Last year: Michael Thompson then the 218th-ranked player in the world let a four-shot lead wilt away on Sunday but held off hard-charging Adam Long to win by two strokes at 19 under par. Thompson sank a 14-foot birdie putt on the final hole to seal the victory and held back tears after accepting the winner's trophy and check which accounted for nearly 12% of his career earnings.

Players to watch

Despite hosting a stateside event days after the British Open and during the Olympic Games in Tokyo the 3M Open pulled together a better field than some might have expected. The 156 players competing include 11 former major champions and 31 players from the British Open field.

Dustin Johnson: The world's No. 1-ranked player is back in Blaine destined for a do-over. Last summer Johnson signed for a first-round 78 and withdrew 30 minutes later citing a back injury. It was a far from memorable tournament debut but perhaps he found a little something along the way? Johnson tied for 12th the next week at the WGC St. Jude Invitational then finished no worse than a tie for second the rest of the season in winning the FedEx Cup playoffs.

Louis Oosthuizen: Mr. Consistency is set to make his 3M Open debut fresh off what has been — surprise! — another spectacular showing in a major. Oostuizen began Sunday with a one-shot lead at Royal St. George's. Winner of the 2010 British Open and five times a runner-up in the other three majors the smooth-swinging South African has made 16 cuts in 17 events on the PGA Tour this season banking nearly $5 million.

Matthew Wolff: He won the 3M Open as a 20-year-old sponsor exemption fresh out of Oklahoma State in 2019. But it's been a roller coaster since. Wolff was runner-up at the U.S. Open in September and posted another second-place finish at the Shriners Open three weeks later. He didn't post a top-25 finish in the next 10 events (including a DQ at the Masters) and took a two-month break to restore his mental health. Wolff withdrew from the British Open before the start of the tournament.

Rickie Fowler: The last time we saw Fowler in Minnesota he was the lone single man without a partner to smooch in a 2016 Ryder Cup celebratory photo that went viral. Fowler is now married but looking for a career rebound eager to find those golfing skills that earned Team USA two points in a dominating victory over Europe at Hazeltine National. Fowler is in the midst of a down season with just one top-10 finish although it came two months ago at the PGA Championship.

Steve Stricker: Speaking of the Ryder Cup the 54-year-old Wisconsin native is set to captain the United States this fall at his home-state Whistling Straits. But first a few more events as a competitor. Stricker has three PGA Tour Champions majors since turning 50 and has remained competitive on the PGA Tour. He has made seven cuts in 10 events this season. At 152nd in the FedEx Cup standings he is in shouting distance of a spot in the playoffs. Stricker has a positive history at TPC Twin Cities; he finished tied for third (18 under) in his lone 3M Championship appearance in 2017.

John Pak: Last year's winner of the college big three (Haskins Award Hogan Award Nicklaus Award) turned in low amateur honors at the U.S. Open in September. He is now a pro and ready to go but Pak has struggled thus far in his PGA Tour career. At the Barbasol Championship on Friday he played the final six holes in 3 over and missed the cut by two. He is one of five college stars with sponsor entries into the 3M Open joining Quade Cummins (Oklahoma) Austin Eckroat (Oklahoma State) Ryan Hall (South Carolina) and Angus Flanagan of the Gophers.

Local connections

Fargo's Tom Hoge a former two-time Minnesota State Amateur champion was the only player with Minnesota ties to make the cut last summer (he finished tied for 46th). He's back along with former Gophers golfer Erik van Rooyen and Spring Lake Park graduate Troy Merritt. They both missed the cut at the British Open and will aim to improve on last summer's disappointments in Blaine.

Sharing the spotlight

Before the top-tier talent of golf tees off for the tournament some players with ahem slightly lesser abilities will show their stuff. There is a three-hole celebrity challenge Wednesday evening featuring eight participants raising money for Minnesota charities. TNT analyst and noted golf aficionado Charles Barkley will team with NFL star Larry Fitzgerald Jr.; Former Twins batting champion Joe Mauer is with Vikings receiver Adam Thielen; Hollywood star Josh Duhamel is with former Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph; and 10-time LPGA major champion Annika Sorenstam is with CBS reporter Amanda Balionis.

Her mother Teresa Hernandez was at the airport to see her daughter off.

She wished she could be in Tokyo to support her daughter from the stands but spectators have been barred because of the city’s COVID-19 state of emergency.

“It’s a little sad and bittersweet that you know she’s heading off without us without her family” Hernandez.

Though her fans can't be there to see her compete in person she has a big team cheering her on at home.

In the weeks leading up to her departure Hernandez was honored with a backyard celebration full of well-wishers and a parade in Southlake Town Square.

Tokyo Olympics-bound diver Hailey Hernandez received a proper sendoff Friday night. The Southlake community showed their support for the local 18-year-old star in the town square with a parade and party.

Hernandez plans to carry that love and support in her heart as she competes for Team USA.

“We’ve always grown up competing with the spectators and people cheering really loudly so it’ll definitely be different"" Hernandez said. ""I’m sad they’re not able to be there but I know they’ll be watching me and supporting me from back home so I’ll remember that as I’m competing.""

The opening ceremony will be held Friday. You can watch the 3m springboard competition live at 2 a.m. on Aug. 1 streaming live and also on USA.

Louganis' head struck the springboard during the preliminary rounds. He was back in the pool soon after receiving five stitches to head. He went on to win the final by a record margin of 25 points to retain the gold he won at Los Angeles 1984.

But does that mean the habit will stick?,"Mask mandates are in place in Victoria and New South Wales as these states continue to see COVID cases in the community. And public health experts have argued face masks will continue to be an important measure in our fight against the virus for some time to come.

Evidence shows masks are effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

However masks won’t always be compulsory particularly outside outbreak situations. In most Australian states and territories at present masks are not mandatory but are recommended in certain settings such as where physical distancing is difficult.

But moving forward — as more people get vaccinated and outbreaks hopefully become fewer and smaller — is mask use likely to stick?

Leaving it up to the public

In recent weeks we’ve seen announcements from the United Kingdom and Singapore that they’re shifting their approach to COVID-19 restrictions moving to a new way of “living with the virus”.

In the UK along with the reopening of all businesses and lifting of attendance caps at events social distancing and mask wearing will become matters of personal responsibility.

Select authorities may still require people to wear masks in certain settings such as in hospitals or on public transport. For example masks will remain compulsory on London’s public transport network.

But from July 19 the national legal requirement to wear a face covering in shops on public transport and in other enclosed spaces will end.

In Singapore and the UK the governments have noted the community’s behaviour will be part of the solution.

Authorities hope that even without mandates people will continue to wear masks in high-risk situations such as crowded and enclosed spaces.

Will discretionary mask use work?

While we know mandates increase mask use substantially the decision to wear a mask is influenced by many factors beyond whether or not there are penalties in place for non-compliance. A person’s age level of income where they live and cultural norms can all play a role.

A review on mask use to prevent respiratory infections conducted before COVID-19 found people are more likely to wear a mask when they feel at increased risk of infection or when they think the outcome of getting sick is severe.

Wearing a mask is also motivated by a shared sense of responsibility and by perceived social norms (those unwritten rules or beliefs we consider acceptable in our community). We often take cues from people we’re close to especially in uncertain times.

Our research found perceived pressure from different avenues including employers mass media government and family can all play a role in increasing mask use.

It’s difficult to know whether as countries move away from mandates and leave it up to individuals we’re likely to see ongoing mask use in the community.

But it’s worth looking to the Asian experience. Some Asian countries have a longer history of wearing masks both for protection against pollution and for protection against infection especially since SARS in 2003.

In Hong Kong after the outbreak the proportion of people who reported wearing a mask when experiencing flu-like symptoms declined sharply from 74% in June 2003 to 39% in September 2003. But self-reported health-related behaviours including mask use were still much greater in the period after SARS compared to before it.

Researchers tracking these trends noted that in the face of SARS people in Hong Kong came to accept mask use as part of their “civic responsibility”.

One study looking at photographs of settings such as grocery stores and markets in six different countries in early 2020 mapped huge variations in mask use. This ranged from a high of 97% in Phnom Penh Cambodia (in Asia) through to 4% in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

In some of these countries the level of mask use may have been influenced by government recommendations or mandates in place at the time.

Luis Ascui/AAP

There is an element of doubt as to whether masks will continue to be used in countries with more individualist cultures such as the US and Australia (“I often do my own thing”) as opposed to collectivist cultures like those found more often in Asia (“My happiness depends very much on the happiness of those around me”).

Vaccination status could also affect mask use in the community. People who are vaccinated against COVID-19 — as a high proportion are in countries like the UK and Singapore — may be less inclined to wear a mask compared to those who are unvaccinated.

The new normal?

If we’re trying to shift the social norm around masks and encourage their ongoing use (without mandates) it’s important we evolve our messaging. This includes relevant reminders around times when masks would be most beneficial such as:

encouraging people to put a mask on straight away if they’re out in public and start to feel unwell

encouraging mask use in higher-risk locations such as on public transport and especially when visiting people in aged care and hospitals.

Continuing to frame the use of masks as a social behaviour is critical. We don’t send our kids to school with peanut butter sandwiches in case there’s someone with an allergy. Likewise wearing a mask is a simple action we can take to protect those who may be vulnerable.

Diving is one of the most popular water sports at the Olympics. It is an art that the divers must perfect in order to win big at international events. The USA has always been a powerhouse in diving and here are the female divers who will represent the nation at the Tokyo Olympics 2020.

Diving first made its Olympic debut in 1904 and has come a long way since. The Americans stand tall as the most decorated nation but China has been picking up the pace quite tremendously over the years.

Abbott Talks Border Security In Texas With Florida Gov. DeSantis Law Enforcement,"Note: Watch the entire news conference in the video player above.

DEL RIO Texas (CBSDFW.COM) - Gov. Greg Abbott was joined by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and law enforcement officials for a briefing on southern border security in Texas on Saturday.

The news conference was held in the border city of Del Rio where an update was given on the state's efforts to address an influx of migrants illegally crossing into the U.S.

Other speakers included Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw and National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd.

Abbott spoke about how Florida and other states have responded to the governor's call for law enforcement assistance at the border.

""This is a situation where all states need to be in the process of stepping up because the best place to interdict this criminal activity is not in Florida is not in Iowa but is right here on the border. This is where the people come across this is where we can make the biggest impact by having the resources on the border right now"" Abbott said.

DeSantis thanked Abbott for addressing the border issue as the Texas governor placed blame on the Biden administration for the increase in migrant crossings.

""We appreciate you stepping up where the federal government won't. We understand how important this to not just Texas but to other states and we are absolutely going to see impacts in Florida and in other states if we don't turn the tide on this so thank you"" DeSantis said.

Last month Abbott announced the state would be building its own southern border wall through donations from residents.

""The crisis at our southern border isn't just a Texas issue; it's a national security threat"" Abbott said. ""The Biden administration's open border policies have brought on an unprecedented surge of illegal migrants drugs weapons and other contraband coming into our country.

The briefing took place in Del Rio a city about 160 miles west of San Antonio along the border with Mexico.

""What's happening here at the border may be happening here today but it may be happening in these other states tomorrow next week or next month"" Abbott said.

The meeting between the two Republican governors follows a June letter from Abbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) in which they issued a call for help from fellow governors under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact.

The letter requested ""additional manpower"" to help apprehend people attempting to illegally cross the border into the United States. DeSantis deployed law enforcement officers to the border in response.

""We appreciate you stepping up where the federal government won't and we understand how important this is to not just Texas but other states"" DeSantis said.

Abbott who in June announced plans to build a wall along the state's border with Mexico has repeatedly criticized Democrat President Joe Biden's administration's handling of the border and immigration.

Abbott and Ducey's letter said the administration has ""proven unwilling or unable to do the job"" of securing the border.

According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection numbers released Friday the agency recorded 188829 encounters on the Mexican border in June the most since March 2000 and an increase of about 5% over May.

The majority of encounters were single adults though encounters of unaccompanied children increased by 8% to 15253 in June well below the high of 18663 unaccompanied children encountered in March by the Border Patrol.

The number of children in CBP custody fell to 832 on June 30 from 5767 at its peak on March 29.

The number of migrant families encountered at the border increased by 25% from the previous month to 55805 even as summer temperatures rise in the deserts and mountain terrain of the southwestern borderlands. The figure is below the high of 88587 in May 2019.

Of the June encounters 34% were people who had at least one prior encounter in the last 12 months up from about 14% for 2014 to 2019 fiscal years according to CBP.

Pandemic-related powers that the government uses to rapidly expel most migrants from the country without allowing them to seek asylum has led to a larger-than-average number of migrants trying to cross multiple times which means the numbers ""somewhat overstate"" how many are arriving at the border Customs and Border Protection said in the monthly report.

Being expelled carries no legal consequences so many people try to cross multiple times.

Drug seizures were down 30% overall in June from the previous month however interceptions of some drugs including cocaine and fentanyl increased 30% and 12% respectively.

Abbott has highlighted the flow of drugs specifically fentanyl across the border into the U.S. as a reason to bolster law enforcement efforts.

CBP said it has seen a surge in fentanyl seizures which are 78% higher for the 2021 fiscal year through June over the 2020 fiscal year.

Both governors say the blame falls on the Biden administration for the number of migrants crossing the border emphasizing that they believe the previous administration's stance on immigration was more effective.

""Your success is really America's success. We need this to work. Obviously we'd like to see the old policies of the previous administration simply put back in"" said DeSantis.

Governor Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are meeting with state and local officials as well as law enforcement in Del Rio.

""Those policies were abandoned by the Biden administration and in their place the Biden administration has imposed open border policies that has led to this incredible influx of people who have come across the border"" added Abbott.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd Adjutant General of Texas Tracy Norris National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) President Brandon Judd and Val Verde County Sheriff Joe Frank Martinez were also in attendance.

At the briefing Governor Abbott provided an update on the state's efforts to combat the vast influx in the smuggling of drugs weapons and other contraband into the state. He also thanked Governor DeSantis for answering the call to the Emergency Management Assistance Compact by deploying law enforcement officers from Florida to assist in border security efforts in the State of Texas.

Governor Abbott began by saying that all states need to ""step up"" because in Texas alone in this fiscal year we've set a new all time record of undocumented immigrants who have been apprehended. ""With each passing day that record is going to do nothing but increase"" said Abbott.

The governor said this is due to President Biden and his ""open border policies"" leading to the ""incredible influx"" of people coming across the border. He made it clear he wants to arrest and jail those who illegally cross the border.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said many people who are illegally crossing the border in Texas are on their way to Florida.

""The crisis at our southern border isn't just a Texas issue; it's a national security threat"" said Governor Abbott. ""The Biden administration's open border policies have brought on an unprecedented surge of illegal migrants drugs weapons and other contraband coming into our country. Our continued efforts to secure the border are made stronger by the support of states like Florida through our Emergency Management Assistance Compact and I thank Governor DeSantis and the law enforcement officers from Florida for stepping up to support the Lone Star State.""



Abbott also mentioned a ""reality"" that people need to come to grips with -- ""almost everyone who comes across the border is going to have a price extracted from them."" He said this involves sex crimes and is a ""horrific dangerous journey."" He said the Biden Administration is blind to how some children ""even lose their lives.""

Gov. Abbott went on to say ""One thing that everybody in Texas understands...if we are going to be able as a state to respond even more aggressively one thing we need is additional funding"" mentioning funding for Val Verde County and local counties so they can respond to the ""record breaking challenge.""

Abbott closed the press conference comparing the situation at the border to a trauma; ""Stabilize the trauma and you worry about the bills later.""

Gov. DeSantis' visit comes after Gov. Abbot declared that the State of Texas will invoke the Emergency Management Assistance Compact which officially asks other states to send law enforcement to help make arrests.

In response Governor DeSantis deployed Florida law enforcement to the Texas border to assist in border security efforts.

Both Governor Abbott and Governor DeSantis were joined by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody Florida Senate President Wilton Simpson Texas Chair of House Appropriations Greg Bonnen Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd Adjutant General of Texas Tracy Norris National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd Val Verde County Sheriff Joe Frank Martinez and Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe.

The company is continuously growing to meet its sponsor’s needs — including Johnson & Johnson GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Sanofi and AbbVie.

Prospective Research Innovations Inc is a multi-therapeutic facility conducting clinical trials to advance medicine and give patients a better quality of life.

They have an incredible team of expert physicians and investigators with over 20 years of experience. Some of their current trials are for patients who are diagnosed with depression bipolar disorder knee pain asthma ulcer colitis diabetes and schizophrenia.

When asked why medical research is important Barnett stated “There are many benefits the most important is to find solutions to adverse effects of many existing and new medications. It is incredibly vital to make sure new medications are safe before releasing them to billions of people. Medical research is also needed to improve medical devices for patients. Everyone benefits from it!”

He added:“Our sponsors depend on us to conduct studies with patient safety being the top priority. There is direct communication with our investigators and sponsors to provide study status and protocol compliance. Behind every discovery of a new medicine and treatment are thousands of people who were involved in the medical research.”

He said that many medications and treatments that we now take for granted are the result of medical studies that have been done in the past.

Prospective Research Innovations Inc is located in Rancho Cucamonga California. Barnett and his hard-working team including his fiancée and Executive Brand Director Elvira Guzman will develop nine additional medical research facilities in California within the next five years and then they will expand globally.

Barnett attributes his success to fulfilling a need within the medical research community a facility with staff members that resemble the patients so they feel at ease while at the facility.

“Many times talking about our illnesses can be difficult but if you’re speaking to someone who looks like they can be related to you it makes it a bit easier” he said.

Originally from Kingston Barnett relocated to California when he was 19 years old to reunite with his father. Since then instead of going to college and then working to build someone else’s empire he decided to start building his own empire just like his father.

Through faith in God and hard work he is now the founder and chief executive officer of the fastest-growing medical research company in the US — and one of the few black entrepreneurs to head a successful company in this field.

ACN,Accenture,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBlYWttYWdhemluZS5jb20uc2cvZ291cm1ldC10cmF2ZWwvY292aWQtMTktZGF0YS1hbmFseXRpY3MtaG9zcGl0YWxpdHktbWlrZS10YW5zZXktYWNjZW50dXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Covid-19 has levelled the hospitality playing field according to Accenture's Mike Tansey,"While the pandemic has ravaged the global hospitality industry it has also presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for smaller players to wrestle market share from the big boys. This is the conviction of Mike Tansey managing director for travel and growth markets in Accenture a Fortune Global 500 professional services company.

With two decades of management consulting experience including 15 years specialising in the travel industry Singapore-based Tansey has his finger on the pulse. He leads Accenture’s travel industry team across multiple markets and has worked with organisations such as Singapore Airlines InterContinental Hotels Group Cathay Pacific Marriott International and Qantas. So Tansey understands the challenges companies face in transforming online and offline customer experiences.

“What Covid-19 has done is reset everybody’s market share effectively to zero. Before the smaller independent chains might have found it hard to compete against the big guys. Now suddenly all of us are back at the starting line. We’re talking to several hotel clients on how they can take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grab market share because loads of people will want to travel.”

(Related: What will hospitality and design look like after the pandemic? Florian Sander has answers)

The traditional approach is to spend millions on mass media campaigns. However brands now recognise that this is ineffective and unaffordable says Tansey and are trying different approaches. He gives the example of Banyan Tree. With the hotel group Tansey helps them to identify unique guest behaviour and profiles filtered by property and source markets.

This approach is not new but it was not popular until the pandemic. Tansey cites another example: Thai Smile Airways. The airline appointed Accenture before Covid as it wanted to tap on its data analytics expertise. It worked. Despite the pandemic the company gained domestic market share rising from 9.23 per cent in 2019 to 11.5 per cent in 2020.

He says: “It’s difficult for people to understand that the critical difference is the really detailed data analytics that goes behind it. Most people would think that 10 or even 30 data fields are sufficient.” Accenture captures data in 170 fields.

“For example we create a customer analytic record for every person who has stayed in a particular hotel for the last five years. We apply trend analysis against the data collected to identify specific behaviours of those guests. Then we use that information to create digital marketing campaigns most of which is done through social media such as Facebook where the content you see changes dynamically (depending on your profile). This precise targeting is what will drive an ‘unfair’ share of the market.”

(Related: How an airline amenities agency can thrive during a global pandemic)

Another gap that hospitality players need to plug is customer service infrastructure. It needs to be robust enough to handle the massive volume of upcoming itinerary changes.

Tansey recalls being frustrated recently at being put on hold for two hours before he could speak to a representative of “a major airline” on refunding a cancelled ticket.

“Online travel agents found it particularly difficult at the beginning of Covid-19 because they set up the business model to be from light to no touch. If I suddenly need to cancel my flights and everyone’s doing the same they just don’t have the infrastructure to cope with that volume of calls. That’s going to continue because there’s still going to be volatility in the travel business in the next year Tansey warns.

“We can solve a lot of these digitally. But the problem is that the businesses particularly the smaller ones don’t have the money to do it. However as revenues pick up they will invest in those types of technologies to future-proof themselves.”

In the meantime staying ready for change and being constantly aware of what’s happening around the world is vital. Tansey says: “We will not go from where we are now to everything being back to normal. There’s going to be a period of transition. We need to remain adaptable and adjust quickly to changes both in this region and our source markets.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNpdHl3b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tL3Bvc3QucGhwP3N0b3J5PTIwMjEwNzE3MTMzNzExNTQ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20% of year 2&3 students have no 'real friends' at university,"UNITED KINGDOM 20% of year 2&3 students have no ‘real friends’ at university Tweet



The finding has renewed fears that students are struggling with loneliness and declining mental health.



Some 42% of students have experienced suicidal thoughts at some time the survey reveals. Of these 24% – amounting to more than one in 10 of all students – say that their thoughts turned to suicide for the first time during university; and 16% say that they have had the urge to hurt or harm themselves in the past 12 months.



The survey carried out by student market research consultancy Cibyl for Accenture during the COVID-19 pandemic found that as social restrictions and other impacts of the pandemic continue more than half – 55% – of students say they feel lonely every day or every week and 45% say they have been avoiding socialising in person or online with others.



The isolation currently felt by students appears to be contributing significantly towards declining mental health the Accenture report says.



Four in 10 students – 39% – report a deterioration in their mental health since starting university and more than half – 53% – have experienced at least seven symptoms of poor mental health over the past year.



Dasha Karzunina head of research at Cibyl said: “It is clear that feeling connected and supported has a significant impact on students’ mental well-being.”



Different experiences of mental health



The



Students from lower socio-economic backgrounds show higher rates of having suicidal thoughts (47%). Some 67% of LGBQ and 81% of transgender students will have had such thoughts at some point in their lives the report said.



Ben West a recent graduate said: “No student should have to pay for a degree with their life. This report shines a vital light on the areas which universities must improve to better support all students many of whom have spent the last year feeling forgotten and ignored.



“I really hope universities and government take on board the findings and recommendations in this report and act to better the industry to help those people whose lives depend on this change.”



The survey was conducted online between October 2020 and December 2020 and was completed by 12014 students from 140 universities.



Barbara Harvey managing director and mental health sponsor at Accenture UK said: “University is a formative part of so many young people’s lives and can be a great leveller when it comes to the career opportunities open to students from all backgrounds.



“However our research reveals that despite the resources and support services universities provide university is not a dream experience for everyone and there’s a significant disconnect between the experiences of different students.”



Karzunina said: “Universities are well positioned to create a healthier culture and improve their students’ resilience. We hope that the findings and recommendations of this report inspire action from both universities and employers to better understand educate and support their students and graduates and to continue conversations about mental health to tackle stigma head on.”



Pandemics preparedness and pressure



Unsurprisingly the report says COVID-19 has played a significant role in eroding students’ well-being with 80% saying that it has contributed to their poor mental health. However the poor state of student mental health preceded the pandemic; only 13% of students attribute their mental health challenges fully to COVID-19.



Preparation for the university experience is a sticking point when it comes to mental health. Only one in 10 students claim they felt completely prepared for the reality of university life with those feeling less prepared more likely to report mental health challenges (44% versus 32%). Perhaps most significantly they were 1.6 times more likely to see their mental health decline since starting university (54% vs 33%).



Worryingly Harvey noted in the foreword to the report that half the students “didn't feel their mental health was supported at university and many are reluctant or unable to access the care they need”.



Making mental health matter



In reality most universities offer – either directly through the National Health Service or through other organisations – a range of support from general (general practitioner-led) health centres to dedicated mental wellness centres and crisis services such as the telephone service Nightline that are run by the students themselves.



The report says universities are well aware of the need to provide mental health support and virtually all of them do. But the research reveals that most students are not using the services on offer with 60% of respondents who have a mental health challenge stating they do not access any support provided.



When asked why they do not seek mental health support at university four in 10 (42%) said it was simply a case of not knowing what to say or how to express their feelings.



The data showed this uncertainty to be particularly high among overseas African Caribbean students – among this group 34% aren’t sure how to describe their mental health.



Also it was not just mental health services that students were not opening up to. Although most talk to family or friends only 11% talk to university support staff and 9% to academic staff. Significantly 17% talk to no-one which rises to 32% of men and 20% of ethnic minority students.



Most effective services



The report says mentors and buddies top the list when it comes to the effectiveness of service (80% of users rate them as effective) outperforming more traditional (and more popular) services such as GPs (61% effectiveness) and well-being support services (63% effectiveness).



Mental health advisers and stress management workshops were rated as second and third most effective services (72% and 71% effectiveness respectively).



Students who saw their university as one that supported good mental health in general (as well as during the pandemic) and who knew how to access help were nearly three times less likely to say their mental health had declined since starting there the report says.



It says the introduction of a charter for mental health among universities has been an important first step. And the development of an impartial standard against which universities could be assessed and held accountable “would do much to make the efficacy of mental health services and the culture of these institutions more transparent and ultimately a better fit for purpose”.



Framework for action on mental health



The report stresses that the experience and voice of the student “should be at the heart of every action”.



To address the findings of the research Accenture has proposed a framework for universities to help address student mental health and well-being:



• Know: Understand the mental health risk profile of your students even before they start and proactively target interventions.



• Support: Provide the right level of support making it easy and a natural act to access it. Offer multiple channels to allow students to choose an approach that’s right for them.



• Teach: Educate students on what good mental health is how to maintain it the value of seeking help early and how to support themselves and others.



• Connect: Help students to adapt to university life forge meaningful friendships and reduce loneliness: there is a strong correlation between feeling connected and well-being.



• Culture: University chancellors should adopt the principles enshrined in the Hippocratic Oath – “Do no harm” and “Prevention is better than cure”.



Harvey said: “With almost half of young people in the UK now going into higher education and this year’s cohort doing so after 18 months of disrupted learning and social lives universities must enhance both the technology-based and human mental health support on offer for those that need it.” One in every five students in years two and three in the United Kingdom say they don’t have a ‘real friend’ at university according to a survey of more than 12000 students nationally.The finding has renewed fears that students are struggling with loneliness and declining mental health.Some 42% of students have experienced suicidal thoughts at some time the survey reveals. Of these 24% – amounting to more than one in 10 of all students – say that their thoughts turned to suicide for the first time during university; and 16% say that they have had the urge to hurt or harm themselves in the past 12 months.The survey carried out by student market research consultancy Cibyl for Accenture during the COVID-19 pandemic found that as social restrictions and other impacts of the pandemic continue more than half – 55% – of students say they feel lonely every day or every week and 45% say they have been avoiding socialising in person or online with others.The isolation currently felt by students appears to be contributing significantly towards declining mental health the Accenture report says.Four in 10 students – 39% – report a deterioration in their mental health since starting university and more than half – 53% – have experienced at least seven symptoms of poor mental health over the past year.Dasha Karzunina head of research at Cibyl said: “It is clear that feeling connected and supported has a significant impact on students’ mental well-being.”The report of the survey also reveals that students from different backgrounds have different experiences when it comes to mental health. Those with longer term or more serious mental health issues are much more likely to have their mental health decline further at university (58%) followed by neurodiverse students (49%) those with disabilities (45%) women (43%) and LGBTQ students (42%).Students from lower socio-economic backgrounds show higher rates of having suicidal thoughts (47%). Some 67% of LGBQ and 81% of transgender students will have had such thoughts at some point in their lives the report said.Ben West a recent graduate said: “No student should have to pay for a degree with their life.

“We will help these companies move on to the next stage on the way to becoming larger and more significant” said JVP and Margalit Startup City founder Erel Margalit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcG9ldHNhbmRxdWFudHMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTgvdG9wLW1iYS1lbXBsb3llcnMtYXQtMjQtbGVhZGluZy11LXMtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc2Nob29scy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top MBA Employers At 24 Leading U.S. Business Schools,"Who really hires the most MBAs at the leading business schools in the U.S.? Sure you know McKinsey Bain and BCG are there and so is Amazon and Google. But who else? And what percentage of the graduating class at top MBA programs are actually hired by these firms?

In a rare and exclusive look at elite MBA employment we present the top ten employers of MBA graduates at 24 of the leading business schools over the past three years. Only a few business schools disclose a ranked listing of top employers and when they do the schools limit those lists to a single graduating class. Now for the first time an extensive analysis of MBA recruits by Menlo Coaching the premium MBA admissions consulting firm has pulled the curtain back on exactly which firms are hiring in a big way from these schools. Menlo Coaching’s research team analyzed 51991 student profiles on LinkedIn to get to the bottom of it. To access the full report on all 24 schools from Menlo Coaching you can click here.

This latest analysis follows the look at top employers of Harvard Stanford and Wharton MBAs (see Who Really Hires Harvard Stanford & Wharton MBAs These Days) a report on where McKinsey Bain & BCG hire the most MBAs and a look at the MBA hires by Goldman Sachs JPMorganChase & Morgan Stanley.

THE MOST FREQUENT TOP FIVE EMPLOYER ACROSS 24 SCHOOLS? AMAZON

The data reveals some big surprises. For one thing notes David White a founding partner of Menlo Coaching the top employers are not the same as the top feeders.”In unpublished research we identified Deloitte as the #1 largest feeder company to the 24 U.S. MBA programs we analyzed sending around twice as many students as the runner up BCG” he says. “However Deloitte is only the fifth largest post-MBA recruiter across these same 24 programs.”

So which company is the most frequent Top Five employer? Amazon. “It made the list of the top five employers at every M7 school.” says White. “In total it was a top five employer at 22 of the 24 MBA programs we examined. Beyond Amazon Google was the other big tech company to appear frequently in the top five employer lists.”

Not surprisingly perhaps some schools are local favorites of companies. “Although the top five employers at most MBA programs are national recruiters who appear in the lists for many different MBA programs there are a few major employers with a regional recruiting footprint” explains White. “For example Dell was a top five employer at UT Austin McCombs and UNC Kenan-Flagler but not at other MBA programs and Microsoft was a top five recruiter only at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business.”

GEOGRAPHY MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME MBA EMPLOYERS

For prospective MBA students the real takeaway might well be this: ""Graduates can join McKinsey Bain or BCG even if they are not at a top-ranked school"" adds White. ""We examined 14 MBA programs outside of (M7 + Haas Tuck Yale). In those 14 programs all but two include one of McKinsey Bain and BCG as one of their Top 10 employers. For example UCLA Anderson and NYU Stern both have all three firms among their top 10 employers.""

Once you expand to looking at the top 10 employers instead of the top five Facebook pops up frequently as another tech recruiter alongside Amazon and Google. In Menlo Coaching's top 10 employers report you can see a larger number of employers who recruit disproportionately at MBA programs near their headquarters with pairs like USC Marshall and Amgen Emory Goizueta and UPS Rice Jones and ExxonMobil and Chevron) as well as Washington Foster and Starbucks.

The company taking the largest percentage of MBAs out of any one school among the top 24 is the Boston Consulting Group at Kellogg: BCG has hired 11.5% of Kellogg graduates in the past three years. The only other double-digit employer from a single school is Amazon which has hired 10.3% of the MBA grads out of Washington Foster in three years.

AT STANFORD GOOGLE TIES BCG AS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR EMPLOYER

Overall at the 24 leading schools McKinsey and BCG are the #1 and #2 employers respectively. Bain follows in fourth place. Amazon ranks #3 at 4.1% and represents the only non-consulting firm in the top five (see table below). ""The high placement rate at Amazon reflects its position as a highly desirable company for MBAs targeting tech"" says White. ""It also reflects Amazon's own interest in hiring MBA graduates especially outside the M7: Amazon is the top employer for UNC Kenan-Flagler UCLA Anderson Texas McCombs Michigan Ross UW Foster NYU Stern and Duke Fuqua (tied).""

Only one financial services company makes the top ten: JPMorgan Chase employing just under 1% of the graduates in tenth place.

McKinsey Bain and BCG maintain their attraction for MBA graduates from M7 programs. Indeed for all M7 programs MBB ranks at the top (though Google ties BCG at Stanford's #3 according to Menlo's analysis. ""In addition to the clear relationship between M7 attendance and placement at an MBB firm listings for programs outside the M7 reveal strong placement rates at the Big Four strategy consulting firms or Deloitte PwC KPMG and EY-Parthenon"" adds White. ""Placements at Deloitte and EY-Parthenon are especially high across the board.""

Americans seem eager to travel for fun but not for work: Business travel demand right now is about 40% of what it was in the summer of 2019 United CEO Scott Kirby said in a recent CBS Face The Nation interview.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

That's a problem. In normal times business travelers occupy about 12% to 15% of the seats on the big conventional airlines that offer multi-class seating aim at higher fare-paying business travelers and have higher operating costs than the budget players. But that same group of travelers generates about 45% of conventional carriers' revenues.

So airlines — and their travel industry compatriots in the hotel and restaurants segments — remain in a deep financial hole. And nobody's quite sure when if ever business travel will fully rebound.

Kirby said he doesn't see a full recovery before next summer. In a June interview with Fox Business Delta CEO Ed Bastian predicted the sector will return to pre-pandemic levels this fall. Hyatt Hotels CEO Mark Hoplamazian whose business also relies on business travel proposed a similar timeline. ""We are already seeing the signs of people starting to travel for work"" he said at CNBC's Evolve Global Summit in June. ""I think that will really take hold in a more affirmative way in the fall.""

But predictions from the Global Business Travel Association make even Kirby's outlook seem rosy. In a May poll by the trade group 92% of companies surveyed said they had paused most or all of their international travel. Two-thirds stopped domestic trips too. The association said that a recent modest bump in business travel is a good sign but that it doesn't forecast a full return to 2019 levels until 2025.

""The lack of business travel and lingering consumer hesitation are prolonging the road to recovery"" Adobe Analytics which tracks domestic flight bookings said in a June report.

But along with how long that recovery will take comes another question: What might it look like?

Bruce Rosenberg president of travel company HotelPlanner said it's likely that business travel demand growth will take off in September. But the reasons motivating that new business travel will be different in some regards.

""People will travel in order to get back to where they think they need to be"" in terms of generating sales better meeting their clients' expectations or overseeing critical aspects of their companies' far-flung operations he said. ""But the touchy-feely things? No.""

Companies are much less likely to spend money on team building confabs employee reward events and other types of ""soft"" travel that don't directly generate revenue. Trade shows are likely to start up again this fall but Rosenberg expects most will be scaled-back affairs with maybe half as many attendees as in pre-pandemic times even as such shows' floor space requirements will double to accommodate social distancing best practices and any local requirements still being enforced.

""I think budgets are an issue. For a big sale or big client meeting corporations will find the money for that kind of travel but not the other stuff"" he said. However over the next couple of years of corporate budgeting travel for less essential business purposes will gradually make its way back into corporate budgets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBzeWNob2xvZ3l0b2RheS5jb20vaWUvYmxvZy9lbmQtaHVtYW4tdHJhZmZpY2tpbmcvMjAyMTA3L3ZpZXdlcnMtY2hpbGQtcG9ybm9ncmFwaHktYXJlLXRoZXktbWVuYWNl0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHN5Y2hvbG9neXRvZGF5LmNvbS9pZS9ibG9nL2VuZC1odW1hbi10cmFmZmlja2luZy8yMDIxMDcvdmlld2Vycy1jaGlsZC1wb3Jub2dyYXBoeS1hcmUtdGhleS1tZW5hY2U_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some viewers of child pornography are likely to harm children. Others aren't.,"Crimes against children have changed in the digital age. Doctors Richard B. Krueger and Meg Kaplan Columbia University psychiatrists specializing in sexual behavior believe that the legal system hasn’t kept up.

In the past a victimizer engaging in predatory sexual abuse had physical contact with the young person. Today people who will never touch a particular child are nevertheless part of a system that can result in that child’s pain degradation and even death.

What People Agree on—and What They Don’t

Everyone can agree that child pornography is not a victimless crime. The child who’s being videoed having sex or masturbating or being tortured is real.

The individuals responsible for causing this kind of suffering are unambiguously criminal and need to be put away. There’s no controversy about this.

Where it gets complex is what about the viewers?

Should they be locked up because they’re enabling an industry that causes almost unthinkable pain and degradation?

 Is it justifiable to lock the viewers up both as a deterrent to others and as a means of chipping away at the demand for child pornography?

 Even if an individual viewer hasn’t touched a child is he on the path to developing into a full-blown child molester?

Different countries and different researchers have different answers. In some countries viewing pornography is a death-penalty offense. In others such as Great Britain viewers get a warning.

Kaplan says that during a visit to colleagues in Scandinavia “When they learned that we incarcerate people for five or ten years even when they’ve never touched a child the Scandinavians look on us as if we’re from outer space.”

An Evidence-Based Response

“Our number one goal” emphasizes Kaplan “is protecting children. However the evidence shows that some of our approaches are making things worse.”

Krueger adds “We have 30 years of actuarial instruments with a high degree of predictability for understanding which individual is likely to abuse a child in the future.”

Here are two sample cases of individuals with vastly different likelihoods of harming a child in the future: outcomes:

An individual caught viewing child pornography is 65 years old and never had any prior offenses. He is at very low risk for child molestation.

An individual caught viewing child pornography is 25 years old and has been convicted of several prior sex offenses as well as non-sexual violence. That person is vastly more likely to harm a child.

Krueger and Kaplan use the Child Pornography Offender Risk Tool (CPORT) fo make this distinction. It was developed to assess the risk of sexual re-offense of individuals convicted of charges involving child pornography:

Both Krueger and Kaplan wish that legislators would distinguish between those who are unlikely to harm a child in the future and those who are. Society now has the proven tools to do it.

Why Not Put Both People in Jail?

Putting that low-risk person in jail means that when he gets out the stigma will make it difficult for him to get a job or find a place to live. On top of this the notification laws that tell people that he’s a sexual predator are going to make it hard for him to function in society.

The person who can’t find work or a place to live may become a danger to society. For a low-risk individual to be put in this situation is both unnecessary and counterproductive.

A Final Thought

Krueger and Kaplan know that some consumers of pornography pose an imminent risk to children. Others pose very little risk. Tools exist to distinguish between them and society needs to treat them differently.

Conflating the two groups can mean making the dangers worse by driving people who are not a danger to society into becoming a danger.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR0bmV4dC5pbi90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvMDcvMTcvaG93LWVtb2ppcy1jYW4taGVscC1jcmVhdGUtYS1tb3JlLWVtcGF0aGV0aWMtd29ybGTSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kdG5leHQuaW4vYW1wL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMS8wNy8xNy9ob3ctZW1vamlzLWNhbi1oZWxwLWNyZWF0ZS1hLW1vcmUtZW1wYXRoZXRpYy13b3JsZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How emojis can help create a more empathetic world,"San Francisco

The tiny emojis being shared on billions of devices worldwide can play a major role in digital communication with most people saying that emoji compels them to feel more empathy towards others according to an Adobe report.

Adobe's global emoji study found that emoji even helps people overcome language barriers and form connections that would otherwise be difficult to do.

""We were surprised and delighted by the discoveries made in the survey most notably how enthusiastic respondents were for emoji as a means to express themselves"" the company said in a statement.

Emoji sometimes get criticised for being overly saccharine but this sweetness is key when it comes to diffusing some of the heaviness of online communication.

""Many of the emoji are focused on positive emotions so it's easy to insert them into our conversations and lighten the mood"" the Adobe study said.

It's not surprising that over half of those surveyed feel more comfortable using emoji than talking on the phone or in-person.

This applies to less intense situations too. Dating for example can be tricky — especially when it's online or via digital apps as it often is now.

The study also found that emoji even helps people overcome language barriers and form connections that would otherwise be difficult to do.

These processors were discovered within the USB-IF database and include three new SKUs that are part of the Ryzen/Athlon 4000 family aiming at the desktop platform (via Komachi).

AMD Ryzen & Athlon Entry-Level Desktop CPUs Spotted Powered By Zen 2 Core Architecture

As per the listing there are three new Zen 2 Desktop SKUs mentioned the AMD Ryzen 5 4500 the Ryzen 3 4100 and the Athlon Gold 4100GE. Based on their naming convention we can decipher a few specifications but what's important is that these are still part of the older 4000 series lineup & that has entirely been replaced by 5000 series SKUs. There are currently no entry-level Zen 3 SKUs in the 5000 lineups so these chips may act as a refresh for the Zen 2 based 3000 SKUs and offer a small spec bump.

Starting with the AMD Ryzen 5 4500 the chip would replace the Ryzen 5 3500 and offer 6 cores 6 threads and up to 19 MB of cache. The existing Ryzen 5 3500 clocks at 3.6 GHz base and 4.10 GHz boost so you can definitely expect the Ryzen 5 4500 to offer higher clocks than that. The chip will retain a 65W TDP design. The Ryzen 3 4100 will be the replacement to the Ryzen 3 3100 & offer 4 cores and 8 threads along with 18 MB of cache. The Ryzen 3 3100 offers clock speeds of 3.60 GHz base and 3.90 GHz boost so expect the 4100 SKU to feature higher clocks than that. The TDP will also be set at 65W.

The AMD Athlon Gold 4100GE will be the spiritual successor to the Athlon Gold 3150GE and come with 4 cores 4 threads and 6 MB of cache. The chip being a 'GE' variant will support a Vega (3 CU) integrated GPU and clocks of up to 4.0 GHz. The 'GE' variant will also feature a TDP of 35W so we can expect higher clocks on the non-GE SKU.

Now there's no word on the pricing of either part. The AMD Ryzen 5 4500 and the Ryzen 3 4100 should hit retail pricing of sub-$150 US while the Athlon Gold should hit retail pricing of sub-$100 US but the more important question is if these chips are going to enter the retail segment at all. It looks like this Zen 2 refresh is aimed at the OEM segment rather than the DIY market but we have seen certain OEM-only chips being sold in the DIY segment by certain Asian Pacific retailers so let's wait and see when these chips actually become available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vbmNlLWdhbWVycy1kaXNjb3JkLXZ5aW5nLWNoYXQtMDgwMTU3NTgxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Once a go-to for gamers Discord is vying to be a chat app for all,"discord

Picture a combination of Slack AOL Instant Messenger Zoom and a sketchy chat room and you have something approximating Discord. It’s essentially an all-purpose chat app built around closed communities—called “servers”—that speak to different interests.

After launching in 2015 Discord caught on first with gamers who use it to discuss games and watch each other play. “[A server] can be a safe place” says Discord CTO and co-founder Stanislav Vishnevskiy “for a small group of people you know a larger community of like-minded people and everything in between.”

What is the Discord app used for?

The Discord of today has more than 150 million monthly active users and 19 million active servers each week. Vishnevskiy says the small servers are where people “develop true connections and belonging”—90% of Discord’s private servers have fewer than 15 people. But topics now vary widely as the company starts to draw (and court) communities of all stripes. To get a sense of the increasing breadth here are a few of the servers I can’t live without:

A gaming community. Just the one though: Breath of the Wild is for discussing the eponymous (and G.O.A.T.) Zelda game from 2017.

An open-source data group. Project Owl users chat about geopolitics and current events.

A fan community for Brit pop-rockers. The 1975 is mainly for music convos and listening parties.

An independent journalists’ co-op. Sidechannel is a group of Substack writers including Casey Newton and Charlie Warzel who host a server for their collective subscribers.

A meme stock community. Stock chatter like you’ll find on Discord’s WallStreetBets has helped retail investors become a powerful force in financial markets.

Here’s a look at the Discord desktop experience for a user participating in multiple servers:

A screenshot of Discord as experienced on a desktop computer.

How does Discord make money?

With its growing scale a platform might try to drive revenue through advertising. But Discord has so far refused. “We have intentionally pursued a business model that does not rely on monetizing our users’ data” Vishnevskiy says. While there are opportunities for some brands to engage with loyal customers—Chipotle held a virtual job fair on the app and fashion retailer All Saints held a fan Q&A on Discord’s Clubhouse-like audio feature—the most successful ones seem to treat their servers like a fan club.

Discord’s primary revenue stream is Discord Nitro a $99-per-year subscription service that gives users access to perks like customizable emoji personalized profiles better upload speeds streaming capabilities hi-res video and “server boosts” to improve their servers. Discord declined to share how many Nitro subscribers it has but the Wall Street Journal reported that Discord generated $130 million in revenue last year up from $45 million in 2019. In the same time period its monthly user base doubled.

Of course growing up—or going public—could come with a new set of expectations. When it first launched Discord became a haven for white nationalists and it was used to help organize 2017’s deadly Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville Va. Since then the company has had built a trust and safety team from scratch; as of last year it constituted about 15% of Discord’s staff. Discord also started a curriculum for volunteer moderators to better self-police servers and in the second half of 2020 it reportedly booted 2000 extremist communities.

Next up: reaching profitability.

Bloomberg





Intel Corp is exploring a deal to acquire semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries Inc the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.

Closely held GlobalFoundries controlled by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Co could be valued at about US$30 billion the report said.

The deal is not guaranteed and GlobalFoundries might continue to pursue an initial public offering the paper said adding that the talks do not appear to include GlobalFoundries itself.

A spokesperson for Santa Clara California-based Intel declined to comment on the report and GlobalFoundries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Any bid for GlobalFoundries would buttress Intel’s ambitious plan to regain its once unmatched lead in chip production. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger who took the top job in February has pledged to restore the company to its dominant role in manufacturing and computer processors after losing ground to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) and others.

He is also moving to take on those rivals directly by opening the doors of Intel’s plants to other chipmakers including competitors and has said he would spend heavily to build new factories specifically to serve as foundries for others.

“We’re going to be leaders in the market and we’re going to satisfy the new foundry customers” Gelsinger told journalists after taking over as CEO. “Because the world needs more semiconductors and we’re going to step into that gap in a powerful and meaningful way.”

Intel with a market value of more than US$225 billion had US$22.4 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the end of the first quarter.

GlobalFoundries has been planning an IPO that could value the chipmaker at about US$30 billion Bloomberg News has reported.

GlobalFoundries was created when Mubadala bought Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s manufacturing facilities in 2009 and later combined them with Singapore’s Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.

Contract chipmakers like GlobalFoundries TSMC and Samsung fabricate semiconductors for large tech companies such as Apple Inc Nvidia Corp and Amazon.com Inc. GlobalFoundries in April said it is moving its headquarters to Malta New York the site of a major chipmaking plant.",,,,,,

Earth is a wet rock floating through space; it doesn’t care if we drown our coastal cities or turn our farmland into desert. Rather carbon capture is one of the technologies we will need if we want Earth to continue to be a tolerable place for humans to live.

In brief The carbon-capture chemistry we have today is too expensive. It works and it makes economic sense in a few settings. But to meet the global-consensus goal of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and dodge the worst consequences of climate change we need to deploy more than 150 times as much carbon-capture capacity as we have now. That means reducing costs and making more options available for a wide range of CO 2 emission sources. Read on about the growing number of businesses government labs nonprofits and academic researchers racing to bring the next generation of carbon-capture technology up to scale and into the market.

In 2020 we sent 40 billion metric tons (t) of carbon dioxide into Earth’s atmosphere. We need to cut that number to 0 by 2050 if we are to avoid the worst consequences of climate change according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If we don’t the natural systems that keep Earth’s climate relatively peaceful and comfortable will start to tip. The shift will be chaotic and the new normal might not be conducive to life as we know it.

To reach net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 we need an all-of-the-above approach. Efficiency improvements can reduce our energy needs and renewable and nuclear power may eventually be able to supply enough electricity for our homes offices and cars. But nuclear power is expensive and lacks public support and renewables are struggling to find the land they need to be deployed at scale. On top of that activities such as aviation and iron smelting are currently impossible to carry out commercially without releasing CO 2 .

That’s where carbon capture comes in. Removing carbon dioxide from point sources such as the flue gas of power plants and locking it away underground can be a big part of the path to net zero. Related technologies known as direct air capture can remove CO 2 that is already in the ambient air. But all of it depends on carbon capture getting a lot bigger cheaper and more efficient—and doing so quickly.

Slow start

Capturing the CO 2 from power plants’ flue gas is where most of the action is. “Decarbonization of the power sector becomes the backbone that the decarbonization of the rest of the economy happens on” says John Northington director of the National Carbon Capture Center a research facility near Birmingham Alabama.

What’s your gas stream? Different emission sources require different carbon-capture methods. Ammonia ethanol natural gas processing: Emit gas streams with more than 80% CO 2 . The CO 2 is captured with compression and dehydration membranes or physical solvents. Chemical plants iron steel and paper mills: Emit gas streams with 15–80% CO 2 . The CO 2 can be captured with physical solvents solid sorbents or membranes. Coal and natural gas power plants and boilers: Emit gas streams with less than 15% CO 2 . The CO 2 can be captured with chemical solvents. Ambient air: Has a CO 2 concentration around 0.041%. The CO 2 can be captured with metal-organic frameworks or chemical systems. Sources: Global CCS Institute National Petroleum Council.

But just one commercial power plant has carbon capture: the coal-fired Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan which captures 1 million t of CO 2 per year on one of its four generators. Carbon capture elsewhere on other industrial processes such as natural gas production adds another 27 plants and gathers 25 million t per year. Not nearly enough.

The people developing the technology that will make capturing carbon practical have gained unlikely allies in the past couple of years: the oil and gas companies responsible for the lion’s share of CO 2 emissions. Though these firms have had their eyes on carbon capture for some time Northington says they’re investing serious money in it now.

Data from the patent research firm Patent Seekers bear that notion out. Oil companies have gotten the largest number of carbon-capture patents in recent years followed by government agencies and research institutes universities and engineering and technology companies.

Klaus Lackner an engineering professor working on direct air capture at Arizona State University says the change in attitude is a result of pressure from two directions: competition from cheap renewable energy and public demand for low-carbon options. Major changes are coming to the energy market Lackner says. “The question isn’t ‘Will we have a transition?’ We will. The Exxons and Shells and other companies have to figure out how to make it through that transition. Their business model falls apart if you can’t have liquid fuels.”

Lackner says he’s been pushing fossil fuel companies on this point for years telling them “Your societal license to dump CO 2 into the air will go away. You need to figure out how to operate without needing that license.”

Matt Steyn a senior adviser with the advocacy wing of the Global CCS Institute (GCCSI) a carbon-capture-and-storage think tank says the change is also driven by the scientific consensus expressed by the IPCC and the International Energy Agency. “The target has been set; the timeline has been set” he says. The conversation has shifted from “What do we do?” to “How do we do it?”

As we deploy more plants costs will come down just as they have done in every other sector. Steve Oldham CEO Carbon Engineering

Carbon capture of all types is a gas-separation problem. The goal is pure CO 2  ideally at high pressure so it can go into a pipeline and be injected safely underground. For some industrial processes the capture technology available today works fine. In ammonia and corn ethanol plants for example the gas exiting exhaust pipes is 80% or more CO 2 and just needs to be dried and compressed for transport.

As the CO 2 in emissions gets more dilute the energy required to extract it rises. The emissions coming from steel plants and many chemical processes tend to be between 15 and 80% CO 2 . The flue gas from fossil fuel combustion in air such as in coal or natural gas–fired power plants is generally less than 15% CO 2 .

Capture with solvents

Ironically oil companies are some of the biggest practitioners of carbon capture today because they use solvents membranes and other technologies to remove CO 2 from natural gas deposits found in locations such as Russia and west Texas. When they use or sell that CO 2 instead of venting it that counts as carbon capture. That’s why ExxonMobil can claim to capture more CO 2 than any other company even if it uses most of that to push more oil out of the ground.

Amine-based extraction systems developed for natural gas processing have been adapted for other CO 2 sources such as the power plant in Saskatchewan but the energy cost of using such systems on more dilute streams is crushingly high. Second-generation solvent systems are poised to come to market next followed by membranes and solid sorbents. And numerous innovative and experimental approaches are racing to catch up.

Syrie Crouch vice president for carbon capture and storage at Shell which built the Saskatchewan plant says deploying capture where it’s simple is an important start. US ethanol makers for example capture only 3 million t of the 43 million t of CO 2 their plants produce each year. “The key is to capture that lowest-hanging fruit first and then work on down the cost curve” she says.

Incumbent amines

The most mature carbon-capture technologies today use solvents. These systems pump emissions through a solution that absorbs CO 2 but lets through other gases such as nitrogen. The CO 2 -rich solvent then flows into a boiler where heat drives the pure CO 2 back out of solution. That stripping step is the energy hog.

Though the terminology is harsh to a chemist’s ears carbon-capture solvents are considered either chemical or physical. Chemical solvents mostly amines such as the industry standard 30% monoethanolamine in water get a CO 2 -solubility boost through reversible chemical reactions with water and CO 2 that form carbonates bicarbonates and carbamates.

Physical solvents such as methanol rely on intermolecular interactions to dissolve CO 2 . Companies including Linde Air Products and UOP offer such systems commercially. They use less energy than chemical solvents but require high pressures and low temperatures. They’re not suitable for combustion flue gas but have been used for many years to remove CO 2 from natural gas.

Amine solvents have the advantage of being mature technology. The systems are well understood with well-characterized economics and risk profiles that investors know how to analyze. Dow Shell Fluor and others offer monoethanolamine solutions for carbon capture. Boundary Dam Unit 3 uses amines as did NRG Energy’s Petra Nova plant in Texas which captured more than 1 million t of CO 2 per year from 2017 until NRG shut it down in 2020.

BASF Linde General Electric and the start-up Carbon Clean are among those working on advanced amines. These systems use chemicals such as piperazine alongside or instead of monoethanolamine to get better stability kinetics and thermodynamics. The US Department of Energy recently awarded Linde and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign $47 million to build a 200 t per day pilot facility using an advanced amine solvent from BASF at a coal-fired power plant near Springfield Illinois.

But capturing CO 2 with amines comes at a steep cost. Fitted onto a power plant’s systems they consume 30–50% of the plant’s energy output. Most experts including Shell’s Crouch expect that amine systems can get only 10–20% more efficient. At the same time amines can seem like a safe bet compared with a next-generation technology. “If you’re making your first investment in carbon capture and storage you don’t necessarily want to be taking massive risks on something new and untested” the GCCSI’s Steyn says.

The next generation

At the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) and the Wyoming Integrated Test Center (ITC) two next-generation carbon-capture technologies that look promising are solid sorbents and membranes.

The NCCC and ITC sites are essentially coal-fired power plants that can pipe their flue gas into a series of testing bays. The NCCC tests systems at scales from less than 1 t per day up to about 25 t per day; tests at the ITC run between 25 and 450 t per day. The sites which use a combination of public and private financing serve as technology development bridges between lab-scale carbon-capture concepts and pilot-scale tests on commercial power plants.

The NCCC’s Northington says the incumbent amine systems can capture carbon at a cost of $60–$65 per metric ton. Advanced amines and other second-generation solvents are about $40 per metric ton. A handful of commercial installations that will use advanced amines are in early-stage engineering now he says. Solid sorbents membranes and other transformational technologies will reach $30 or less per metric ton he predicts.

“We want choice in the marketplace” says William Morris technical director of the ITC. “People are really trying to figure out what works for them not only in their industry but in their specific circumstance.”

Solid sorbents include zeolites metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) activated carbon and porous silica particles. They’re often functionalized with amine groups to increase their activity and make them more selective for CO 2 .

Merry-go-round

Generally solid sorbents have faster absorption kinetics than amines and require less energy to release the CO 2 again. They can also hold more CO 2 per unit volume than most solvents. That means that solid-sorbent systems can be smaller reducing capital costs and can be stripped of their CO 2 using vacuum or modest heat.

The start-up Svante forms solid sorbents into large nanoporous disks divided into slices like a pizza. On a giant turntable the disk slowly rotates each slice through a flue gas stream a CO 2 -stripping module and one or two sorbent preparation stations. The firm has a 10000 t per year demonstration plant on a natural gas–fired boiler in Canada. It raised $75 million in February to advance a design for cement plants.

In addition to Svante ExxonMobil Kawasaki Heavy Industries TDA Research and others are testing solid-sorbent systems for flue gas capture. Shell which is shifting its R&D to solid sorbents tested a system that uses amine-functionalized solid sorbents on a wood-burning power plant in Austria; it is now readying a scaled-up test at a manure-to-power plant in the Netherlands. After these trials Crouch says Shell will offer the technology on the open market.

Membranes are even further along than solid sorbents Morris says. Membrane systems use selectively permeable materials that exploit the small chemical and physical differences between CO 2 and the rest of a gas mixture to achieve separation. Like amines membranes are already being used in natural gas processing and other areas where CO 2 pressure and content are high.

“The next technology outside of amines that will deploy will be membranes” Morris predicts. He says membranes are coming fast for capturing CO 2 from flue gas at power plants. And Northington expects membranes will play a big role in carbon capture for the chemical industry and heavy manufacturing which have moderate to high CO 2 concentrations.

Getting any new carbon capture technology to market won’t be cheap. Morris says getting a robust set of data from testing at the ITC can cost seven figures. One membrane maker Membrane Technology and Research (MTR) won $52 million in funding in May from the US Department of Energy to do just that. MTR ran a 20 t per day version of its system for 1400 h at the NCCC in 2015 and will use the funds to scale it up to 150 t per day in Wyoming. The company expects to demonstrate capture at less than $40 per metric ton.

MTR’s membrane polymers are isoporous meaning their pores are uniform in size and arranged geometrically unlike the randomly arranged multisize pores in most gas-separation membranes. The regular pore pattern lets molecules flow more smoothly through the material lowering the amount of pressure needed relative to conventional membranes. And a tighter distribution of pore sizes increases selectivity for CO 2 .

Another membrane maker Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) also seeks to decrease costs by reducing pressure. CMS uses facilitated transport membranes which are specialized fluoropolymers coated onto a porous substrate. CEO Erica Nemser likens the mechanism to Tarzan swinging through the jungle on vines. The CO 2 is Tarzan and fluoropolymers decorated with activating groups act as the vines passing CO 2 along with minimal pressure needed.

The firm’s systems are already being used to separate olefins from paraffins and to remove water and dissolved gases from solvents oils and lubricants. The system that will capture CO 2 in flue gas will be a modification of one that’s in field trials now for removing CO 2 from biomethane. Chemical changes to the fluoropolymer make the membrane selective toward different chemical species Nemser says.

CMS’s units are built around membrane cartridges about twice the size of a can of spray paint—hence the “compact” in the company’s name. The bigger the gas stream to be treated the more cartridges the system uses. Chief Technology Officer Hannah Murnen says such modular systems will make carbon capture accessible for a wide range of CO 2 point sources. In contrast the towers needed to mix amine solvents with a gas stream and strip the CO 2 out later make economic sense only at enormous scales she says.

CMS says it will be able to deliver carbon capture for as little as $20 per metric ton. “It’s time for membranes. It’s membranes’ day in the sun” Murnen says.

Tomorrow’s tech

Amines may dominate carbon capture today and membranes and solid sorbents may be right on their heels but a need this serious—and a market this big—is attracting plenty of other contenders. And a good-enough concept could leap ahead if the people behind it can show it works and is scalable.

Saipem and Chart Industries both hope to adapt technology and equipment already in use in other chemical processes.

In January 2020 Saipem an energy technology and engineering firm acquired CO 2 Solutions a start-up that is using enzymes to boost the carbon-capture kinetics of aqueous potassium carbonate. K 2 CO 3 reacts with CO 2 and water to form potassium bicarbonate KHCO 3 . The bicarbonate solution releases its CO 2 at relatively low temperatures—around 75 °C under reduced pressure—meaning it can tap low-grade heat that most industrial processes would waste.

That chemistry has been used to scrub CO 2 from the air in submarines and other closed environments and in some high-CO 2 -concentration settings. The trouble is that the absorption kinetics are too slow for it to work well at flue gas concentrations and pressures; the contact towers would have to be even bigger than those used with amines.

To solve that problem Saipem catalyzes the reaction with the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Natural carbonic anhydrase is already one of the fastest enzymes speeding up the formation of HCO 3 – by a factor of 107. The team at CO 2 Solutions modified the enzyme to make it even faster and keep it active at higher temperatures.

“The first time I saw carbon capture with the enzyme my jaw just dropped because the catalyst is magic” says Richard Surprenant who came to Saipem from CO 2 Solutions and is now commercial manager for carbon-capture technologies.

Any industrial or postcombustion application is fair game for the firm’s technology Surprenant says and anywhere with low-grade waste or geothermal heat is an opportunity because it doesn’t need the high-grade heat a resource many plants already use in other ways. The firm is in the midst of restarting CO 2 Solutions’ first commercial plant a 30 t per day facility in Quebec that extracts CO 2 from a paper mill and sells it to a nearby greenhouse.

Chart Industries an energy and industrial gas equipment firm is also moving into carbon capture through acquisition and investment. In late 2020 Chart acquired Sustainable Energy Solutions a start-up making cryogenic carbon-capture systems for combustion flue gas. In June of this year it invested in Earthly Labs which uses cryogenics to capture CO 2 from breweries.

In the simplest terms both cryogenic systems chill their target gas streams until the CO 2 condenses into a solid or liquid. Nitrogen still a gas at those temperatures is pumped off. The basic process often called cryogenic distillation is already used to purify other industrial gases such as oxygen and nitrogen.

The challenge for flue gas is in the engineering not the chemistry according to Chart CEO Jill Evanko. If water and CO 2 freeze in the wrong places they can clog pipes and block heat exchangers. But with clever heat management system design and integration with the rest of the equipment Chart and its partners can deliver carbon capture of flue gas at half the cost of conventional amines Evanko says and make brewery carbon capture profitable enough to pay off the equipment in 18 months.

Several other technologies are in early-stage development. Solvents that use less water or no water at all including organic solvents and ionic liquids could reduce the amount of mass that needs to be heated to release the purified CO 2 . Allam cycle power plants burn hydrocarbons in a mix of O 2 and CO 2  sidestepping the need to separate CO 2 from nitrogen. And FuelCell Energy is commercializing its molten carbonate fuel cell which can capture flue gas carbon while generating additional electricity from natural gas.

It’s an exciting time for technology development the ITC’s Morris says. “Decarbonization is going to be very very difficult and it’s probably not going to be possible without technologies that are currently in the development stage.”

State of play



Direct air capture

Point-source carbon capture won’t be enough. The technology still lets 2–10% of the carbon through. And it’s hard to deploy on sources with diffuse or mobile emissions such as airplanes sprawling petrochemical plants and wide-open wastewater treatment facilities. Besides the atmosphere has too much carbon already. The goal of net-zero CO 2 emissions will require methods to remove carbon from the air.

This direct air capture or DAC works on chemical principles similar to those for point-source capture. The big difference is that our ambient air although overloaded is still only 410 ppm or 0.041% CO 2  much lower than even the most dilute industrial point sources. And that changes a lot about the devices and their economics.

Because flue gas and other point sources are releasing new carbon into the atmosphere the goal is to capture as much of it as possible—90% is a common target. In DAC the amount of carbon left behind isn’t important; it’s all about how much CO 2 can be removed per dollar spent. “My goal is not to make CO 2 -free air. My goal is to take CO 2 out of the air and I can choose where the optimal efficiency is” says Lackner the Arizona State engineer who is also developing DAC technology.

But however you look at it DAC is expensive. Carbon capture at an ethanol plant can cost as little as $10 per metric ton. At a coal-fired power plant the cost is around $60. DAC companies don’t like to talk about their costs but industry insiders estimate they are around $500 per metric ton. Lackner and other experts generally peg $100 as the point at which DAC will become cost competitive with other decarbonization methods.

Oxy Low Carbon Ventures a carbon-reduction subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum thinks it can reach that level in partnership with the start-up Carbon Engineering. The firms plan to build in the southwestern US what they say will be the world’s first commercial-scale DAC plant. It will capture 1 million t of CO 2 per year to be used mainly to boost production in Occidental’s oil wells in the region. The largest existing DAC plant captures a mere 2000 t per year according to Ryan Edwards low-carbon policy adviser for Oxy Low Carbon.

Carbon Engineering uses chemical looping to capture carbon from the air. In its process intended to run on renewable energy giant fans blow air over plastic surfaces that have aqueous potassium hydroxide flowing over it.

The KOH reacts with CO 2 to form potassium carbonate K 2 CO 3  which then flows into a pellet reactor containing aqueous calcium hydroxide Ca(OH) 2 . The calcium and potassium switch places to form CaCO 3  which precipitates out as solid pellets as well as KOH which is ready to cycle back to the plastic surfaces. The pellets then pass into a calciner a heater that decomposes the CaCO 3 into solid CaO and pure CO 2 . The CO 2 is cooled and pressurized and the CaO heads back to the pellet reactor where it mixes with water and re-forms Ca(OH) 2 .

The system sounds complicated but it’s built mostly out of reactions and equipment already in use in industry. The pellet reactor is adapted from papermaking. Calciners running the same chemical reaction are central to cement production and other versions come into play in glass uranium petroleum coke and gypsum processing.

Carbon Engineering published its process in 2018 projecting costs between $94 and $232 per metric ton (Joule DOI: 10.1016/j.joule.2018.05.006). CEO Steve Oldham says the firm is “extremely confident” its costs will be in that range and expects that second and third generations will ensure a cost of $100 or less. “As we deploy more plants costs will come down just as they have done in every other sector” Oldham says.

Mosaic Materials a developer of MOFs and one of C&EN’s 10 Start-Ups to Watch in 2019 pivoted to DAC from point-source capture 2 years ago according to CEO Thomas McDonald. In the past 3 months McDonald says he’s seen a sharp increase in interest in DAC.

The firm’s MOFs use a flavor of CO 2 -amine chemistry that McDonald calls cooperative binding in which the CO 2 inserts itself between a magnesium ion and an amine ligand. The mechanism gives the material high capacity and fast kinetics and it reverses at relatively low temperatures to release the CO 2  according to McDonald.

MOFs are more expensive than other solid sorbents such as silica or activated carbon. Mosaic researchers are working to improve the materials’ capacity and stability to reduce operating costs McDonald says. But the firm is focused more on lowering manufacturing costs and optimizing complete systems around its materials.

Mosaic worked with ExxonMobil on flue gas capture in 2017 and 2018 and has some ongoing work in that area along with collaborations with NASA and the US Navy on life-support systems McDonald says. But he sees DAC as the best way to build his company. “We see the fastest least-capital-intensive least-risky path is by achieving early scale on projects through direct air capture.”

We will require something roughly the size of the current oil and gas industry but with the molecules going in reverse. Syrie Crouch vice president for carbon capture and storage Shell

Lackner says DAC is a good fit with renewable energy. If a natural gas power plant is off because of low demand so is any point-source carbon-capture device attached to it. DAC on the other hand can run on renewable energy and stabilize electricity prices by being a customer of last resort.

In addition to his academic work Lackner is working to commercialize his own DAC concept which he calls MechanicalTrees. The “trees” eliminate the cost of running fans by relying on wind to move air across sorbents loaded onto disks arranged in a tower. When saturated with CO 2  the towers drop into a chamber where heat and vacuum remove the CO 2 at roughly 95% concentration.

Paying for it

All cool ideas but who’s putting up the cash? A provision of the US tax code called 45Q offers tax credits for capturing carbon. When the provision is fully in place in 2026 carbon that is captured and sequestered will be worth $50 per metric ton. CO 2 used to extract more hydrocarbons a widespread and controversial practice called enhanced oil recovery gets $35.

That $35 credit plus the $40 per metric ton that enhanced oil recovery operators pay for CO 2 on average make that market the most profitable for non-food-grade CO 2 even with the lower credit (Front. Clim. 2019 DOI: 10.3389/fclim.2019.00005).

That makes the economic rationale for carbon-capture products dependent on the price of oil. That dynamic is what doomed the Petra Nova carbon-capture facility when the price of oil got too low during the pandemic. Still Oxy Low Carbon executives are prepared to depend on enhanced oil recovery for their southwestern US DAC project.

Despite such bumps carbon capture offers a way to decarbonize combustion and other CO 2 -emitting processes so they can remain part of a net-zero world. That’s both a selling point and a point of criticism. Critics such as Greenpeace say carbon capture diverts resources away from renewables and keeps polluters in business.

Your societal license to dump CO 2 into the air will go away. You need to figure out how to operate without needing that license. Klaus Lackner engineer Arizona State University

Critics also point out that almost all the CO 2 captured to date has been used in enhanced oil recovery. In the best cases enough CO 2 stays permanently in the ground after such oil extraction that the resulting fuel has net-negative CO 2 emissions. But many enhanced oil recovery projects don’t meet that goal (Energies 2019 DOI: 10.3390/en12030448).

“To put it very brutally in the beginning I don’t care” where the captured CO 2 goes Lackner says. The technology needs to start scaling up now. He points to a recent report from the International Energy Agency detailing a path to net zero by 2050. In that scenario point-source capture has to scale up from about 40 million t per year today to 6.6 billion t in 2050 and DAC has to grow from a few thousand metric tons per year to almost 1 billion t in 2050.

If enhanced oil recovery operators are willing to be early adopters that get carbon capture down to a cost that the market will bear Lackner says that’ll have to do. “The only way you get there is by learning. Most industries gain 10–20% in cost reduction for every doubling of cumulative output” he says. “If we follow normal learning curves I’m allowed to be optimistic. If it turns out we derail from that the sooner we know the better off we are.”

Shell’s Crouch agrees that industry needs to start deploying carbon capture now to reach the necessary scale. “We will require something roughly the size of the current oil and gas industry but with the molecules going in reverse” she says.

Building all those plants will cost $655 billion to $1280 billion over the next 3 decades according to a recent analysis by the GCCSI. That’s a lot of money but Brad Page CEO of the GCCSI points out in a press release that “investing around one trillion dollars over almost 30 years is well within the capacity of the private sector which invested almost two trillion dollars in the energy sector in 2018 alone. Government decisions hold the key to enabling the requisite private sector capital being allocated for [carbon capture and storage] deployment.”

One proposal the US Congress is considering now would add a higher credit for carbon captured from the air. The idea has broad bipartisan support according to Oxy Low Carbon’s Edwards. At a recent panel discussion hosted by the nonprofit OurEnergyPolicy he expressed confidence that enhanced incentives R&D and deployment support and funding for infrastructure for CO 2 transport and storage could all become law in the current session of Congress.

Jeremy Harrell the managing director for policy at the energy-transition nonprofit ClearPath and another OurEnergyPolicy panelist said he expects the Biden administration to launch a 50:50 cost-sharing initiative to deploy a first wave of carbon-capture facilities. “We think that sends a really important market signal to the private sector as they look to invest in these technologies” he said at the event. “The politics here are going to play out well over the next 18 months and people should stay tuned.”

The administration’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year includes a 61% increase in spending at the Department of Energy on carbon capture use and storage though the $368 million total is far short of what many climate activists would like to see.

Edwards says 45Q has opened the door to commercial-scale carbon-capture projects. Since Congress extended 45Q in 2018 and removed the cap on the number of credits available 30 to 40 new projects have been publicly proposed he says which would more than double the global number. Between projects that are being kept quiet for now and new ones that will be unlocked if Congress expands 45Q that increase is “just the tip of the iceberg” Edwards says.

It’ll need to be. Right now 28 point-source capture and DAC plants are active including at Boundary Dam and nonpower installations according to the GCCSI.

The burning heat of summer has us all reaching for sunscreens. But before you slather that product on your skin first check to see if it is part of a voluntary recall by sunscreen brands Neutrogena and Aveeno.

The companies recently pulled several sunscreens from market shelves after independent testing had found they were contaminated with a cancer-causing chemical called benzene.

“Exposure to benzene increases the risk of developing leukemia and other blood disorders” according to the National Cancer Institute.

CVS Health also stopped selling two of its after-sun care products due to similar findings. But other sunscreens and after-sun cosmetics which also tested positive for the toxin remain on the market (the full list is below).

The vast majority of tested sunscreens however were free of benzene and experts stress the importance of sunscreen use to protect skin from the aging and cancerous effects of the sun.

“It is NOT a reason to stop using sun protection which is known to prevent skin cancer. To do so would be like hearing a particular car model was recalled and then committing to never drive again” dermatologist Dr. Ranella Hirsch a past president of the American Society of Cosmetic Dermatology and Aesthetic Surgery posted on Instagram.

How did brand-name sunscreens become contaminated with benzene? Should you be concerned? And what can you do to protect yourself and your family? We’ve gathered answers to these questions and more.

Which sunscreens were recalled?

All batches or lots of these four Neutrogena spray sunscreens and one Aveeno spray were voluntarily recalled this week by parent company Johnson & Johnson (J&J) “out of an abundance of caution”:

Neutrogena® Beach Defense® aerosol

Neutrogena® Cool Dry Sport aerosol

Neutrogena® Invisible Daily™ defense aerosol

Neutrogena® Ultra Sheer® aerosol

Aveeno® Protect + Refresh aerosol

“While benzene is not an ingredient in any of our sunscreen products it was detected in some samples of the impacted aerosol sunscreen finished products” J&J reported in a statement. “Consumers should stop using these specific products and appropriately discard them.”

Specific lots of all recalled Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreens can be found here and customers can call with questions and request a refund by completing this form or calling 1-800-458-1673.

CVS also stopped selling CVS Health After Sun Aloe Vera and CVS Health After Sun Aloe Vera Spray a day after the Johnson & Johnson recall was announced.

Mike DeAngelis senior director of CVS Health’s corporate communications told CNN the company is “cooperating with Johnson & Johnson’s voluntary recall.”

He said that “CVS products have not been recalled” but the company has paused sales of the two CVS products which tested positive for benzene “out of an abundance of caution.” CVS Health is working with the supplier of the products to “take appropriate additional steps” he added.

However one of the CVS products on the list of benzene-contaminated products After-sun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel “is still for sale” DeAngelis said.

Why were the sunscreens recalled?

The voluntary recalls and pause in sales came after an independent lab tested 294 samples from 69 brands of sprays lotions gels and creams designed to protect the skin from the sun or care for the skin after sun. Of those 78 samples tested positive for benzene.

Contamination appeared in specific batches of sunscreen rather than a specific brand said David Light CEO and founder of Valisure the independent lab that ran the tests.

“The finding of benzene in sunscreen was certainly surprising to me as a scientist and a consumer. I’m quite a heavy user of sunscreen myself; I have five kids and we all use sunscreen so it was rather concerning to find such high levels” Light said.

Multiple samples contained “significantly detectable benzene and some batches contained up to 3.1 times the conditionally restricted limit” according to the citizen petition asking for action that Valisure filed with the US Food and Drug Administration.

“We petitioned the FDA to recall or to request recalls of the products that are 0.1 per million and above” Light told CNN. “It’s obvious that we shouldn’t be taking that risk and we just wanted it cleaned up.”

Samples of three of the recalled Neutrogena spray sunscreens – Beach Defense Invisible Daily and Ultra Sheer – and one CVS brand – After-sun Aloe Vera Soothing Spray – had levels of benzene that were 2 parts per million or higher according to Valisure’s tests.

Another spray Neutrogena’s Cool Dry Sport and CVS Health’s After-sun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel tested at .01 to 2 parts per million of benzene in some samples.

Aveeno’s Protect + Refresh aerosol which was the fifth sunscreen recalled by J&J was not tested by Valisure.

“We did not have the chance of acquiring any of the Aveeno sprays but it certainly sounds like Johnson & Johnson’s own internal testing confirms our overall concern with benzene in the sunscreens” Light said.

According to J&J daily exposure to benzene in these sunscreen products “at the levels detected in internal testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.”

“There is not a safe level of benzene that can exist in sunscreen products” said Dr. Christopher Bunick associate professor of dermatology at Yale University in Valisure’s press release. “Even benzene at 0.1 ppm (parts per million) in a sunscreen could expose people to excessively high nanogram amounts of benzene.”

Which products were not recalled?

Samples of Eco Formula Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 Advanced After-Sun Gel by Sun Burst Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 by SunBurnt Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 by Goodsense Ultimate Sheer Sunscreen Lotion SPF 70 by TopCare Everyday and UV Aero Broad-Spectrum Full-Body Sunscreen Spray SPF 45 by EltaMD all tested for benzene at levels of 2 parts per million or higher.

Samples of three Banana Boat products also contained levels of benzene at those levels: Kids Max Protect & Play Sunscreen C-Spray SPF 100 UltraMist Deep Tanning Dry Oil Continuous Clear Spray SPF 4 and Ultra Sport Clear Sunscreen Spray SPF 100.

To date CNN was not able to verify that any of these products have been recalled following Valisure’s request to that effect to the FDA.

The sunscreens tested by Valisure were only a tiny sample of the more than 11000 registered sun care products on the market.

The Personal Care Products Council an industry association said its members were “firmly committed” to providing products with “ingredients that have been thoroughly tested for safety and follow the requirements of the law.”

“We are aware of the study reporting the presence of benzene in some of the sunscreen products tested” the council said in a statement. “There is nothing more important than safety. If our consumers can’t believe in a product or rely on it to do what it says then nothing else matters.”

What is benzene?

Benzene is a natural component of crude oil gasoline and cigarette smoke and ranks in the top 20 chemicals used for production of “lubricants rubbers dyes detergents drugs and pesticides” as well as “plastics resins and nylon and synthetic fibers” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At room temperature benzene is a colorless or light yellow liquid with a sweet odor. Highly flammable it will float on water and while it evaporates quickly it is heavier than air and can sink into low-lying areas the CDC noted.

Gas emissions from volcanoes and forest fires are natural sources of benzene but the largest sources are emissions from burning coal and oil motor vehicle exhaust and evaporation from gasoline service stations according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).

Exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause death the ATSDR says but the impacts of eating foods or drinking liquids containing lower levels of benzene are not known.

“If you spill benzene on your skin it may cause redness and sores. Benzene in your eyes may cause general irritation and damage to your cornea” the ATSDR said.

Cigarette smoke and off-gassing from furniture wax detergents glue and paint are sources of indoor exposure to benzene according to the CDC while outdoor air can be polluted with benzene from “gas stations motor vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions.”

How did benzene get into sunscreens?

No one knows for sure how the toxin ended up in sun care products. Benzene was not an ingredient in any of the sunscreens so experts suspect contamination had to have occurred during the manufacturing process.

“There are a lot of theories” said Scott Faber the senior vice president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group (EWG) a non-profit consumer health advocacy group which puts out a yearly guide to safe sunscreens.

“Benzene could be a byproduct of the process of making the chemicals that companies sell to the formulators of personal care products and sunscreens. Or it could be that some of those chemicals break down into benzene although that seems less likely” Faber said.

“But it’s very alarming especially since the FDA does not require companies to test ingredients for contaminants nor does it require testing for such chemicals at a finished product stage” he added.

What is the FDA doing?

In response to Valisure’s petition the FDA told CNN that it “evaluates and assesses the information provided in citizen petitions of this type and generally initiates an independent testing and verification process.”

“While the FDA evaluates the citizen petition submitted by Valisure we will continue to monitor sunscreen manufacturing and marketing to help ensure the availability of safe sunscreens for U.S. consumers” an FDA spokesperson said.

How can I tell if my sunscreen is contaminated?

Because the contamination was sporadic and likely occurred accidentally there is no way for consumers to look at a label and choose a product without benzene Faber said.

“Sadly consumers are screwed. There’s no way to shop around this problem” Faber said adding that consumers can petition for new regulations to more thoroughly test consumer care products for toxins and contaminants.

“People can tell the FDA to require over-the-counter sunscreen product companies to test for contaminants like benzene and people can tell Congress to pass laws to modernize cosmetics safety laws” he said.

Valisure has committed to testing additional sun care products as they have space in their lab schedules and it is encouraging people to send in sunscreens and sun care products they have purchased to be analyzed.

If you’re interested in having your sunscreen tested in their crowdsourcing study the full instructions on how to package and send your product can be found here.

How can I protect my family?

Benzene is not the only concern when it comes to sunscreen. A number of sunscreens have been shown to be ineffective or contain chemicals that can enter the bloodstream and disrupt hormones. In EWG’s 2021 guide to sunscreens they analyzed over 1800 products and found that 75% did not provide adequate sun protection – or included ingredients linked to harm. Still there were over 200 products that did meet their safety standards.

All of this uncertainty may leave consumers unsure of what to do and experts worry some may forgo the use of sunscreen altogether. But experts warned that’s an even worse idea. Melanoma one of the most deadly forms of skin cancer has been on the rise globally for decades. And while survival rates are getting better melanoma is still the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States.

And of course it’s always a great choice to use common sense practices as well to protect your skin from harmful rays. Wear shorts shirts pants and hats to help block dangerous rays and apply safe sunscreens to exposed skin. Wisely choose your time in the sun by avoiding the most intense rays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and seek shade whenever possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3dhdGNoLmNvbS9tYWluZS1mb3JldmVyLWNoZW1pY2Fscy0yNjUzODIzODcyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maine Becomes First U.S. State to Ban 'Forever Chemicals' in Products,"By Jenna McGuire

Maine enacted a groundbreaking law on Thursday banning the use of so-called “forever chemicals” in all products by 2030 except in instances deemed “currently unavoidable.”

Maine is the first state in the U.S. and first government in the world to implement a ban on the toxic chemicals per- and polyfluoroalkyl known as PFAS which are notorious for not breaking down easily in the environment and can remain in a person’s body for decades after exposure.

“I am proud to see Maine taking action that will change the conversation on how PFAS are regulated not only addressing the entire class but creating the requirement to avoid these persistent and toxic chemicals wherever possible” said Patrick MacRoy the deputy director of Defend Our Health a public health organization in Maine that coordinated with experts and community advocates to get the bill passed.

The man-made chemicals can be found in soil drinking water the air food packaging cosmetics cookware various household products and industrial workplaces—resulting in widespread exposure to humans and the environment.

A 2015 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found PFAS present in 97% of Americans’ blood.

Democratic state House Representative Lori Gramlich who sponsored the bill told Reuters “PFAS is at a crisis level here in Maine—it’s in the soil groundwater and household items and it is making people severely sick.”

PFAS have been associated with numerous health effects including low infant birth weights liver and kidney disease disruptions of the immune and reproductive systems and cancer.

While the statewide ban does not take affect until January 2030 manufacturers will have to begin reporting the presence of PFAS chemicals in their products to the Maine Department of Environmental Quality starting in January 2023.

“This policy sets a strong national precedent that sends a clear signal to industry that we need to move quickly toward safer chemistry and away from toxic chemicals like PFAS” said Sarah Doll the national director of Safer States a public health advocacy group that advocates for stronger legislation on PFAS at the state level.

Maine has emerged as a climate leader recently passing two additional landmark environmental laws. In June it became the first state to pass a bill requiring the government’s divestment from fossil fuels by 2026 and on July 13th Gov. Janet Mills (D) signed a bill that shifted costs of recycling from taxpayers to companies the first bill of its kind in the country.

Away Packable

A backpack carry-all and sling bag crafted from lightweight water-resistant recycled nylon — so they’ll survive the elements and most importantly not take up a lot of room. Each bag here folds into a tiny zip pouch when not in use.

Sony

LSPX-S3 Glass Sound Speaker

A third-generation of Sony’s speaker that looks like either a lamp or a bong the S3 is a wireless glass speaker with 360 degrees of sound and eight hours of battery life. It’s probably the only speaker you can set to “flickering candlelight” mode.

Bearaby

Bearaby Travel Napper

Ever wanted to take your weighted blanket on the go but can’t because it’s unfortunately an extremely heavy weighted blanket? Well design- and sustainability-forward weighted blanket brand Bearaby is solving that problem with the launch of its new Travel Napper a portable carry-on sized weighted blanket that even comes with a handy (and good-looking) canvas tote. At 10lbs the hand-knitted 100% organic cotton blanket is perfect for in-flight naps road trips and even serves as a convenient comforting deskside companion.

Houseplant

Houseplant Gravity Glass

Leave it to Seth Rogen to make the fanciest most sophisticated and least stoner-y bong we’ve ever seen. Building upon DIY gravity bongs from yesteryear Houseplant’s version is crafted from amber or yellow glass and is meant to be put on display rather than hastily shoved out of sight. The colored high-quality borosilicate glass and tapered silhouette are reminiscent of vintage mid-century modern homewares so your smoking experience will not only be peaceful but aesthetically pleasing.

Scapegrace

Scapegrace Black

A velvety black gin that turns red and purple when mixed with tonic? That’s a cool trick from this well-reviewed New Zealand distillery. If you’re wondering how the gin starts out as black it’s natural and based on the gin’s botanicals (aronia berry saffron pineapple butterfly pea wweet potato etc.)

Timex

Q Timex

Calling all Timex enthusiasts: the brand has just released two new two-tone Q Timex watches as they continue to expand upon the Color Series. The watches are available in black or off-white the dials and bezels completely filled out in solid color rather than the usual split-bezel look of the previous styles released. Yet the most noticeable change to the design is the two-tone bracelet made entirely from stainless steel and featuring a gold band running down the center for a look that’s simultaneously unique and classic.

Vollebak

Vollebak Garbage Sweater

The overbuilt outfitter that brought you the Garbage Watch has now unveiled the Garbage Sweater a fire-resistant layer made from — no joke — old firefighter suits and bulletproof vests that would have otherwise ended up in a landfill. If that’s not tough enough the designers at Vollebak say they took inspiration from the time Sylvester Stallone kept warm on the freezing set of Rambo: First Blood by slicing a hole in a piece of rotting canvas. This’ll cost you a bit more though.

Harley Davidson

Harley-Davidson x Jason Momoa

Your typical Harley gear this is not. But a new clothing collab with Aquaman himself Jason Momoa may just be the unexpected kick in the pants the aging hog builder needs. We’ve got some familiar elements what with the classic eagle logo and black-and-rust color palette but there are also Hawaiian shirts striped long-sleeves and a leather jacket lined with an aloha print. It’s worth a gander whether or not you’ve got a bike in the garage.

Nike

Nike Air Max 2021

If you’ve been anticipating the release of this year’s Nike Air Max then the wait is almost over as the sneaker is finally set to be released August 5.

Free Rain

Free Rain Pink Grapefruit & Maca for Arousal

Adaptogen-enhanced sparkling water brand Free Rain just launched its newest tiltilating flavor: Arousal. Containing Pink Grapefruit and Maca this first-of-its-kind beverage claims to have “one full dose of pleasure in every can.” Yes it’s a sparkling sex water designed to “nourish libido enhance sexual energy and support hormonal balance.” Drink up.

Panera

Panera Bread Swim Soup Collection

Panera Bread released a limited-edition collection of soup-themed swimwear the chain restaurant says is inspired by the people who refuse to stop eating soup even in the devastatingly hot summer weather. The collection includes four soup-inspired swimwear styles two of which boast a fun broccoli cheddar print plus a pool float inspired by Panera’s delicious bread bowls. We offer our sincerest apologies to all you soup aficionados out there though because the entire Swim Soup collection has already sold out.

Glco

Garrett Leight has teamed up with the Brazilian menswear brand Frescobol Carioca on a capsule collection of sunglasses and resortwear.

It's Not.,"Just over a year ago Airbnb was in dire straits.

The pandemic had ground global travel to a halt all but vaporizing the tech giant's business model. Bookings were cancelled. Revenue disappeared. By May of 2020 the company had announced sweeping layoffs — slashing a quarter of its workforce. It was said to be facing hundreds of millions in losses. The sharing economy pundits proclaimed was gutted.

You wouldn't know that though from Airbnb's current marketing campaign. In the US where eased travel restrictions have prompted a wave of demand the short-term rental business is booming. And Airbnb — so recently in crisis — is now branding itself a benefactor. This spring the company solemnly announced a new focus: working ""with governments and tourism agencies globally to support economic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.""

To the many cities and towns whose economies were ravaged by the pandemic Airbnb now claims to offer a solution: floods of tourists and an influx of cash. It's a smart strategy — one that would cement the company not only as a cornerstone of travel but also of local economies.

In sleepy Montpelier Vermont — the small-town capital of a state that leans heavily on tourism — Airbnb has launched a campaign to revitalize an economy and businesses that ""have suffered"" from the lack of tourism. In Portland Oregon Airbnb is working with a municipal tourism agency to help travelers ""rediscover"" the town. And the list goes on: New Mexico northwest Arkansas Tulsa Oklahoma — ""Airbnb can be an important part of their revitalization"" the company insists.

This strategy might be lucrative for Airbnb — but it's deceitful. The company is capitalizing on the economic strain towns and cities are bearing from the pandemic and a growing demand for travel. But unchecked short-term rentals and the destructive tourism they offer are not an answer for beleaguered economies.

An ounce of hindsight shows that Airbnb does not offer a sustainable business model. As the pandemic proved its short-term approach to lodging is highly susceptible to economic shock. This came into full view last year with massive layoffs and subsequent internal unrest. It also revealed the many shady landlording schemes that the company had allowed to proliferate as Airbnb's overextended tycoons and speculators found themselves in hot water when their revenue vanished overnight.

Airbnb's hosts are seeing fevered demand for travel now; some of its high-demand listings are reportedly going for $1000 a night. Investors are once again looking to buy enormous real estate portfolios to sell off as highly lucrative short-term rentals — using AI software to buy ""hundreds of properties"" at one time. But there are real reasons to be wary of Airbnb even when it's lucrative for hosts — as it usually is.

Peeking behind the curtain

For one the company's claims to be a boon to local economies — specifically for small businesses and ""mom and pop"" rental operations — are tenuous at best. Studies have shown that Airbnb typically increases tourism less than advertised serving merely as a substitute for other accommodations which would have drawn the same travelers. And whatever additional travel it does bring is increasingly at the expense of reduced housing stock.

Airbnb's impacts on housing are clear: The platform often drives up prices in neighborhoods and displaces long-term residents accelerating gentrification. As Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky has even said in recent days the platform is seeing more demand for full house rentals — moving away from the sharing model that once envisioned modest homeowners renting out a spare bedroom. And it is these sorts of rentals that can starkly change the character of neighborhoods.

Last month Airbnb made headlines for its apparently well-intentioned promise to ban listings at properties that had evicted tenants formerly protected under the federal eviction moratorium — an attempt to lessen the blow of the lifted policy. Yet as some local news outlets quickly realized the plan's feasibility is dubious and is likely difficult to implement. For one thing Airbnb will require cities to inform the company of properties that had evicted tenants — regardless of whether they're tracking that information (and most cities probably aren't). And furthermore many tenants are forced out of their homes informally without a court order as evidence — when a landlord declines to renew a lease for instance or posts an eviction notice and no one brings the matter to a judge.

'We are about belonging'

The promise to ban listings at properties where tenants were evicted forms part of Airbnb's undying efforts to brand itself as a homey ""mom and pop"" business; ""What we are about is belonging and at the center of belonging is love"" Chesky told his employees in his emotional letter announcing last year's layoffs.

This identity carries over into the company's policy arguments. This summer when Nevada passed a new law regulating short-term rentals Airbnb was incensed. The law took the reasonable and increasingly popular step of requiring Airbnbs to be taxed at the same rate as hotel lodging as well as implementing other various restrictions on short-term rental ownership. A company representative decried all these measures as ""a gift for resorts at the expense of regular Nevadans who share their homes.""

Airbnb has spent years lobbying against laws like Nevada's which carry actual penalties for violations in favor of more lukewarm regulation by cities. But its efforts to rescind or block this kind of legislation have adopted a new tone of urgency bolstered by the company's claims that it is a lifeline for struggling cities. This is echoed by local business leaders. Currently Columbia South Carolina is considering new limits on short-term rentals but it has faced pushback.

""We're trying to open back up from a pandemic now is not the time to put up hurdles for people visiting Columbia"" the head of the local chamber of commerce told the Post and Courier. ""We need to be opening our arms and welcoming people to come and visit.""

Airbnb might claim that its platform helps hosts ""stay in their homes"" but study after study has shown that the platform jacks up rent prices and aggravates housing shortages subverting zoning laws to convert residential housing stock into what are essentially commercial hotels. Meanwhile the nation is on the brink of a housing crisis as the eviction moratorium lifts and other housing assistance programs — funded by federal relief funds — begin to run dry.

In Vermont where Airbnb is embarking on one of its tourism campaigns a statewide real estate boom is pricing out renters all while hundreds of residents lose housing as an emergency housing program launched at the onset of the pandemic abruptly ends. In Portland a longstanding homelessness crisis is only worsening.

This moment calls for serious investment in affordable housing and rent relief — all far less lucrative for landlords than short-term rentals. The past year showed that such investment was possible even if we are now watching it come to a brutal end. We should not be duped into thinking that what we need instead are more Airbnbs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2NoaWNhZ28vMjAyMS8wNy8xOC9vbHltcGljLWRlYWwtc2NvdHRpZS1waXBwZW4tbGlzdHMtY2hpY2Fnby1tYW5zaW9uLW9uLWFpcmJuYi1mb3ItOTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scottie Pippen's Chicago Mansion Hits Airbnb For Olympics,"The Chicago home of two-time Olympic gold medalist and Bulls’ great Scottie Pippen is hitting Airbnb to coincide with the upcoming Tokyo Olympics.

Pippen’s Highland Park mansion is open for three separate one-night stays in early August at a symbolic rate of $92 per night a reference to Pippen’s 1992 Olympic gold according to People.com.

Bookings open for Pippen’s home on July 22. Those who manage to book one of the three nights can bring three guests and will be able to play basketball on his indoor court hang out in the sauna or pool and tour his extensive collection of trophies and memorabilia.

His home theater will be open to watch the Olympic Games in Tokyo as well as archival footage of the Dream Team’s 1992 Olympic run.

Airbnb regularly creates novelty bookings for its Airbnb Online Experience promotion. The platform is also running an online Q&A with Pippen’s 1992 teammates Larry Bird and Patrick Ewing.

Last year Airbnb turned the last remaining Blockbuster video store in Bend Oregon into a nostalgia-themed rental at a rate of $4 per night a tie-in to the defunct video store’s rental fee.

The platform also secured five one-night stays at the Bel Air mansion where “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” filmed as a promotion for the show’s 30th anniversary.

Pippen’s PR stunt could also double as a marketing move.

In October 2018 he cut the asking price on the 10000 square-foot home to $2.25 million.

Meanwhile his Bulls and Dream Team teammate Michael Jordan is still trying to sell his own Highland Park mansion this one a 30000-square-foot property.

The massive home has been on the market for more than decade. Jordan’s ex-wife Juanita Vanoy Jordan recently listed her own six-bedroom Chicago home.

The two-time Olympic gold medalist and six-time NBA champion announced earlier this week that he is opening the doors to his Chicagoland home offering lucky superfans the opportunity to live like a champion during the Olympic Games.

As a first time host on Airbnb Scottie’s pulling out all the stops for his guests starting with a virtual meet-and-greet at check-in then followed by a day filled with fun relaxation and nostalgia. Guests will have the opportunity to channel their inner athlete on his indoor basketball court. (Try not to dunk too hard and break the backboard!)

In his welcome message on AirBnb Pippen notes that swimming is his second favorite activity after basketball. Guests can cool off after basketball in his backyard pool- complete with an outdoor television so you don’t miss a moment of the Olympic Games. (Inclement weather might be a bummer but Pippen’s in-home theater will also be available for guest use.)

Non-Olympic caliber guests can still compete with each other in his arcade room- or just relax in the sauna if they’ve had too much activity for the day.

Best of all guests can check out his memorabilia room featuring some of his NBA and Olympic gear photos and awards.

Perhaps most interesting of all is that Pippen is offering this stay at a price that non-ballers can afford. He will host three one-night stays for up to four people occurring on August 2 August 4 and August 6 for only $92* a night a nod to the year he and his teammates became gold medalists.

Booking for this stay begins Thursday July 22 at 1 p.m. EDT at airbnb.com/scottiepippen.

In the spirit of the Olympic Games Airbnb is making a one-time donation to the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Foundation which generates critical financial resources that help Team USA athletes and para-athletes reach their full potential.

Your indoor space may be limited to only 400 square feet in this tiny house but you’ll have 105 acres of dense Alabama woods and walking trails to explore at this eco-retreat. Adventure opportunities include floating the nearby river and meeting the property owner’s goats. With two queen-sized beds plus a twin futon and an extra twin mattress there’s enough bedding to accommodate the entire family. Be sure to stop into the main house to purchase a pizza kit or s’mores kit to enjoy by the fire.

Or follow us on Google News

The electric aircraft market feels a bit like the electric car market in 2005 or 2010. We have a handful of startups trying to get off the ground we have fun and exciting concept vehicles that will be available … someday and we have large legacy airplane makers dipping their toes in the waters with a variety of acquisitions partnership and R&D projects. One of the companies that has long flown pretty high above the crowd is Eviation.

We started covering Eviation in June 2017 if not earlier. This was before it had even unveiled “Alice” its first planned airplane. However concept drawings it used at the time look very similar to what it plans to bring to market next year. “Eviation believes a growing number of regional flight operators might take a certain liking to their electric aircraft” Nicolas Zart wrote at the time. “While most current electric aircraft are modified or converted regular gasoline planes Eviation decided to go another route — it decided to design its next aircraft electric from the get go. Designing from a blank slate allows for a review of every component as well as its relationship to the aircraft. In this case the airframe propeller and motor were highly maximized for flight efficiency which of course means that their energy usage was made more efficient.”

In 2018 the name was set — Alice — and the airplane was expected to have 9 seats. Nicolas interviewed Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay about the plans. “After spending minutes on the phone with Omer it was clear his passion for electric aviation makes Eviation Aircraft a serious contender in the electric aviation world.” He also opened up about some of the details:

“Omer says flying a business jet averages around $3000 per hour. An electric airplane slashes that cost by about 90%. Since an electric aircraft is 92 to 95% more efficient than its kerosene counterpart it also has to take into consideration the same weight when it lands. While this might sound puzzling modern airliners are designed to take off and land with the same full weight constraints in case of emergency. (If not I wouldn’t set foot in any.)

“I expected Omer to be vague with the battery specs but he told me all of this was achievable with a 400Wh/kg battery which is less than twice that of most modern prognostics. With 900 kWh the battery pack makes up 65% of the weight of the aircraft. The electric motors produce 3× 260 kW of power. This gives the Alice a service ceiling of 30000 ft (9144 m) and an approach landing speed of 100 knots.”

By May 2019 Eviation had selected the magniX magni250 propulsion system to power the airplane. Eviation’s ambition was to be the first company to offer a “fully operational” commuter electric plane. “With a maximum takeoff weight of 6350 kg (about 14000 lb) the Alice electric passenger aircraft should fly 650 miles (208 nm) cruising at about 240 knots (276 MPH) with a service ceiling of 30000 feet — enough to clear traffic on hour-long flights” Nicolas wrote.

“We have been successfully testing the magniX system with our Alice aircraft propeller for quite some time now with great results. We will begin manufacturing battery-powered fleets this year for our U.S. regional carrier customers with a value proposition that reduces their operating costs by up to 70 percent” Omer Bar-Yohay said. “In 2017 Americans spent $1 trillion traveling distances between 50 and 650 miles. Our goal is to undercut the cost of commuting by making middle mile trips cheaper faster and cleaner. Together with magniX we’re providing an economically and environmentally sustainable mobility solution that will forever change the face of aviation and consumer travel.”

A short time later in June 2019 right after unveiling the electric airplane in Paris Eviation had reportedly secured its first buyer Cape Air. “Although the scale of the purchase hasn’t been released a few sources are estimating the number to be as high as double-digit purchase options” Nicolas Zart wrote at the time. “Omer feels the Alice is ready to begin its flight testing period this year with an aim for certification by 2021. Eviation hopes to enter service by 2022.”

Was the company’s plan too ambitious? Seemingly not. In November 2020 Eviation said it was indeed on track to deliver its first Alice electric airplanes to customer in 2022. Yes that customer is still Cape Air which is a regional aircraft carrier in New England USA. Steve Hanley provided an update on the dream of the electric aviation startup. “Alice is built for regional flights up to 650 miles at a cruising speed of 276 mph. That covers journeys like from San Jose to San Diego or London to Prague. While conventional planes fly faster electric planes like Alice are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude quieter than commercial jet aircraft and could use shorter runways. Those factors mean they can fly into and out of smaller airports that are closer to travelers’ final destinations.”

“‘I think it’s important that the industry looks at its responsibilities to the planet and makes itself more sustainable in terms of emissions but it needs to work economically’ Bar-Yohay says. Alice costs about $200 per flight hour to operate. A turboprop with similar performance costs between $1200 and $2000 per flight hour meaning ticket prices for Alice could be substantially less than those for conventional aircraft. Lots of people might be delighted to add an hour or two to their flight if they can fly for half the money.”

That said — big claims and big dreams can trigger skepticism in others. “In the very beginning it was extremely difficult to convince partners clients anybody investors that we’re not delusional. Today it feels like everybody’s on board and this is where the industry should go. The industry is beginning to notice that there is really a tectonic shift here” Bar-Yohay told Business Insider.

All of that background brings us to this month’s news. A production version of Alice has been finalized. Eviation is approaching the runway! Its first flight is planned for later this year and the goal remains to deliver the first customer planes to Cape Air in 2022 — next year.

“Alice is a beautiful aircraft and represents the future of flying plain and simple” said Eviation Executive Chairman Roei Ganzarski. “Add in zero emissions less noise and significantly lower operating costs and communities will be connected like never before starting sooner than you think.”

Though apparently Cape Air also needs some time with the plane itself and use in commercial service is not expected until 2024. Whenever it is though I have to say that I’d like to be on that flight.

A date to many that may mean nothing.

A date to you that may mean something.

But it’s a date to me & the rest of Chicago that means…everything

My name is Frank Mustari. Better known as Frank The Clown in professional wrestling circles. For years I was that annoying rainbow wig that you’d see plastered ringside at countless WWE shows. Currently I am a manager/wrestler (for lack of a better term) on the independent wrestling scene. People do not like me. However I am not speaking to you today as Frank The Clown the character I am speaking to you today as Frank Mustari the 30-year-old wrestling fan who was born and raised in beautiful Chicago IL.

And this is my story about July 17th 2011. The night that wrestling & my life changed forever.

Wrestling at its very core is storytelling. It’s a live action art form. Good vs evil. Some stories are certainly better than others but every once in a while the universe aligns itself perfectly to tell a story that will live on far beyond its years. Perhaps the greatest instance of this was in the summer of 2011.

The first half of 2011 in pro wrestling was actually quite eventful. We witnessed a 40-man Royal Rumble some shocking returns and an untimely retirement. Unbeknownst to us the fans another historic story was brewing behind the scenes.

On June 20th 2011 shockwaves were sent throughout the wrestling world when one of its biggest stars made it public that his contract with WWE was expiring on July 17th. Remember that little thing I said about the universe aligning perfectly? July 17 2011 just so happened to be the Money in The Bank pay-per-view emanating from the Allstate Arena in Rosemont IL the hometown of…CM Punk.

I’m not here to give you a history lesson but it’s important to get the full scope of the story arc as it leads to the match. I’d be remiss not to mention that this story was only built on camera for the better part of four weeks. In that time Punk went from one of the guys…to THE guy. A metamorphosis that does not happen often.

On June 27th 2011 Punk dropped the infamous pipebomb in Las Vegas which I am proud to admit that I can legitimately recite word for word. It was a promo unlike those we have seen before where a man pulled back the curtain broke the proverbial fourth wall and aired out real-life grievances on air for the world to listen. It was captivating. This catapulted Punk to superstardom not only in the wrestling world but even into the mainstream something that professional wrestling still struggles to do to this day.

On July 10th six days before the PPV ironically in John Cena’s hometown of Boston Massachusetts Punk and Cena had their final faceoff. An underrated episode of RAW Punk opened the show after a one week “hiatus” where he continued to acknowledge the impending expiration of his contract and that he would be leaving the company with Vince McMahon’s prized possession the WWE Championship. In order to prevent such a tragedy from happening to him Vince added the stipulation that if John Cena loses in Chicago he would be fired thus raising the stakes even more.

Thus the stage had been set.

July 17th 2011.

Money in the Bank at The Allstate Arena.

Rosemont IL.

The WWE Champion the face of the company the franchise player John Cena would be defending his championship against a punk rock kid from Chicago the Second City Savior and the man who represented the people our people…CM Punk.

July 17th was a roller coaster of emotions for 20-year-old Frank. For many years I would generally wait until the day of the show to purchase my tickets. Many times premium seats would be released as production finalizes and I would be there to scoop them up sometimes mere minutes before showtime. Call me Kenny Rogers because I am most certainly a gambler but this gamble did not always pay off as I hoped. There were many instances where I’d wind up in the nosebleeds far far away from where I wanted to be. I made the 20-minute trek from my northwest suburban Chicago home to the Allstate Arena box office early in the afternoon to set up shop and begin my ticket hunt knowing it’d be an uphill battle as the buzz for this event was at a fever pitch. The show was rapidly approaching a sellout the resale market was scarce and little ole me showed up empty-handed hoping for the best.

To put this in perspective Punk has been my hero for my entire adolescent/adult life dating back to the early 2000’s before he broke into the WWE. Through Punk I discovered the straight edge lifestyle which I still live by to this day. I discovered Punk at a formulative stage of my life thus he was one of my biggest influences to shape me into the individual I am today and I am proud of it.

On the contrary John Cena was my 1B to Punk’s 1A. I was not ashamed to be a Cena fan at a time where it was sometimes shameful to be one. This match had happened a few times before where there was minimal fanfare but to have what were my two favorite wrestlers engaged in the story of the year in my backyard of Chicago was my true dream match scenario.

The stakes were not only high later that night in the arena but they were at an all-time high in the dingy stuffy Allstate Arena box office. Time ticked by as I checked over and over again if any floor seats had been released. I had befriended the box office attendants to increase my slim chances. I was dead set on having a premium seat as I was spoiled at the time and couldn’t imagine myself sitting elsewhere. 3 PM comes and goes. 4 PM comes and goes. 5 PM comes and go and still…no tickets. I see familiar face after familiar face passing by excitedly picking up their tickets and heading inside the venue with no worry in the world. Meanwhile neurotic Frank is biting off his last fingernail.

We are about an hour out from showtime and still no ticket. Now I’m being posed with the harsh reality that I may not even be getting into this show period let alone a floor seat. As the clock ticks a ticket scalper sent from the ticket heavens above approaches me and two of my friends and offers us a set of three front row seats that he had left over. We immediately purchase the seats I quickly applied XXX in red face paint on my face propped on my wig and sprinted in the building. As spoiled as this sounds (I was a child) these were not my “ideal” front row seats as they were stationed in the corner of the floor and in the middle of the row but regardless beggars can’t be choosers.

Section 1 Row 1 Seat 7.

The Allstate Arena is known for its acoustics & its raucous crowd so the atmosphere is always electric but this night was…different. It felt special when you walked in. You could feel the palatable energy flowing through the building. This wasn’t going to be your run-of-the-mill “B” level WWE pay per view this was going to be a spectacle unlike anything we had seen before.

Chants of “CM PUNK” rained down through the building even before the PPV went on the air. Opposing chants of “LET’S GO CENA” “CENA SUCKS” echoed but this wasn’t your typical 50/50 split this was most overwhelming anti-Cena crowd that I have ever been a part of.

The show began and right away the tone was set for the night as Daniel Bryan surprisingly won the MITB ladder match to open the show. This entire show is awesome. I do think most forget about that as we tend to romanticize the main event but we witnessed two awesome MITB ladder matches an incredible World Heavyweight Championship match between Randy Orton & Christian along with some other bangers that kept the crowd on the edge of its seat throughout the night. That still didn’t stop Chicago from still chanting for Punk at every opportunity they could. We couldn’t control our excitement and quite frankly we couldn’t control our anxiety.

What was going to happen? Is this Punk’s swan song? Are we going to see an uneventful main event with John Cena AA’ing Punk for a three count and we go home disappointed but yet not surprised? Far too often we hold the answers to the questions we have about wrestling storylines but on this night not one person in that crowd had any idea what was about to happen.

It was time.

The undercard had passed and it was time for the main event. An incredible video package rolls recapping the story leading up to this. In my extremely biased opinion it still holds up as one of the best video packages of all time. The crowd was waiting to explode.

As a production dork I loved that the video package ends and there’s a good ten-second pause where the crowd begins some of the loudest CM Punk chants that have ever existed. At our peak of chanting the guitar riff for “This Fire Burns” hits and the Allstate Arena goes banana.

It’s rare to hear a unison “YEAH!” that is so loud that it blares over the music but in this case it absolutely drowned out Killswitch Engage for a split second. It was equivalent of 15000 proverbial pipebombs.

Slowly OUR guy emerges from behind the curtain. Sporting a brand-new t-shirt that I previously secured earlier in the night that would wind up being exclusive to that show with the date and “Chicago” written on the back. The mass-produced version did not include that thus making it one of the rarer WWE shirts in the past 20 years.

Punk strolls out as braggadocios as ever with a smirk on his face and he enters his domain. From my perch in the front row I am seen clapping my hands together so hard that my hands probably matched the redness of my face paint.

In this moment I was overcome with emotion. This was the culmination of Punk’s life’s work…all in front of family friends and 15000 of the most rabid & passionate hometown supporters you can find. The magnitude of this moment was indescribable.

For me this was the culmination of my wrestling fandom as my hero is approaching the ring in this high-intensity situation in our backyard to face another hero of mine in a match that would change the course of pro wrestling forever. I wish I could bottle up the way I felt in that moment and mass produce it because it was pure unadulterated joy. Tears rolled down my face as I knew how much this moment probably meant to him and I felt how much it meant to me.

It was in that precise moment that I told myself I wanted to make others feel the way that I felt right then & there. Everything about that entrance was real. It was raw hometown emotion where everyone in that building believed in something or in this case someone. In our world nowadays it’s hard to find two people believing in one thing together let alone an entire city.

Punk made his stroll to the ring and the crowd somehow managed to get louder as he walked up the steps climbed the turnbuckle and let out an explicit battle cry. He proceeded to sit down in the middle of the ring as per usual and let the chants pour in from every direction. I have never to this day heard a wrestling crowd as loud as that one in that very moment.

Eventually his music cuts which is the crowd’s cue to be even louder than before and in one of my favorite moments Punk suddenly jumps up from sitting to a huge pop that makes me smile every single time. Now we awaited his adversary…John Cena.

I love John Cena. I had never booed John Cena before this night.

On July 17th 2011 I booed the fuck out of John Cena.

It obviously had nothing to do with Cena as a performer you could have put Michael Jordan across the ring from Punk in Chicago that night & even he might have been booed. You could have put 50 puppies in the ring opposite of Punk and we would have heard a “PUPPIES SUCK” chant. It was Punk or bust for us. Cena was the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Cena was all business as the chorus of boos serenaded him. Big Match John had the body language and the mannerisms to back up that this was going to be a FIGHT.

The bell rang the match begins. The match itself had more twists and turns than a roller coaster at Great America. Both men took us for a ride and we were fully invested. They were puppet masters toying with our emotions for what felt like hours. What probably made the match even better is that most of us deep down assumed Cena was going to win which in turn made every near fall that much better and there were some incredible ones.

Punk used the hometown crowd to his advantage by egging on the “YOU CAN’T WRESTLE” chants directed at Cena. He slapped hands with friends and family in the front row and clearly fed off the passion from the crowd elevating his intensity and game to another level.

For 33 minutes the two men exchanged blow after blow shot after shot and left it all in the ring. There was not one singular moment that the crowd wasn’t hanging on every move throughout this masterclass.

And then it happened.

As John Cena had Punk locked in his STF for what seemed like the finish Vince McMahon and John Laurinaitis walk down the ramp and signal for the bell to end the match. Cena sees this slides out of the squared circle and cleans Johnny Ace’s clock with a forearm before declaring to Mr. McMahon that “the best man wins this fight.”

Upon reentering the ring Cena is met by Punk who lifts him for another GTS and connects! Pinfall…

1…

2…

3!!!

Holy shit.

CM Punk Is the WWE Champion.

The crowd is going bonkers. Pure euphoria & elation. Grown men were hugging and jumping up and down. Strangers were embracing each other. Children were screaming in horror.

I legitimately jumped so high and lost complete control of my limbs that I actually knocked the padding off the barricade in front of me thus startling the poor security guard.

I couldn’t believe what I had just witnessed. The importance of it didn’t set in right away but everyone knew they just witnessed something special that we would never ever forget. Chicago is a proud city and we were so damn proud of our guy.

It was…magic.

When pro wrestling is good its fucking great. I’m unsure if there was anything that could have been done to make this even better than it was. I was actually relieved it was over so I could attempt to recover physically and emotionally. I vividly remember telling those around me that I felt like I had wrestled a near 40-minute match when it was all said and done.

The night wasn’t over yet though as just as we thought we had a moment to recover and celebrate out comes Alberto Del Rio to be a party pooper but he was quickly dismissed by a swift kick to the head.

Remember that line earlier about the universe aligning again? And the story about my ticket and how it came to be? And that part of me was disappointed by the location of my seat because I’m a spoiled prick?

Would you believe me if I told you that following the kick that time stood still as Punk & Vince locked eyes? Would you believe me if I told you that Punk proceeds to exit the ring and makes a beeline straight towards Sec 1 Row 1 Seat 7? Well that fucking happened.

Punk proceeds to climb and sit on the barricade and blow the most infamous kiss in wrestling history while a 20-year-old Frank The Clown is feet away forever enshrined in one of the most iconic wrestling photos of all time. (That’s the main image we used for this column. Here’s a video clip too.)

Everything happened so fast that I didn’t even time to react or comprehend what just happened. Punk disappeared into the crowd and my brain just told me to run after him so after he leaves the camera shot I disappear right behind him. I followed the mob of bodies to the staircase to head towards the concourse as Punk escaped through his hometown crowd with the most prestigious championship in all of wrestling in tow and headed off into the lovely Chicago night.

Vince stood on the ring steps right in front of me as he watched in sheer horror at what was unfolding. The show went off the air once Punk left and the psychopathic crowd turned their attention towards the Chairman. A chant broke out of “SCREW YOU VINCE!”

Vince slowly descended down the steps and was staring straight into my soul. I was suddenly engaged in an intense stare down with the most powerful man in wrestling and despite that I continued to scream “SCREW YOU VINCE” as loud as my malnourished body would allow me to at that particular point in time. I would love to see that footage because it was ten seconds that truly felt like an eternity. My heart was beating out of my chest.

After Vince stepped away and made his way up the ramp and back through the curtain the show was finally over. My red face paint was bleeding down my cheeks looking reminiscent of spaghetti sauce. My shirt and tie were untucked my wig was disheveled but I felt more alive than I had ever felt in my life up until that point.

Looking back on that night it almost makes me sad in a way. Sad because I don’t think anything can top that night for me personally. It was the perfect storm of circumstances that only happens once in a lifetime.

I have gone back and relived that match over and over again. It’s one of the few wrestling matches that my girlfriend will actually put her phone down and re-watch with me. It’s the first match I show to non-wrestling fans when I try to explain to them what makes wrestling so special. It’s perfect.

As I type this on July 17th 2021 at 3:53 AM Chicago time I am preparing for a moment of my own tonight. Exactly 10 years to the day that I realized I wanted to be in the business of making people feel alive I am involved in the main event of a wrestling show named Warrior Wrestling in you guessed it Chicago IL in front of my family and friends. I will be honoring that match and that night with special gear that will be a direct nod to Punk. I’ve always felt this strange connection to Punk where our lives have run parallel in so many weird ways. We have the same birthday for fuck’s sake.

If all that is not full circle then I don’t know what is.

A lot can happen in ten years and the impact from that match is still felt today. Pro wrestling took a turn towards a more grounded “reality” era because of that story. The Summer of Punk went into full swing and wound up becoming one of the most successful runs in wrestling history. That match set the bar for the next decade. It was story telling at its finest and what creative should strive to try and recreate by any means necessary.

Monday Night RAW will take place inside the Allstate Arena on August 2nd. I can guarantee there will be CM Punk chants throughout the night but not because we are bored but because Chicago remembers that fateful night and Chicago will continue to honor that night and the man who helped change the course of pro wrestling. And on a much smaller scale the night and the man who changed the course of a young Frank The Clown’s life forever.

Happy July 17th y’all.

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nb29nLXN0b2NrLWNvbnRpbnVlLWltcHJlc3NpdmUtZ3Jvd3RoLTA4MTM0MDUyOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can GOOG Stock Continue its Impressive Growth?,"Search engine behemoth Alphabet (GOOG) has grown into a formidable tech superstar in the matter of a couple of decades. Since the company’s IPO in 2004 shares of GOOG stock have been a 50-bagger for patient investors. Indeed that kind of growth is hard to come by with any stock over such a long time frame. Accordingly an easy case can be made for long-term investors to continue holding this growth gem in their core portfolios in the decades to come.

As a tech giant Alphabet’s core search business has become large enough to warrant regulatory scrutiny. We’ll get to some of the ramifications of this in a minute. However investors who remain keen on Alphabet continue to believe that bigger is better in the monopolistic search engine space.

Google’s growth segments such as the company’s cloud division are where investors have been placing increasing emphasis lately. Indeed other than Chinese tech giants Alibaba (BABA) Tencent (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU) Google is among the fastest-growing cloud players globally and catching up to U.S. rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Let’s dive into whether this segment will be enough to take Alphabet over the psychologically-important $2 trillion market cap level soon. (See Alphabet stock charts)

Google's Cloud Growth Impressive But Coming at a Cost

Alphabet has grown its cloud business to an impressive size. According to the company’s recent financial statements Alphabet’s cloud division grew 46% year-over-year in the company’s latest quarter. Cloud revenues of $4 billion were substantial but made up only 7.3% of the company’s overall revenue for the quarter.

Indeed Alphabet’s Google search engine business is still the economic engine of the company. Google (net YouTube) generated 82% of Alphabet’s overall revenue. Accordingly this is still by and large the business segment that matters particularly from an earnings standpoint.

Google’s cloud business is growing in importance for Alphabet but remains highly unprofitable. The company lost $974 million in earning its $4 billion in revenue this past quarter. The reality is Alphabet is still buying market share in the cloud space. Until the company is able to scale up this business to a level where it can compete on quality rather than price this is likely to be the case.

However like many of Alphabet’s unprofitable businesses such as those included in Alphabet’s “Other Bets” category (which lost even more money) investors remain bullish on Alphabet’s ability to monetize these businesses well as it has done with YouTube. Time will ultimately tell how profitable Google’s rising prevalence in cloud computing will be. All in all should margins begin to expand significantly in this segment investors can expect to see significant gains over time.

Is Alphabet’s Size Becoming a Problem?

Bigger is usually better in the corporate world. Economies of scale and margin improvements over time combined with a durable competitive advantage (moat) is what every company is after. In many respects Alphabet’s Google segment enjoys these benefits right now.

However regulatory concerns are starting to rear their ugly head with this company. In the U.S. Alphabet has become one of the punching bags for regulators in recent years. The U.K. is probing Google and Amazon over fake reviews. Additionally investors may recall that pesky ruling in France where Alphabet was slapped with a 220 million euro fine for abusing its market power.

Anti-monopolistic crackdowns are happening all around the world as governments look to rein in big tech. China’s incredible crackdown on its own tech leaders has shown how painful such a targeted crackdown can be.

For investors in Alphabet these concerns are likely easy to ignore. On the one hand regulatory risks are certainly worth pricing in. After all the government calls the shots with respect to how large it allows companies to get.

On the other hand the U.S. and most free-market countries have proven to defer to technological innovation in most cases. Additionally fines of a few hundred million dollars are really nothing to a company like Alphabet which generates tens of billions of operating income every year.

For now these are risks investors should be watching and keep an eye on. However the camp that remains firm in its stance that regulatory concerns are either immaterial or non-existent seems to be correct at least thus far.

What Analysts are Saying about GOOG Stock

According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus GOOG stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 10 analyst ratings there are 10 Buy recommendations.

As for price targets the average GOOG price target is $2741.67. Analyst price targets range from a low of $2510.00 per share to a high of $2900.00 per share.

Google stock forecast

Bottom Line on GOOG

Alphabet remains a world-class tech company with tremendous growth potential over the long-run. That said valuations are getting stretched today in the mega-cap tech space so investors may want to be cautious when considering adding to their positions.

Regardless those holding onto shares of GOOG stock really don’t have any reason to sell. Getting any sort of reasonable return in this market requires taking on some level of risk. Indeed today Alphabet appears to be one of the lower-risk bets in the high tech space today.

Can the internet be delivered by balloon?

Yes. For years Alphabet — the parent company of Google — worked to perfect an internet-balloon division service called Loon. It shut down that project in January saying it wasn't commercially viable.

Prior to the shutdown Loon balloons had been providing service in mountainous areas in Kenya through a partnership with a local telecom Telkom Kenya. The service also helped provide wireless communications in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria which destroyed the island's mobile network. Loon partnered with AT&T to make service available.

How does that work?

The Loon balloons were effectively cell towers the size of a tennis court. They floated 60000 to 75000 feet or 11 to 14 miles (18000- 23000 meters or 18-22 kilometers) above the Earth well above commercial jetliner routes. Made of the commonplace plastic polyethylene the balloons used solar panels for electricity and could deliver service to smartphones in partnership with a local telecom.

Each balloon could serve thousands of people the company said. But they had to be replaced every five months or so because of the harsh conditions in the stratosphere. And the balloons could be difficult to control. ""Navigating balloons through the stratosphere has always been hard"" wrote Salvatore Candido who had been chief technology officer for Loon in a December 2020 blog post. The company created algorithms that tracked wind patterns.

What equipment was required?

Loon had said that beyond the balloons themselves it needed network integration with a telecom to provide service and some equipment on the ground in the region. It also needed permission from local regulators — something that the Cuban government isn't likely to grant.

Could a network be set up from afar?

Yes. Loon used multiple balloons to extend connections beyond the necessary ground link. In one 2018 test Loon said the connection jumped 1000 kilometers or about 620 miles over 7 balloons. Another time it bridged a wireless connection over 600 kilometers or about 370 miles between two balloons. Cuba and Florida are only about 100 miles (160 kilometers) apart at their closest.

Is that feasible?

DeSantis promoted the balloon idea Thursday alongside two Cuban-American members of Congress from the Miami area Reps. Maria Salazar and Carlos Gimenez FCC commissioner Brendan Carr and Cuban-American lawyer businessman and museum director Marcell Felipe.

Felipe said he has been talking for about two years with a defense contractor who could deploy such balloons in a cost-effective way in airspace near Cuba but declined to name the company.

In comments to The Associated Press Felipe claimed it wouldn't be feasible for the Cuban government to block these balloon-delivered signals ""in any significant manner'' though he didn't cite any evidence.

None of the supporters provided a cost estimate. Salazar said that if the federal government endorsed the plan she believes it could be funded entirely with contributions from members of the Cuban diaspora if necessary.

What is internet access like in cuba?

Internet access in Cuba has been expensive and relatively rare until recently. Starting in December 2018 Cubans could get internet access on their phones through the state telecom monopoly. More than half of Cubans today have internet access.

But the Cuban government restricts independent media and censors what's available to Cubans online according to Human Rights Watch. It disrupts internet access in an attempt to head off protests.

Since the company’s IPO in 2004 shares of GOOG stock have been a 50-bagger for patient investors. Indeed that kind of growth is hard to come by with any stock over such a long time frame. Accordingly an easy case can be made for long-term investors to continue holding this growth gem in their core portfolios in the decades to come.

As a tech giant Alphabet’s core search business has become large enough to warrant regulatory scrutiny. We’ll get to some of the ramifications of this in a minute. However investors who remain keen on Alphabet continue to believe that bigger is better in the monopolistic search engine space.

Google’s growth segments such as the company’s cloud division are where investors have been placing increasing emphasis lately. Indeed other than Chinese tech giants Alibaba (BABA) Tencent (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU) Google is among the fastest-growing cloud players globally and catching up to U.S. rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Let’s dive into whether this segment will be enough to take Alphabet over the psychologically-important $2 trillion market cap level soon. (See Alphabet stock charts)

Google's Cloud Growth Impressive But Coming at a Cost

Alphabet has grown its cloud business to an impressive size. According to the company’s recent financial statements Alphabet’s cloud division grew 46% year-over-year in the company’s latest quarter. Cloud revenues of $4 billion were substantial but made up only 7.3% of the company’s overall revenue for the quarter.

Indeed Alphabet’s Google search engine business is still the economic engine of the company. Google (net YouTube) generated 82% of Alphabet’s overall revenue. Accordingly this is still by and large the business segment that matters particularly from an earnings standpoint.

Google’s cloud business is growing in importance for Alphabet but remains highly unprofitable. The company lost $974 million in earning its $4 billion in revenue this past quarter. The reality is Alphabet is still buying market share in the cloud space. Until the company is able to scale up this business to a level where it can compete on quality rather than price this is likely to be the case.

However like many of Alphabet’s unprofitable businesses such as those included in Alphabet’s “Other Bets” category (which lost even more money) investors remain bullish on Alphabet’s ability to monetize these businesses well as it has done with YouTube. Time will ultimately tell how profitable Google’s rising prevalence in cloud computing will be. All in all should margins begin to expand significantly in this segment investors can expect to see significant gains over time.

Is Alphabet’s Size Becoming a Problem?

Bigger is usually better in the corporate world. Economies of scale and margin improvements over time combined with a durable competitive advantage (moat) is what every company is after. In many respects Alphabet’s Google segment enjoys these benefits right now.

However regulatory concerns are starting to rear their ugly head with this company. In the U.S. Alphabet has become one of the punching bags for regulators in recent years. The U.K. is probing Google and Amazon over fake reviews. Additionally investors may recall that pesky ruling in France where Alphabet was slapped with a 220 million euro fine for abusing its market power.

Anti-monopolistic crackdowns are happening all around the world as governments look to rein in big tech. China’s incredible crackdown on its own tech leaders has shown how painful such a targeted crackdown can be.

For investors in Alphabet these concerns are likely easy to ignore. On the one hand regulatory risks are certainly worth pricing in. After all the government calls the shots with respect to how large it allows companies to get.

On the other hand the U.S. and most free-market countries have proven to defer to technological innovation in most cases. Additionally fines of a few hundred million dollars are really nothing to a company like Alphabet which generates tens of billions of operating income every year.

For now these are risks investors should be watching and keep an eye on. However the camp that remains firm in its stance that regulatory concerns are either immaterial or non-existent seems to be correct at least thus far.

What Analysts are Saying about GOOG Stock

According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus GOOG stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 10 analyst ratings there are 10 Buy recommendations.

As for price targets the average GOOG price target is $2741.67. Analyst price targets range from a low of $2510.00 per share to a high of $2900.00 per share.

Google stock forecast

Bottom Line on GOOG

Alphabet remains a world-class tech company with tremendous growth potential over the long-run. That said valuations are getting stretched today in the mega-cap tech space so investors may want to be cautious when considering adding to their positions.

Regardless those holding onto shares of GOOG stock really don’t have any reason to sell. Getting any sort of reasonable return in this market requires taking on some level of risk. Indeed today Alphabet appears to be one of the lower-risk bets in the high tech space today.

Can the internet be delivered by balloon?

Yes. For years Alphabet — the parent company of Google — worked to perfect an internet-balloon division service called Loon. It shut down that project in January saying it wasn't commercially viable.

Prior to the shutdown Loon balloons had been providing service in mountainous areas in Kenya through a partnership with a local telecom Telkom Kenya. The service also helped provide wireless communications in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria which destroyed the island's mobile network. Loon partnered with AT&T to make service available.

How does that work?

The Loon balloons were effectively cell towers the size of a tennis court. They floated 60000 to 75000 feet or 11 to 14 miles (18000- 23000 meters or 18-22 kilometers) above the Earth well above commercial jetliner routes. Made of the commonplace plastic polyethylene the balloons used solar panels for electricity and could deliver service to smartphones in partnership with a local telecom.

Each balloon could serve thousands of people the company said. But they had to be replaced every five months or so because of the harsh conditions in the stratosphere. And the balloons could be difficult to control. ""Navigating balloons through the stratosphere has always been hard"" wrote Salvatore Candido who had been chief technology officer for Loon in a December 2020 blog post. The company created algorithms that tracked wind patterns.

What equipment was required?

Loon had said that beyond the balloons themselves it needed network integration with a telecom to provide service and some equipment on the ground in the region. It also needed permission from local regulators — something that the Cuban government isn't likely to grant.

Could a network be set up from afar?

Yes. Loon used multiple balloons to extend connections beyond the necessary ground link. In one 2018 test Loon said the connection jumped 1000 kilometers or about 620 miles over 7 balloons. Another time it bridged a wireless connection over 600 kilometers or about 370 miles between two balloons. Cuba and Florida are only about 100 miles (160 kilometers) apart at their closest.

Is that feasible?

But experts aren't sure it would be that easy to set up a guerrilla internet service for Cuba this way. It would need an unused band of spectrum or radio frequencies to transmit a connection to Cuba and spectrum use is typically controlled by national governments. Anyone trying this would have to find a free block of spectrum that wouldn't be interfered with said Jacob Sharony of Mobius Consulting a mobile and wireless consulting firm.

Balloon- or drone-powered networks aren't likely to be economical over the long term said Tim Farrar of TMF Associates a satellite communications consultant. While they're suitable for bridging communications amid disasters or in war zones the transmission capabilities of such networks isn't large — ""certainly not enough to serve the entire population of Cuba or anything like that"" Farrar said.

Another challenge: The Cuban government could also try to jam the signal.

Who is involved in the cuba effort?

DeSantis promoted the balloon idea Thursday alongside two Cuban-American members of Congress from the Miami area Reps. Maria Salazar and Carlos Gimenez FCC commissioner Brendan Carr and Cuban-American lawyer businessman and museum director Marcell Felipe.

Felipe said he has been talking for about two years with a defense contractor who could deploy such balloons in a cost-effective way in airspace near Cuba but declined to name the company.

Making money in the stock market is easy... if you own dividend stocks.

According to a report published by J.P. Morgan Asset Management in 2013 publicly traded companies that initiated and grew their payouts between 1972 and 2012 averaged an annual return of 9.5%. As for their non-dividend-paying peers average annual gains were a paltry 1.6% over the same 40-year period. Because dividend stocks are almost always profitable and time-tested they're logical candidates to make investors rich.

Ideally income seekers want the highest yield possible with the least amount of risk. However data shows that once yields cross about 4% yield and risk are tightly correlated. This is to say that ultra-high-yield companies usually prove to be more trouble than they're worth. Since yield is simply a function of payout relative to share price a failing or struggling operating model can trap income seekers with a high dividend yield.

But there's good news. The following five ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- which I'm arbitrarily defining as a yield of 7%+ -- have the potential to make their shareholders rich.

Annaly Capital Management: 10.3% yield

Arguably one of the safest ways to build wealth over the long run is to buy and hold the premier name among mortgage real estate investment trusts (REIT) Annaly Capital Management (NLY 0.81%). Annaly has paid out over $20 billion in dividends since its inception over two decades ago and it's averaged a roughly 10% yield over the past 20 years.

In simple terms Annaly seeks to borrow money at low short-term lending rates and uses that capital to purchase assets (mortgage-backed securities) with a higher long-term yield. The difference between this higher long-term yield and lower short-term borrowing rate is known as the net interest margin. The wider this margin the more profit Annaly has the potential to make. Historically mortgage REITs see their net interest margins widen noticeably during the early years of an economic recovery as the yield curve steepens. This means we're right in the sweet spot where mortgage REITs outperform.

The other key selling point for Annaly is that it's loaded its portfolio with agency securities ($92.6 billion of $100.4 billion in total assets). This is a way of saying that a vast majority of its assets are backed by the federal government in the event of a default. This added protection is what allows Annaly to wisely use leverage to its advantage in order to boost its profitability.

Enterprise Products Partners: 7.4% yield

Put plainly the idea of buying into an oil and gas stock following the shellacking the industry took during the pandemic is enough to make some long-term investors squirm. But ultra-high-yielding dividend midstream company Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.84%) was virtually unfazed by the pandemic -- as evidenced by its distribution coverage ratio not dropping below 1.6 -- and is riding a 22-year streak of increasing its base annual payout.

The biggest advantage Enterprise Products Partners holds for investors is its place within the energy complex. Midstream companies that provide the transmission and storage capacity for oil natural gas and natural gas liquids typically offer predictable cash flow no matter how well or poorly the economy is performing. Leaning on transparent fee-based contracts allows Enterprise to undertake projects without inadvertently harming its cash flow or profitability. The company currently has over 50000 miles of pipeline in the U.S. along with 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity.

The other factor fueling healthy distributions for Enterprise Products Partners is its willingness to spend on capital expenditures and acquisitions. Even though we're liable to witness energy companies steadily shift to greener solutions over time fossil fuels will remain a key source of energy production for decades to come.

Mobile TeleSystems: 11.1% yield

The high-water mark on this list in terms of yield is Russian telecom giant Mobile TeleSystems (MBT). Keep in mind that MTS as the company is known varies its dividend based on its operating performance. Nevertheless it's been consistently delivering a payout north of 7% annually.

Mobile TeleSystems' bread and butter will continue to be its wireless operations. Even though Russia is a highly saturated wireless market infrastructure upgrades are going to be key in driving organic growth higher. The introduction of 5G download speeds in Russia's major cities as well as the ongoing rollout of 4G in Russian suburbs should create a sustainable technology upgrade cycle that leads to increased data consumption -- and data is where wireless providers make their juiciest margins.

Beyond just the cash flow predictability associated with its wireless operations MTS also has a number of rapidly growing new verticals including MTS Bank paid TV and cloud services to name a few. Over just the past year Active paying TV users rose 54% to 7.1 million with over-the-top customers nearly tripling to 2.9 million. Meanwhile cloud services revenue rose 28% from the year-ago quarter. Though these segments aren't contributing a lot of revenue now they'll likely play an important role in the company's long-term growth prospects.

AGNC Investment Corp.: 8.8% yield

Have I mentioned that the mortgage REIT industry is hitting its stride? In addition to putting your money to work in industry leader Annaly its veritable sidekick AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC 1.15%) has a really good chance to outperform and make its shareholders rich. Since going public roughly 13 years ago AGNC's yield pretty much hasn't dipped below 8%.

Just like Annaly AGNC has aligned its portfolio to take advantage of agency mortgage-backed securities. Excluding to-be-announced securities the company held $62.1 billion of agency-backed residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) in the first quarter. That compares to less than $500 million in non-agency RMBS and $1.1 billion in credit-risk transfer securities. Without getting overly technical only around 3% of total assets are in potentially risky long-term assets which is what's led to a steady stream of dividend income for shareholders.

And there's a bonus that awaits AGNC's investors. Whereas the other companies on this list pay their dividends quarterly or twice a year AGNC doles out its dividend of $0.12 on a monthly basis. If the U.S. economy continues to gain steam and the yield curve steepens this payout and the company's book value have room to expand.

Altria Group: 7.3% yield

Last but not least consider putting brand-name tobacco stock Altria Group (MO 0.95%) to work in your portfolio. Since 1972 Altria share price appreciation plus dividend have returned greater than 2600000% for its shareholders according to data from YCharts.

With its focus on the U.S. market the bulk of Altria's revenue is derived from the sale of premium cigarette brand Marlboro. Although cigarette shipment volume has been on a fairly steady decline over the years as the negative health impacts of smoking have coerced some users to quit the addictive nature of nicotine has also allowed Altria to boost the price for its premium products. These price hikes usually make up for the decline in cigarette shipments.

Altria is also focused on life beyond tobacco cigarettes. It's offering a line of smokeless tobacco products in select cities and it owns a 45% stake in Canadian marijuana stock Cronos Group. If the U.S. were to ever legalize cannabis at the federal level Altria would almost certainly become a favorite in the U.S. to develop a leading cannabis vape product with Cronos.

Even though it's not the growth stock it once was Altria's heavy dose of share buybacks and exceptional pricing power make it a dividend stock with all the potential to make its shareholders rich.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvdXMtbWF5LWV4dGluZ3Vpc2gtdGhlLWp1dWwtaW4tdGhlLXZhcGluZy1jcm93bi1tMDBmYmI4MDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US may extinguish the Juul in the vaping crown,"Juul was once the hottest start-up in Silicon Valley. In 2018 the vaping pioneer became the youngest company to achieve a market value of $10 billion (£7 billion) as its vape pens flew off the shelves.

Later that year tobacco giant Altria which sells Marlboro in the US bought a 35 per cent stake valuing the three-year-old firm at $38 billion and turning its co-founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen into billionaires.

Now the US safety regulator wants to force Amazon to recall those products. This past week it sued the company in a case that could be the latest to hold Amazon accountable for products offered by its third-party sellers. But here’s the thing: Amazon has already recalled these specific products. They’re no longer for sale.

Amazon says and the CPSC acknowledges that the giant retailer has already stopped selling these products already notified their buyers and already handed out refunds.

Here’s the initial statement Amazon provided to The Verge:

Customer safety is a top priority and we take prompt action to protect customers when we are aware of a safety concern. As the CPSC’s own complaint acknowledges for the vast majority of the products in question Amazon already immediately removed the products from our store notified customers about potential safety concerns advised customers to destroy the products and provided customers with full refunds. For the remaining few products in question the CPSC did not provide Amazon with enough information for us to take action and despite our requests CPSC has remained unresponsive. Amazon has an industry-leading recalls program and we have further offered to expand our capabilities to handle recalls for all products sold in our store regardless of whether those products were sold or fulfilled by Amazon or third-party sellers. We are unclear as to why the CPSC has rejected that offer or why they have filed a complaint seeking to force us to take actions almost entirely duplicative of those we’ve already taken.

What’s actually going on here? We spoke to the CPSC and it claims there’s a few big problems with the way Amazon’s handling the issue. Primarily that the CPSC would have to take Amazon’s word that the recall is being handled and that these dangerous products are actually being destroyed.

In the statement Amazon says that the CPSC rejected its offer to work together on this issue and it seems like that might be true — because Amazon’s offer was a “proposed recalls pledge” that would let online marketplaces handle recalls themselves. Here’s the proposal Amazon sent the CPSC on May 6th:

The CPSC originally suggested to us that pledge wasn’t a legally binding agreement either — it might have to take Amazon’s word that it would for instance provide regular reports about the progress of a recall so the CPSC can follow up. If Amazon didn’t adequately tell customers how to destroy dangerous products or how to ship them back at no charge the CPSC might not be able to take action.

Amazon suggests that’s not true though. “Amazon proposed an agreement that would be legally binding and that was developed and agreed upon with the CPSC staff” it tells The Verge. The retailer says it worked “hand-in-hand” with the CPSC through this entire process used a recall template that “we discussed and agreed upon with the CPSC staff” and suggests it doesn’t understand why the CPSC changed its mind.

Neither Amazon nor the CPSC would let The Verge see a copy of their proposed agreement but Amazon did give us copies of the recall notices it sent to customers. One example:

Amazon says there’s a simple reason you don’t see any mention of returns: “Amazon did not require the return of these products before issuing a refund because CPSC had not asked us to and because such a step is unusual for recalls of these product types” Amazon tells The Verge.

It’s about the long game too

There are bigger things at stake than the recalls of these specific products though. CPSC’s move is also about finding the authority to force recalls on broad online seller marketplaces like Amazon to begin with marketplaces which weren’t around at the time the laws were written — that way it wouldn’t always need to rely on Amazon being willing to comply. CPSC acting chairman Robert Adler hints at this difficulty in a statement (PDF) issued alongside the complaint: “for every product which CPSC determines a recall is necessary a lengthy negotiation must first take place about the threshold question of whether that sales platform is even subject to our laws.”

The CPSC says its existing statute gives it legal authority when it comes to importers distributors and manufacturers and it’s now arguing the way Amazon handles its “Fulfilled by Amazon” products clearly makes it a distributor under the law.

“We are seeking Amazon to be responsible for the ‘fulfilled by Amazon’ products on their site; Amazon does not see themselves legally responsible for these products. We assert Amazon has legal responsibility as a distributor for the safety of these products” the CPSC tells The Verge adding “We are eager to collaborate with them on details of a recall.”

Amazon of course doesn’t want to be categorized as a distributor:

We disagree with CPSC’s assertion that we are a distributor under this statute and our perspective was reinforced by Chairman Adler’s statement. However more importantly Amazon has always believed that we have an obligation to our customers to provide the safest shopping experience. This is why Amazon has messaged customers and covered the cost of refunds when selling partners failed to engage with regulators about recalls. We did this for the products noted in the lawsuit and worked with CPSC staff to finalize an agreement that would establish a new-norm for recalls of third-party products. We are unclear as to why the CPSC Commission rejected that offer particularly as its staff worked hand-in-hand with us to develop it.

If this does get dragged out in the courts the CPSC says it might take many years to conclude with previous forced recalls taking five to seven years on average. The first step is getting the case in front of an administrative law judge (of which the CPSC says it doesn’t have any of its own) after which Amazon may have several opportunities to appeal first to the CPSC itself and then in the federal courts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9hbWF6b24tbGlnaHRzYWls0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Lightsail review,"Amazon Lightsail is an excellent budget-friendly choice for small businesses and well-versed webmasters from the software industry who are able to get things done without a helping hand.

Amazon Lightsail (a part of AWS which is short for Amazon Web Services) started out in 2016 and (as its name implies) is a subsidiary of Amazon a multinational technology company from the USA. Besides being a market behemoth its objective is to provide all-in-one and easy-to-use virtual private servers (VPS) to all that are in need of them and wherever they are to put it simply.

The company is headquartered in the USA although it has offices and (more importantly) data centers all over the globe. These include 80 availability zones within 25 different geographic regions including three locations in the USA (Virginia Ohio and Oregon) one in central Canada five in Europe (two in the UK and one of each in Germany France and Sweden) and five in Asia-Pacific (Australia Japan South Korea Singapore and India). AWS also announced its plans to expand to 15 more availability zones inside 5 regions and to support more coverage in Australia Indonesia India Spain and Switzerland.

Amazon offers a wide variety of VPS hosting plans for Linux and Windows (Image credit: Amazon)

Plans and pricing

Along with many providers of the same caliber Amazon Lightsail hosting plans are billed using an on-demand hourly rate and as a result you pay only for what you use. For each of their plans you decide to use you will be charged the fixed hourly price which can only go up to the maximum monthly plan cost.

The most budget-friendly option with Amazon Lightsail will cost you $3.50 per month (with Linux/Unix) and it includes 512 MB of memory 1 core processor up to 20GB of disk space (SSD) and 1TB of data transfer allowance (the limit is lower in Indian and Australian region at 0.5 TB).

Currently there are seven different-sized VPS plans for Linux (ranging from $3.50 to $160 per month) and the same number for Windows (from $8 to $240 for a month). Here you can also purchase containers managed databases CDN load balancer and block storage.

Amazon Lightsail also provides a free trial with the least-expensive plans for Linux and Windows and they are valid for 750 hours. However be careful not to exceed the monthly limits because that is the point at which the word ""free” will begin to lose its meaning. In other words you'll have to pay by the standard pay-as-you-go service rates.

As one might expect there is no money-back guarantee but you can cancel Amazon Lightsail's services at any time and pay for the past usage only.

Methods of payment with Amazon Lightsail include all major credit cards ACH direct debit (for customers from the USA) and SEPA direct debit (for customers from Europe). Oddly enough (and to the dissatisfaction of a number of their users) PayPal is not available.

Ease of use

To start your story with Amazon Lightsail you'll have to create your AWS account or log in if you already have one. What is important is that by signing up you can get an entire year of free tier access which includes a free trial of Amazon Lightsail's hosting packages (both for Linux and Windows) for a period of one month.

Creating an AWS account runs as smoothly as possible although it will require some time and a bit more personal information and involvement than one might expect. This includes providing your full name home address telephone number postal code all payment details and so forth. You’ll also be required to confirm your identity through verification via mobile phone where you can decide between a text message and a voice call.

After this you can finally choose a hosting plan and if you want to make use of their free trial before making further commitment you’ll have to opt for a basic one.

You can create either a Linux or Windows instance and have it set up with a CMS or other apps (Image credit: Amazon)

Amazon Lightsail’s interface is stripped down to the simplest form and is consequently inviting intuitive and incredibly user-friendly. All you need to do is click on “Create instance” and decide on the details about your virtual server. These include picking a location (the nearest one will be marked) making a choice between Linux/Unix and Microsoft Windows deciding if you want to have apps included and which of those you want to come pre-installed and configured for you.

If you want to make a WordPress site here is where you can mark it to make things easier for yourselves. Besides WordPress you can select from LAMP Joomla Magento MEAN Node.js Nginx Durpal GitLab CE Redmine Nginx and Plesk Hosting Stack on Ubuntu. In addition you can add a launch script change your SSH key pair or add automatic snapshots (point-in-time backups).

In conclusion you'll name your instance click on ""create“ and wait a little while before your server is ready for action. Tech-savvy users will probably find everything from now on as easy as anything however everybody else may have trouble with some basic things such as pointing out your domain name to the server. If your domain isn't managed by Amazon this may be even more complicated.

If all of a sudden you feel an urge to upgrade your plan to a more ambitious one (or just the opposite) Amazon Lightsail has made this process pretty easy and there are (fortunately) enough guides to make things even easier.

We used GTmetrix to test the uptime and response time of Amazon Lightsail's main site (Image credit: GTmetrix)

Speed and experience

With the amount of global data centers Amazon Lightsail provides and the availability of solid-state drive and resources we found it reasonable to expect lightning-fast speed performance. After testing the speed of AWS' main site (via Gtmetrix) we found out we were right to think so.

The page fully loaded in 2.6 seconds (the average result being 8.1) and almost all of the vital web metrics were in the green zone that is pretty much above the average score. However total blocking time (or the amount of time blocked by scripts during the page loading process) was an absolute disaster requiring 665 milliseconds while the recommended amount ought to be 150 or less. Nevertheless Gtmetrix evaluated the overall speed performance of AWS' site with a B (83%) which is one of the better results we have seen so far.

When it comes to uptime Amazon Lightsail sets out a 99.99% guarantee backed by SLA. According to it all of their users are entitled to be compensated from 10% to 100% depending on the downtime their site has suffered during the month in question. To test this out we monitored uptime of AWS' main site (via UptimeRobot) for a whole month but all of our efforts were (fortunately) in vain since we failed to record any downtime at all.

Amazon Lightsail's resource center has a number of useful guides and tutorials to help you get started (Image credit: Amazon)

Support

If you find yourself stuck and want to stay self-sufficient the first-and-foremost option will be AWS' knowledgebase documentation center FAQ section (for simpler issues) or their community forum. The knowledgebase and documentation are equally equipped with both informative and easy-to-follow articles however finding your way around might feel like doing chores.

As for Amazon Lightsail's support staff it can be reached via support ticket where they tend to respond within 24 hours. If you are a user of Amazon Lightsail's cheapest plan that's about it since its support is divided into four levels (Basic Developer Business and Enterprise) and to get more support channels you are required to purchase pricier plans. Therefore if you are prepared to pay a king's ransom you'll be treated like a proverbial king by getting your own advisors including technical account manager short-termed infrastructure event management proactive reviews in-depth guides and so on.

Round-the-clock telephone and chat support (included in most expensive plans) are not included in all languages supported on Amazon Lightsail's website.

The competition

Those looking for a well-rounded VPS solution will find both Bluehost and Amazon Lightsail worthy of consideration. Amazon Lightsail offers VPS plans ranging from $3.50 to $160 easy upgrade/downgrade hourly billing and a free trial while Bluehost provides three VPS plans (where its cheapest option is considerably pricier than the cheapest one with Amazon Lightsail) month-to-month billing and a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Much like Bluehost HostGator offers a variety of hosting types options and features and all with a very beginner-friendly approach. However in terms of pricing the cheapest VPS package with Amazon Lightsail is comparable with shared hosting solutions with either of them. Therefore if you are looking for a cheap and cheerful VPS solution have some experience and don’t mind getting your hands dirty Amazon Lightsail is a number one pick. If that is not the case you’re better off with Bluehost or HostGator.

Like Amazon Lightsail DigitalOcean is best suited for somewhat tech-savvy users who can deal with “non-existent” customer support so they can deploy a cloud infrastructure without doing much damage to their budget. Both offer free trials so you can check everything out for yourselves before committing to either of them.

GreenGeeks is one of the most popular picks for VPS as well as the industry's leading eco-friendly web hosting provider. Although their VPS packages are not as pocket-friendly as those with Amazon Lightsail you’ll be getting an amazing array of features (free SSL certificate free website transfer user-friendly cPanel and superb 24/7 managed support being some of them) and an opportunity to help our planet along the way.

Final verdict

Amazon Lightsail provides an easy path for all those who want to learn more about cloud hosting or get themselves integrated into the AWS ecosystem. Their VPS hosting solutions are simple to set up and are easily scalable to meet most needs but those who want to launch mission-critical high-performance websites should keep their options open for now.

We advise the same to newcomers working on a tight budget since Amazon Lightsail’s staff won’t try to spoil you with sensible support unless you’re willing to pay top dollar. Thankfully there is a 30-day free trial so you can set up your instance install all the apps you want and check how everything works before shelling out your hard earned cash.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZWVodWdnZXIuY29tL2FtYXpvbi1yYWluZm9yZXN0LWRlZm9yZXN0YXRpb24tYWNjZWxlcmF0ZXMtYnJhemlsLWJvbHNvbmFyby01MTkyOTEy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deforestation of Amazon Rainforest Accelerates Under Brazil's Bolsonaro,"When the modern environmental movement was born in the 1970s the Amazon rainforest quickly became its poster child thanks to mass deforestation in Brazil. Decades later deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is still a perfect if alarming proxy for the climate crisis writ large—and still a major roadblock to a healthy planet according to Brazil’s National Institue for Space Research INPE which this month published new data showing accelerating deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon despite a half-century of activism against it. ﻿﻿

In June 2021 INPE’s system of forest-watching satellites detected 410 square miles (1062 square kilometers) of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon which represents an increase of 1.8% compared to June 2020.﻿﻿ Furthermore its data show that deforestation in the region has increased 17% year to date totaling 1394 square miles (3610 square kilometers)—an area more than four times the size of New York City according to Reuters whose reporting on the subject attributes the spike in deforestation to the pro-development policies of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.﻿﻿ In addition to endorsing mining and agriculture in protected areas of the Amazon it says he has weakened environment enforcement agencies and obstructed Brazil’s system for fining environmental offenders.

The data speaks for itself. Since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019 deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has exploded according to the nonprofit environmental news outlet Mongabay which compared INPE data from Bolsonaro’s presidency to INPE data from the tenure of former President Dilma Rousseff. During the first 30 months of Rousseff’s first term which lasted from January 2011 to June 2013 INPE detected approximately 2317 square miles (6000 square kilometers) of deforestation. During the first 30 months of her second term during which she was replaced in office by former President Michel Temer INPE detected over 5019 square miles (13000 square kilometers) of deforestation. During the first 30 months of Bolsonaro’s term deforestation totaled over 8108 square miles (21000 square kilometers).

Under Bolsonaro annual deforestation for the third consecutive year is expected to surpass 3861 square miles (10000 square kilometers) which has not occurred since 2008 according to the advocacy group Climate Observatory.

“From the beginning the Bolsonaro regime has sabotaged the environmental inspection bodies and adopted measures to favor those who destroy our forests” Climate Observatory Executive Secretary Marcio Astrini said in a statement following the release of INPE’s June data. “The high rates of deforestation do not happen by chance; they are the result of a government project. Bolsonaro is the Amazon’s worst enemy today.”

Exacerbating Bolsonaro’s impact on the Amazon are natural weather patterns according to Reuters which says Brazil is about to enter its annual dry season which peaks in August and September. It’s common to burn deforested areas to clear them for agriculture or development and during that time fires can easily spread from deforested to forested land.

“Almost 5000 square kilometers of area deforested since 2019 has not yet burned—meaning those areas are tinderboxes of fuel waiting for a spark. Many of these fuel-heavy areas are adjacent to standing forests making them prime locations for fires to jump from cleared land to remaining forest” explains a fire season forecast by the Woodwell Climate Research Center and the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “The Brazilian federal government has authorized the use of military forces to combat deforestation over the next two months. They have also declared a nationwide fire ban. However fires continued to escalate under a similar ban last year highlighting the need for more effective strategies.”

Yet another factor in a complicated equation is drought. “To make matters worse the southern Amazon this year has been experiencing drought conditions” continues the Woodwell and IPAM analysis. “The drought has … been exacerbated by increasing average temperatures due to climate change. Warmer temperatures increase evaporation and reduce soil moisture which increases flammability. Droughts like this will place increasing pressure on remaining forests particularly in the southern Amazon.”

In that way deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is a vicious circle: Razing rainforests reduce the Earth’s capacity to naturally capture and sequester carbon. That leaves the planet more susceptible to climate change which in turn makes rainforests vulnerable to even more destruction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRkdS5vcmcvbWVldGluZ19hbWF6b25fdGhyZWF00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meeting the Amazon Threat,"The Amazon Threat

The Teamster Convention adopted a resolution to make building union power and winning a union contract a top priority for our union. That’s a heavy challenge.

Amazon is the world’s fastest growing employer with more than one million workers in the U.S. and climbing.

Amazon is now directly competing in key Teamster industries like warehousing and package delivery.

Amazon’s huge size growing monopoly of power and low-wage business model make it a direct threat to Teamsters.

We need to help Amazon workers drive up their wages benefits and power or we will be dragged down in a race to the bottom.

Growing Amazon Sweatshop

Until 2012 Amazon’s business model focused on warehousing and selling goods and used UPS and other companies to ship to their customers.

Since then Amazon has rapidly expanded into sorting and delivering its own packages directly competing with UPS.

Workers at Amazon sortation centers equivalent to a UPS hub are part-timers. Amazon hiked part-time starting pay to $15 - $17 an hour this year and crappy benefits.

Delivery drivers don’t work for Amazon. They work for small subcontractors (called Amazon service providers) for $15 an hour or are “Amazon Flex Drivers”— the name that Amazon uses for self-employed personal vehicle drivers.

In 2018 Amazon had only 80 delivery stations. Last September Amazon announced that it will build 1000 more delivery stations.

Organizing Amazon is not something that is going to be won shop-by-shop or through the typical NLRB election process.

The Teamster Convention resolution says organizing Amazon will require supporting shopfloor militancy by Amazon workers solidarity from warehousing and delivery Teamsters partnerships with unions and the community and mobilization of the rank and file."

After years spent lagging behind its neighbors in renewable energy production Missouri may finally be on the cusp of a green makeover of its power grid.

That’s the cautiously optimistic prognosis of renewable energy advocates after a recent surge in wind farm construction in the state and in the wake of brand-new state legislation meant to ease Missouri utility companies’ transition away from fossil fuels.

Missouri has long been one of the most coal-dependent states in the country. It consumed more coal for electricity generation in 2020 than any other state except Texas despite producing very little of its own coal and ranking 18th among U.S. states in population and 27th in total energy consumption per capita as of 2019.

That dynamic has made Missouri and its power grid a prime target for environmentalists and renewable energy advocates who have stressed the need for the state to transition toward a cleaner and more sustainable model.

The stakes involved in the move away from a fossil-fuel-dependent energy system are well-documented: in order to prevent some of the more catastrophic impacts of climate change such as extreme droughts flooding and hurricanes the United Nations has urged countries to transition to renewable energy sources that don’t emit the high levels of planet-warming greenhouse gases that fossil fuels like coal do.

“We’re already feeling the impacts of the climate crisis in Missouri and they’re only going to increase” said Andy Knott central region director for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign. “Missouri needs to become a leader in mitigating those impacts by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.”

Coal virtually all of it shipped in by rail from out of state accounted for 70% of electricity generation in Missouri last year compared with just 9% from renewable sources like wind solar and hydropower.

Nationally renewables make up about 20% of electricity generation. The top renewable energy producers are Texas and the West Coast states though Missouri also trails far behind neighboring Iowa Illinois Kansas and Oklahoma in renewable output.

However the coal-based proportion of Missouri’s energy grid in 2020 did represent a decrease from a high of 81% in 2010 and figures to continue its decline as utilities retire old coal-fired plants switch them to natural gas or replace them with renewable sources.

In 2020 alone the state roughly doubled its total wind power capacity from about 1000 to 2000 megawatts which means wind now accounts for over half of Missouri’s total renewable energy output.

Wind turbines under construction in the state as of the start of 2021 are expected to add another 448 megawatts according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“At the utilities level there has been a dramatic shift in the past several years toward cleaner energy” said James Owen executive director of Renew Missouri a Columbia-based clean energy advocacy group. “And I think you’re going to see it go even further.”

Missouri’s wind energy capacity which is largely concentrated in the northwestern part of the state still lags behind neighboring Iowa (over 11000 megawatts) and Kansas (6500 megawatts). But Owen expects the recent move toward renewables to continue especially in light of new legislation signed into law last week by Gov. Mike Parson.

The bill will enable utility companies to close old coal plants more quickly and speed up their transition to renewables. The legislation will allow these companies to refinance debt they took on to build the plants without taking a financial hit through a process known as securitization. This process would remove a hurdle that companies like Ameren and Evergy have cited as hindering their move away from fossil fuels even as they have verbally committed to doing so.

Knott said that argument was partly a “convenient excuse” on the part of utilities that could still have been ramping up their investments in renewables more quickly though he acknowledged that their hefty investments in coal-fired plants have presented a challenge.

Now though they have all the tools they need to accelerate their transition to renewables Knott said. “At this point there won’t be any excuse to not move ahead.”

Owen agreed saying securitization will be crucial to attaining a more sustainable Missouri power grid.

Nonetheless he said that while he is particularly encouraged by the state’s progress with regard to wind energy Missouri needs to devote further attention to other renewable sources especially solar energy.

Throughout Missouri homeowners associations place limits on homeowners’ ability to purchase their own solar panels. Efforts to remove those restrictions by passing a “Solar Bill of Rights” in the state legislature which organizations like the Missouri Sierra Club have supported have been unsuccessful so far.

All in all while they argue there is plenty of additional room for progress renewable energy advocates like Knott and Owen are encouraged by what they view as Missouri’s recent move toward an energy infrastructure that will be cleaner and more sustainable as well as beneficial to the state’s economy.

“People don’t think about the economic benefits of this” Owen said citing the boon that an influx of green jobs and reduced need to purchase coal from other states could provide to Missouri.

“I am optimistic. The tide is turning in terms of utility and political support of clean energy” Knott said. “We just have to be vigilant and keep the acceleration going.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is great in theory for American Airlines customers giving them a big domestic network to fly while still earning miles and elite status. It’s great for JetBlue customers given American’s global reach. And it makes the two airlines competitive against United and Delta in selling to corporate accounts.

American Airlines customers especially should like flying JetBlue which offers more legroom seat back entertainment free wifi and a business class product (on routes where it’s offered) with relatively great seats food and friendly service.

However the actual partnership – as experienced by passengers – is quite broken. Several customers based in both Boston and New York have shared the problems they’ve faced and an American Airlines manager generously provided context.

When you buy a JetBlue flight from American American Airlines can’t assign seats and customers have shared stories of JetBlue agents who say they can’t or who don’t want to do it on American Airlines codeshares. (“Hang up call back”)

Customers expect elite benefits across partners but that doesn’t exist yet. I regularly get asked and read in my social feed about AAdvantage elite benefits when traveling on JetBlue. For instance they assume they’ll get better seats (that JetBlue doesn’t give their own members – the TrueBlue program is weak). Communication that this is still an earn-only relationship without elite recognition or redemption opportunities so far has not been clear.

American is telling customers about one elite benefit that doesn’t exist . Reservation confirmations sent to customers booking codeshare flights have shown free checked baggage benefits for elite members even though those don’t apply on JetBlue . This is a DOT complaint waiting to happen. I mocked complaints about this six years ago but I was wrong because American still hasn’t gotten their IT fixed. Push hard enough and I’m told if you have a confirmation saying you get free checked bags American Airlines will cover the fees you were forced to pay to JetBlue.

JetBlue isn’t properly reporting miles to American in some cases. Customers who have added their AAdvantage account number but that who have JetBlue accounts have found flights crediting to TrueBlue instead. Getting this fixed is… a challenge.

The partnership was announced a year ago and it’s been live for five months but it’s not yet ready for prime time.

Overall it should be good for customers but competitors don’t like it. However the value proposition is entirely contingent on delivering a consistent customer experience.

Americans seem eager to travel for fun but not for work: Business travel demand right now is about 40% of what it was in the summer of 2019 United CEO Scott Kirby said in a recent CBS Face The Nation interview.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

That's a problem. In normal times business travelers occupy about 12% to 15% of the seats on the big conventional airlines that offer multi-class seating aim at higher fare-paying business travelers and have higher operating costs than the budget players. But that same group of travelers generates about 45% of conventional carriers' revenues.

So airlines — and their travel industry compatriots in the hotel and restaurants segments — remain in a deep financial hole. And nobody's quite sure when if ever business travel will fully rebound.

Kirby said he doesn't see a full recovery before next summer. In a June interview with Fox Business Delta CEO Ed Bastian predicted the sector will return to pre-pandemic levels this fall. Hyatt Hotels CEO Mark Hoplamazian whose business also relies on business travel proposed a similar timeline. ""We are already seeing the signs of people starting to travel for work"" he said at CNBC's Evolve Global Summit in June. ""I think that will really take hold in a more affirmative way in the fall.""

But predictions from the Global Business Travel Association make even Kirby's outlook seem rosy. In a May poll by the trade group 92% of companies surveyed said they had paused most or all of their international travel. Two-thirds stopped domestic trips too. The association said that a recent modest bump in business travel is a good sign but that it doesn't forecast a full return to 2019 levels until 2025.

""The lack of business travel and lingering consumer hesitation are prolonging the road to recovery"" Adobe Analytics which tracks domestic flight bookings said in a June report.

But along with how long that recovery will take comes another question: What might it look like?

Bruce Rosenberg president of travel company HotelPlanner said it's likely that business travel demand growth will take off in September. But the reasons motivating that new business travel will be different in some regards.

""People will travel in order to get back to where they think they need to be"" in terms of generating sales better meeting their clients' expectations or overseeing critical aspects of their companies' far-flung operations he said. ""But the touchy-feely things? No.""

Companies are much less likely to spend money on team building confabs employee reward events and other types of ""soft"" travel that don't directly generate revenue. Trade shows are likely to start up again this fall but Rosenberg expects most will be scaled-back affairs with maybe half as many attendees as in pre-pandemic times even as such shows' floor space requirements will double to accommodate social distancing best practices and any local requirements still being enforced.

""I think budgets are an issue. For a big sale or big client meeting corporations will find the money for that kind of travel but not the other stuff"" he said. However over the next couple of years of corporate budgeting travel for less essential business purposes will gradually make its way back into corporate budgets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi8yMDIxLzA3LzE4L2FpcnBsYW5lLWZpZ2h0LWJlaGF2aW9yLWZhYS1hcnJlc3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unruly airplane passengers are straining the system for keeping peace in the sky,"After consuming several beers and a couple of shots before takeoff a miner started urinating near his seat on an Alaska Airlines flight an FBI special agent recounted.

That decision led to a strong response from U.S. Rep. David McKinley R-W.Va. whose district includes the Mitchell plant.

American Electric Power through its subsidiaries Wheeling Power and Kentucky Power made separate filings to each state’s PSC. Wheeling Power and Kentucky Power each own a 50% stake in the Mitchell plant so filings needed to be made in each state. Wheeling Power made its case in June before the West Virginia PSC and is awaiting that body’s decision.

AEP has two plans on the table to bring the Mitchell plant into compliance with federal environmental regulations.

One plan according to Kentucky PSC documents would allow the plant to stay open until 2040 at a cost of $133.5 million.

In that plan the Mitchell plant would be able to make improvements that would allow it to meet federal Effluent Limitations Guidelines which are national standards for wastewater discharged to surface waters and municipal sewage treatment plants. Those have a compliance deadline of Dec. 31 2028.

The other would cost $35.1 million but would only allow the plant to make improvements to meet Coal Combustible Residual guidelines which regulate the safe disposal of coal ash. Those improvements would only keep the Mitchell plant open until 2028.

Kentucky Power was asking to complete the first plan and requested a certificate to construct projects that would make the Mitchell plant ELG compliant and recover the costs for that project. It argued that doing so would be the cost-effective option saying the costs to replace capacity in 2028 would be more than the costs of the improvements.

The Kentucky PSC disagreed and authorized the company to go with the second plan.

“Based on the evidence provided in the case the Commission found the company over-stated the costs of replacement energy and capacity” the Kentucky PSC said in a news release.

‘Additionally Kentucky Power did not account for potential future environmental compliance costs that could add to costs to keep Mitchell in operation beyond 2028.”

The PSC’s ruling fell in line with the arguments made by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron a Republican the Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers advocacy group and the Sierra Club.

McKinley has been a very vocal proponent of doing what is necessary to keep the Mitchell plant open until 2040. He testified before the West Virginia PSC and led a congressional delegation letter calling on the WVPSC to approve the necessary upgrades.

He said in a statement released Friday that he was disappointed in Kentucky “turning its back on coal.”

“Not only does the Mitchell Power Plant support countless jobs and much-needed economic activity but it is critical to providing reliable and resilient electricity to ratepayers through West Virginia and Kentucky” McKinley said. “Any rate increases needed to keep the Mitchell Power Plant open pale in comparison to the economic devastation that will come with the plant’s premature closure.”

A 2021 West Virginia University report on the economic impact of coal and coal-fired power generation in the state said Mitchell produces more than 5 million in total megawatt hour power generation. The plant’s direct economic impact in Marshall County is $418 million and closing the Mitchell plant would mean the end of more than 660 jobs and $65 million in employee compensation.

McKinley said he and other supporters of the Mitchell plant weren’t done fighting to keep it open until 2040.

“Moving forward to keep the plant open through 2040 we will work with the state and other stakeholders to find a solution to protect our economy and West Virginia’s coal miners” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluZm9ybWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81N2E2YTFlZC0wZDQ1LTQ4ZjEtYmUwMS0xYTU3MDVjMTg1ZDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Elon Musk Has Bet on Asian Battery Makers Over American Battery Startups,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.theinformation.com/articles/57a6a1ed-0d45-48f1-be01-1a5705c185d8 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluZm9ybWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81N2E2YTFlZC0wZDQ1LTQ4ZjEtYmUwMS0xYTU3MDVjMTg1ZDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHlhbmRzdGF0ZW55LmNvbS9wb3dlci1saXN0cy8yMDIxLzA3L3Bvd2VyLWRpdmVyc2l0eS1hc2lhbi0xMDAvMTgzNzU3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Power of Diversity: Asian 100,"1.

Beauty is so much more than simply something pleasant to see or hear. Beauty in and of itself can play an important part in the evangelistic endeavor and even in apologetics.

It should go without saying that beauty is a good thing. While opinions about what makes something beautiful may differ just about everyone agrees that beauty is something positive. St. Thomas Aquinas defined beauty as “that which upon being seen pleases” (id quod visum placet). Certainly this is something good something to be admired.

But it does not take faith to be affected by great beauty certainly; even many atheists are stopped in their tracks when they walk into St. Peter’s Basilica or see the western sky ablaze with a sunset or the aurora borealis dancing across the stars or hear the music of Mozart or gaze upon Notre-Dame in Paris. Beauty has a powerful evangelizing effect—and especially today beauty should be a starting point for evangelization.

The world has changed a lot over the past hundred years or so. Argumentation logical demonstrations and reason don’t mean as much as they used to. People often are not swayed by such intellectual pursuits. When was the last time you heard a “debate” result in anyone changing his mind being convinced by the other side’s argument? Many people now identify with the groups that hold their viewpoints which makes them even more entrenched and unlikely to change—especially through any sort of argumentation or debate.

What can bring people to their senses make them see what is true and good like a splash of cold water bringing them out of their stupor? Beauty.

The transcendentals have a unity about them: if something is true it is also good and it is also beautiful. The three are intertwined distinct from one another but intimately connected even flowing from each other. If someone is earnestly pursuing what is good he will come to know the truth and will find profound beauty. Truly beautiful things are good and profoundly true; truly good things are true and profoundly beautiful; truly true things are beautiful and profoundly good. This is why beautiful things can so easily lead down the road to the true and the good.

Beauty in itself has an evangelizing power. It communicates something beyond merely what is being depicted. Michelangelo’s Pietá shows us not just a tableau a moment in time Mary holding the lifeless body of Jesus after the Crucifixion. It shows us so much more: we see the horrors of the crucifixion; we see grief beyond measure; we see hope hope in something unknown but the most profound expression of the virtue of Christian hope; we see God’s love for us carved out in marble. And in many cases beauty such as this can be a more effective tool for evangelization than argumentation ever could be.

The attack on beauty that our culture is experiencing is no accident. Modern architecture modern art modern classical music—many of these are intentional attacks on beauty. While there are thankfully artists in every field who are reacting against this and continuing to make beautiful art the trend among the “elite” artists is an attack on the beautiful and thus on the true and the good.

It is no coincidence that this proliferation of bad art coincided with our society’s fight against truth and goodness. Hans Urs von Balthasar said that denial of the true and the good would inevitably lead to ugliness. The precipitous moral decline of Western society over the past hundred years is a symptom of society’s turning away from God and from objective truth. Reclaiming and reengaging with real beauty is the sure antidote.

Beauty does not simply refer to things that are aesthetically pleasing—and especially not things that meet our culture’s standards of beauty. Peter Kreeft once remarked that there is much more beauty in the face of Mother Teresa than in the face of say the singer Madonna.

To take another example in all of the horrors of the Passion of Jesus Christ is a profound and stunning beauty: the beauty of the sacrifice of Jesus. True beauty and often the most powerful beauty can be found in things that strike us in ways we cannot fully understand.

But let’s think about just what that beauty does. When we encounter such beauty what happens? In the face of Mother Teresa we see her joy her humility her love her ardor and perhaps even her legendary stubbornness. It is a face that draws you in that makes you want to know more: Why is she joyful? Why does she have this love? What causes her ardor?

In the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross we see in these horrors the utterly unselfish sacrifice that caused this instrument of torture to be brandished as a trophy by billions of Christians around the world. No one wears an electric chair around their necks; what makes this executed criminal different? There is the icebreaker.

St. Augustine wrote about how the beauty of God’s creation can answer some of our most profound questions:

And what is this? I asked the earth and it answered me “I am not he”; and whatsoever are in it confessed the same. I asked the sea and the deeps and the living creeping things and they answered “We are not thy God seek above us.” I asked the moving air; and the whole air with his inhabitants answered . . . “I am not God.” I asked the heavens sun moon stars “Nor are we the God whom thou sleekest.” And I replied unto all the things . . . “You have told me of my God that you are not he; tell me something of him.” And they cried out with a loud voice “He made us.” My questioning them was my thoughts on them: and their beauty gave me the answer” (Confessions 10 6).

This almost poetic periscope from Augustine is a moving example of the way in which beauty (in this case the beauty of creation) can both prompt the question and provide the answer.

Ratzinger on beauty

Then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger now Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has written and spoken a great deal about beauty. One of his clearest and most eloquent elucidations of the role of beauty in evangelization came in August 2002 in a message delivered to the Communion & Liberation community titled “The Feeling of Things the Contemplation of Beauty.”

“This is the very way in which reason is freed from dullness and made ready to act” Ratzinger said. This speaks to an important point we must keep in mind: although beauty may not be a logical argument in and of itself neither is our reaction to it it a purely emotional one. It is an icebreaker an eye-catcher. For someone who has no experience of the beauty of the liturgy the smells and bells and sights and sounds tell them that something remarkable is going on. This prompts further questions and investigation.

Cardinal Ratzinger recounted the story of a personal profound experience he had with beauty. He once attended a concert of the music of J.S. Bach in Munich conducted by the American conductor Leonard Bernstein. He was seated next to a Lutheran bishop.

When the last note of the great Thomas-Kantor-Cantatas triumphantly faded away we looked at each other spontaneously and right then we said “Anyone who has heard this knows that the faith is true.” This is the way of beauty the via pulchritudinis. Beauty can be the most effective means to bring man to Jesus Christ. The music had such an extraordinary force of reality that we realized no longer by deduction but by the impact on our hearts that it could not have originated from nothingness but could only have come to be through the power of the Truth that became real in the composer’s inspiration.

Ratzinger said—many times over the years—that the most convincing apology for the Christian faith in the face of every denial are the saints and the beautiful art that has flowed from the Faith. “This is the very way in which reason is freed from dullness and made ready to act” he wrote.

Beauty in Evangelii Gaudium

In Pope Francis’s lovely apostolic exhortation Evangelii Gaudium (“The Joy of the Gospel”) he writes on the role of beauty in evangelization. “Every form of catechesis would do well to attend to the ‘way of beauty’ (via pulchritudinis)” he wrote. “Proclaiming Christ means showing that to believe in and follow him is not only something right and true but also something beautiful capable of filling life with new splendor and profound joy even in the midst of difficulties” (167).

There is a profound beauty in true joy and this joy can be seen in those who abandon themselves pick up their crosses and follow Jesus Christ. Christians have always been recognized for their joy and how they love one another. There is a great beauty in that.

“Every expression of true beauty can thus be acknowledged as a path leading to an encounter with the Lord Jesus” Pope Francis wrote.

The Holy Father also addressed how the arts can be utilized to evangelize:

Each particular Church should encourage the use of the arts in evangelization building on the treasures of the past but also drawing upon the wide variety of contemporary expressions so as to transmit the faith in a new “language of parables.”

Beauty creates a longing within us according to many of the Greek philosophers. It pierces us creates a vacuum that we must fill. The Christian tradition recognizes this aching emptiness and recognizes that God alone can satisfy us. As St. Augustine famously wrote “You made us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.”

Plato said man lost the original perfection that was conceived for him and is now constantly trying to get back to that perfection. “Nostalgia and longing impel him to pursue the quest” wrote Cardinal Ratzinger in 2002; “beauty prevents him from being content with just daily life. It causes him to suffer.”

From this suffering comes a searching an attempt to attain that which we’ve lost that which we (deep down) know we need. Beauty is reassuring it is pleasing but it only makes us want more only makes us want that perfect beauty—which is God. Pope Francis says:

Every expression of true beauty can. . . be acknowledged as a path leading to an encounter with the Lord Jesus. A formation in the via pulchritudinis ought to be part of our effort to pass on the Faith. Each particular Church should encourage the use of the arts in evangelization building on the treasures of the past but also drawing upon the wide variety of contemporary expressions (Evangelii Gaudium 167).

While beauty may not be a logical reasoned argument for the existence of God it is a powerful indicator. It opens the door. The evangelizing power of beauty is in the gut punch it can give you the splash of cold water that brings you out of yourself and helps you see the bigger picture.

Sidebar 1: From John Paul II’s ‘Letter to Artists’ (1999)

“In perceiving that all he had created was good God saw that it was beautiful as well. The link between good and beautiful stirs fruitful reflection. In a certain sense beauty is the visible form of the good just as the good is the metaphysical condition of beauty” (3).

“Believers find nothing strange in this:

they know that they have had a momentary glimpse of the abyss of light which has its original wellspring in God. Is it in any way surprising that this leaves the spirit overwhelmed as it were so that it can only stammer in reply?” (6).

“True art has a close affinity with the world of faith so that even in situations where culture and the Church are far apart art remains a kind of bridge to religious experience” (10).

“May the beauty which you pass on to generations still to come be such that it will stir them to wonder! Faced with the sacredness of life and of the human person and before the marvels of the universe wonder is the only appropriate attitude.” (16)

“Beauty is a key to the mystery and a call to transcendence. It is an invitation to savour life and to dream of the future. That is why the beauty of created things can never fully satisfy. It stirs that hidden nostalgia for God which a lover of beauty like Saint Augustine could express in incomparable terms: ‘Late have I loved you beauty so old and so new: late have I loved you!’” (16).

Sidebar 2: Scripture on Beauty

“For from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator” (Wis. 13:5).

“I praise thee for thou art fearful and wonderful. Wonderful are thy works!” (Ps. 139:14).

“He has made everything beautiful in its time; also he has put eternity into man’s mind yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end” (Eccles. 3:11).

“The Mighty One God the Lord speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting. Out of Zion the perfection of beauty God shines forth” (Ps. 50:1-2).

“And God said ‘Let there be light’; and there was light. And God

saw that the light was good”

(Gen. 1:3-4).

“The earth brought forth vegetation plants yielding seed according to their own kinds and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good” (Gen. 1:12).

“In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it” (John 1:1-5).

Sidebar 3: I See His Blood Upon the Rose

I See His Blood Upon the Rose

I see his blood upon the rose

And in the stars the glory of his eyes

His body gleams amid eternal snows

His tears fall from the skies.

I see his face in every flower;

The thunder and the singing of the birds

Are but his voice—and carven by his power

Rocks are his written words.

All pathways by his feet are worn

His strong heart stirs the ever-beating sea

His crown of thorns is twined with every thorn

His cross is every tree.

Written by the Irish poet Joseph Mary Plunkett this poem is a powerful illustration of the way that we can see God and his love for us in the beauty of creation. Plunkett was a devout Catholic who was arrested and executed for his role in the Easter Rebellion an armed uprising of Irish republicans against British rule in Ireland.

In the poem Plunkett goes through the beauty of God’s creation—the redness of the rose the stars in the sky the singing of birds the powerful sea—and shows how we can see not only evidence for a creator but the love of God for all of us. The redness of the rose reminds us of Christ’s blood shed for us; the beauty and tenderness of flowers is God’s face; etc. In other words as St. Augustine wrote we can see evidence of God through all the beauty of creation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL01hdGVyaWFscy9QYW5hc29uaWMtam9pbnMtVVMtcHJvamVjdC10aGF0LWV4dHJhY3RzLWxpdGhpdW0tZm9yLUVWcy1pbi13ZWVrczLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Panasonic joins US project that extracts lithium for EVs 'in weeks',"OSAKA -- Panasonic has joined a project led by U.S. oil services leader Schlumberger that seeks to extract lithium from underground salt water in a fraction of the time reducing the process from over a year to a matter of weeks.

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you.

The Hotel Collection bookings may be made by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic and Additional Platinum Card Members and Companion Platinum Card Members on the Platinum Card Account. Delta SkyMiles® Platinum Card Members are not eligible for the benefit. To receive the statement credits an eligible Card Member must make a new booking using their eligible Card through American Express Travel on or after July 1st 2021 that is prepaid (referred to as ""Pay Now"" on amextravel.com and the Amex App) for a qualifying stay at an available participating Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection property. Bookings of The Hotel Collection require a minimum stay of two consecutive nights. Eligible bookings must be processed before December 31st 11:59PM Central Time each calendar year to be eligible for statement credits within that year. Eligible bookings do not include interest charges cancellation fees property fees or other similar fees or any charges by a property to you (whether for your booking your stay or otherwise).

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance.

Officials from Houma-based A.M. Dupont Corp. are asking the Houma-Terrebonne Regional Planning Commission to approve its plan to create seven adjacent lots to sell to camp owners on the island. The company also plans to improve water and sewerage pipes and add fire hydrants that would serve the camps.

Company representative Keneth Rembert told the board Thursday that it is negotiating with the area's fire department on some of the improvements. The company is also considering deepening the bayou at the front of its property to accommodate new pipes.

Isle de Jean Charles has weathered decades of storms erosion and flooding that have reduced the tiny island at the southeastern tip of Terrebonne to a sliver of land occupied by a few dozen families mostly low-income Native Americans.

For years the state has used a $48 million federal grant to relocate those who voluntarily leave their homes on the island to a new community on higher ground in Schriever. In April some of the residents got their first look at their new homes in the New Isle community.

M:Isle de Jean Charles residents view future homes for the first time

Chief Shirell Parfait-Dardar chief of the Grand Caillou-Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw was among 10 island residents and camp owners who attended Thursday's Planning Commission meeting to learn more about the plans.

She read a statement by Albert Naquin chief of the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe who was unable to attend.

“When the resettlement plan was approved and funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development we agreed to it based on our understanding that part of the agreement was that IDJC would be left to nature meaning no improvements or services would be provided to IDJC over time and it would ultimately be consumed by water. This includes our roads our homes and our historic burial sites” Naquin’s statement reads.

“However now that the resettlement has been funded we see improvements being made to our Island Road and fishing piers with parking were built. Our school was recently shut down – we were told it didn’t make sense to keep it open. … It seems IDJC is slated to become a recreational sporting island” Naquin says in the letter.

“I am here tonight because the Dupont land is being sold as campsites"" the statement continues. ""This is profoundly unsettling. Our tribe was strongly encouraged to leave our homes and we were told that if we stayed we’d have no help or services there. Now we’re finding out that the land is being repurposed and seemingly redeveloped for private recreational use.”

Timeline of Isle de Jean Charles:Why is Isle de Jean Charles disappearing? A timeline of land loss

In an interview Friday Terrebonne Planning Director Chris Pulaski clarified that not all properties on Isle de Jean Charles are a part of the resettlement program.

“Not every piece of property on the island is owned by someone who would even be eligible to participate” Pulaski said. “It's all voluntary first of all and then there's some properties that wouldn't be eligible.”

Pulaski said residents on the island including those who relocate but keep property there are allowed to make limited improvements and renovations but they can amount to no more than half of the structure or property's assessed value.

“If they are being relocated the property that they own on the island it stays their property. It doesn't become property of the parish or anything” Pulaski said. “Now it will have restrictions on it as to what they can or can't build.”

Terrebonne Parish Councilman John Amedee whose district includes the new resettlement community in Schriever attended Thursday's meeting. He decried what he sees as a lack of communication among residents local government and the state about the whole process.

“Communication has been an issue all along and hasn't been a part of that whole process. I want to make sure I check on anything that I’m told to make sure that we’re getting the right information out” Amedee said.

Planning Commission member Dr. L.A. Cloutier noted that the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies might have to get involved with the company’s proposed changes to the property that involve dredging. Pulaski also pointed out during the meeting that the type of fire hydrant used was not finalized.

“Those variances were not listed on the application. So you need to have another call for another public hearing” he said.

The Planning Commission will hold at least one more public hearing next month before making a final decision officials said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9kZWFscy9kaXNjb3VudGVkLWFuYS1maXJzdC1jbGFzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to book an ANA first class to Japan for under $2000 round-trip,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

Virgin Atlantic is running an excellent buy points promotion through Aug. 14 2021. U.S.-based Virgin Atlantic Flying Club members can buy Virgin points with a 70% bonus when purchasing at least 100000 points. This brings the cost down to just under 1.6 cents per point.

At face value this might not look like the best deal. TPG values Virgin points at 1.5 cents per point and you can transfer points in from American Express Membership Rewards Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou. But things get more interesting when you consider that you can use this sale to purchase partner flights at a discount.

Virgin Atlantic's most intriguing partner is All Nippon Airways (ANA). You can use Virgin Atlantic Flying Club to book ANA flights at excellent rates with first-class award tickets from the U.S. to Japan starting at just 110000 points round-trip. So you can buy Virgin points through this promotion and effectively purchase an ANA first-class ticket for under $2000. This is a stark contrast to the $17000+ ANA charges for revenue fares.

Here we'll take a look at how to maximize this buy points promotion to fly one of the best first-class products in the sky at a steep discount.

The risk of 'buying' an ANA award ticket right now

This is a great deal but it isn't without risk. (Photo by TungCheung/Shutterstock)

While this is an excellent way to save money on ANA first and business-class tickets it isn't without its risks. Japan's borders are still closed to tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic. You may need to change or cancel your ANA tickets if the country doesn't reopen by the time you're set to travel.

There's also no guarantee that Virgin Atlantic won't devalue ANA awards in the future. You could be left paying a higher mileage cost in the future if Virgin Atlantic chooses to devalue its program after you cancel your tickets. If this happens you'd have to either buy more Virgin points or transfer them in from another program.

Keep these risks in mind before you buy Virgin points to book an ANA award ticket. Personally I'd only book tickets departing in mid-2022 and have a backup plan in place if you can't use the points to fly ANA. For example you can use Virgin points to book Delta One Suites to Europe for 50000 points one-way with minimal taxes and fees.

How to book ANA first class for under $2000

You can book round-trip ANA first class awards for less than $2000 when you buy Virgin points at a discount. (Photo by Ethan Steinberg / The Points Guy)

Before you buy miles it's important to understand Virgin Atlantic's ANA award chart and how to find award space. As discussed Virgin Atlantic has an excellent award chart. You can book first-class tickets from the West Coast to Japan for 110000 points and the East Coast for 120000.

Business-class flights can also be a great deal and start at just 90000 points round-trip from the West Coast.

Here's a look at the full award chart. All prices listed are for round-trip tickets though you can book a one-way ticket for half the price.

You're liable for paying minor taxes and fees on your ANA award ticket. Thankfully ANA eliminated most fuel surcharges last year so this won't be a huge bill. Expect to pay roughly $195 in taxes and fees on a round-trip award ticket on top of the miles you purchase from Virgin Atlantic.

How to find ANA award space

One downside to booking ANA tickets with Virgin Atlantic Flying Club is that you cannot book tickets online. Instead you have to find award space using a Star Alliance search tool. You can then call Virgin Atlantic to book the award ticket with your points. It's important that you find award space before purchasing Virgin points so you're not stuck with points you can't use.

I recently started using Air Canada's website to find Star Alliance award space. I used United in the past but its website recently stopped showing some Lufthansa award space. This shouldn't directly impact ANA searches but it's best not to take any chances when you're considering spending thousands of dollars to buy points.

You can search for an award ticket from Air Canada's home page. Be sure to select ""Points"" as your payment currency. At the time of writing you can only book nonstop ANA flights with Virgin points. So you'll need to search from one of ANA's U.S. gateway cities to Tokyo-Haneda (HND) or Tokyo-Narita (NRT). You can enter ""TYO"" as your destination to search award space into both airports at once.

(Screenshot courtesy of aircanada.com)

Look through the list of available flights and scan for non-stop flights operated by ANA. Award space is available if there's a points price underneath your requested class of service. Write down the dates and flight numbers when you flight applicable flights. At this point it's in your best interest to call Virgin Atlantic to verify that the open award space before you buy points.

Leveraging Virgin Atlantic's points sale for a cheap ANA first-class ticket

As discussed U.S.-based Flying Club members can buy Virgin points with a 70% bonus through Aug. 14 2021. You'll need to buy 100000 points (before the bonus) to score the full 70% bonus with lower quantities resulting in a lower bonus.

The bonus structure is as follows:

Buy 5000 to 24000 points get a 20% bonus

Buy 25000 to 69000 points get a 30% bonus

Buy 70000 to 99000 points get a 50% bonus

Buy 100000 to 150000 points get a 70% bonus

If you want to purchase two ANA first-class tickets from the U.S. West Coast to Tokyo you need 220000 Virgin points. With the promotion you can buy 130000 Virgin points and receive an additional 91000 bonus points. This gives you a total of 221000 Virgin points for $3535. Again this is just 1.6 cents per point.

(Screenshot courtesy of points.com)

If you're departing from San Francisco (SFO) next April the same two tickets cost a whopping $39698.90. You're saving $35773 using this method assuming taxes of $195 per passenger. The total cost per passenger is just $1962.50 after taxes and fees.

(Screenshot courtesy of matrix.itasoftware.com)

Alternatively you can book two passengers round-trip from New York-JFK to Tokyo in ANA business class for 95000 points per person. You can buy the required 190000 points for $3049. Assuming the same $195 in taxes and fees you'll pay $1719.50 per person. The same two tickets cost $19292.90 next May giving you nearly $16000 in savings.

(Screenshot courtesy of matrix.itasoftware.com)

Unfortunately you won't earn frequent flyer miles or elite status credit when you book ANA tickets with Virgin points. At the same time the cost savings massively outweighs any points you would otherwise earn and makes an otherwise unattainable ticket possible for many travelers.

Earn Virgin points with a credit card

Alternatively you can earn transferable points and transfer them to Virgin Atlantic to book these ANA award tickets. Many of the major transferable points currencies transfer to Virgin Atlantic but my favorite is American Express Membership Rewards.

A number of Amex cards earn these points and each has different bonus spend categories welcome offers and fees. Consider opening one of these Amex cards if you don't want to shell out nearly $2000 for an ANA first-class ticket.

Bottom line

Here I showed you how to leverage Virgin Atlantic's buy points promotion to buy ANA first-class tickets to Japan for under $2000 round-trip. This deal has the potential to save you thousands of dollars on premium airfare so it's worth considering if you're planning a trip to Japan in 2022. That said you should only buy points for this redemption if you're comfortable with the risks involved.

Here’s what it means for customers and the payment system in India:

Why have these companies been barred from enrolling new customers?

On July 14 the RBI imposed restrictions on Mastercard Asia Pacific Pte Ltd from onboarding new domestic customers (debit credit or prepaid) in India from July 22 citing non-compliance with guidelines for storage of data in India. The RBI said it had given almost three years for Mastercard to comply with the regulatory directions but it was unable to complete the process.

In April this year the RBI had imposed restrictions on American Express Banking Corp and Diners Club International Ltd from enrolling new domestic customers onto their card networks from May 1 2021 also citing non-compliance of storage of data.

Also in Explained | What to consider before investing directly in government securities

Will existing card users and banks be affected?

No. Existing customers using a credit card or a debit card with Mastercard American Express or Diners Club as the payment network can continue using these. Banks and non-banking finance companies that were planning to use these payment networks won’t be able to use these platforms to enrol new customers until the RBI lifts the ban.

“This leaves only Visa Inc and homegrown NPCI’s RuPay as payment providers under no restrictions currently. We don’t know if Visa has fulfilled all the requirements of data localisation as envisaged in the Storage of Payment System Data circular of the RBI. In the near term we don’t foresee any material impact on card issuers (especially credit card issuers) but there could be a medium-term impact if this situation persists” banking group Nomura said in a report. Banks that were planning for new customers through Mastercard will have to look at Visa for enrolment.

Yes Bank RBL Bank and Bajaj Finserv are likely to be most impacted as their entire card schemes are allied with Mastercard Nomura said. Around 60% of HDFC Bank’s card schemes are tied to Mastercard Diners and AmEx. For ICICI Bank and Axis Bank 35-36% are linked to Mastercard. The card portfolio of Kotak Mahindra Bank is allied with Visa.

What do the RBI guidelines stipulate?

By the RBI circular on Storage of Payment System Data dated April 6 2018 all system providers were directed to ensure that within six months the entire data (full end-to-end transaction details information collected or carried or processed as part of the message or payment instruction) relating to payment systems operated by them is stored in a system only in India. They were also required to report compliance to the RBI and submit a board-approved system audit report conducted by a CERT-In empanelled auditor within the timelines specified. However credit and card firms with global operations have been resisting the move citing costs security risk lack of clarity timeline and the possibility of data localisation demand from other countries.

According to Kazim Rizvi Founding Director of think-tank The Dialogue the RBI’s decision to restrict entities from onboarding new customers is a crucial development in their endeavour to ensure that all payment system operators store or localise their end-to-end transaction data only in India. “The motivation behind such a move is to carry out effective law enforcement requirements as data access for law enforcement purposes has been a challenge” Rizvi said.

Why have these firms not complied?

Advertisement

The RBI had stipulated that data should be stored only in India and no copy — or mirroring — should be stored in other countries. Payment firms like Visa and Mastercard which currently store and process Indian transactions outside the country have said their systems are centralised and expressed the fear that transferring the data storage to India will cost them millions of dollars. Besides once it happens in India there could be similar demands from other countries upsetting their plans.

What has upset foreign players is that domestic payment companies including e-commerce firms which are storing the data within India were putting pressure for data storage within the country. While the Finance Ministry had suggested some easing of norms in transferring the data the RBI has refused to budge stating that the payment systems need closer monitoring in the wake of the rising use of digital transactions. It’s not clear if Visa has obliged the RBI and transferred data storage to India.

Is there a way out?

Experts agree that it is necessary for all entities to comply with the RBI’s localisation mandate. “At the same time however it’s true that hard localisation may impact India’s payments ecosystem” Rizvi said.

“To have a more effective mechanism for law enforcement we need to move beyond MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty) which is slow and ineffective to a system based on bilateral treaties on data transfers with the EU UK and the US. Here the idea must be to ensure that Indian law enforcement requirements of access to data are met in a timely manner while at the same time allowing data flows to foster innovation and trade in the tech ecosystem” Rizvi said. However the RBI is against the suggestion that a copy of data stored outside be brought to India.

What’s the role of card networks?

Firms such as Mastercard Visa and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) are Payment System Operators authorised to operate a card network in India under the Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) Act 2007. Under the Act the RBI is the authority for the regulation and supervision of payment systems in India. The RBI’s payment system enables payments to be effected between a payer and a beneficiary and involves the process of clearing payment or settlement or all of them.

Funds transferred using debit or credit cards are routed through platforms such as Mastercard Visa and NPCI. The RBI has decided to allow non-bank entities — Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers card networks White Label ATM (WLA) operators Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms – to become members of the centralised payment system (CPS) and effect fund transfer through RTGS and NEFT.

How big is India’s card business?

According to RBI data there were 90.23 crore debit cards and 6.23 crore credit cards in India as of May 2021.

Introduction

NSO Group claims that its Pegasus spyware is only used to “investigate terrorism and crime” and “leaves no traces whatsoever”. This Forensic Methodology Report shows that neither of these statements are true. This report accompanies the release of the Pegasus Project a collaborative investigation that involves more than 80 journalists from 17 media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories with technical support of Amnesty International’s Security Lab.[1]

Amnesty International’s Security Lab has performed in-depth forensic analysis of numerous mobile devices from human rights defenders (HRDs) and journalists around the world. This research has uncovered widespread persistent and ongoing unlawful surveillance and human rights abuses perpetrated using NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.

As laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights NSO Group should urgently take pro-active steps to ensure that it does not cause or contribute to human rights abuses within its global operations and to respond to any human rights abuses when they do occur. In order to meet that responsibility NSO Group must carry out adequate human rights due diligence and take steps to ensure that HRDs and journalists do not continue to become targets of unlawful surveillance.

In this Forensic Methodology Report Amnesty International is sharing its methodology and publishing an open-source mobile forensics tool and detailed technical indicators in order to assist information security researchers and civil society with detecting and responding to these serious threats.

This report documents the forensic traces left on iOS and Android devices following targeting with the Pegasus spyware. This includes forensic records linking recent Pegasus infections back to the 2016 Pegasus payload used to target the HRD Ahmed Mansoor.

The Pegasus attacks detailed in this report and accompanying appendices are from 2014 up to as recently as July 2021. These also include so-called “zero-click” attacks which do not require any interaction from the target. Zero-click attacks have been observed since May 2018 and continue until now. Most recently a successful “zero-click” attack has been observed exploiting multiple zero-days to attack a fully patched iPhone 12 running iOS 14.6 in July 2021.

Sections 1 to 8 of this report outline the forensic traces left on mobile devices following a Pegasus infection. This evidence has been collected from the phones of HRDs and journalists in multiple countries.

Finally in section 9 the report documents the evolution of the Pegasus network infrastructure since 2016. NSO Group has redesigned their attack infrastructure by employing multiple layers of domains and servers. Repeated operational security mistakes have allowed the Amnesty International Security Lab to maintain continued visibility into this infrastructure. We are publishing a set of 700 Pegasus-related domains.

Names of several of the civil society targets in the report have been anonymized for safety and security reasons. Individuals who have been anonymized have been assigned an alphanumeric code name in this report.

1. Discovering Pegasus network injection attacks

Amnesty International’s technical investigation into NSO Group’s Pegasus intensified following our discovery of the targeting of an Amnesty International staffer and a Saudi activist Yahya Assiri in 2018. Amnesty International’s Security Lab began refining its forensics methodology through the discovery of attacks against HRDs in Morocco in 2019 which were further corroborated by attacks we discovered against a Moroccan journalist in 2020. In this first section we detail the process which led to the discovery of these compromises.

Numerous public reports had identified NSO Group’s customers using SMS messages with Pegasus exploit domains over the years. As a result similar messages emerged from our analysis of the phone of Moroccan activist Maati Monjib who was one of the activists targeted as documented in Amnesty International’s 2019 report.

However on further analysis we also noticed suspicious redirects recorded in Safari’s browsing history. For example in one case we noticed a redirect to an odd-looking URL after Maati Monjib attempted to visit Yahoo:

Visit ID Date (UTC) URL Redirect Source Redirect Destination 16119 2019-07-22 17:42:32.475 https://yahoo.fr/ null 16120 16120 2019-07-22 17:42:32.478 https://bun54l2b67.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:30495/szev4hz 16119 null

(Please note: throughout this document we escaped malicious domains with the marking [.] to prevent accidental clicks and visits.)

The URL https://bun54l2b67.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:30495/szev4hz immediately appeared suspicious particularly because of the presence of a 4th level subdomain a non-standard high port number and a random URI similar to links contained in SMS messages previously documented in connection to NSO Group’s Pegasus. As you can see in the table above the visit to Yahoo was immediately redirected to this suspicious URL with database ID 16120.

In our October 2019 report we detail how we determined these redirections to be the result of network injection attacks performed either through tactical devices such as rogue cell towers or through dedicated equipment placed at the mobile operator. When months later we analysed the iPhone of Moroccan independent journalist Omar Radi who as documented in our 2020 report was targeted we found similar records involving the free247downloads[.]com domain as well.

In November 2019 after Amnesty International’s initial report a new domain urlpush[.]net was registered. We found it subsequently involved in similar redirects to the URL https://gnyjv1xltx.info8fvhgl3.urlpush[.]net:30875/zrnv5revj.

Although Safari history records are typically short lived and are lost after a few months (as well as potentially intentionally purged by malware) we have been able to nevertheless find NSO Group’s infection domains in other databases of Omar Radi’s phone that did not appear in Safari’s History. For example we could identify visits through Safari’s Favicon.db database which was left intact by Pegasus:

Date (UTC) URL Icon URL 2019-02-11 14:45:53 https://d9z3sz93x5ueidq3.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:30897/rdEN5YP https://d9z3sz93x5ueidq3.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:30897/favicon.ico 2019-09-13 17:01:38 https://2far1v4lv8.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:31052/meunsnyse#011356570257117296834845704022338973133022433397236 https://2far1v4lv8.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:31052/favicon.ico 2019-09-13 17:01:56 https://2far1v4lv8.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:31052/meunsnyse#068099561614626278519925358638789161572427833645389 https://2far1v4lv8.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:31052/favicon.ico 2020-01-17 11:06:32 https://gnyjv1xltx.info8fvhgl3.urlpush[.]net:30875/zrnv5revj#074196419827987919274001548622738919835556748325946%2324 https://gnyjv1xltx.info8fvhgl3.urlpush[.]net:30875/favicon.ico 2020-01-27 11:06:24 https://gnyjv1xltx.info8fvhgl3.urlpush[.]net:30875/zrnv5revj#074196419827987919274001548622738919835556748325946 https://gnyjv1xltx.info8fvhgl3.urlpush[.]net:30875/favicon.ico

As explained in the Technical Appendix of our 2020 report on Pegasus attacks in Morocco these redirects do not only happen when the target is navigating the Internet with the browser app but also when using other apps. For example in one case Amnesty International identified a network injection while Omar Radi was using the Twitter app. When previewing a link shared in his timeline the service com.apple.SafariViewService was invoked to load a Safari WebView and a redirect occurred.

Because of this we can find additional records involving the domains free247downloads[.]com and urlpush[.]net in app-specific WebKit local storage IndexedDB folders and more. In multiple cases IndexedDB files were created by Safari shortly after the network injection redirect to the Pegasus Installation Server.



In addition Safari’s Session Resource logs provide additional traces that do not consistently appear in Safari’s browsing history. It appears Safari does not record full redirect chains and might only keep history records showing the final page that was loaded. Session Resource logs recovered from the analysed phones demonstrate that additional staging domains are used as trampolines eventually leading to the infection servers. In fact these logs reveal that the very first network injection against Maati Monjib we describe at the beginning of this post also involved the domain documentpro[.]org:

Redirect Source Origin Redirect Destination yahoo.fr documentpro[.]org free247downloads[.]com

Maati Monjib visited https://yahoo.fr and a network injection forcefully redirected the browser to documentpro[.]org before further redirecting to free247downloads[.]com and proceed with the exploitation.

Similarly on a different occasion Omar Radi visited the website of French newspaper Le Parisien and a network injection redirected him through the staging domain tahmilmilafate[.]com and then eventually to free247downloads[.]com as well. We also saw tahmilmilafate[.]info used in the same way:

Redirect Source Origin Redirect Destination leparisien.fr tahmilmilafate[.]com free247downloads[.]com

In the most recent attempts Amnesty International observed against Omar Radi in January 2020 his phone was redirected to an exploitation page at gnyjv1xltx.info8fvhgl3.urlpush[.]net passing through the domain baramije[.]net. The domain baramije[.]net was registered one day before urlpush[.]net and a decoy website was set up using the open source Textpattern CMS.

Traces of network activity were not the only available indicators of compromise and further inspection of the iPhones revealed executed processes which eventually led to the establishment of a consistent pattern unique to all subsequent iPhones that Amnesty International analysed and found to be infected.

2. Pegasus’ BridgeHead and other malicious processes appear

Amnesty International Citizen Lab and others have primarily attributed Pegasus spyware attacks based on the domain names and other network infrastructure used to deliver the attacks. However forensic evidence left behind by the Pegasus spyware provides another independent way to attribute these attacks to NSO Group’s technology.

iOS maintains records of process executions and their respective network usage in two SQLite database files called “DataUsage.sqlite” and “netusage.sqlite” which are stored on the device. It is worth noting that while the former is available in iTunes backup the latter is not. Additionally it should be noted that only processes that performed network activity will appear in these databases.

Both Maati Monjib’s and Omar Radi’s network usage databases contained records of a suspicious process called “bh”. This “bh” process was observed on multiple occasions immediately following visits to Pegasus Installation domains.

Maati Monjib’s phone has records of execution of “bh” from April 2018 until March 2019:

Fist date (UTC) Last date (UTC) Process Name WWAN IN WWAN OUT Process ID 2018-04-29 00:25:12 2019-03-27 22:45:10 bh 3319875.0 144443.0 59472

Amnesty International found similar records on Omar Radi’s phone between February and September 2019:

Fist date (UTC) Last date (UTC) Process Name WWAN IN WWAN OUT Process ID 2019-02-11 14:45:56 2019-09-13 17:02:11 bh 3019409.0 147684.0 50465

The last recorded execution of “bh” occurred a few seconds after a successful network injection (as seen in the favicon records listed earlier at 2019-09-13 17:01:56).

Crucially we find references to “bh” in the Pegasus iOS sample recovered from the 2016 attacks against UAE human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor discovered by Citizen Lab and analysed in depth by cybersecurity firm Lookout.

As described in Lookout’s analysis in 2016 NSO Group leveraged a vulnerability in the iOS JavaScriptCore Binary (jsc) to achieve code execution on the device. This same vulnerability was also used to maintain persistence on the device after reboot. We find references to “bh” throughout the exploit code:

var compressed_bh_addr = shellcode_addr_aligned + shellcode32.byteLength; replacePEMagics(shellcode32 dlsym_addr compressed_bh_addr bundle.bhCompressedByteLength); storeU32Array(shellcode32 shellcode_addr); storeU32Array(bundle.bhCompressed32 compressed_bh_addr);

This module is described in Lookout’s analysis as follows:

“bh.c – Loads API functions that relate to the decompression of next stage payloads and their proper placement on the victim’s iPhone by using functions such as BZ2_bzDecompress chmod and malloc”

Lookout further explains that a configuration file located at /var/tmp/jb_cfg is dropped alongside the binary. Interestingly we find the path to this file exported as _kBridgeHeadConfigurationFilePath in the libaudio.dylib file part of the Pegasus bundle:

__const:0001AFCC EXPORT _kBridgeHeadConfigurationFilePath __const:0001AFCC _kBridgeHeadConfigurationFilePath DCD cfstr_VarTmpJb_cfg ; “/var/tmp/jb_cfg”

Therefore we suspect that “bh” might stand for “BridgeHead” which is likely the internal name assigned by NSO Group to this component of their toolkit.

The appearance of the “bh” process right after the successful network injection of Omar Radi’s phone is consistent with the evident purpose of the BridgeHead module. It completes the browser exploitation roots the device and prepares for its infection with the full Pegasus suite.

2.1 Additional suspicious processes following BridgeHead

The bh process first appeared on Omar Radi’s phone on 11 February 2019. This occurred 10 seconds after an IndexedDB file was created by the Pegasus Installation Server and a favicon entry was recorded by Safari. At around the same time the file com.apple.CrashReporter.plist file was written in /private/var/root/Library/Preferences/ likely to disable reporting of crash logs back to Apple. The exploit chain had obtained root permission at this stage.

Less than a minute later a “roleaboutd” process first appears.

Date (UTC) Event 2019-02-11 14:45:45 IndexedDB record for URL https_d9z3sz93x5ueidq3.get1tn0w.free247downloads.com_30897/ 2019-02-11 14:45:53 Safari Favicon record for URL hxxps//d9z3sz93x5ueidq3.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:30897/rdEN5YP 2019-02-11 14:45:54 Crash reporter disabled by writing com.apple.CrashReporter.plist 2019-02-11 14:45:56 Process: bh 2019-02-11 14:46:23 Process: roleaboutd first 2019-02-11 17:05:24 Process: roleaboutd last

Omar Radi’s device was exploited again on the 13 September 2019. Again a “bh” process started shortly afterwards. Around this time the com.apple.softwareupdateservicesd.plist file was modified. A “msgacntd” process was also launched.

Date (UTC) Event 2019-09-13 17:01:38 Safari Favicon record for URL hxxps://2far1v4lv8.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:31052/meunsnyse 2019-09-13 17:02:11 Process: bh 2019-09-13 17:02:33 Process: msgacntd first 2019-09-13 17:02:35 File modified: com.apple.softwareupdateservicesd.plist 2019-09-14 20:51:54 Process: msgacntd last

Based on the timing and context of exploitation Amnesty International believes the roleaboutd and msgacntd processes are a later stage of the Pegasus spyware which was loaded after a successful exploitation and privilege escalation with the BridgeHead payload.

Similarly the forensic analysis of Maati Monjib’s phone revealed the execution of more suspicious processes in addition to bh. A process named pcsd and one named fmld appeared in 2018:

Fist date Last date Process Name WWAN IN WWAN OUT Process ID 2018-05-04 23:30:45 2018-05-04 23:30:45 pcsd 12305.0 10173.0 14946 2018-05-21 23:46:06 2018-06-4 13:05:43 fmld 0.0 188326.0 21207

Amnesty International verified that no legitimate binaries of the same names were distributed in recent versions of iOS.

The discovery of these processes on Omar Radi’s and Maati Monjib’s phones later became instrumental for Amnesty International’s continued investigations as we found processes with the same names on devices of targeted individuals from around the world.

3. Pegasus processes following potential Apple Photos exploitation

During Amnesty International’s investigations as part of The Pegasus Project we discovered additional cases where the above mentioned “bh” process was recorded on devices compromised through different attack vectors.

In one instance the phone of a French human rights lawyer (CODE: FRHRL1) was compromised and the “bh” process was executed seconds after network traffic for the iOS Photos app (com.apple.mobileslideshow) was recorded for the first time. Again after a successful exploitation crash reporting was disabled by writing a com.apple.CrashReporter.plist file to the device.

2019-10-29 09:04:32 Process: mobileslideshow/com.apple.mobileslideshow first 2019-10-29 09:04:58 Process: bh 2019-10-29 09:05:08 com.apple.CrashReporter.plist dropped 2019-10-29 09:05:53 Process: mptbd

The next and last time network activity for the iOS Photos app was recorded was on 18 December 2019 again preceding the execution of malicious processes on the device.

2019-12-18 08:13:33 Process: mobileslideshow/com.apple.mobileslideshow last 2019-12-18 08:13:47 Process: bh 2019-12-18 11:50:15 Process: ckeblld

In a separate case we identified a similar pattern with the “mobileslideshow” and “bh” processes on the iPhone of a French journalist (CODE: FRJRN1) in May 2020:

2020-05-24 15:44:21 Process: mobileslideshow/com.apple.mobileslideshow first 2020-05-24 15:44:39 Process: bh 2020-05-24 15:46:51 Process: fservernetd … 2020-05-27 16:58:31 Process: mobileslideshow/com.apple.mobileslideshow last 2020-05-27 16:58:52 Process: bh 2020-05-27 18:00:50 Process: ckkeyrollfd

Amnesty International was not able to capture payloads related this exploitation but suspects that the iOS Photos app or the Photostream service were used as part of an exploit chain to deploy Pegasus. The apps themselves may have been exploited or their functionality misused to deliver a more traditional JavaScript or browser exploit to the device.

As you can see from the tables above additional process names such as mptbd ckeblld fservernetd and ckkeyrollfd appear right after bh. As with fmld and pcsd Amnesty International believes these to be additional payloads downloaded and executed after a successful compromise. As our investigations progressed we identified dozens of malicious process names involved in Pegasus infections.

Additionally Amnesty International found the same iCloud account bogaardlisa803[@]gmail.com recorded as linked to the “com.apple.private.alloy.photostream” service on both devices. Purposefully created iCloud accounts seem to be central to the delivery of multiple “zero-click” attack vectors in many recent cases of compromised devices analysed by Amnesty International.

4. An iMessage zero-click 0day used widely in 2019

While SMS messages carrying malicious links were the tactic of choice for NSO Group’s customers between 2016 and 2018 in more recent years they appear to have become increasingly rare. The discovery of network injection attacks in Morocco signalled that the attackers’ tactics were indeed changing. Network injection is an effective and cost-efficient attack vector for domestic use especially in countries with leverage over mobile operators. However while it is only effective on domestic networks the targeting of foreign targets or of individuals in diaspora communities also changed.

From 2019 an increasing amount of vulnerabilities in iOS especially iMessage and FaceTime started getting patched thanks to their discoveries by vulnerability researchers or to cybersecurity vendors reporting exploits discovered in-the-wild.

In response Amnesty International extended its forensic methodology to collect any relevant traces by iMessage and FaceTime. iOS keeps a record of Apple IDs seen by each installed application in a plist file located at /private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist. This file is also typically available in a regular iTunes backup so it can be easily extracted without the need of a jailbreak.

These records played critical role in later investigations. In many cases we discovered suspected Pegasus processes executed on devices immediately following suspicious iMessage account lookups. For example the following records were extracted from the phone of a French journalist (CODE FRJRN2):

2019-08-16 12:08:44 Lookup of [email protected] by com.apple.madrid (iMessage) 2019-08-16 12:33:52 Lookup of bergers.o79@gmail\x00\x00om by com.apple.madrid (iMessage) 2019-08-16 12:37:55 The file Library/Preferences/com.apple.CrashReporter.plist is created within RootDomain 2019-08-16 12:41:25 The file Library/Preferences/roleaccountd.plist is created within RootDomain 2019-08-16 12:41:36 Process: roleaccountd 2019-08-16 12:41:52 Process: stagingd 2019-08-16 12:49:21 Process: aggregatenotd *The date of the first entry for FRJRN2 was updated on 11 Jan 2023 to correct a typo.

Amnesty International’s forensic analysis of multiple devices found similar records. In many cases the same iMessage account reoccurs across multiple targeted devices potentially indicating that those devices have been targeted by the same operator. Additionally the processes roleaccountd and stagingd occur consistently along with others.

For example the iPhone of a Hungarian journalist (CODE HUJRN1) instead showed the following records:

2019-09-24 13:26:15 Lookup of [email protected] by com.apple.madrid (iMessage) 2019-09-24 13:26:51 Lookup of [email protected] by com.apple.madrid (iMessage) 2019-09-24 13:32:10 Process: roleaccountd 2019-09-24 13:32:13 Process: stagingd

In this case the first suspicious processes performing some network activity were recorded 5 minutes after the first lookup. The com.apple.CrashReporter.plist file was already present on this device after a previous successful infection and was not written again.

The iPhone of yet another Hungarian journalist (CODE HUJRN2) show lookups for the same iMessage accounts along with numerous other processes along with roleaccountd and stagingd:

2019-07-15 12:01:37 Lookup of mailto:e\x00\x00[email protected] by com.apple.madrid (iMessage) 2019-07-15 14:21:40 Process: accountpfd 2019-08-29 10:57:43 Process: roleaccountd 2019-08-29 10:57:44 Process: stagingd 2019-08-29 10:58:35 Process: launchrexd 2019-09-03 07:54:26 Process: roleaccountd 2019-09-03 07:54:28 Process: stagingd 2019-09-03 07:54:51 Process: seraccountd 2019-09-05 13:26:38 Process: seraccountd 2019-09-05 13:26:55 Process: misbrigd 2019-09-10 06:09:04 Lookup of [email protected] by com.apple.madrid (iMessage) 2019-09-10 06:09:47 Lookup of [email protected] by com.apple.madrid (iMessage) 2019-10-30 14:09:51 Process: nehelprd

It is interesting to note that in the traces Amnesty International recovered from 2019 the iMessage lookups that immediately preceded the execution of suspicious processes often contained two-bytes 0x00 padding in the email address recorded by the ID Status Cache file.

5. Apple Music leveraged to deliver Pegasus in 2020

In mid-2021 Amnesty International identified yet another case of a prominent investigative journalist from Azerbaijan (CODE AZJRN1) who was repeatedly targeted using Pegasus zero-click attacks from 2019 until mid-2021.

Yet again we found a similar pattern of forensic traces on the device following the first recorded successful exploitation:

2019-03-28 07:43:14 File: Library/Preferences/com.apple.CrashReporter.plist from RootDomain 2019-03-28 07:44:03 File: Library/Preferences/roleaccountd.plist from RootDomain 2019-03-28 07:44:14 Process: roleaccountd 2019-03-28 07:44:14 Process: stagingd

Interestingly we found signs of a new iOS infection technique being used to compromise this device. A successful infection occurred on 10th July 2020:

2020-07-06 05:22:21 Lookup of f\x00\[email protected] by iMessage (com.apple.madrid) 2020-07-10 14:12:09 Pegasus request by Apple Music app: https://x1znqjo0x8b8j.php78mp9v.opposedarrangement[.]net:37271/afAVt89Wq/stadium/pop2.html?key=501_4&n=7 2020-07-10 14:12:21 Process: roleaccountd 2020-07-10 14:12:53 Process: stagingd 2020-07-13 05:05:17 Pegasus request by Apple Music app:

https://4n3d9ca2st. php78mp9v.opposedarrangement[.]net:37891/w58Xp5Z/stadium/pop2.html?key=501_4&n=7

Shortly before Pegasus was launched on the device we saw network traffic recorded for the Apple Music service. These HTTP requests were recovered from a network cache file located at /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/D6A69566-55F7-4757-96DE-EBA612685272/Library/Caches/com.apple.Music/Cache.db which we retrieved by jailbreaking the device.

Amnesty International cannot determine from forensics if Apple Music was itself exploited to deliver the initial infection or if instead the app was abused as part of a sandbox escape and privilege escalation chain. Recent research has shown that built-in apps such as the iTunes Store app can be abused to run a browser exploit while escaping the restrictive Safari application sandbox.

Most importantly however the HTTP request performed by the Apple Music app points to the domain opposedarrangement[.]net which we had previously identified as belonging to NSO Group’s Pegasus network infrastructure. This domain matched a distinctive fingerprint we devised while conducting Internet-wide scans following our discovery of the network injection attacks in Morocco (see section 9).

In addition these URLs show peculiar characteristics typical of other URLs we found involved in Pegasus attacks through the years as explained in the next section.

6. Megalodon: iMessage zero-click 0-days return in 2021

The analysis Amnesty International conducted of several devices reveal traces of attacks similar to those we observed in 2019. These attacks have been observed as recently as July 2021. Amnesty International believes Pegasus is currently being delivered through zero-click exploits which remain functional through the latest available version of iOS at the time of writing (July 2021).

On the iPhone of a French human rights lawyer (CODE FRHRL2) we observed a lookup of a suspicious iMessage account unknown to the victim followed by an HTTP request performed by the com.apple.coretelephony process. This is a component of iOS involved in all telephony-related tasks and likely among those exploited in this attack. We found traces of this HTTP request in a cache file stored on disk at /private/var/wireless/Library/Caches/com.apple.coretelephony/Cache.db containing metadata on the request and the response. The phone sent information on the device including the model 91 (iPhone 7) and iOS build number 18C66 (version 14.3) to a service fronted by Amazon CloudFront suggesting NSO Group has switched to using AWS services in recent months. At the time of this attack the newer iOS version 14.4 had only been released for a couple of weeks.

The Cache.db file for com.apple.coretelephony contains details about the HTTP response which appeared to have been a download of ~250kb of binary data. Indeed we found the downloaded binary in the fsCachedData sub-folder but it was unfortunately encrypted. Amnesty International believes this to be the payload launched as gatekeeperd.

Amnesty International subsequently analysed the iPhone of a journalist (CODE MOJRN1) which contained very similar records. This device was exploited repeatedly on numerous times between February and April 2021 and across iOS releases. The most recent attempt showed the following indicators of compromise:

As is evident the same iMessage account observed in the previous separate case was involved in this exploitation and compromise months later. The same CloudFront website was contacted by com.apple.coretelephony and the additional processes executed downloaded and launched additional malicious components.

The initial check-in indicates the compromised iPhone 6s was running iOS 14.4 (build number 18D52) at the time of the attack. Although versions 14.4.1 and 14.4.2 were already available then they only addressed vulnerabilities in WebKit so it is safe to assume the vulnerability leveraged in these iMessage attacks was exploited as a 0-day.

It is worth noting that among the many other malicious process names observed executed on this phone we see msgacntd which we also found running on Omar Radi’s phone in 2019 as documented earlier.

In addition it should be noted that the URLs we have observed used in attacks throughout the last three years show a consistent set of patterns. This supports Amnesty International’s analysis that all three URLs are in fact components of Pegasus customer attack infrastructure. The Apple Music attack from 2020 shows the same 4th level domain structure and non-standard high port number as the 2019 network injection attack. Both the free247downloads[.]com and opposedarrangements[.]net domains matched our Pegasus V4 domain fingerprint.

Additionally the Apple Music attack URL and the 2021 Megalodon attack URLs share a distinctive pattern. Both URL paths start with a random identifier tied to the attack attempt followed by the word “stadium”.

Amnesty International reported this information to Amazon who informed us they “acted quickly to shut down the implicated infrastructure and accounts”.[2]

The iPhone 11 of a French human rights activist (CODE FRHRD1) also showed an iMessage look-up for the account linakeller2203[@]gmail.com on June 11th 2021 and malicious processes afterwards. The phone was running iOS 14.4.2 and was upgraded to 14.6 the following day.

Most recently Amnesty International has observed evidence of compromise of the iPhone XR of an Indian journalist (CODE INJRN1) running iOS 14.6 (latest available at the time of writing) as recently as 16th June 2021. Lastly Amnesty International has confirmed an active infection of the iPhone X of an activist (CODE RWHRD1) on June 24th 2021 also running iOS 14.6. While we have not been able to extract records from Cache.db databases due to the inability to jailbreak these two devices additional diagnostic data extracted from these iPhones show numerous iMessage push notifications immediately preceding the execution of Pegasus processes.

The device of a Rwandan activist (CODE RWHRD1) shows evidence of multiple successful zero-click infections in May and June 2021. We can see one example of this on 17 May 2021. An unfamiliar iMessage account is recorded and in the following minutes at least 20 iMessage attachment chunks are created on disk.

Amnesty International found no evidence that the 17 May attack was successful. Later attacks on the 18 June and 23 June were successful and led to Pegasus payloads being deployed on the device.

Initially many iMessage (com.apple.madrid) push notifications were received and attachment chunks were written to disk. The following table show a sample of the 48 attachment files found on the filesystem.

A process crash occurred at 20:48:56 which resulted in the ReportCrash process starting followed by restarts of multiple processes related to iMessage processing:

A second set of crashes and restarts happened five minutes later. TheReportCrash process was started along with processes related to parsing of iMessage content and iMessage custom avatars.

Shortly afterwards at 20:54 the exploitation succeeded and we observe that a network request was made by the com.apple.coretelephony process causing the Cache.db file to be modified. This matches the behaviour Amnesty International hasseen in the other Pegasus zero-click attacks in 2021.

Lastly the analysis of a fully patched iPhone 12 running iOS 14.6 of an Indian journalist (CODE INJRN2) also revealed signs of successful compromise. These most recent discoveries indicate NSO Group’s customers are currently able to remotely compromise all recent iPhone models and versions of iOS.

We have reported this information to Apple who informed us they are investigating the matter.[3]

7. Incomplete attempts to hide evidence of compromise

Several iPhones Amnesty International has inspected indicate that Pegasus has recently started to manipulate system databases and records on infected devices to hide its traces and and impede the research efforts of Amnesty International and other investigators.

Interestingly this manipulation becomes evident when verifying the consistency of leftover records in the DataUsage.sqlite and netusage.sqlite SQLite databases. Pegasus has deleted the names of malicious processes from the ZPROCESS table in DataUsage database but not the corresponding entries from the ZLIVEUSAGE table. The ZPROCESS table stores rows containing a process ID and the process name. The ZLIVEUSAGE table contains a row for each running process including data transfer volume and the process ID corresponding to the ZPROCESS entry. These inconsistencies can be useful in identifying times when infections may have occurred. Additional Pegasus indicators of compromise were observed on all devices where this anomaly was observed. No similar inconsistencies were found on any clean iPhones analysed by Amnesty International.

Although most recent records are now being deleted from these databases traces of recent process executions can also be recovered also from additional diagnostic logs from the system.

For example the following records were recovered from the phone of an HRD (CODE RWHRD1):

System log files also reveal the location of Pegasus binaries on disk. These file names match those we have consistently observed in the process execution logs presented earlier. The binaries are located inside the folder /private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/ which is consistent with the findings by Citizen Lab in a December 2020 report.

/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/launchrexd/EACA3532-7D15-32EE-A88A-96989F9F558A

Amnesty International’s investigations corroborated by secondary information we have received seem to suggest that Pegasus is no longer maintaining persistence on iOS devices. Therefore binary payloads associated with these processes are not recoverable from the non-volatile filesystem. Instead one would need to be able to jailbreak the device without reboot and attempt to extract payloads from memory.

8. Pegasus processes disguised as iOS system services

Across the numerous forensic analyses conducted by Amnesty International on devices around the world we found a consistent set of malicious process names executed on compromised phones. While some processes for example bh seem to be unique to a particular attack vector most Pegasus process names seem to be simply disguised to appear as legitimate iOS system processes perhaps to fool forensic investigators inspecting logs.

Several of these process names spoof legitimate iOS binaries:

The list of process names we associate with Pegasus infections is available among all other indicators of compromise on our GitHub page.

9. Unravelling the Pegasus attack infrastructure over the years

The set of domain names servers and infrastructure used to deliver and collect data from NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware has evolved several times since first publicly disclosed by Citizen Lab in 2016.

In August 2018 Amnesty International published a report “Amnesty International Among Targets of NSO-powered Campaign“ which described the targeting of an Amnesty International staff member and a Saudi human rights defender. In this report Amnesty International presented an excerpt of more than 600 domain names tied to NSO Group’s attack infrastructure. Amnesty International published the full list of domains in October 2018. In this report we refer to these domains as Pegasus network Version 3 (V3).

The Version 3 infrastructure used a network of VPS’s and dedicated servers. Each Pegasus Installation server or Command-and-Control (C&C) server hosted a web server on port 443 with a unique domain and TLS certificate. These edge servers would then proxy connections through a chain of servers referred to by NSO Group as the “Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network” (PATN).

It was possible to create a pair of fingerprints for the distinctive set of TLS cipher suites supported by these servers. The fingerprint technique is conceptually similar to the JA3S fingerprint technique published by Salesforce in 2019. With that fingerprint Amnesty International’s Security Lab performed Internet-wide scans to identify Pegasus Installation/infection and C&C servers active in the summer of 2018.

NSO Group made critical operational security mistakes when setting up their Version 3 infrastructure. Two domains of the previous Version 2 network were reused in their Version 3 network. These two Version 2 domains pine-sales[.]com and ecommerce-ads[.]org had previously been identified by Citizen Lab. These mistakes allowed Amnesty International to link the attempted attack on our colleague to NSO Group’s Pegasus product. These links were independently confirmed by Citizen Lab in a 2018 report.

NSO Group rapidly shutdown many of their Version 3 servers shortly after the Amnesty International and Citizen Lab’s publications on 1 August 2018.

9.1 Further attempts by NSO Group to hide their infrastructure

In August 2019 the Amnesty International identified another case of NSO Group’s tools being used to target a human rights defender this time in Morocco. Maati Monjib was targeted with SMS messages containing Version 3 Pegasus links.

Amnesty performed a forensic analysis of his iPhone as described previously. This forensic analysis showed redirects to a new domain name free247downloads.com. These links looked suspiciously similar to infection links previously used by NSO.

Amnesty International confirmed this domain was tied to NSO Group by observing distinctive Pegasus artefacts created on the device shortly after the infection URL was opened. With this new domain in hand we were able to begin mapping the Pegasus Version 4 (V4) infrastructure.

NSO Group re-factored their infrastructure to introduce additional layers which complicated discovery. Nevertheless we could now observe at least 4 servers used in each infection chain.

Validation domain: https://baramije[.]net/[ALPHANUMERIC STRING] Exploit domain: https://[REDACTED].info8fvhgl3.urlpush[.]net:30827/[SAME ALPHANUMERIC STRING]

A validation server: The first step was a website which we have seen hosted on shared hosting providers. Frequently this website was running a random and sometimes obscure PHP application or CMS. Amnesty International believes this was an effort to make the domains look less distinguishable.



The validation server would check the incoming request. If a request had a valid and still active URL the validation server would redirect the victim to the newly generated exploit server domain. If the URL or device was not valid it would redirect to a legitimate decoy website. Any passer-by or Internet crawler would only see the decoy PHP CMS.

Infection DNS server: NSO now appears to be using a unique subdomain for every exploit attempt. Each subdomain was generated and only active for a short period of time. This prevented researchers from finding the location of the exploit server based on historic device logs.



To dynamically resolve these subdomains NSO Group ran a custom DNS server under a subdomain for every infection domain. It also obtained a wildcard TLS certificate which would be valid for each generated subdomain such as *.info8fvhgl3.urlpush[.]net or *.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com.

Pegasus Installation Server: To serve the actual infection payload NSO Group needs to run a web server somewhere on the Internet. Again NSO Group took steps to avoid internet scanning by running the web server on a random high port number.



We assume that each infection webserver is part of the new generation “Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network”. Connections to the infection server are likely proxied back to the customer’s Pegasus infrastructure.

Command and Control server: In previous generations of the PATN NSO Group used separate domains for the initial infection and later communication with the spyware. The iPwn report from Citizen Lab provided evidence that Pegasus is again using separate domains for command and control. To avoid network-based discovery the Pegasus spyware made direct connections the Pegasus C&C servers without first performing a DNS lookup or sending the domain name in the TLS SNI field.

9.2 Identifying other NSO attack domains

Amnesty International began by analysing the configuration of the infection domains and DNS servers used in the attacks against Moroccan journalists and human rights defenders.

Based on our knowledge of the domains used in Morocco we developed a fingerprint which identified 201 Pegasus Installation domains which had infrastructure active at the time of the initial scan. This set of 201 domains included both urlpush[.]net and free247downloads[.]com.

Amnesty International identified an additional 500 domains with subsequent network scanning and by clustering patterns of domain registration TLS certificate issuance and domain composition which matched the initial set of 201 domains.

Amnesty International believes that this represents a significant portion of the Version 4 NSO Group attack infrastructure. We are publishing these 700 domains today. We recommend the civil society and media organisations check their network telemetry and/or DNS logs for traces of these indicators of compromise.

9.3 What can be learned from NSO Group’s infrastructure

The following chart shows the evolution of NSO Group Pegasus infrastructure over a 4-year period from 2016 until mid-2021. Much of the Version 3 infrastructure was abruptly shut down in August 2018 following our report on an Amnesty International staff member targeted with Pegasus. The Version 4 infrastructure was then gradually rolled out beginning in September and October 2018.

© Amnesty International

A significant number of new domains were registered in November 2019 shortly after WhatsApp notified their users about alleged targeting with Pegasus. This may reflect NSO rotating domains due to perceived risk of discovery or because of disruption to their existing hosting infrastructure.

The V4 DNS server infrastructure began going offline in early 2021 following the Citizen Lab iPwn report which disclosed multiple Pegasus V4 domains.

Amnesty International suspects the shutting down of the V4 infrastructure coincided with NSO Group’s shift to using cloud services such as Amazon CloudFront to deliver the earlier stages of their attacks. The use of cloud services protects NSO Group from some Internet scanning techniques.

9.4 Attack infrastructure hosted primarily in Europe and North America

NSO Group’s Pegasus infrastructure primarily consists of servers hosted at datacentres located in European countries. The countries hosting the most infection domain DNS servers included Germany the United Kingdom Switzerland France and the United States (US).

Country Servers per country Germany 212 United Kingdom 79 Switzerland 36 France 35 United States 28 Finland 9 Netherlands 5 Canada 4 Ukraine 4 Singapore 3 India 3 Austria 3 Japan 1 Bulgaria 1 Lithuania 1 Bahrain 1

The following table shows the number of DNS servers hosted with each hosting provider. Most identified servers are assigned to the US-owned hosting companies Digital Ocean Linode and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Many hosting providers offer server hosting in multiple physical locations. Based on these two tables it appears that NSO Group is primarily using the European datacentres run by American hosting companies to run much of the attack infrastructure for its customers.

9.5 Infection domain resolutions observed in Passive DNS database

Based on forensic analysis of compromised devices Amnesty International determined that NSO Group was using a unique and randomly generated subdomain for each attempt to deliver the Pegasus spyware.

Amnesty International searched passive DNS datasets for each of the Pegasus Version 4 domains we have identified. Passive DNS databases record historic DNS resolution for a domain and often included subdomains and the corresponding historic IP address.

A subdomain will only be recorded in passive DNS records if the subdomain was successfully resolved and the resolution transited a network which was running a passive DNS probe.

This probe data is collected based on agreements between network operators and passive DNS data providers. Many networks will not be covered by such data collection agreements. For example no passive DNS resolutions were recorded for either Pegasus infection domains used in Morocco.

As such these resolutions represent only a small subset of overall NSO Group Pegasus activity.

The domain urlredirect.net had the highest number of observed unique subdomains. In total 417 resolutions were recorded between 4 October 2018 and 17 September 2019. The second highest was mailappzone.com which has 410 resolutions in a 3-month period between 23 July 2020 and 15 October 2020.

Amnesty International believes that each of these subdomain resolutions 1748 in total represent an attempt to compromise a device with Pegasus. These 23 domains represent less than 7% of the 379 Pegasus Installation Server domains we have identified. Based on this small subset Pegasus may have been used in thousands of attacks over the past three years.

10. Mobile devices security and auditability

Much of the targeting outlined in this report involves Pegasus attacks targeting iOS devices. It is important to note that this does not necessarily reflect the relative security of iOS devices compared to Android devices or other operating systems and phone manufacturers.

In Amnesty International’s experience there are significantly more forensic traces accessible to investigators on Apple iOS devices than on stock Android devices therefore our methodology is focused on the former. As a result most recent cases of confirmed Pegasus infections have involved iPhones.

This and all previous investigations demonstrate how attacks against mobile devices are a significant threat to civil society globally. The difficulty to not only prevent but posthumously detect attacks is the result of an unsustainable asymmetry between the capabilities readily available to attackers and the inadequate protections that individuals at risk enjoy.

While iOS devices provide at least some useful diagnostics historical records are scarce and easily tampered with. Other devices provide little to no help conducting consensual forensics analysis. Although much can be done to improve the security posture of mobile devices and mitigate the risks of attacks such as those documented in this report even more could be achieved by improving the ability for device owners and technical experts to perform regular checks of the system’s integrity.

Therefore Amnesty International strongly encourages device vendors to explore options to make their devices more auditable without of course sacrificing any security and privacy protections already in place. Platform developers and phone manufacturers should regularly engage in conversations with civil society to better understand the challenges faced by HRDs who are often under-represented in cybersecurity debates.

11. With our Methodology we release our tools and indicators

For a long time triaging the state of a suspected compromised mobile device has been considered a near-impossible task particularly within the human rights communities we work in. Through the work of Amnesty International’s Security Lab we have built important capabilities that may benefit our peers and colleagues supporting activists journalists and lawyers who are at risk.

Therefore through this report we are not only sharing the methodology we have built over years of research but also the tools we created to facilitate this work as well as the Pegasus indicators of compromise we have collected.

All indicators of compromise are available on our GitHub  including domain names of Pegasus infrastructure email addresses recovered from iMessage account lookups involved in the attacks and all process names Amnesty International has identified as associated with Pegasus.

Amnesty International is also releasing a tool we have created called Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT). MVT is a modular tool that simplifies the process of acquiring and analysing data from Android devices and the analysis of records from iOS backups and filesystem dumps specifically to identify potential traces of compromise.

© Amnesty International

MVT can be provided with indicators of compromise in STIX2 format and will identify any matching indicators found on the device. In conjunction with Pegasus indicators MVT can help identify if an iPhone have been compromised.

Among others some of the features MVT has include:

Decrypt encrypted iOS backups.

Process and parse records from numerous iOS system and apps databases and system logs.

Extract installed applications from Android devices.

Extract diagnostic information from Android devices through the adb protocol.

Compare extracted records to a provided list of malicious indicators in STIX2 format. Automatically identify malicious SMS messages visited websites malicious processes and more.

Generate JSON logs of extracted records and separate JSON logs of all detected malicious traces.

Generate a unified chronological timeline of extracted records along with a timeline all detected malicious traces.

In a statement on Saturday the Core Group called for the creation of “a consensual and inclusive government” in Haiti which long before Moise’s killing had seen mounting gang violence and political instability.

“To this end it strongly encourages the designated Prime Minister Ariel Henry to continue the mission entrusted to him to form such a government” the statement reads.

The Core Group is composed of ambassadors from Germany Brazil Canada Spain the United States France the European Union and representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of American States.

The group also asked that “all political economic and civil society actors in the country fully support authorities in their efforts to restore security”.

Moise’s assassination on July 7 has worsened the already unstable political situation in Haiti as the Caribbean nation’s constitution is unclear about who should take over and the president had been leading by decree for more than a year amid several defunct state institutions.

Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph has been leading the country with the backing of police and the military despite the fact that Moise had announced his replacement a day before the president was killed.

Joseph and his allies argue that the designated successor Henry was never sworn in though he pledged to work with him and with Joseph Lambert the head of Haiti’s inactive Senate.

Leading civil society activists have said any solution to the current crises facing the country must be Haitian-led. Many have rejected a push by the US and UN to hold general elections later this year saying continuing instability makes holding a free and fair election impossible.

Haitian journalist and activist Monique Clesca rejected the Core Group’s statement on Saturday.

“This is interference” Clesca wrote on Twitter. “Worse this is being done while civil society & political parties are meeting to decide the way forward!”

Haitian civil society and political groups have formed a commission to try to find a Haitian solution to the crises and Clesca said earlier on Saturday that people were meeting to develop a draft agreement.

Once again Core Group who takes itself for #Haiti’s ruler rather than shutting up is now siding with Ariel Henry to form a government.

This is interference

Worse this is being done while civil society & political parties are meeting to decide the way forward!#PersonaNonGrata — Monique Clesca (@moniclesca) July 17 2021

Magali Comeau Denis a former Haitian minister of culture and communications and the spokesperson for the commission told US news programme Democracy Now! last week that Haiti was in “an extra-constitutional situation”.

Comeau Denis said the commission aims “create a broad consensus between all the sectors of the population to propose a Haitian solution” to the crises. “There is no other legal answer to that situation of exception” she said.

Robert Fatton a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia said the Core Group’s statement is very confusing especially after the UN representative had said that Joseph was in charge. “More confusion in a very confusing and bewildering situation” he told The Associated Press.

Also responding to the statement Emmanuela Douyon executive director of Haitian think tank Policite said “attention must be paid to their refusal to wait for the outcome of the political conference”.

“They are short-circuiting this initiative by reaching out to Ariel Henry. Watch out!” she tweeted.

Jake Johnston a senior research associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington DC and an expert on Haiti also said the Core Group statement was “a snub to parts of the opposition who issued statement opposing Henry yesterday and to civil society commission which is meeting today”.

The Core Group statement isn't about snubbing Claude Joseph who had already accepted begrudgingly perhaps to join Henry's government. It's a snub to parts of the opposition who issued statement opposing Henry yesterday and to civil society commission which is meeting today. — Jake Johnston (@JakobJohnston) July 17 2021

Meanwhile questions persist around the motive behind Moise’s assassination as well as who ordered it.

Haitian authorities have accused a group of mercenaries including 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans of opening fire on the president and his wife Martine Moise in the early hours of July 7 at their home in the capital Port-au-Prince.

Eighteen of the Colombians have been arrested while five are on the run and three were killed.

Haitian police said last week they arrested the alleged mastermind of the operation a 63-year-old Haitian man living in the US state of Florida named Christian Emmanuel Sanon.

Colombian police chief General Jorge Vargas also said on Friday that former Haitian justice ministry official Joseph Felix Badio may have ordered the killing. It was not immediately possible to reach Badio for comment and his whereabouts were unclear.

Moise’s funeral is expected to take place on July 23 in Cap-Haitien a city in the country’s north.

Frantz Exantus Haiti’s secretary of state for communication tweeted on Saturday that Moise’s widow Martine Moise who was seriously injured in the attack and was treated in the US had returned to Haiti to prepare for the funeral.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbnJvZW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy8xOC9pdHMtdGltZS1nZXQtYmFuZHdhZ29uLXUtcy1tZW5zLXNvY2Nlci10ZWFtLWZ1bi13YXRjaC83OTkxMzY4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's time to get on the bandwagon: the U.S. men's soccer team is fun to watch,"The Monroe News

Hear me out: I'd like to talk about soccer and I would really appreciate it if you didn't immediately stop reading this column.

I know that European football still lacks widespread appeal in the states. But between the worldwide appeal of Europe's Premier League the growing popularity of the homegrown Major League Soccer and the decades of dominance that the United States Women's National Team have displayed (four World Cups and four Olympic gold medals - but who's counting?) there are certainly plenty of reasons for Americans to love the Beautiful Game.

Anyone who knows anything about soccer in America might find it ironic that watching the U.S. Mens National Team was actually what got me hooked on the sport just a few years ago.

The USMNT has struggled in recent years with the lowlight being a loss to lowly Trinidad and Tobago in October 2017 that ensured the Stars and Stripes wouldn't qualify for the 2018 World Cup. It was the first time since 1986 that the U.S. had failed to reach the tournament.

The Americans also failed to qualify for the Olympics this year.

But since that point the team has been slowly but steadily rebuilding under current head coach Gregg Berhalter. Leading the charge has been Pennsylvania wunderkind Christian Pulisic who at just 22 years old has already planted himself firmly in the conversation about the greatest American-born men's soccer player of all time (admittedly not the highest bar anyone has ever hurdled).

Pulisic is expected to lead his fellow countrymen to great things in the 2022 World Cup. But one player does not a soccer team make - and that's why I wanted to talk about this team today.

Pulisic and several other key U.S. players - such as his fellow midfielders Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams - aren't with the squad this month as it competes in the Gold Cup the top competition for teams governed by the Confederation of North Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF).

Berhalter gave his stars a break - most of them play for European clubs and this is technically their offseason - and instead opted to go with a pool of mostly younger players who are still largely unknown and unproven on the international level.

They've only played two matches as of the writing of this column but so far the youngsters haven't disappointed. They followed up a too-close-for-comfort 1-0 victory over Haiti with a 6-1 thrashing of Martinique Thursday night that ensured the U.S.' place in the quarterfinals with one match left to play in the group stage.

Now to be clear these are matches the United States is supposed to win. Today's match against Canada should be a much more accurate measuring stick for how good these guys really are.

But the seemingly cupcake matches are the ones that have proven to be an issue for this team in recent years.

It's also worth noting that the average age of the U.S.' Starting XI against Martinique was a ripe old 23 years 85 days. That's young even for soccer and while the kiddos looked a bit green at times against the considerably more experienced (i.e. older) Martinique the result speaks for itself.

Daryl Dike stole the show against Les Matinino. The 21-year-old striker for MLS' Orlando City SC scored twice and had a good chance of finishing with a hat trick had Berhalter not subbed him in the 68th minute for the much more experienced Gyasi Zardes - who promptly scored his 13th career goal for the USMNT.

This is definitely not the squad that will take the field in September as the U.S. shifts its focus to qualifying for next year's World Cup. But if they continue to show out like they did Thursday some of these youngsters could certainly make an impact down the stretch of 2021 and - barring a repeat of the Trinidad and Tobago debacle - in the tournament itself in 2022.

You can go back to your baseball now if you want. Or maybe you want to check in on the latest season of the Walking Dea- er I mean the NBA Finals. Sorry all the injuries in the playoffs have made it hard to tell the difference between the two.

As for me I'm looking forward to today's soccer match against our neighbors to the north. The U.S. Men's National Team is exciting to watch whether it be the stars we'll see in World Cup Qualifying in September or the youngsters trying to prove themselves in the Gold Cup.

So go ahead jump on the bandwagon with me. You might not love the Beautiful Game just yet but I promise this team can get you there.

Salomon Gold expects to celebrate his 90th birthday next month in his Champlain Towers North condo in Florida where for decades he has enjoyed views of the turquoise blue waves of the Atlantic lapping on Surfside Beach.

“You know how much they charge in the hotel next door for a night? One thousand dollars” said Gold wearing a driver’s cap over bespectacled eyes and sporting a thick white mustache on his balcony his wife Cila at his side. “I have it here for free.”

Since the partial collapse last month of the twin Champlain Towers South killed at least 100 people just down the block some residents in Gold’s building have chosen to evacuate. Not him.

“I am confident that this building is safe” he said. “You know you have twin families. I mean two brothers and the same genetics. But they are not the same. One can be a criminal and the other can be a physician.”

But some of Gold’s neighbors and residents of other coastal properties in Florida and beyond are not as confident. They have been feeling anxious and unnerved since the June 24 tragedy.

“Every resident of every association every condo was taking this personally. Every professional was taking this personally and really was struck by it in a very emotional way” Tom Skiba CEO of the Community Associations Institute said after a brief visit to Surfside following the collapse.

Those worries are being felt outside South Florida where emergency re-inspections of other aging buildings prompted evacuations in at least four other residential structures deemed unsafe.

“Not just our organization but every professional in the industry every board every manager got a huge volume of calls. Just people asking questions: Could this happen in my community in my building? Should I be concerned about this?” said Skiba whose organization advocates for homeowners associations.

‘Some people are especially worried’

While the cause of the Surfside collapse remains under investigation the disaster has prompted reviews of highrise condos buildings in the area.

“People are worried” Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said. “Some people are especially worried.”

One South Florida building that has raised alarms is Crestview Towers about seven miles north of the Surfside condo. The city of North Miami Beach earlier this month ordered its immediate closure and the evacuation of about 300 people after a report determined the structure is unsafe.

“What upset me the most is that management knew about it since January” Crestview resident Harold Dauphin said of the building’s structural and electrical issues.

Crestview Towers was deemed structurally and electrically unsafe based on a delinquent recertification report for the almost 50-year-old building according to City Manager Arthur H. Sorey III.

Crestview’s attorney did not respond to multiple CNN requests for comment.

The report was dated January 11 2021 and was submitted on July 2 Sorey said. In it an engineer retained by the condominium association chronicled the building’s structural and electrical flaws.

“As a resident we didn’t realize the situation” lamented Estefania Grajales who also lives at Crestview.

In fact Dauphin said he first learned of the evacuations when he was picking up his 7-year-old child from camp. As he approached the residence recently he said he saw helicopters flying above and police on the premises – going floor to floor – assisting with the evacuation.

“I understand the call” he said of the evacuation order. “It’s a great call knowing what happened at Surfside. So it’s better to be safe than sorry.”

Before it collapsed Champlain Towers South had been visited regularly by officials in recent years. Inspectors from the town of Surfside conducted permit-related inspections at the condo tower more than once a week on average in 2018 and 2019 according to a CNN analysis of town records.

But even as an engineer hired by the building’s condo board warned of “major structural damage” on the property – and as residents squabbled over funding for expensive repairs – no record appears of town officials raising red flags. Their job was to ensure compliance with permits for plumbing upgrades air conditioning repairs and window installations – not to evaluate the structure of the building.

The Champlain Towers South Condominium Association which has been named in lawsuits accusing it of failing to maintain the building released a statement earlier this month saying: “Answers will take time as part of a comprehensive investigation and we will continue to work with city state local and federal officials in their rescue efforts and to understand the causes of this tragedy.”

‘What is the status our buildings here?’

Concerns over the structural integrity of condo buildings go beyond the highrise residents of Florida’s 1350 miles of coastline.

About 30 million people live in condo buildings across the US according to the Community Associations Institute.

In New York three state senators are urging the state Division of Building Standards and Codes to strengthen requirements for aging highrise buildings in coastal communities including mandating annual inspections.

“We share some similarities with the Florida highrise shoreline” said New York State Sen. Todd Kaminsky a Democrat from Long Island. “We ask ourselves the question: What is the status of our buildings here?”

In a letter earlier this month Kaminsky and two other state senators also asked the division’s code development unit to reassess standards for construction in high-risk coastal areas.

“We are hearing from worried constituents who wonder about the structural integrity of their buildings” the letter said.

‘There might be people who don’t like the answer’

Skiba said rules on condo reserves – or how much money the boards should have on hand to repair a building – vary by state. But the Surfside collapse highlights the need for a reserve standard to address structural integrity.

“The reserve standards don’t address structural issues” he said. “They address replacement items that are usually addressed due to age or wear and tear.”

An independent budget review had warned the Champlain Towers South condo association that its financial reserves were critically underfunded in the face of urgently needed structural repairs a little more than a year before the building came down according a document obtained by CNN.

Joel Figueroa-Vallines a fellow with the American Society of Civil Engineers expressed concern about hundreds of aging properties in South Florida.

“We know that there may have not been proper maintenance or quality control” he said of the Surfside condo building. “So let’s get out there. Let’s talk to the associations. Let’s try to inspect them and then go from there.”

Allyn Kilsheimer an 80-year-old structural engineer and veteran of forensic investigations at catastrophes like the Pentagon post-9/11 and the collapse of a pedestrian bridge at Miami’s Florida International University has been hired by the town of Surfside.

Kilsheimer has been surveying the Champlain Towers North building ordering tiles pulled up from the pool deck and concrete samples drilled from walls for a series of tests he hopes will explain what led to the collapse of Champlain Towers South.

“There’s nothing that I know so far here that tells me this is symptomatic of condominiums in the United States of America” he said.

His work is but one part of overlapping probes that involve homicide detectives local prosecutors and government engineers and could take years to complete.

“We’ll figure it out” Kilsheimer said. “There might be people who don’t like the answer. But we’ll figure it out.”

The north tower a sister of Champlain Towers South had the same design architect and structural engineer.

“The same construction the same developer the same name probably the same materials” Burkett said.

Gold has lived in the north tower since 1981 the year it was built and was president of its condo association for a decade. He has no plans to leave though many neighbors have left.

“I don’t blame them for moving out” he said. “Everybody has to make their own decisions. It’s like flying. Some people are afraid to fly.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL2tub3R0cy1iZXJyeS1mYXJtLXRvd2VyLWNsaW1iZXItbmVhci1zdXByZW1lLXNjcmVhbS1yaWRlLXByb21wdHMtcG9saWNlLXJlc3BvbnNl0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vdXMva25vdHRzLWJlcnJ5LWZhcm0tdG93ZXItY2xpbWJlci1uZWFyLXN1cHJlbWUtc2NyZWFtLXJpZGUtcHJvbXB0cy1wb2xpY2UtcmVzcG9uc2UuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Knott’s Berry Farm tower climber in police custody after scaling 300-foot Supreme Scream ride,"The popular Knott’s Berry Farm theme park in Southern California drew a police response Saturday night after a man apparently climbed a more than 300-foot metal tower near the park’s Supreme Scream ride according to reports.

The man eventually came down safely police in Buena Park tweeted shortly after 9 p.m. local time.

Earlier images posted by FOX 11 of Los Angeles showed the climber just below a large American flag at the top of the tower.

Police previously tweeted around 8 p.m. local time confirming the incident.

""Please stay out of the area while we work to bring this person down safely"" the police post read.

There was no immediate information about the climber’s identity or how he managed to climb the metal tower FOX 11 reported. Whether the climber would face charges in connection with the incident was not immediately clear.

He was taken to a local hospital for a mental health evaluation according to the Orange County Register.

The park issued a statement saying: ""At approximately 7:23pm Knott’s Berry Farm became aware of a male who had accessed a unauthorized area and climbed the Supreme Scream tower. Park personnel alerted local law enforcement and emergency responders who are now on site. The guest descended the tower at 8:55pm and is now currently safely on the ground in police custody. No other information is available at this time. The safety of our guests is always our top priority"" FOX 11 reported.

Last weekend the outside of the theme park was the scene of a drive-by shooting that left a teenager wounded.

A group of US investors say they incurred financial losses when Arconic’s Reynobond PE cladding was implicated in the Grenfell fire in 2017 which left 72 people dead.

Their claim which Arconic said was “meritless” hinges on whether the company knew the cladding could be dangerous and should have warned investors of the risk involved in selling it.

A US judge ruled that the claim can proceed after the shareholders put forward testimony from two anonymous former Arconic employees who say managers at its French subsidiary knew of the risks.

The plaintiffs also point to an expert report submitted to the Grenfell Tower inquiry in the UK which found that the safety rating of the cladding had been downgraded.

One confidential witness said Claude Wehrle and Claude Schmidt senior members of staff at the French outpost where Arconic’s cladding was manufactured were aware of the cladding’s poor performance in safety tests.

A second witness said Schmidt “knew that the downgraded Reynobond PE panels were regularly being sold for use in high-rises”.

Wehrle has refused to give evidence to the Grenfell inquiry. Schmidt told the inquiry that while fire test data was not concealed from building certifiers its omission may have been a “misleading half truth”. He also said he was “practically sure” he had raised concerns with the US parent company.

During the legal battle with shareholders Arconic has said it could not have known what the two men allegedly knew arguing that they worked at a foreign subsidiary and did not hold senior positions in the company.

The court refused to dismiss the shareholders’ claim on these grounds.

According to the ruling in the district court for Western Pennsylvania Arconic also argues that the men did not know the use of Reynobond PE was inappropriate because that depended on the overall cladding system not just aluminium panels.

The court found that this argument failed finding that the claim “supports a strong inference that [an Arconic manager] not only knew that Arconic was regularly selling Reynobond PE for use in high-rises but also that he knew or at least recklessly disregarded that this ‘common practice’ was improper”.

The plaintiffs are making a financial claim against Arconic for their losses although the value of the claim is yet to be determined.

While the judge dismissed several of the claims including those made against individual senior managers at the company it allowed two to proceed.

The claims that will go ahead are under sections 10(b) and 11 of the US Securities Act which cover misleading information given to shareholders and companies’ liability for them.

A spokesperson for Arconic said: “Arconic notes the Pennsylvania Western district court opinion from 23 June in the Howard v Arconic shareholders case in which the court has dismissed many of the claims in the shareholders’ lawsuit.

“As to the remaining claims we maintain they are also meritless and intend to prevail in court.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdGhlb3MuY29tL2Jsb2dzL2Fza2FtdXNsaW0vMjAyMS8wNy9oYWpqLWthYWJhLWFuZC1tZWNjYS1yb3lhbC1jbG9jay10b3dlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hajj Ka'aba And Mecca Royal Clock Tower | Ejaz Naqvi MD,"It is the Hajj season again and Muslims will be heading to the plains of Arafat near Mecca starting today. It brings back memories when four years ago we spent a day there as an essential part of Hajj pilgrimage. This is the beginning of the 5-day Hajj period that starts in Arafat leading to Muztalifah where we would spend the night under the sky then head to the tent city of Mina for three nights and will culminate in returning to Mecca to perform the farewell Umrah to complete the Hajj.

This year like last year no pilgrims were allowed from outside the Saudi Arabia due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The Saudi authorities have permitted 60000 pilgrims from within the kingdom to perform one of the five pillars of Islam. Every pilgrim has received two doses of the Coronavirus vaccine and must be from of any chronic illnesses.

Normally there are 2-3 million pilgrims from around the world who perform Hajj every year so this is a significant drop from the normal. When I performed Hajj four years ago there were times that I had to put my hands around my chest to make sure I had enough room for breathing. I have published posts every year since then reliving the most amazing experience of my life. I was not a fan of the overcrowding at the time but watching some of the live videos of the Hajj last year and this year with more than half empty Ka’aba makes me kind of sad actually. The presence of masses performing the same rituals with focus and purity of heart is what made my experience so memorable. I never thought I will miss the overcrowding but I do now!

Pretty much the only relatively “negative” experience I had was the sight of the tall Mecca Royal clock tower and all the luxury hotels around Ka’aba.

Mecca clock tower is a proud symbol of the desire to turn this place into a five (or six) star experience rather than a spiritual experience. It minimizes the holiest shrine in all of Islam- literally and figuratively. It makes Mecca clock tower the center of attraction distracting pilgrims from Ka’aba.

I cannot get over the sight of the pilgrims taking the picture of the tower the third tallest building in the world while looking at the Ka’aba in the foreground! Compared to the giant tower Ka’aba looks diminutive. I am not sure why some of the pilgrims are so obsessed with something that is so counter to the whole Hajj experience. Hajj is about humbling ourselves purifying our hearts putting the worldly luxuries behind us (or at least put it in perspective) and equality where every pilgrim has regardless of their socio-economic status the same white outfit (Ahraam) which is basically made up of two pieces of towels wrapped around the body for male pilgrims. Women also wear very simple clothes.

I understand that despite these distractions most pilgrims are able to focus on the worship and various Hajj rituals to strengthen their connection with One true God but I am still lost as to why they needed to build something right next to the holiest shrine in Islam that can overshadow it and probably even more lost as to why some of us would have the urge to take pictures of the tower or even think about it when inside the Haram (the large compound surrounding Ka’aba).

The last thing we want to think back when thinking about the most amazing trip of our lives is the cluster of luxurious tall buildings around Ka’aba especially the Mecca clock tower. For most if not all pilgrims (Hajjis) Hajj has been a life-changing experience and they return home more humble with their hearts purified from all the worldly pollution. With the passing of time and as we get back into the ‘rat race’ the hearts do lose some of that purity. I am feeling a renewal is in order.

I cannot wait to get back there one of these days InshaAllah (God Willing).

Fort Collins Utilities’ interim executive director

As the lifeblood of our community the Cache la Poudre River plays a critical part in what makes our city thrive. While the Poudre provides many opportunities for recreation it also is one of our main sources for drinking water.

Have you noticed the Poudre looking darker than usual — sometimes almost black — over the last few months? If so you’re not alone.

In 2020 the Cameron Peak Fire burned much of the Poudre Watershed and when it rains over the burn scar ash and sediment wash into the river. With these changes in river water quality some might wonder how we still have clean safe drinking water when the river looks so bad.

Fort Collins Utilities staff work 24 hours a day 365 days a year to ensure our customers have some of the safest cleanest and best-tasting drinking water in North America. We have taken a proactive approach to mitigating post-wildfire effects on our treated drinking water ensuring the best water possible from source to tap:

We continually monitor weather conditions and flow times in the Poudre Canyon and are alerted to any mud or rockslides.

Two real-time river water quality meters provide early warning alerts to water treatment staff before post-fire ash and sediment reach the intake.

Two pre-sedimentation basins allow sediment to settle out of the water before it is transported to the Water Treatment Facility.

Water treatment staff are trained to detect undesirable smokey compounds in the water allowing them to make alterations to the treatment process as needed.

If necessary we have the flexibility to bypass the ash and sediment-laden river water at the intake and rely primarily on high-quality water in Horsetooth Reservoir.

Post-wildfire watershed restoration efforts are underway to stabilize hillslopes and reduce sediment and ash erosion in the river long term.

We are proud to offer some of the best water in the nation — in fact we were recently awarded second place in the American Water Works Association's “Best of the Best” Water Taste Test. While these periodic changes in river water quality are likely to continue through monsoon season we will continue to manage our water resources wisely to ensure the best water possible for our customers.

Thank you to all the staff who work to navigate these challenges so we can continue to deliver high-quality water to our customers!

Lake Mead. Google Earth

Sometime next month for the first time the federal government is likely to declare a water shortage at Lake Mead.

This vast turquoise reservoir formed in 1935 when the Hoover Dam corked the Colorado River in Arizona and Nevada is part of a broader network of natural and artificial aqueducts and dams that supplies water to 40 million people and homes farms manufacturers and businesses across several states tribal lands and parts of Mexico. Lights stay on in Phoenix Tucson Las Vegas San Diego Los Angeles and other Southwestern cities because Hoover Dam hydropower helps generate the region’s electricity.

But the lake is shrinking faster and sooner than hydrologists and other experts predicted. A stark white band of dry rock 120 feet wide circles its craggy perimeter marking how far the water line has fallen in the ongoing drought. Locals call it the “bathtub ring.”

Hoover Dam. Timothy L. O’Brien

Walking Lake Mead’s shoreline in the blistering July sunshine offers other reminders of the receding water. Swimmers gather in an area that they call a beach but is really an exposed portion of the reservoir’s rocky floor — some distance from the place further inland where people used to sunbathe. Marina ramps are closed because the water isn’t high enough to properly launch a boat. Formerly submerged infrastructure supporting enormous “straws” that suck water from the reservoir to be delivered to Las Vegas now tower above the lake. Saddle Island home to a major water treatment plant is so parched it’s no longer an island — it’s a peninsula.

Lake Mead and its troubled fellow reservoir upriver Lake Powell symbolize a broader threat. The entire Southwest has been baking in a 21-year drought and in this summer’s successive heat waves which have also roasted Northwestern states. How communities and businesses everywhere live with this change — how they adjust to the idea that water is a precious waning resource rather than an abundant inexpensive commodity — is being tested in the Southwest. Dry sizzling summers and warmer winters that restrict water supplies may now be the norm courtesy of a permanently altered climate.

“A lot of our problems are creeping. They aren’t acute. Drought isn’t something that just happened here — it’s been going on for two decades” says Kristen Averyt Nevada’s climate policy coordinator and a research professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. “But this recent heat wave should be sobering because this is arguably the most significant heat wave North America has experienced. And it’s here to stay.”

Interlocking legal agreements built on earlier pacts dating back at least a century and layered atop a hodgepodge of local rules govern how Colorado River water is shared among seven states Native American nations and Mexican territories. In 2019 after years of thorny negotiations over a diminishing water supply states and the federal government signed the Drought Contingency Plan which lays out how water will be doled out if a shortage occurs.

When the plan was signed Arizona and Nevada accepted reduced water allocations from Lake Mead — a feature of the DCP known as Tier Zero. California was initially spared from cutbacks. Colorado New Mexico Utah and Wyoming are served water from Lake Powell where water levels have plunged; a shortage may be declared next year.

The hope was that these first incremental steps might slow Lake Mead’s depletion and delay more severe restrictions. The reservoir’s surface elevation at Tier Zero was 1090 feet well below its peak of 1226 feet in 1983. When the reservoir drops to 1075 feet it will become Tier 1 — which represents just 40% of total capacity. (Other more wrenching shortfalls accompany plunges to Tiers 2 2a 2b and 3.)

Lake Mead Reservoir Elevations A cut of 720000 acre-feet of water represents about a year’s supply for more than 2 million households. Arizona’s initial cuts will fall on farmers however and not municipalities or industry. Sources: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (levels); Arizona Water Banking Authority (cuts)

“Tier 1” looms over conversations about drought in the Southwest in the same way that “rolling blackouts” haunts certain conversations elsewhere. Tier 1 has entered the Southwestern argot because it is the benchmark that will trigger a formal declaration of a water shortage expected in August. Tier 1 also foreshadows further belt-tightening. It suggests that a region of deserts and mountains that has spent a century growing explosively might have to consider downsizing — or perhaps right-sizing.

Tier 1 will most heavily impact Arizona due to legal and political peculiarities stemming from water battles of the past. Other Colorado River basin states will face more onerous rationing regimes only when further DCP tiers are reached. Then Arizona’s burden will worsen as well but even Tier 1 inflicts a severe blow. The state will lose nearly a fifth of the water it has been drawing from the Colorado River.

It has decided that farmers and ranchers will absorb the entirety of this cut temporarily sparing municipalities and industry. Farmers in Pinal County an Arizona breadbasket expect deliveries from the Colorado River to drop by half next year and disappear altogether in 2023.

“We’re not sure how long we can hang on. We’re getting nervous about it” Nancy Caywood a Casa Grande farmer recently told a local TV station. “We seriously don’t know what to do. We’re hoping for rain. We’re praying for rain.”

Farms need outsized amounts of water to grow crops. During wet years so much water could be channeled to central Arizona that it was possible if inadvisable to grow cotton corn barley and alfalfa in the desert. That may no longer be the case. But farms aren’t the only businesses that need water. Cutting-edge factories including semiconductor plants require millions of gallons daily. Two heavyweights in the chip industry Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plan to build major plants in Arizona and those operations will be water-dependent too. Real estate developers which routinely unveil master-planned communities in fast-growing Phoenix suburbs and in the Sonoran Desert also need water and some groundwater supplies are already strained.

Arizona has spent decades preparing for droughts and the state believes it can use water-sharing agreements to aid farmers when the first big cutback happens. Chipmakers have become deft water recyclers and say that they can work with a more limited supply. Developers claim to be observing strict local regulations on sustainable water usage. But even experts who have spent their careers tackling water-management issues in the state recognize why this moment resonates.

“We’re about to declare the first water shortage ever on the Colorado River” says Chuck Collum a program manager for the Central Arizona Project an agency that delivers Lake Mead water to the state. “It will be emotional to be here when that happens.”

“This isn’t just an Arizona problem. This is a Colorado River basin problem” he adds. “We’re linked by this river so problems in Phoenix are problems in Las Vegas.”

And problems in Las Vegas will find their way elsewhere too.

The Colorado River formed by tectonic collisions settled into its present 1450-mile course about 6 million years ago carving the Grand Canyon as it flowed southwestward from the Rocky Mountains to its delta in the Gulf of California. Its unpredictability and turbulence humbled the Native Americans who settled around it thousands of years ago and considered its waters sacred. The river remained untamed until the 20th century when the Hoover Dam was built.

The dam is an alabaster fortress capped with Art Deco flourishes and so soundly engineered it is expected to last a millennium. To absorb the financial risks of building it six major construction companies combined forces in partnership with the federal government. A model of ingenuity it is the closest approximation in the U.S. to the Great Pyramids and required as much hubris.

Before the dam was built the Colorado River swung between seasonal floods and withdrawals alternately swamping and drying out Southwestern farms homesteads and towns. It was “an American Nile awaiting regulation” proclaimed a Los Angeles engineer and federal hydrographer Joseph Barlow Lippincott in 1912. It needed to be corralled he said “in as intelligent and vigorous a manner as the British government has treated its great Egyptian prototype.”

In 1922 California eager to feed a booming economy and population began lobbying the federal government to dam the river. It also wrangled water so aggressively that the six other basin states worried they’d lose their share. That same year the Colorado River Compact was drafted to settle those fears with water from the river allocated in annual batches measured in acre-feet — the amount needed to cover an acre of land to a depth of one foot. (Today a single acre-foot is enough to serve three households annually depending on usage.) The states estimated in 1922 they would have 16.5 million acre-feet of river water available annually a figure that decades later proved to be wildly optimistic.

Court battles between Arizona and California over water rights took decades more to settle and left the federal government as the arbiter of allotments in the region. But the 1922 compact allowed the basin states to jointly tame the river ultimately with the Hoover Dam. The river was diverted the dam’s 726-foot concrete wedge filled the canyon and the water was allowed to rush back in.

For the first time the Colorado River was being directed and managed with a giant faucet. Lake Mead became so voluminous that its weight deformed the earth’s crust and in the 1930s triggered more than 600 minor earthquakes. Like dams before and after Hoover Dam also disrupted plant marine and wildlife habitats; unsettled sediment deposits; and created reservoirs that emitted methane and other greenhouse gases.

All that water also enabled the extraordinary manufacturing agriculture technology and residential boom in the Southwest. The water’s eventual decline which started to be felt at the turn of this century stands to have an equally powerful impact.

During a six-day stretch in mid-June warm Pacific Ocean air carried along the jet stream became trapped in the atmosphere over Western states — a phenomenon known as a “heat dome.” Record-high temperatures occurred in several places extending the worst megadrought in centuries amplified by climate change.

Soaring temperatures have also reduced runoff from the Rocky Mountain snowpack that replenishes the Colorado River and have caused Lake Powell and Lake Mead to evaporate more rapidly. Yet the coming shortages have been anticipated.

“We are not in a state of panic. We’re prepared. We knew it was coming and we’ve been storing water underground” says Sharon Megdal director of the University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center. “But the situation is bad and it’s growing worse sooner and faster than we thought it would. Some aren’t going to be able to continue business as usual. They will have to adapt.”

Southwesterners bristle at the idea that they shouldn’t live in such a forbidding region or that they have somehow overlooked the peril of dwindling water supply. Yes Las Vegas casinos have waterfalls and Venetian canals and Phoenix has golf courses but Southwesterners say such oddities don’t represent their relationship to water. And in fact they don’t.

Arizonans use less water now than they did in the 1950s despite a population boom. A pivotal factor in that shift was refashioning agricultural lands for residential living; homes use much less water than farms do. But smart planning also played a role. Legislation the state passed in 1980 regulates water use conservation and land development. Projects built since then have to show they have access to a 100-year water supply (though some developers have found ways around that mandate).

The state also diversified its sources of water. In the 1950s 69% of its supply came from groundwater. Now only 41% does as the chart below shows. Water from the Colorado River accounts for the lion’s share of that difference. (Most of Arizona’s water — 72% — is used by farmers. Municipalities and industry use the rest.)

Arizona has also spent the past 25 years storing about 3 trillion gallons in a network of “water banks” — a supply big enough the state says to serve Phoenix for 30 years. Part of that supply was created through artificial above-ground pools that gradually seep through the soil and “recharge” subterranean aquifers.

But Arizona’s regulatory apparatus isn’t airtight. Some landowners and farmers aren’t bound by its rules and can pump groundwater at will. And there are no uniform legal guidelines around various uses of surface water and groundwater.

While Arizona now uses less groundwater than it did decades ago waning supplies from Lake Mead have forced it to reconsider that strategy. As the shortage deepens water banking is likely to be eliminated. Sprawling suburban subdivisions depend on groundwater stocks that will be difficult to replenish. The prospect of aggressively tapping other groundwater supplies in rural areas to make up the difference has sparked a heated debate about environmental impacts — and basic fairness.

A group of University of Arizona researchers who in 2017 wrote a detailed analysis of the state’s water usage found that some of the lofty conservation goals established in 1980 won’t be met and that the balance between extracting and replenishing groundwater has fallen dangerously out of whack.

In March Intel announced that it will spend $20 billion building its two new semiconductor plants in Arizona. TSMC which has been scrambling to secure water amid a drought in Taiwan has already broken ground on its Arizona plant which is said to cost as much as $35 billion.

This spending is part of a larger manufacturing renaissance in Arizona built on the strategic advantages talented workers and lower operating costs the state offers certain businesses. Chipmakers also need to build their factories as far as possible from seismic activity because even slight rumblings can upend production runs. Earthquakes occur less frequently in Arizona than they do in nearby states such as California.

But a chip fab depending on its size can use 2 million to 9 million gallons of water a day to produce a smaller amount of the ultra-pure water it needs to clean components. TSMC has said it recycles 87% of the water it uses. Intel says its goal is a recycling program that generates “net positive water use” in Arizona. It has funded 15 water restoration projects for the state that it says will potentially restore 937 million gallons annually.

Nevada has longstanding water restrictions in place and is planning to ban ornamental grasses. Indoor wastewater is recycled and the state offers companies financial incentives to find innovative ways to conserve water. Developers were ordered decades ago to build only water-efficient homes. Although homeowners watering lawns and filling pools account for the single biggest use of water in Las Vegas — more than all the casinos and hotels consume — aggregate water usage in Nevada has dropped even as the state’s population has grown.

Experts such as Averyt Collum and Megdal — all committed to the Southwest’s future — emphasize how crucial it will be to strengthen conservation regulations and water laws across the region.

Water is still sold at rock-bottom rates — lower than the cost of electricity — and to facilitate rationing and responsible usage prices will need to rise. Israel another desert community offers a good model for how to orchestrate such a pricing shift. A lot of residential water in states like Arizona is used outdoors to water plants and trees and fill swimming pools and this offers an easy target for cutbacks. Seawater desalination plants and wastewater recycling facilities have sprung up around the region. Greater public education about water usage and availability — as San Antonio Texas has provided its residents — would also help.

But there’s no single fast solution. “It’s a story that’s going to unfold over years and years” says Collum. “It’s going to be incremental important engagement. There’s no single masterstroke that can fix it.”

If the drought persists or accelerates then this becomes a race against time. The Colorado River Compact drafted in the wake of two decades of unusually abundant rains allocated more water than the river could provide. Now Mother Nature is forcing the Southwest to adjust.

The Hoover Dam’s original hydraulic turbines have been replaced with more efficient models able to keep spinning in shallower water. These can operate until the reservoir’s water level falls to 950 feet about 125 feet below where it is now and then they stop working. At a level of 895 feet water can no longer leave the reservoir — at which point Lake Mead is labeled a “dead pool.”

A reservoir and dam that one day are unable to provide water and electricity will have outlasted their usefulness. And that will be proof — if more is needed — that the ravages of climate change are at hand.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXpvZXJlcG9ydC5jb20vYmVhdXR5L2JlYWNoLXdhdmUtcGVybdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Got The Beach Wave Perm: Here's Everything You Need To Know,"For the past decade or so as summer approaches and I start to envision what the season will look like — where to go on vacation what to wear and how to manage my hair in the heat — I always consider whether or not to get a beach wave perm. I take screenshots of inspiration look at before and after pictures at hair salons and consult with beauty editors. Yet not knowing anyone who’s actually gotten it done made me too nervous to go through the long process required of perms (or so I thought) and possibly again if I was unhappy with the results.

But after almost two decades of wondering what my hair would look like wavy and loosely textured without the need for salt from an ocean plunge or hot tools and styling products I finally took the plunge and got the perm.

Now hear me out. I know at first sound of the word “perm” conjures up images of tightly coiled ringlets from the ‘80s aka the spiral perm and countless hours sitting at the salon with funky smelling formula seeping into one’s hair. I know — I had this done multiple times starting from the tender age of six. But to my surprise and relief I discovered that perms have come a long way since the days of my poodle-like mane.

To achieve my ideal “natural” looking soft tousled curls I went with the American Wave at the Brooklyn location of Nick Arrojo’s salon ARROJO NYC. I loved the results so much that once the waves grew out I tried a new perm called Curl Cult a proprietary new perm created by celebrity hairstylist and owner of LA-based Hairroin Salon Janine Jarman. While both perms produced the bouncy loose waves I desired the process and formula used quite differs.

Curl Cult Perm

Over seven years in the making this is the first ever Protein Perm which utilizes a Pisum-Protex technology that shapes the hair from the inside out. Paraben- and sulfate surfactant-free the two notable and significant differences with Jarman’s formula is that it takes almost half the time — in and out of the chair in about two hours for my long hair— and the smell is drastically less offensive than the standard perm. Ninety percent of the service is done at the chair skipping the step of rinsing the perming solution and blotting the hair at the sink and applying the neutralizer right on top — also a formula Jarman created that processes in as little as ten minutes at most twenty depending on the hair type and desired results.

What Hair Type Works With The Curl Cult Perm?

While you can get a Curl Cult perm with dyed or bleached hair like other perms it depends on how damaged your hair may be. Jarman notes that “anyone with metallic hair color such as henna and had Thio-based services done previously should not get a perm.”

If you are looking to redefine your curl patterns create S bends relax your curls with a reformation perm or a get a simple root lift you can achieve this with the Curl Cult demi-perm solution.

In regards to my hair condition at the time of service it had been ten months since I last permed my hair at Arrojo Salon for the American Wave perm. I dye it black about three to four times a year and I almost always air dry my hair.

Kathy Lee

What Is The Process?

First I informed Jarman of the type of curls I was looking for — loose wavy and soft — and the type of maintenance I could manage — air dry and minimal styling products. Since she can see the texture from last year’s perm still very loosely in place she then determined the size of rods for my hair. After shampooing and conditioning she sectioned my hair and rolled on rods of two different sizes. Since my hair is long and heavy Jarman notes that she “used smaller rods above the occipital bone to compensate for the amount the curl gets pulled out with the length and weight. For the underside I went a size down to maintain as much length as possible all while getting it to blend and look like you grew it yourself.”

Thereafter she applied the perming solution checked the strands after ten minutes and left the solution on for another ten. When two to three strands had the pull of a rubber band Jarman then applied the neutralizer. After about fifteen minutes Jarman removed the rods and rinsed my hair she then conditioned it using the Curl Cult Magic Spell Conditioning Leave-In spray and detangled with a wide tooth comb. After applying the Curl Cult Enhance Moisturizing Curl Cream and scrunching my hair with a microfiber towel to remove the water Jarman diffused my hair.

Kathy Lee

How Much Maintenance Does It Require?

Like any other perm it’s advised not to wash your hair for 48 hours. I also avoid tying it in a tight ponytail or bun as I don’t want to compromise the curl pattern.

I personally don’t like the look of very defined curls so I simply spritz on leave-in conditioner and apply the occasional oil in the morning. I do try and avoid wrapping my hair in a towel but most often it’s not very practical as I need to speed up the drying process to get myself out the door.

To keep up the moisture in my hair on days I don’t wash my hair I spritz on water to open up the cuticles and then leave-in conditioner. I shampoo my hair about every four days and use a cowash on day two.

The great thing about this perm and the American Wave perm is that there is no distinct demarcation because the curls are loose and by the time there is significant growth from when you had the perm the curls are much looser so it all looks very natural.

Jarman advises that “If you have no natural texture to your hair you will need [the perm] more frequently (approximately four to six months) because it won’t blend in as much when your natural hair starts to grow in. With short hair you will need a perm every three to four months because you end up cutting off the perm ... some clients with long hair and a natural texture come in every eight to twelve months because they love how it looks when it’s grown out and enjoy the different version of it as it softens.”

The cost of the Curl Cult perm starts at $150 for short lengths $350 for average and then $500-$700 for very long. For reference my hair length costs around $400-$600.

American Wave Perm

As opposed to the traditional perm which tend to leave the hair dry and damaged and in effect frizzy the American Wave — which is Thio (sulfur) formaldehyde and ammonia-free — includes cysteamine as the active ingredient potassium as a cuticle softener in the waving lotion and utilizes ionic technology. As a result the American Wave 'softens' the hair bonds in the cortex as opposed to breaking it as done during a traditional perm.

The specific look I requested was the Beach Wave Wrap which combines straight and wavy textures to create tousled waves and can be customized to your liking. It’s not a one-size fits all technique but instead one where you can work with the stylist to specify the tightness of how much hair per wave.

What Hair Type Works With The American Wave?

Similar to Curl Cult those with colored and previously permed hair can get the American Wave. But it may not be suitable for heavily highlighted or bleached manes. Not sure if you fall into the category of “heavily?”

Kathy Lee

At Arrojo NYC the stylist will do a porosity strand test by taking one strand of your hair and putting it in the waving lotion to see how it reacts. If it breaks or becomes distressed by becoming gummy or stringy the stylist will instead suggest a series of conditioning treatments to strengthen and repair the hair before reconsidering the service.

In terms of hair thickness the American Wave is good for someone with thinner density hair as the wave will give them volume bounce and thickness. But if you are looking for big cascading C shaped curls with naturally fine hair this perm won’t be able to give those results.

What Is The Process?

From start to finish the whole process took a little over three hours. First my stylist Kat Rohan shampooed my hair twice before wet cutting to create the slightest layers. This allows room for the waves to take place and for the hair to not be too overpowering especially at the ends. From thereon six sections were made with a zigzag parting and Rohan continued this sectioning in between each individual soft rod that resembles a foam-like tube which the hair was wrapped around so that the waves sit naturally and there is less of a harsh part line.

Rohan selected the largest size coil for the loosest curl but if you prefer a tighter pattern there are multiple options to choose from. Those with shorter hair may consider tighter rods as the ones used on my long hair may not be able to create any curls on shorter hair.

Kathy Lee

Thereafter my stylist applied a warm perming solution and left it on for 25 minutes (the maximum time which can vary depending on hair thickness and strands per rod). My hair was then rinsed under hot water for ten minutes and neutralized for five minutes using a solution which closes up the cuticle of the hair and secures the change in texture — it basically locks everything in. Lastly Rohan rinsed out the neutralizer removed the rods and conditioned my hair using the American Wave Submerge conditioner.

How Much Maintenance Does It Require?

In terms of styling Rohan scrunched my hair with a towel after conditioning combed it out using a wide-tooth comb applied the American Wave Structure hair cream and Wave mist and a light serum to rehydrate the hair. I was then placed under a dryer to remove excess water and after Rohan used a diffuser to further dry each curl. If you are looking for a more natural look you can air dry instead and forego the products (as I did with my hair in the lead image).

Kathy Lee

For 48 hours after the perm I was advised to not wash my hair or work out (due to sweat) or expose my hair to the rain. Basically avoid getting it wet in any way in order to not deactivate the perm chemicals. If you need to pull back your locks do so gently but try to avoid tying or clipping your hair altogether for at least one week.

For products Rohan instructs me to use only sulfate- and sodium chloride-free shampoo and conditioner and only comb through when my hair is wet. Do not brush your hair when wet or dry.

The wave falls out naturally over time usually lasting between two to five months. The great thing about this perm is that it’s so subtle the grow out process isn’t severe no matter how straight your natural hair may be. And if you love this new look you can continue to receive the perm depending on the condition of your hair at that time and if you’re willing to shell out $400 minimum (depending on hair length) each time.

I’m all for sitting in a salon chair for a few hours if it means my daily routine is shortened by a good chunk of time. I now have soft textured waves which were previously only possible after a dip in the sea or styling with heat. I’m happy to say that after three weeks since my visit my heart is fully content with finally taking the plunge and getting the beach wave perm I’ve so long thought about.

The 20-year-old has been on Saints’ radar since his days a teenager at Old Trafford chased for three transfer windows by Austrian boss Ralph Hasenhuttl.

Speaking to HampshireLive towards the end of last season Hasenhuttl described the left-back as a player of interest once again before his CEO Martin Semmens told fans during a fan forum event that if the chance to sign the youngster emerged they would.

Since then Saints have once again found themselves in talks with United over his future.

Their previous approaches have been rebuffed by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer keen to keep him as part of his Red Devils squad.

But this summer things seem to be different with United happy for Williams to depart on loan.

Reports have suggested that the clubs remain far apart at present but that there is optimism that a deal can be done.

During what has so far been a slow summer of transfer dealings Williams will not join Southampton until August at the earliest.

The defender is expected to be a part of United’s squad for their first pre-season friendlies with Luke Shaw currently away on holiday with a number of his England teammates following their Euro 2020 campaign.

Williams meanwhile is hard at work at his club’s AON training centre and issued a five-word update on Friday about how his pre-season is going and where his head is at.

The youngster posted on Twitter: “The hard work never stops.”

Williams remains focussed on preparing himself right for the new season well aware that he could play a part in a friendly against Derby County on Sunday.

And that game could offer Saints fans the chance to see him in action following a campaign where he made only five appearances for Manchester United.

Apple on Friday removed the app Fakespot from its App Store at Amazon's request.

Amazon complained Fakespot misled customers broke App Store rules and posed a security risk.

Fakespot's CEO said he was shocked by the turn of events.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Amazon got Apple to remove an app called Fakespot from the App Store on Friday as reported by the Verge and CNBC.

Fakespot is an app that flags when product reviews on shopping apps like Amazon's are likely to be fake or bot-generated.

According to the Verge Amazon filed a complaint with Apple on June 8 saying that Fakespot displays Amazon's website inside its app which breaks Apple's rules. The rules in question state that apps displaying third-party content must have permission from that third party.

Amazon also said Fakespot misleads customers and created a security risk with the way it put code into Amazon's website to display its ratings.

""The app in question provides customers with misleading information about our sellers and their products harms our sellers' businesses and creates potential security risks. We appreciate Apple's review of this app against its Appstore guidelines"" an Amazon spokesperson told the Verge.

Fakespot's CEO Saoud Khalifah denied the app has any security vulnerabilities in an interview with the Verge. He added: ""Amazon is willing to bully little companies like ours that showcase the cracks in their company."" He said Fakespot had 150000 downloads when Apple removed it.

Saoud's said Apple has given Fakespot little opportunity to fight back since Amazon initiated proceedings on June 8 and he told CNBC the takedown notice was sudden and unexpected. ""Imagine going to a tenant and saying you have to take all your stuff you have to leave right now. That's how I feel right now"" he said.

Apple disputes this saying it gave Fakespot ""ample time"" to resolve the issue with Amazon. Speaking to the Verge Khalifah said between June 8 and Friday the process consisted of Fakespot and Amazon arguing against each other with Apple providing no guidance. ""I'm shocked Apple decided to side with Amazon without any proof"" he told the Verge.

At time of writing Fakespot remains on the Google Play Store for Android phones where it has more than 50000 downloads.

Fakespot Amazon and Apple did not immediately respond when contacted by Insider for comment.

Fake reviews have been a big PR problem for Amazon. The tech giant is facing an investigation in the UK over fake reviews and in June it issued a statement saying social media companies need to do more to stop the sale of fake reviews on their platforms.

TL;DR: Bad guys abuse permissions and outdated software to infect your devices.

Background: Epic Games Inc. v. Apple Inc.

At the time of writing this piece Apple Inc. and Epic Games Inc. are in the throes of a legal dispute. Epic Games claims that Apple’s App Store is a monopoly and should not have control over in-app purchases. Apple countersued Epic and accused it of breaching its contract. The outcome of the ruling could fundamentally alter how Apple runs its App Store and how app developers monetize their content.

There is one aspect to the lawsuit that piqued my interest: Apple’s argument for maintaining its current model of having complete control over the App Store.

The argument goes that Apple’s tight grip over the App Store guarantees a safe environment where every single application is vetted for malware and compliance with Apple’s standards. Hence the user is shielded from malware and can focus on what’s important: finding an app you like. The metaphor of the walled garden is often used here since you can pick and enjoy any fruit within the garden as long as you stick within the confines of its walls.

This got me asking: What’s the security landscape in a third party store compared to Apple’s? Can we create a simple data-driven model to vet apps for malware regardless of who controls the store?

Full disclosure: This entire project was done on an Apple MacBook I’m not taking any sides in the legal case.

Objectives

My objective in this piece is to show how a data-driven approach can flag malicious smartphone apps and provide an explanation for each step leading up to that goal. I will also see how my results compare to other research on the topic.

The operating system (OS) examined is Android which has a 72% share of the world wide mobile OS market. Given its widespread popularity it is more likely to be abused by malicious actors.

Show Us the Code

The repository associated with this project can be found here:

Getting the Data

The data is from Kaggle user Saurabh Shahane and can be downloaded in one click:

The dataset was originally used in the paper “ADROIT: Android malware detection using meta-information” by Martín Alejandro; Calleja Alejandro; Menéndez Héctor D.; Tapiador Juan; Camacho David.

Each row in the dataset represents meta-information of an app available on the Aptoide app store website and also information from the app’s Android Manifest. In addition the paper will serve as a benchmark for model performance.

Please note that I assume that the information in the dataset is as truthful and accurate as possible. Any changes to this fundamental assumption might entirely alter the findings of this article. In addition I highly recommend reading the paper as it explains how the data was aggregated and labeled.

Building A Feature Space

In this section I give a general description of how I munge disparate data types into actionable features.

Target Variable & Success Metrics

Rather straightforward the target variable takes one of two values: benign or malware. The data is about 70% benign and 30% malware. For comparison according to Apple CEO Tim Cook only 1–2% of the Apple App Store is malware.

The authors of the ADROIT paper achieved 94% AUC. I will see if I can replicate similar results with my methods.

Moreover I will also use F1 score for checking model performance. Indeed ROC averages over all possible thresholds whereas the F1 score applies to any arbitrary point on the ROC curve.

Using the F1 score also raises core business questions: do we sacrifice precision for more recall? Is the cost of missing a malware app much higher than barring well-meaning developers from using the marketplace (False Positive)?

To rephrase the previous question: For a store like Aptoide how much potential income would they be missing out on if they barred a well-meaning developer? On the other hand how much reputational damage user harm and lost income is there from missing malware?

Furthermore not all malware is created equal. Indeed it can be adware spyware ransomware or some other kind.

These questions are tied to core business benchmarks and are beyond the scope of this article.

Numerical Features

Out of 166 numerical features 160 are binary and 6 are continuous. We have too many features on our hands and it might hinder a model’s predictive performance. For this reason it’s useful to look at each feature’s variance and remove features that have a low variance.

For the continuous variables we have to look at outliers. This is particularly relevant to the number of ratings an app receives since an overwhelming number of apps never received a single rating.

In order to weed out outliers I used Tukey’s method: the outliers are values more than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the quartiles either below Q1 − 1.5IQR or above Q3 + 1.5IQR.

Text Features

When it comes to NLP I usually pose the following questions:

Can I understand what a column is about by skimming the text?

Does it use the Latin alphabet and is it all in the same language?

What are the preprocessing functions needed?

What’s the most compact and representative way to transform the text?

As it turns out many entries have a description in Chinese characters (Also some Turkish Korean etc…). If one day I want to productionize or explain this model I will have to understand and explain its choices to stakeholders. However I can’t explain that which I don’t understand and therefore decided to drop non-Latin characters from the text.

Below is a sample from an app description:

Tap Tap Gems is a very addictive puzzle game. Tap two or more gems with the same colour to remove them from the board. You must think which gems should be removed next. To pass each level you must score certain amount of points. The more gems removed the more points you score. Game features 120 levels and 7 different gems.

And another sample shows that even with strictly Latin characters one might still have no idea what is going on (I’m guessing this is Vietnamese?).

After preprocessing the text data is transformed using TF-IDF vectorization. In order to optimize prediction TF-IDF parameters are tuned using a grid search cross validation.

Model Selection

At first I wanted to choose XGBoost since it had the highest AUC. So I set out to do a vanilla data science workflow that comes after data munging:

Instantiate TF-IDF vectorizer

Instantiate a pipeline to avoid leakage

Research how parameters influence the model predictions with GridSearchCV

With an AUC of 0.94 I was happy since it matched the authors’ findings. However when comparing train/test AUC the plot below suggested I was overfitting:

In contrast Random Forest (RF) shows underfitting:

Logistic regression is not overfitting but it might be severely underfitting.

XGBoost should be the clear winner here however I decided to continue with a vanilla logistic regression. It comes with a rather straightforward interpretability and saves me the trouble of using methods such as SHAP feature permutation or LIME.

Effect of Corpus Size on Predictions

Since this task involves NLP I want to mine as much information as possible from the text data. Logistic regression tends to suffer when working with sparse data and sparse data is typical when working with text.

We have two plots below one is the ROC curve and the other is the precision recall curve. Multiple curves show how as we add more features the model performance improves only slightly.

Spoiler Alert: Text data did not matter the next section will show that the numerical features in the Android Manifest are the most important factors for classification.

Interpretation of Results

It’s fair to assume that black box models are not exactly popular. Therefore I set out to understand how the classifier weighs its decisions and dive deeper into these features.

Indicators FOR Malware

In terms of what is a strong indicator for malware the top 5 are:

android.permission.READ_SYNC_SETTINGS android.permission.WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS android.permission.MANAGE_ACCOUNTS com.android.launcher.permission.UNINSTALL_SHORTCUT android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED

Take for example the permission to write sync settings what does it mean? When a device synchronizes (syncs) it is synchronizes data on your phone with the service’s servers.

The table below is a snapshot from the training data and it suggests that giving an unvetted app these permissions is a strong case for caution.

In addition MANAGE_ACCOUNTS allows the app to add/remove accounts and delete their passwords.

Moreover the RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED stood out as a strong indication of compromise. The android documentation sums it up nicely:

Though holding this permission does not have any security implications it can have a negative impact on the user experience by increasing the amount of time it takes the system to start and allowing applications to have themselves running without the user being aware of them.

Lastly the UNINSTALL_SHORTCUT permission is no longer supported. This might be associated with malware as older software tends to have more outstanding vulnerabilities.

Indicators AGAINST Malware

For the indicators against malware the main features are not as obvious:

android.permission.BLUETOOTH android.permission.READ_LOGS .//Min_SDK android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE “ringtones”

It’s not entirely clear to me why permissions to connect to paired Bluetooth and reading low-level system log files is a case against malware. Perhaps it’s not as bad as other permissions that allow the device to advertise to nearby Bluetooth devices (see BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE).

Moreover it’s beyond me why having “ringtones” in the app description gives you the green light to download it.

However I can comprehend how setting a higher SDK version (Min_SDK) can protect your device against infection. This feature aligns well with READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE. The latter is enforced starting API level 19 and prompts the user for themselves to enable/disable the permission.

Unfortunately the referenced paper does not come with code or an explanation of model weights. Therefore I’m unable to rigorously compare my findings with the authors’.

Conclusion

Working with data from the Aptoide store suggests that there’s an ample amount of malware on third party stores. Therefore Apple’s business practices could seem reasonable if they guarantee the safety of the user.

However data science can be leveraged to create a speedy and accurate classification system where such restrictions by Apple are not necessary. The logistic regression model is simple to set up and offers adequate performance when compared to existing literature.

Projects like these have the potential to boost the safety of app stores and give a deeper understanding of how vulnerabilities are exploited. The methodology can be expanded to other stores and operating systems.

The median price of a home for sale in Stockton was $420000 as of Friday according to the Central Valley Association of Realtors. A 6% to 20% down payment at that price would equal between $25200 and $84000.

A program to address those issues is available through the California Housing Finance Agency.

Middle-class homebuyers could see increased competition for local housing – especially if the spread of telecommuting allows high-earning professionals to relocate permanently to San Joaquin County said Jeffrey Michael professor of public policy at University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of Law. What's more the pandemic recession has made it difficult for many low-income people to stay housed at all.

CalHFA's Homebuyers program offers both down payment assistance and mortgages to homebuyers that earn up to $148000 per year. To access the program homebuyers must first check if they are eligible. If they are they should contact one of the lending officers in CalHFA's network.

“One of the biggest hurdles for people is that down payment” Eric Johnson a spokesperson for CalHFA said.

Through CalHFA's programs homebuyers need a 3% to 3.5% down payment and the agency will help them obtain it with a low-interest loan that is repaid when the loan is refinanced or the home sold Johnson said.

CalHFA can also help fund the purchase price with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of 3.625% he said.

Apple Inc. has funded a portion of the homebuyers program by purchasing home loans from CalHFA which then puts the proceeds toward down payment assistance. The Apple funds are part of a $1 billion affordable housing support initiative the Silicon Valley-based tech company announced on Wednesday.

The money from Apple has funded 323 loans worth roughly $109.3 million for families in San Joaquin County Johnson said.

About two-thirds of the participants in the homebuyers program are Hispanic Black Asian Pacific Islander or Native American and the program provides additional benefits to teachers veterans and firefighters according to Apple's news release.

Even with the help of assistance programs it can be tough for low-income homebuyers to compete with homebuyers who can afford to offer more than the asking price make non-contingent offers or even pay full price said Pete Diryawush president of the Central Valley Association of Realtors.

However it's important to keep in mind that the market will not be this crowded forever Diryawush said. Recently sellers have put more homes on the market easing somewhat the pressure buyers were feeling earlier in the pandemic.

“Since the pandemic everyone went crazy ... everybody automatically wanted to buy a home” he said.

Diryawush recommended that homebuyers ""have an open mind when you’re looking at homes"" and that homebuyers look at homes with prices slightly lower than their budgets in case they need the difference to make a competitive offer.

Education is key in helping people not only to afford their homes but to stay in them Johnson said.

“As we saw back in the early 2000s it’s really easy to get any random person into a home” but much harder to keep them their home he said. All CalHFA loans come with a mandatory six-hour educational course that applicants must complete before their loan deals close as well as optional courses after the loan he added.

More information about interest rates who is eligible for Cal HFA loans and where to find a lender in San Joaquin County can be found on the agency’s website at https://www.calhfa.ca.gov/homebuyer/index.htm.

Time for some more Travel Technology – this week looking at Apple’s minuture speaker – The HomePod Mini. Is it worth the asking price just to play music and ask it to find where your phone is or is there a lot more to this speaker?

What is it?

Apple’s HomePod Mini is a miniaturized version of their HomePod. It was released in November 2020 and has been on my radar for some time to take a look at.

The device is a mini version of Apple’s Smart Speaker allowing you to stream music from it interact with it and generally enjoy music in your home.

It is 8.4cm tall and 9.8cm wide available in white or black coming in at 345g. The speaker features a single full-range driver inside powered by a neodymium magnet and two force-cancelling passive radiators. For voice commands a three-microphone array is designed to listen for Siri commands and a fourth microphone that faces inward isolates sound coming from the speaker for better voice detection when music is playing.

Do not expect to plug other devices in there are no ports on the device (be they USB-C Line In Line out or headphones).

How much is it?

The RRP for the HomePod Mini is £99/$99/€99. The price in your territory may vary depending on how Apple values the US Dollar to your currency and how much they are in the mood to gouge.

What is in the box? (And the unboxing)

Not a lot with Apple’s minimalism at play. You get:

The HomePod Mini with an attached power cable

A USB-C plug rated at 20watts.



Charcoal.



Turn it to the side they say. It looks better they say.



A wild HomePod Mini appears!

The power brick is a 20watt affair which should be easy enough to replace when it goes wrong.

Sadly whilst the device can be powered by a USB-C connector (good) Apple of course showed off their “green” credentials by making the cable non-removable.

*facepalm*

Why does Apple do this to itself?

A Side Note on Apple and its “Green” Credentials (and why the fixed cable on the HomePod annoys me… a lot)

No Apple is not perfect. And here is but one reason.

Apple touts the environmental things about their products and then stick in a non-user-replaceable cable in typical Apple fashion – the first thing that will probably go wrong.



Apple’s Eco Promises for the HomePod mini yet no user-replaceable power/USB-C cable – https://www.apple.com/uk/homepod-mini/specs/



This is beyond stupid. It is designed obsolescence when you break the cable.

Another slap in the face for the right of repair as once the cable is broken you’ve either got time working out the cabling the soldering that goes with it or just e-waste it.

And that is a waste.

If you are in the USA I would strongly recommend you spend time looking at Louis Rossman “Right to Repair”. Linus Tech Tips and MKDHD have covered this subject in depth (and Gamers Nexus makes it a constant part of their coverage).

If you’re in Europe the European Commission has already passed its beady eyes over this. Those in the UK we have these laws coming in soon.

Idiot design decisions like this are not your friend. Or anyone is for that matter.

As for Apple’s consumer-unfriendly policies for their laptops and phones… that is another rant subject for another day.

Setting up the HomePod Mini

Setting up the HomePod Mini is pretty easy – if you’ve paired any Apple product with an iPhone or iPad it’s a matter of bringing your device close to the HomePod mini and following the on-screen instructions.



If you have set up EarPods before this will be familiar…



Where did come from where did go where it is going Cotton-Eye Joe?



You can sign up for Apple Music at this point. Me? Nahhhhhhhh. There are also a lot better offers if you dig around too.



Siri knows everyone.



Tum tee tum.

Once done it is time to play.

Using the HomePod Mini

This device is best enjoyed when it has Apple Music attached to it. Of course yours truly does not have an Apple Music Account – negating one of the direct tie-in benefits.

So how do I use mine?

There are some basic controls on the top of the HomePod Mini – good enough to summon Siri or change the volume



The top of the HomePod – controls illuminated.

Streaming from an iTunes Library source.

I have streamed primarily from my phone (iPhone 12 Pro) or laptop (MacBook Pro 16) rather than Apple Music or other streaming services. Thus I am using AirPlay to play music rather than Apple Music.

It is pretty simple go to music select the output device press play.

From my MacBook Pro it is a matter of changing the audio output from the speakers to the HomePod (mine lives in the living room) and off we go again.



Why yes I have minimal taste. Have you not seen my test playlist?

Streaming from the phone is even easier – bring the iPhone playing music and it transfers the source live over to the HomePod Mini. All thanks to the U1 Ultra-wideband chip as well as some software magic.

Integration from other audio streaming services

Of course Apple Music is the primary streaming service that the HomePod likes to use. You can also integrate with iHeartRadio Radio.com via TuneIn – so I have been using it to steam my local radio station (Free Radio Birmingham) as well as others that are local to me.

If I want to stream any BBC programmes I must play them BBC Sounds and fling them across to the HomePod using AirPlay.

And it is fiddly mainly as it is more than a few taps to the audio controls.

Other fun functions

Yes Siri is still a thing. It does have a “command” over the Apple devices in my flat allowing me to say “Hey Siri” and for it to take the voice command (with other devices fuming in the background). Whilst it can be the basis of a HomeKit hub my house is decidedly dumb when it comes to smart devices – about the only smart devices I have are the Chromecast with Google TV and the HomePod.

The rest is hard IT stuff (no I will not get smart bulbs smart thermostats Amazon Ring Cameras that leak data faster than you can say “Go to the AmaZen room and think about what you’ve done”).

Maybe the main function I use Siri for is asking about the weather and asking where the hell my iPhone is. Do not look at me like that – you would do the same thing if your phone is buried halfway down the sofa.

Siri’s results can be… well. It is not the greatest and still needs some major development compared to other voice recognition platforms out there.

There is also the intercom feature in the HomePod Mini as well – useful if you have more than one of them and need to message each other. Me? Little point when there’s only me in the house.

Audio Tests

Let us move onto the audio tests. For this again I am streaming from my phone my laptop and some Siri commands.

If you have been around when I have done some cheap headphone reviews you know I have assembled a YouTube playlist of some of the tracks I test with – namely then you can compare them with your headphones or audio device (and as we go on this list will become my standard testing list).

It is an eclectic mix – mostly actually lives on my iPhone for straight transfer to the audio device

The list is published on YouTube but for those who don’t want to click a link here is my list:

Crab Rave – Nordstrom

Keiino – Spirit in the Sky

Justified and Ancient – The KLF featuring Tammy Winnett

Rhapsody in Blue – Gary Graffman · New York Philharmonic Orchestra · George Gershwin (Manhattan film version)

Sands of Time – T. Stebbins/Sugano

On Her Majesty’s Secret Service – John Barry/The Propellerheads/David Arnold

Glorious – Andreas Johnson

Unfinished Sympathy – Massive Attack

Pompeii – Bastille

A Little Time – The Beautiful South

The Ball – Craig Armstrong

Creep – Scala and the Kolacny Brothers (cover of the Radiohead version)



Note – I’m expanding the list after this year’s Eurovision Song Contest. You’ll have to guess which song I put on though 😉

In this test my HomePod Mini is on the windowsill with some other bits and bobs. There is not a lot of science in terms of why it has been placed there – other than it is within reasonable earshot of the sofa and near enough in a line of hearing near me without me turning it up to deafening noise levels that would annoy next door.

The clicks and thumps of Crab Rave are a good start with the base thumpy whilst the clicks of the crabs are clear through the main music with a sense of left-to-right being pretty good. The thuds of the base and separate trebles seem to continue well through the playlist.

Moving onto Classical music Rhapsody in Blue was clear throughout with the instruments easy to identify as music played with a little distortion when the volume was cranked up. I tend to run the speaker between 50% and 70% volume – mainly not to generate noise complaints but also beyond that – it can be a little more than loud.

On a single HomePod it can try to a reasonable “left to right” on certain tracks – however on the Elenor Rigby test (which is mostly Paul McCartney singing on the right-hand side of your ear) it was more mono than not. On a more processed track such as “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” the separation is almost there.

When pumped up some of the tracks had distortion on them – which is to be expected with the design – but I did have to push some of these tracks to the volume limit and annoy the neighbours

Travelling with the HomePod Mini

A nice idea I had would be to take the HomePod Mini with me and use it as a big speaker for meetings. Now that is a lot harder than it needs to be sad with you either needing to change the settings in the Home App or reset and re-setup the thing each time.

Even when the homepod was near because it couldn’t talk over Wi-Fi I was getting a bucket of errors.



Well that’s a load of nothing burger isn’t it?

It is not ideal – but it is possible. In the end I kept it at home as my running between networks was becoming a less important thing using it on the road .

I also tried resetting it up in the Home app but to not much success.

What if I am outside the Apple Ecosystem?

Let us be honest – you need to be deep into the Apple Ecosystem to make the best benefit of it (and if you check the requirements list an iPhone is required).



No ‘droids (or anything else) allowed.

And even I cannot take advantage of some of the features as I refuse to license my music monthly from Apple thus having to use AirPlay a lot more than I would like.

IF you are in the Google/Android/Amazon ecosystems this probably will not be the best speaker for you as you will have issues communicating with it. There is a decent Reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/ktjh0x/play_music_from_android_phone_to_homepod_mini/ on how to communicate with it.

But it is making things complex for the sake of being complex because you haven’t chosen to have an iPhone as your primary phone device.

A banging speaker – with some silly mistakes

This is a banging little speaker. Make no mistake. The Apple engineers did a bang-up job of the speaker array along with the software engineers who did their jobs to handle what you can at it.

Some things bug me about it – namely that power cord. There was no need for Apple to not make it a detachable USB-C Cable – which I can only conclude is for when you tug on it once too many times you will have to pay Apple £99/$99 for another one – as opposed to £5 for a decent quality USB-C cable.

In addition you need to be in the Apple ecosystem to take advantage of the features it offers – and that may be having an iPhone or iPad… and that is just to set up the unit

The lack of ease to move the device between networks is also a pain if you want to travel with it and use the speaker as a posh conference phone.

However when it comes to playing music and podcasts and finding your phone it excels in its primary purpose – being a speaker. The smart features are a welcome addition and if you can utilise them – it makes a reasonable assistant (depending on Siri’s mood).

As for me? It has got a spot on the windowsill. Good for when I want to pump tunes listen to a podcast clearly or just want the radio on.

Disclosure

This Apple HomePod was brought from my own pocket and as such is not a review sample from Apple Inc. As such review samples of the device don’t tend to come my way and have to buy these like everyone else – hence why I might be a little later.

I also have to pay for my own replacements if I drop them.

A group of scientists in China has come up with a novel coating for everyday cotton that gives it an even broader set of useful traits enabling it to repel oil and water with ease and most impressively float even when bearing loads many times its own weight.

While a popular fabric for a number of reasons one thing cotton can't offer is an ability to repel water and oils which means it simply soaks them up and is therefore quite susceptible to stains. Researchers have been working on so-called superamphiphobic coatings that can bestow regular cotton with the water- and oil-repelling capabilities and with some success. But the methods are difficult time-consuming and involve many steps meaning they aren't presently viable for large-scale manufacturing.

Among the material scientists tinkering away in this area is a team from China's Wuhan University of Technology who have developed a comparatively simple ""one-pot"" coating technique that involves just a single step. The scientists mix dopamine hydrochloride and a pair of molecules together with a piece of cotton fabric for 24 hours. This causes a chemical reaction that sees the ingredients bond together to form a uniform dark brown coating on the fabric.

Through subsequent testing the team showed that this new coating made the regular cotton impermeable to many common liquids and not just at the surface. The inner cotton fibers were found to be liquid-proof too. Fine sand meanwhile could be easily washed away with water. Only when subjecting the material to strong acid did its water resistance become compromised while repeated washing was found to lessen its oil resistance.

Interestingly the technique was also found to create nanoscale pockets of air at the point where the coating attached to the fabric. This enabled the cotton to float in water even when bearing up to 35 times its own weight and 27 times its own weight when floating in oil.

According to the scientists these attributes open up some interesting possibilities around functional fabrics that could find use in buoyant swimming suits that are possibly just as comfortable a regular ones and also repel water. They could also find use in more comfortable lifejackets or protective clothing.

The research was published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces while the video below offers a look at the some of the scientists' experiments.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

(1:19)

Open Extended Reactions

The Indiana Pacers have submitted 78 instances of incorrect or non-calls to the NBA that they felt put them at a disadvantage in Games 1 and 2 against the New York Knicks a league source told ESPN.

Pacers coach Rick Carlisle speaking after Indiana fell behind 2-0 in the Eastern Conference semifinals with a 130-121 loss to New York on Wednesday said the team had identified 29 questionable refereeing decisions from Game 1. The source said the Pacers then identified 49 plays from Game 2 that they felt were incorrectly called or not called at all and submitted them overnight to the NBA office.

Carlisle said they had decided not to send the Game 1 calls to the league office for review but reversed that decision after Game 2 had similar officiating issues from their perspective.

As part of NBA protocol the clips will also be shared with the Knicks.

""I can promise you that we're going to submit these tonight"" Carlisle said after being ejected in the final minute when he was given two technical fouls. ""New York can get ready. They'll see 'em too. I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials but we deserve a fair shot.""

A frustrated Carlisle also implied the Pacers were being penalized by officials because they were playing against the league's largest market.

""Small-market teams deserve an equal shot"" Carlisle said. ""They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing.""

Carlisle was ejected after growing upset about several calls in Game 2 particularly when officials correctly reversed a double-dribble violation that could have given the Pacers a key possession with the outcome still in doubt.

In Game 1 a kicked ball violation was called in error against the Pacers but not corrected a decision that ended up costing the team three vital points during the 121-117 loss.

The Madison Square Garden crowd which was elated when star Jalen Brunson returned in the second half after missing the entire second quarter to deal with a right foot issue made the environment hostile for the Pacers and Carlisle said he believed it affected the officiating to favor the Knicks.

The Pacers will have to examine their defensive film as well. After allowing the Knicks to shoot 65% in the second half in Game 1 as they lost a lead New York shot 67% in the third quarter of Game 2 and flipped the game outscoring Indiana 36-18 behind Brunson's return.

Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton who scored 34 points in bouncing back from putting up six in Game 1 wasn't going to put all the blame on the officiating.

""Let's not pretend like [officiating] is the only reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough"" Haliburton said. ""We just got to be better.""

One other issue for the Pacers to review as the series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday (7 p.m. ET ESPN) is how to guard Brunson. Backup guard T.J. McConnell was somewhat effective in slowing Brunson in Games 1 and 2 but Carlisle took him out with seven minutes to play and the Knicks up two points replacing him with starter Andrew Nembhard.

Brunson scored 10 of his 29 points down the stretch with Nembhard as his primary defender and is 14-of-21 shooting for 33 points against Nembhard over the first two games according to ESPN Stats & Information. Carlisle said he considered bringing McConnell who had a +10 plus/minus on the night back in but decided against it because it wasn't how the team has played throughout the season.

McConnell supported his coach's decision.

""Rick is a Hall of Fame coach and has been doing this for a long time so the rotations that he plays we trust that they're the right ones and I fully support him"" McConnell said. ""Whenever my number is called I'll be ready.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvdXMvY29sc29uLXdoaXRlaGVhZC11bWFzcy1jb21tZW5jZW1lbnQtc3BlZWNoLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colson Whitehead Cancels His Commencement Speech at UMass Amherst,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning author Colson Whitehead said Thursday that he would not give the commencement address at the University of Massachusetts Amherst on May 18 as planned citing the administration’s decision to call the police on campus protesters.

I have to withdraw as your commencement speaker. I give all my best wishes and congratulations to the class of ’24 and pray for the safety of the Palestinian people the return of the hostages and an end to this terrible war.”

Michael Goldsmith a representative for Mr. Whitehead said the author had no further comment.

The school said that the ceremony would proceed without a commencement speaker.

The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA5L3VjbGEtZmFjdWx0eS1jaGFuY2VsbG9ycy1yZXNpZ25hdGlvbi1jYW1wdXMtcHJvdGVzdHPSAWpodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vd29ybGQvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wOS91Y2xhLWZhY3VsdHktY2hhbmNlbGxvcnMtcmVzaWduYXRpb24tY2FtcHVzLXByb3Rlc3Rz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More than 800 faculty and staff at UCLA call for chancellor’s resignation,"More than 800 faculty and staff at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) have called for the chancellor’s resignation following attacks by counter-protesters on pro-Palestinian student demonstrators and a violent police raid of the Gaza solidarity encampment on campus last week.

More than a hundred professors and other teaching staff gathered on Thursday to deliver a letter in support of their students engaged in pro-Palestinian activism demanding Gene Block immediately step down as chancellor and an academic senate vote of no confidence in him. The letter also called for authorities to drop all charges against students staff and faculty who were involved in the encampment.

The mass faculty action at one of the most prominent public universities in the US comes as campuses across the country have been roiled by pro-Palestinian encampment demonstrations and aggressive law enforcement crackdowns during graduation season.

Holding signs that said “Take a walk Block” “UCLA faculty and staff … stand with our students” and “Disclose & Divest” professors from across departments recounted the brutal violence by counter-demonstrators on 30 April as police failed to intervene and the subsequent mass arrests of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

“We are outraged at the university’s failure to protect its students from vigilante and police violence and its refusal to uphold its stated values as made evident in the forcible removal and arrest of peacefully protesting students faculty and staff” said Dan Froot a UCLA world arts and cultures and dance professor representing senate faculty from his department.

A group of volunteer medics who helped care for demonstrators injured by police and counter-demonstrators told reporters that they had treated a wide range of injuries including severe head lacerations facial fractures subarachnoid hemorrhages rubber-bullet wounds broken bones and asthma attacks from chemical irritants. Katherine Marino a history professor who read a statement from faculty in her department noted that at least 25 students had been hospitalized and roughly 200 protesters had been arrested with police “dragging visibly injured students away”.

The letter also expressed solidarity with students’ demands calling on UCLA to publish a report within 30 days disclosing all investments and for the university to “divest from military-weapons-production companies and supporting systems”.

Susan Slyomovics an anthropology professor read a statement on behalf of 75 Jewish faculty and staff saying Block had “misused Jews” by suggesting the encampment had to be dismantled to prevent antisemitism: “We assert that critiques of Israel are not presumptively antisemitic … that Jews who support the liberation of Palestine must not be devalued.”

The faculty action comes as UAW local 4811 the largest union of academic workers representing 48000 graduate student workers throughout the University of California system is voting on a possible strike over administrators’ response to pro-Palestinian protests. Matt Barreto a professor of political science and Chicana/o studies said the group of professors was discussing the “possibility to withhold our own additional labor” until the demands are met. If graduate students go on strike professors will not cross picket lines or do their work he said.

UCLA and the Los Angeles police department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Block announced earlier this week the creation of a campus safety office headed by a former Sacramento police chief to “identify the perpetrators of the violence and hold them to account”.

Purnima Mankekar a UCLA anthropology professor said she felt an obligation to defend students at the encampment. The students she said had gone to great lengths to de-escalate violent attacks from counter-demonstrators. “My job is to make sure the learning and intellectual growth of our students goes unimpeded … When that gets disrupted by violence that is perpetrated on them by outside instigators or by the police that makes me very upset” she said.

If students are unable to engage in peaceful protests “the university is not a university it’s a police state” she added. “The parents of our students entrust us with them. It’s our job to keep them safe.”

It was significant that so many faculty had signed on to the letter said Gary Segura professor of public policy political science and Chicano/a studies and a former dean. “Even faculty who may not have agreed with the student protesters’ underlying issues were mortified by the video of LAPD cops firing [less-lethal munitions] into the crowd. Those are students. I found it just terrifying.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS81MTAwODA3OC9mb3JtZXItdXRhaC1yZXAtY2hyaXMtY2Fubm9uLWRpZXMtYXQtYWdlLTcz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Utah Rep. Chris Cannon dies at age 73,"Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes

SALT LAKE CITY — Former Utah Rep. Chris Cannon died Wednesday at age 73.

Cannon represented the state's 3rd Congressional District from 1997 to 2009 when he was unseated by Jason Chaffetz.

Cannon served on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law and was one of the House impeachment managers tasked with prosecuting the impeachment case against President Bill Clinton in the U.S. Senate. He served as chairman of the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee for several years beginning in 2003 then served as the subcommittee's ranking member when the House swapped to Democratic control in 2007.

News of Cannon's death prompted an outpouring of support from politicians in Utah for his wife and children. His brother confirmed the death to the Deseret News.

""I'm stunned and saddened by breaking news of the death of my friend former Congressman Chris Cannon"" Sen. Mike Lee R-Utah said in a social media post. ""I will miss his insights encouragement and friendship. Sharon and I mourn with his wife Claudia along with the couple's children and extended family all of whom are in our prayers as we who knew him try to come to terms with this heartbreaking news.""

Gov. Spencer Cox said he and his wife Abby were ""saddened"" to hear of Cannon's passing.

""Congressman Cannon worked hard for the people of Utah and was a dedicated public servant working on criminal justice drug policy regulatory reform and other issues during his time in the House of Representatives"" he posted. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time.""

""I am saddened to learn of Chris' passing"" Rep. John Curtis — who currently represents the 3rd District — told KSL.com through a spokesman. ""He was one of a kind. A visionary with big ideas coupled with personality and thoughtful humor. He served the residents of Utah's 3rd Congressional District well.""

Chaffetz said in a post: ""Today I heard Congressman Chris Cannon passed away. God bless. I hope we all can thank him for his valiant patriotic work fighting for the USA. May blessings be with his family.""

Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson expressed ""heartfelt condolences"" to Cannon's family and loved ones calling the late lawmaker a ""great leader and dedicated representative who served his community with passion and integrity.""

A Utah native Cannon earned his law degree from Brigham Young University's J. Reuben Clark Law School. He is the great-grandson of George Q. Cannon an early member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a territorial delegate to Congress.

Cannon's brother Joseph Cannon was chairman of the Utah Republican Party and later the editor of the Deseret News.

Prior to his election to Congress in 1996 Cannon worked as an associate solicitor for the U.S. Department of the Interior and served as finance chairman of the Utah Republican Party. Cannon made his way to Washington by beating incumbent Rep. Bill Orton a Democrat.

As a lawmaker Cannon said he was inspired by former Republican senator and presidential candidate Barry Goldwater of Arizona.

""There's no questioning the fact that Barry Goldwater was as profound an influence on me politically as anybody. ... He becomes sort of this point in time where we shifted away from where we'd gone with Roosevelt and the socialization of America and he was one of the first people to say 'You know this is the wrong direction'"" he told the Deseret News in 2006.

Cannon's efforts to prevent a new telecommunications monopoly are among his proudest achievements through his first decade in Congress he said in the same interview.

""I hope new forms of competition continue to emerge so that we over time continue to significantly decrease our telecommunications costs and our data costs"" he said.

After leaving office Cannon in 2010 backed a Utah citizens' ballot initiative proposing ethics reforms in state government.

Cannon sponsored or cosponsored over 1100 bills during his time in Congress 74 of which were signed into law according to the congressional records."

The availability of large 3D seismic surveys (i.e. greater than 10000 km2) offers unprecedented and challenging opportunities for multi-scale seismic characterization as they are likely to sample a representative amount of various tectono-stratigraphic features from different tectonic events. While manual and semi-automated structural interpretation of large seismic datasets is a very time-consuming task often leading to a simplified fault model a geology-driven machine-learning workflow can significantly improve the turnaround time and accuracy of seismic fault mapping and characterization. We successfully applied this novel workflow on a 20000 km2 seismic survey with depths up to 10 km capturing a variety of fault signatures seismic signal-to-noise ratios and frequencies (data courtesy of CGG and OMV Norge). Our approach enables the 3D fault interpretation process to be performed in a matter of hours compared to days while being geologically and mechanically realistic (Figure 1).

Generating a Fault Baseline Map with a Convolutional Neural Network

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and using data and is considered a part of artificial intelligence. ML algorithms build a model based on sample data known as ‘training data’ to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. The proposed approach combines two training strategies of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN): a ‘global’ scheme based on the generation of thousands of synthetic seismic volumes with labeled faults and a ‘local’ scheme trained using fit-for-basin high-resolution 3D fault labels generated using automated deterministic solutions. The full workflow covers data audit; prediction of a first fault framework (baseline) by applying a 3D CNN trained on synthetic data; baseline quality assessment and identification of missing structures; baseline refinement by retraining locally the 3D CNN; structural analysis of the predicted faulting pattern; and fault network classification based on relative timing of faulting.

First we collect and integrate geological knowledge to allow for the assessment of the seismic data quality in the area of interest in this case the North Sea. The North Sea rift system is characterized by a variety of faulting patterns in terms of geometry and size cutting through the thinned crust. The rift system is interpreted to have migrated northward since its initiation in the Late Permian – Early Triassic period (Phillips et al. 2019). In this study the area of interest captures three main tectonic events with a given stress regime for each one. Firstly a rifting phase one in Late Permian – Early Triassic with N–S striking faults and reactivation of Devonian shear zones. Secondly a rifting phase two in Late Jurassic – Early Cretaceous with NE–SW striking faults and lastly a Late – syn to post rifting phase with N–S striking faults.

To address the 3D multi-scale faulting patterns and to optimize the dataflow pipeline for machine learning we use a laterally equally sampled (50 × 50 meters) seismic volume with a vertical sampling of 20 meters. Then we deploy a ‘global’ 3D CNN over the full survey (Wu et al. 2019 Sarajærvi et al. 2020) to obtain a baseline map of the fault network. The training is based on a collection of 6000 synthetic seismic volumes (128 × 128 × 128 samples) with various resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios that contain labeled faults. We evaluate the baseline and validate the consistency and completeness of the predicted fault traces in 3D over the full survey focusing on fault termination connectivity and continuity. This way structures not completely detected or missing in 3D are identified to be further improved in the next steps of the workflow. Then we adopt a fit-for-basin approach aiming for a local enhancement of the fault network map. The enhancement is performed using deterministic solutions in selected sub-areas capturing the region’s main fault signatures from which and when needed 3D labeled training data are generated to retrain the 3D CNN (Figure 1).

Quality Assessment of the Global Machine Learning Baseline

The primary goal of the proposed iterative ML approach is to honor the geological context and principles while capturing the local tectonic variability with a high level of detail and in 3D. To achieve this level of accuracy and to ensure that geological rules are respected we consider key structural mapping concepts where the domain expert has a major role to steer and validate in the sub-areas. These include the type and location of the detected seismic discontinuities the seismic horizons displacement along the discontinuities the relationship between the detected discontinuities and the 3D consistency of the fault geometry.

In the sub-areas we optionally combine the baseline map with a set of advanced seismic attributes (Figure 1 option 1). For example first an amplitude-based approach with edge detection attributes can improve the continuity and connectivity of the fault network (Etchebes et al. 2019). And second the strata indicator that can highlight stratified from unstratified chaotic areas. Defining contrasts may be used to identify structural discontinuities such as low-angle fault planes (Bounaim et al. 2019). If the baseline map does not require local improvement then we proceed with option 2 (Figure 1).

Improving the Fault Map by Retraining the 3D CNN Locally

At this stage of the workflow we proceed with a structural analysis that consists of a detailed study of the seismic signature across the mapped discontinuities. From our fault sub-cubes structural properties such as fault azimuth dip angle and planarity indicator are computed in a set of property volumes (Figure 1). These properties are used to assist the geoscientist in the structural interpretation as well as to condition the input fault volume for the subsequent fault extraction. Faults are extracted as point sets at the seismic resolution (Bounaim et al. 2013; Etchebes et al. 2019). Thereafter the extracted and verified faults are transferred into triangulated meshes to obtain closed planes. These fault planes are then populated into labeled fault cubes and used as training data in the local 3D CNN (Figure 1). Subsequently we run the trained network over the full survey. Finally we validate the predicted faulting pattern by combining the refined set of structural properties with the strata indicator vector attribute map over the full survey (Figures 2 and 3).

Figure 2: Object-based structural analysis applied on the full survey. (a) Extracted fault point sets (b) (c) (d) and (e) are fault strike (in degrees) dip direction (in degrees) dip angle (in degrees) and depth (in meters) properties respectively mapped on the extracted fault point sets.

The fault network map resulting from our workflow can be then used as an input for various applications. One of them is the paleo and present-day stress analysis which consists of combining the fault network analysis with stratigraphy sequence boundary analysis enabling the classification of faults following their relative timing (Figure 3). The latter provides an indication of the evolution of the stress regime through time. The understanding of the paleo-stress regime and the present-day maximum horizontal stress (S Hmax ) direction can help to assess the potential conductivity of faults under a particular S Hmax  as the strike azimuth of conductive faults should coincide with the direction of S Hmax .

Figure 3: Fault map and strata indicator vector attribute combined for a relative timing of faulting analysis (on the left side) and cross-section (on the right) where relative timing of faulting is established based on their structural relation (1-oldest 2 and 3-youngest) and the use of typical horizons (BCU top Heather and top Shetland). Credit: Schlumberger.



In summary the combination of ML deterministic methods and domain knowledge applied to seismic structural interpretation increased the confidence in detecting geologically sound faulting patterns from seismic. Structural interpretation of large surveys by selecting key smaller areas of interest and ideally capturing the main regional faulting patterns is an appropriate starting point to ensure that the 3D CNN training is as representative as possible. Our approach of validating the consistency of the detected faulting patterns through analysis of automatically extracted structural properties (azimuth dip planarity depth) and selected seismic tectono-stratigraphic attributes is unique and allows the application of a time-efficient fit-for-purpose approach on a very large-scale survey.

By the end of the morning the 12-year-old would have his own space to drift off into dreams about that future – and more.

That’s because after the camp was over Jacorey and 50 other children in the Memphis area learned they all would receive beds of their own.

Ashley HomeStore donated the beds as part of its Hope to Dream program a project it started more than a decade ago.

In conjunction with Youth Villages Memphis Athletic Ministries and the University of Memphis Ashley HomeStore unveiled the metal frame beds replete with mattresses and comforters as the children watched. Some squealed and ran toward them.

It was understandable. Getting a bed of one's own is a big deal when you sleep on pallets or on air mattresses or with too many siblings.

Some of them like Jacorey sleep on the floor.

“It feels nice getting a bed and not having to sleep on the floor “said Jacorey whose brusque responses belied his impatience with the reporter who was wasting precious minutes he preferred to spend with the Tigers footballers.

“But now that I have a bed I don’t have to.”

Lauren Hamsley spokeswoman for Ashley HomeStore said the company has given away 110000 beds since 2010 and has partnered with the university on the giveaways for six years. With every mattress that is purchased she said a portion of the profits is given to Hope to Dream.

Said Katie Jones director of development for Youth Villages in West Tennessee: “This is important to all our kids at Youth Villages who might not have that safe space at night to lay their heads down and to be warm and comfortable.”

At least one Tiger football player wide receiver Javon Ivory said he’s no stranger to Jacorey’s plight. As a child growing up in Grove Hill Alabama he often found himself without a bed.

“I can relate to that background because it was me my mom and four boys… It was a houseful of boys so I was in an environment where I had to sleep on the floor every once in a while” Ivory said.

“I literally gave my cousin my bed so he could sleep well while I slept on an air mattress.”

Anthony Jones Tigers assistant running back coach and recruiter said other players can relate too. ""A lot of our players come from impoverished backgrounds a lot of them come from economic challenges. So they wanted to give back…to be able to partner with them [Ashley HomeStore] is a blessing.”

Hope to Dream is also tapping into a problem that isn't widely discussed: 2-3% of children in the United States don’t have beds according to Sleep In Heavenly Peace a national organization that focuses on providing children with beds.

Children who have to sleep on the floor on pallets or in crowded conditions often fail to get the rest they need to focus and learn in school and they may struggle with hyperactivity depression and other illnesses.

Barbara Garrison a corporate trainer for Ashley HomeStore recalled how emotional she became when she met a little boy in Mississippi who didn't have a bed.

“He was 6 years old and he had never slept in a bed” Garrison said. “It just broke my heart in two. I had to cover my face so he wouldn’t see my tears.

“He said he had slept on a pallet all his life.”

But the children who gathered at the Tigers’ indoor training facility at Billy J. Murphy Athletic Complex as well as 50 other children in the community who will receive beds as part of Youth Villages and Memphis Athletic Ministries won’t have to worry about that anymore.

Some were already making plans. And dreaming dreams.

“I can lay in it I can take naps in it and sometimes I can get comfortable in it” said 7-year-old Takari Shields who laid on her bed and hugged it.

“I can’t wait to sleep in it.”

Jacob Likes who plays center for the Tigers basked in the children’s joy.

“I’m really happy to be out here” Likes said. “I’m from here [Memphis] and it was great to give back to the kids and to see their reactions when they got the beds.

“It’s a good feeling.”

A start-up pharmaceutical manufacturer with a reported potential to employ thousands is set to anchor a $240 million mixed-use development being built next year at the gateway to Oklahoma City’s innovation district.

Wheeler Bio founded by Oklahoma City investor Christian Kanady and scientist Dr. Jesse McCool is set to start with up to 100 scientists working on three floors of Kanady’s Ziggurat building at 120 Robert S. Kerr Ave. The company is set to expand into up to half of a 400000-square-foot manufacturing and office complex at NE 8 and Stiles Circle.

Construction is set to start at the Ziggurat building this summer; work will begin on the larger development at NE 8 and Stiles Circle in February. And while developers promise what is shown in their renderings is what they will deliver timing of an innovation hall is in question.

“We believe that Wheeler Bio in and of itself could represent a billion-dollar business that employs thousands of Oklahomans if done correctly” Kanady said. “It’s pretty intriguing that the University of Oklahoma already has a pretty substantial chemical engineering program that could automatically feed into Wheeler Bio as its workforce.”

Oklahoma City has spent the half century transforming an area initially anchored by the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine into a 321-acre Oklahoma Health Center campus that is home to about two dozen medical research and bio-tech organizations. A series of studies suggested merging the Oklahoma Health Center and nearby Automobile Alley into an “innovation district.”

Kanady who last year invested in the launching of Prairie Surf Studios at the former Cox Convention Center got his start in the energy industry working at Chesapeake Energy and then founding his own company Echo Energy.

Oklahoma City’s future he said must go beyond the energy industry that helped make the city what it is today.

“In times of rapid change experience can be your worst enemy” Kanady said quoting the late billionaire oilman John Paul Getty. “While I very much have an appreciation for this city having been built by the oil and gas industry I also believe the oil and gas industry as well as our city would benefit from having other industries.”

The Innovation District is already home to one pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. Cytovance Biologics was founded by Dr. William Canfield 15 years ago at what is now the OU Research Park at NE 8 and Lincoln. The company employs about 350 in three buildings at the research park and two others nearby and is a contract manufacturer serving large clients across the world.

Wheeler Bio is being promoted as a way to keep building the bio-tech industry by serving emerging biopharma companies that require flexible partnerships over rigid transactional contracts.

McCool moved from Boston to Oklahoma City in 2013 when he was hired by Cytovance Biologics to oversee growth and development. He was promoted from chief technology officer to CEO before leaving to start Wheeler Bio.

Cytovance Biologics grew into an international service provider during McCool’s time with the company. McCool however felt like Oklahoma City still had a gap to fill in keeping drug development in the innovation district.

“They are more focused on commercial manufacturing” McCool said. “And my heart is in the small research side and focusing on the transition between drug discovery and development.”

Kanady and McCool met while the investor was looking to fund efforts to improve COVID-19 testing and find ways to create safer spaces to reduce risk of infection.

The result of that effort Wheeler Bio started work earlier this year through a partnership with Waltham Mass.-based Alloy Therapeutics. Alloy was launched in 2017 with the vision of providing affordable non-exclusive access to scientists in academia small and medium bio-tech and large biopharma.

“Our idea is to design a new type of bio-manufacturing service provider one that is laser focused on emerging biopharmas which are driving the industry” McCool said. “They are the small companies focused on R&D. They don’t have the money to go out and invest in manufacturing of their drug. There is a lot of out-sourcing in manufacturing that goes on and there are some shortages of capacity and high-quality services.”

McCool and Kanady also say they see a shift in drug manufacturing to return to the United States following challenges encountered with the COVID-19 pandemic and manufacturing located in adversarial countries like China (Cytovance Biologics was purchased by a Chinese company in 2015).

“There will be more manufacturing coming back to the United States as a matter of national security” McCool said. “These are topics being discussed and there are a lot of federal dollars pointed at meeting some of these objectives and reshoring manufacturing. COVID did show everyone the sort of bottlenecks that exist due to global production.”

Wheeler Bio is part of a growing vision for innovation district

The unnamed development that will be home to Wheeler Bio started with a much smaller ambition by developer Mark Beffort to build a single 200000-square-foot building that would have shared an existing garage with OSU Discovery (formerly home to the Baker Hughes Energy Innovation Center).

“It was originally designed for the Oklahoma Advanced Manufacturing Center” Beffort said. “As we got into the project we wanted to expand the scope from manufacturing for aerospace and a new type of 3d printing to also the bio-medical field. And we were not able to accomplish that on that smaller site.”

Project architect Ryan Dawson principal at FSB was tasked by Beffort and co-developer Richard Tanenbaum to design a mixed-use innovation campus that would be located at the innovation district gateway envisioned in a master plan developed by the Brookings Institute and global planning firm Perkins & Will.

The plan called for development far different from the institutional single user anchors in the Oklahoma Health Center. The future home for Wheeler Bio will include offices and manufacturing space for other tenants a 100-room “Stiles Hotel” restaurants retail and lit-up plazas.

“Anytime you have a single-program element in isolation it has minimal levels of activation” Dawson said. “The goal with mixed use is to create a diverse experience for users and visitors. With the hotel and offices and retail and all the components it extends the hours of activation and creates a vibrant experience.”

The location of the development also required a design to incorporate Stiles Park – the city’s oldest – and the 100-foot-high Beacon of Hope that sines a light into the air from the circular park. Plans call for removing the roads that surround Stiles Park and incorporating it into a pedestrian plaza that will connect the first phase manufacturing offices and hotel with a second phase office building set to start construction as the first phase is completed.

The only unknown in the project is inclusion of an innovation hall that gets $10 million as part of MAPS 4 if the project is provided a $10 million match.

The location of the innovation hall in the Beffort and Tanenbaum plan matches what was pitched to MAPS 4 voters and Katy Boren president of the innovation district said the hall location has the support of the area’s anchors.

The proposed innovation hall is designed to be built atop underground parking that will serve the hall and the rest of the development. That parking donated land utilities and other considerations are looked at as being part of a match for the MAPS 4 funding.

“We want to make sure this development is the best it can be” Beffort said. “And as a world class facility it should not be inhibited by a parking structure. So we’re designing three levels below grade.”

If the hall is not built on the same schedule of the adjoining development Beffort estimates it will cost another $1.5 million to put a lid on the parking compared to building the hall atop the parking.

“They put MAPS projects in a certain order” Beffort said. “We’re hoping the innovation hall will move up in that order because having it as a part of our project up front with us saves a significant amount of dollars from an infrastructure standpoint.”

Mayor David Holt said he would keep an open mind to the innovation hall scheduling but added his vote is one of nine in addition to input from city staff and a citizens’ advisory board.

“One of the strengths of MAPS is we have a lot of cooks in the kitchen” Holt said. “It’s important the citizens’ advisory board MAPS staff and council be a part of anything that requires judgment and sensitivity.”

Design work continues and Dawson said construction documents are being developed and the development will reflect what is shown in renderings.

Boren sees the innovation hall as key to not just the development but continued creation of a true innovation district.

“It’s a front door the public house of innovation and it’s at a central location for the district” Boren said. “People will know where to plug in and where to go for events and gatherings and where they can exchange ideas and collaborate. It will be heavily programed with special events and subject oriented programming. It will be a central hub for the innovation eco-system across Oklahoma City.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FzY29tcHJlc3Npb25tYWdhemluZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xOC9raW5kZXItbW9yZ2FuLWluY3JlYXNlcy1ybmctcG9ydGZvbGlvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kinder Morgan Increases RNG Portfolio,,,,,,,,,,

In this case it was the best 3-day we’ve seen for a family film during the pandemic with $31.65M. That’s also the best for Warner Bros. during the Covid-19 era beating Godzilla vs. Kong‘s big Easter opening of $31.625M by a smidge and also a record career opening for director Malcolm D. Lee beating the opening weekend of his Girls Trip by $31.2M.

“It’s the family movie of the summer and it’s exciting to see audiences come back in big numbers” said Warner Bros. domestic theatrical distribution chief Jeff Goldstein who praised the big marketing push by the studio for the Looney Tunes NBA sequel which included everything from bus wraps loud social media drumming from star and producer LeBron James and the pic’s mobile game Looney Tunes World of Mayhem which has a week’s theme devoted to the sequel.

iSpot shows that Warner Bros spent $15.2M in TV spots on the Looney Tunes live-action animation hybrid movie (since April 3 yielding 993.6M impressions) which is more than what other studios have been spending on family pics during Covid-19 i.e. Sony with Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway ($8.7M) and Universal with The Boss Baby: Family Business ($13.4M). Warner’s spend here on Space Jam 2 is also less than the $22.5M they forked over for TV ads on In the Heights.

The question is whether and when Warner Bros. can get this movie to cross $100M given the whole HBO Max factor (the movie plays free to subscribers during its first 28 days then its second month is strictly in theaters). In a regular pre-pandemic marketplace without any dynamic windowing strategies this wouldn’t be a question. It took Warner Bros. 12 weekends to get Godzilla vs. Kong ($31.625M 3-day) past the century mark stateside.

Warners according to iSpot bought ads for Space Jam 2 across Nick ABC NBC TNT and Cartoon Network on such shows as SpongeBob SquarePants NBA basketball College basketball America’s Got Talent and The Loud House.

Social media was huge here for Space Jam 2 with RelishMix reporting that the sequel’s reach across Facebook Twitter YouTube and Instagram was 601.2M “well above the family animated norms” thanks to the social power of James (166.2M) and Zendaya (138M) in the mix.

“The quadrangulation of Looney Tunes social network (19.1M) along with HBO Max (growing to 3.3M) Warner Bros. Pictures (56.7M) and the channels for the Space Jam movie (868K) are driving strong activity on international materials — dropping materials across WB YouTube channels to Italy Spain and the Latin channels. Instagram is most notable at 38% in terms of social platform segment at 234.1M fans for the cast. Key soundtrack artists added to the SMU and activating with song posts including John Legend (43.7M) on the red carpet at the premiere plus The Jonas Brothers (25.5M) and Joyner Lucas (7.1M)” reports RelishMix.

James has been posting about the film heavily and even Dwayne Johnson did so to his 58.8M Facebook fans about a song by his wife Lauren Hashian that’s in the film (James thanked him as well for the shoutout).

Reports RelishMix about the pre-buzz for Space Jam 2: “Conversation ran wildly mixed with throwbacks to the original crunchy comparisons of LeBron vs Michael Jordan with hopes that MJ makes a cameo — and dreams of Space Jam 3 based on Kobe or Steph Curry. With a rowdy hoops crowd fans were expectedly skeptical about the remake but noting that the target to families and kids — comments on many of the YouTube videos are turned off — while many fans can’t wait to post their reactions on eared materials after they see the film on the day/date big and little screen.”

Disney

Yes yes similar to Black Widow even with this result for Space Jam 2 money was left on the table box office-wise. This weekend the Scarlett Johansson standalone MCU origin title dropped -67% with $26.25M which reps the steepest second weekend drop for a Disney MCU movie after Ant-Man and the Wasp‘s -62%. So if you’re wondering how Disney+ Premier impacts a Marvel title’s box office here’s further proof. Note among all Marvel movies 2003’s The Hulk which Kevin Feige executive produced for Universal reps the steepest second weekend domestic drop at -70% for the comic book label’s movies. The 10-day box office for Black Widow stands at $132M.

Note you cannot comp Black Widow’s second weekend drop here to F9‘s -67% because the latter’s second Sunday fell on July 4th which is always a down day for moviegoing. Monday July 5th for F9 which was also a recognized holiday stateside saw that pic’s business pop +15% over Sunday. F9 was released with a theatrical window.

Disney did not report any second weekend updates about Black Widow‘s results on Disney+ Premier. How’s that for transparency?

Warner Bros. has eased the town and exhibition’s fears that they’re only practicing this theatrical-HBO Max-day and date strategy for this year because of the pandemic; that their 2022 and beyond slate will be purely theatrical next year. And at the end of the day it’s this pandemic (and the continued news of Delta variants and re-masking of L.A. doesn’t help) which continues to give studios like Disney the license to burn down the film distribution model to keep warm. They can trumpet how they made money between a pic’s opening weekend box office and the Disney+ premier PVOD cash. But in addition to shrinking the pie I hope that Disney CEO Bob Chapek and Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution Chairman Kareem Daniel also realize that they’re losing more than just long-term box office dollars and solid ancillary windows on these-day-and-date releases: Piracy is stealing more money from them faster than they realize as many sources in the know tell me. And that diminishing of dollars at the box office and windows will hit every downstream business units at Disney quite hard. Wall Street needs to stop sniffing the streaming glue wake up and realize this recipe for financial disaster.

Wake up Disney: piracy sites are offering ‘Black Widow’ for free. Disney

Fact: Black Widow was the most-pirated movie last week on Torrent Freak ahead of The Tomorrow War in the No. 2 spot. Many of these piracy sites dress themselves up with images from the film to make it look like they’re legit. The studios go to great lengths while editing their films to encrypt movies and watermark them so they can trace where a pirated copy comes from (whether or not it leaks from inside the studio).

All of those safeguards are blown away in this day-and-date theatrical-streaming era. One industry analytics source informed me that in one study they did for a studio it showed that these piracy sites were the No. 1 platform for those at home to watch movies not Disney+ or any other streaming platform. By Disney executing this Disney+ Premier strategy from day one (and Warner’s with their 2021 slate) they’re essentially making pristine free copies available.

By the way I need to correct myself: Disney doesn’t get 100% of their Disney+ Premier revenue many sources have informed me in the wake of last weekend’s report. On a PVOD release they have to share ~15% of the revenues with platform providers such as Amazon Firestick AppleTV+ etc.

So that $60M global PVOD huzzah last weekend is really around an estimated net $51M back to Disney. While it’s better than the 60%/40% rental terms with exhibition once again Disney is decimating an ancillary window faster and bound to walk away with less money in the end than they typically would on a regular theatrical release.

The Napster millennials have grown up Disney and they’re familiar with getting their goods for free. Is this really a road you want to continue on with future theatrical films? Less box office glow and more piracy results in eroding your brands in the future. Giving into to consumers’ flexible-viewing habits is truly financial foolishness.

*****

Sony is reporting $8.8M for their PG-13 horror sequel Escape Room: Tournament of Champions which is a pure theatrical release at 2815 theaters. We’re still waiting on Sony to truly spend on marketing to open their movies this one iSpot noticed a $4.5M TV spend which produced 415.5M impressions. The first Escape Room opened to $18.2M. Let’s hope we see big results from the Culver City studio when they open Venom: Let There Be Carnage on Sept. 24 and MCU’s Spider-Man: No Way Home on Dec. 17 which rumor has it that Disney+’s Wandavision and possibly Loki tie into.

iSpot shows that Sony bought ads on ESPN Telemundo FX and Adult Swim for the Adam Robitel-directed sequel as well as on shows such as NBA basketball SportsCenter Family Guy Mom and Martin.

Escape Room 2 per RelishMix had a social media universe of 39.8M across Facebook Twitter Instagram and YouTube which is well under horror awareness levels per the analytics corp.

“Conversation ran mixed-positive among horror fans who mulled storyline thoughts about the subway with many who love it and ‘puzzle masters’ who are dissecting the trailer” said RelishMix about the low wattage pre-buzz from the pic.

One highlight of the sequel’s marketing push: the studio reconstructed the pic’s subway escape room in Hollywood:

Focus Features’ Morgan Neville’s documentary Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain rang up $1.9M in 8th place at 925 theaters from 189 DMAs repping the top opening for a specialty movie and top opening for a docu this year. The pic out-grossed the weekend debuts of Roadside Attractions’ The Courier (opened at $1.885M) and Zola (opened at $1.2mil) and grossed more than three times what Questlove’s Summer of Soul made in its opening weekend of $650k. Roadrunner is also the top opening of Oscar winner Neville’s career.

NEON’s Nicolas Cage thriller Pig slotted 10th with $945K at 552 locations for a $17K theater average. The pic’s top ten theaters I’m told out of its top 20 came from arthouses which is a promising sign that the sector is on the rebound after weathering the pandemic. Top cities were NY LA Chicago San Francisco and Portland.

Saturday AM Update: Warner Bros.’ long awaited sequel to the 25-year old family classic Space Jam —Space Jam: A New Legacy—had a four point shot at the box office yesterday with $13.1M at 3965 theaters for what will be a $32M opening weekend.

Disney

The results squash the second Friday and anticipated weekend of Disney/Marvel’s Black Widow which did $8M yesterday one of the worst Friday-to-Friday drops for a recent standalone origin MCU title at -80% on its way to a $25.6M second weekend a -68% drop no thanks to the film’s availability in homes on Disney+ Premier for $29.99. If you think it’s unfair to comp Black Widow to pre-pandemic MCU origin films well then know that her drop is even steeper than the second Fridays of F9 (-72%) and A Quiet Place Part II (-68%). By the end of the weekend Black Widow will count $131.3M at the domestic B.O.

The total weekend B.O. looks to come in around $93M off 22% from last weekend’s pandemic weekend high of $118.46M. While a notable take for the pandemic we’re still behind 65% when compared to weekend 29 of 2019 (which overall grossed $263.8M; that’s when Disney reboot of The Lion King opened). With Canada’s Ontario reopening 70% of its theaters (with capacity restrictions) yesterday the number of 588K domestic cinemas in operation currently resides at 83%.

Space Jam: A New Legacy‘s opening reps the biggest for Warner Bros. during the pandemic besting Godzilla vs. Kong‘s 3-day of $28.2M and the best opening for a family movie. The pic is also available day-and-date in homes on HBO Max. It also reps the biggest opening for director Malcolm D. Lee outstripping the $31M debut of Girls Trip and also the filmmaker’s third film to open at No. 1. The sequel’s opening easily beats the $27.5M opening of Space Jam not accounting for inflation which ended its domestic run at $90.4M.

Space Jam: A New Legacy received an A- CinemaScore the same grade as the first 1996 movie and saw a bulk of walk-up business last night especially from teens indicative of moviegoing for the first Lego movie which played beyond its family demo. Huge turnout by African Americans at 36% Latino 23% Caucasian 32% and Asian/other 9% in Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak exits. Space Jam: A New Legacy overperformed in the East and South but the West was the most dominant territory. Premium Large Format screens drove 4% of the business I understand.

Space Jam: A New Legacy star and producer LeBron James tweeted out the news about the pic’s super weekend:

On CinemaScore exits those under 18 gave Space Jam: A New Legacy a solid A while those under 35 gave it an A- along with the under-25 demo. Males (53%) and females (47%) gave the Lee-directed sequel an A-. PostTrak exits were less brighter than CinemaScore showing 78% in the top two boxes and 58% recommend though kids under 12 gave it a 84% positive with a 70% recommend. PostTrak make-up showed 58% guys 60% under 25 with 48% under 17. Critics aren’t so hot on Space Jam: A New Legacy at 31% Rotten but that’s not impacting the box office.

Zoey Davis (Taylor Russell)and Ben Miller (Logan Miller) in Columbia Pictures’ Escape Room 2. Sony

Sony’s Escape Room: Tournament of Champions did $3.8M yesterday including $1.2M Thursday previews for a 3-day of $8.66M which is what Sony was expecting on this $15M horror movie. Escape Room 2 received a B CinemaScore just like its first installment. PostTrack audience exits were at a low 69% with a 44% recommend. The film had a similar diversity make-up as Space Jam 2 29% African American 27% Latino 32% Caucasian and 12% Asian/other.

Remember it’s a PG-13 film and teens were also heading out to see Space Jam 2 which makes one wonder if this particular Sony sequel was losing business to the animated-live-action hybrid title. An even split between males and females with 53% under 25 62% between 18-34. Best business was on the coasts and in the south for this Adam Robitel-directed movie. Critics were so-so on the first movie back in 2019 at 51% Rotten and their opinions in the horror pic haven’t improved at 42% Rotten.

Anthony Bourdain Focus Features

In a sign that that the arthouse biz is coming back slowly: Focus Features’ documentary about Anthony Bourdain Roadrunner from director Morgan Neville did $760K yesterday (estimated $250K from Thursday previews) on its way to a $1.66M debut in 8th place at 927 theaters for a $1791 per theater average in 189 markets.

Pic is 95% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 21-day window. Great PostTrak exits here at 94% positive and a 61% recommend. Pic played best on the coasts with four of its top ten runs coming out of NYC. Females shows up at 52% with 91% over 25 and 53% between 25-44. Diversity breakdown was 66% Caucasian 19% Latino 3% African American and 12% Asian/other.

Neon

NEON’s truffle hunter-bent-on-revenge feature Pig starring Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff posted an estimated $372K yesterday on its way to a $1M 3-day in the top 10 from 550 theaters for a $1818 per theater average. Pic is on a traditional 42-day window and I hear it posted good results in NY LA Chicago San Francisco and Portland Oregon.

They have been around for centuries and will probably be here for a long time. Here we take a look at the top 10 largest banks in the world. The ranking is based on data from S&P Global Intelligence which publishes a report on global banking and financial services every year ranking the world’s 100 largest banks based on total assets.

Ranked: Top 10 largest banks

American banks dominated the ranking for decades. But the emergence of China as a global economic powerhouse has helped many Chinese banks earn a place among the largest in the world. Out of the top 10 largest banks four are from China two from the US and two from France.

The S&P Global Market Intelligence’s ranking is based on total reported assets. It’s not adjusted for different accounting practices. The US banks use US GAAP method while banks in most other countries use the IFRS. If American banks reported under the IFRS method JPMorgan Chase would be the fourth biggest bank instead of sixth.

10- Credit Agricole

The second largest banking behemoth in France has total assets of $2117 billion. It has been ranked as one of the world’s most sustainable companies. Founded in 1894 Credit Agricole has a history of providing banking and other financial services to farmers. It also happens to be the world’s largest cooperative financial institution.

9- Bank of America

Personal finance guru Ramit Sethi has been a vocal critic of the Bank of America calling it “one of the worst banks on the planet.” But it is one of the world’s largest banks with total assets of $2281 billion. With a market value of $325 billion it’s the world’s third largest bank by market capitalization. The company strengthened its investment banking arm by acquiring Merrill Lynch in 2008.

8- BNP Paribas

The largest bank in France was created in 2000 following the merger of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Paribas. It has $2357 billion of assets under management. BNP Paris has more than 40 million customers in 75 countries across the globe.

Yet team officials hope—no expect—to set an MLS attendance record for its opening match next March.

“Our expectation is crystal-clear” Charlotte FC President Nick Kelly tells me by phone in May. “We want to be 74000-plus. We can do that at Bank of America Stadium. We think if we can create a first game with 74000-plus Charlotte and Carolina soccer fans that’ll set the precedent of what to expect for the remainder of the year.”

Bank of America seats 75000 for Carolina Panthers games. While it’ll typically be configured to seat 38000 in the lower bowl for soccer and the team expects most games to draw about 30000 fans Charlotte FC aims to fill the upper deck for “first kick” in 2022. So much for tempering expectations in financially tenuous times. “Given the capacity of Bank of America Stadium the demand we’ve seen since our club’s announcement and the chance to be a part of the first MLS match ever for Charlotte FC leads us to believe this is an attainable target” Kelly says. “A lofty one but attainable.”

The FC draws much of its confidence from the success of its future rival to the southwest Atlanta United which owns the attendance record Charlotte FC is trying to break: 73019 for a 2018 playoff game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The United has maintained one of MLS’ most ardent fan bases since its debut season in 2017. The United made the playoffs that year and won the MLS Cup in 2018 and the team is considered the gold standard for MLS expansion success. Charlotte shares not just a rivalry but a similar Southern sensibility a booming young professional class and a growing international influence. “If we’re not looking at them” Kelly says “we’re not setting the right standard.”

But Charlotte FC entered the league under circumstances Atlanta United didn’t face. Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper paid a record expansion fee of $325 million to secure the 30th MLS franchise announced in December 2019. A few months later came the COVID lockdown a burden for all pro sports franchises but especially onerous for one just getting started. “We got stuck with one of the hardest challenges probably in professional sports” Kelly says.

Of course COVID and economic hardship landed heavily on Charlotte FC’s potential fans too—which caused concern and anger when they heard how much it might cost to attend the games.

***

The club hired Kelly nationally known for his sports marketing work for Anheuser-Busch in December 2020. Two months later Charlotte FC announced it would require season ticket holders to buy personal seat licenses or PSLs in addition to some of the highest season ticket prices in MLS. The PSL a one-time fee that ranges from $350-$900 is a first for an MLS franchise. With the PSL factored in the per-game cost of an average season ticket is $54—highest in MLS.

The prices stunned even some enthusiastic Charlotte soccer fans especially considering the team’s own estimation of its fan base compared to the Panthers’: five times more likely to be between 18 and 34 years old and four times as likely to be Hispanic. The city’s Latino community comprises a large number of low- and working-class residents.

“The one thing that we basically made very clear to (disgruntled fans) was that we respect your opinion on the PSL” Kelly says. “We hear you but we’d still love to have you to a match. If the season ticket model is not for you we’re going to have affordable ways for every fan in the Carolinas to get in the building.” After a news conference in late May Kelly stressed that when single-game tickets go on sale—price range to be determined as they hadn’t gone on sale as of this writing—that “we’ll be sure we price at a level that allows fans to attend a match in our inaugural season.”

Other fans say they understand the need for the team to balance affordability and profitability. “I get it from a business perspective why they would do PSLs because they’ve got a product that people want to watch and buy into” says David Gusler president of Mint City Collective a 2000-member Charlotte FC supporters’ group. “If you have the ability to do that and get funding to invest back into the stadium I get it. But then from a fan perspective it’s not the most fan-friendly option when you already have a stadium built. It just doesn’t seem to rub some soccer fans very well.”

Gusler bought season tickets in the standing-room supporters’ section which doesn’t require a PSL and averages $27 per game. So did Kristin Bobenage a Panthers season ticket holder. “I feel like the (season) ticket prices are not overly expensive” Bobenage says. “If you’re committed to going to every single match then it might be but I feel like hopefully there are opportunities for it to be inexpensive just to fill some of the seats.”

Despite the pricing objections Kelly says a “very very low number” of people asked for refunds of their season-ticket deposits and many of those canceled because of relocation or COVID-related financial issues. Of the 10000 deposits the team secured after the December 2019 announcement Kelly says in May more than half have converted to season tickets and the club had “thousands” yet to contact. “We’re far exceeding where we thought we would be three months into ticket sales” he says.

Far enough to draw a record crowd for the first game and 30000 per match after that? Club officials are still working on that part. The team planned to build on initial demand over the summer with a marketing blitz it calls the For the Crown Tour with initial stops at the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Memorial Day weekend and the Carolina Country Music Festival in Myrtle Beach South Carolina in mid-June. “The purpose of the tour is to reach an audience that might not yet be engaged with our club” Kelly says.

In the fall the team plans to take advantage of $50 million in soccer-specific renovations at the stadium which Panthers fans will see all season not to mention Clemson and Georgia fans who’ll converge there for a college football game Sept. 4. “It’ll be hard to miss” Kelly says.

And as the FC builds its roster players will join the campaign. “Oh we’re going to wear out our players this fall” he says. “They’ll be at every tailgate out there.”

***

Fans thrilled with the announcement at the end of 2019 were surprised 10 months later when the team and city announced a change in location for the team headquarters. When Tepper initially stood before a crowd and bank of cameras at the Mint Museum Uptown he and team officials expected to house the headquarters at the long-vacant Eastland Mall site the hub of Charlotte’s east side and the heart of the city’s largest Latino community.

In October though the team revealed that it would locate its headquarters at the stadium and reserve part of the old mall site only for its elite Academy youth program which practices at Manchester Meadows in Rock Hill but expects to move to Eastland in July 2022. The main factor was the city’s hesitation to spend an estimated $110 million in public money to prepare the Eastland site and surrounding area for the headquarters; the revised plan requires only a $35 million public investment $25 million of that amount for the city’s share of stadium improvements and construction around it. Kelly who says Charlotte FC will be headquartered at the stadium “for the foreseeable future” adds that the centralized location makes sense given the Panthers’ planned relocation of its headquarters to Rock Hill South Carolina in summer 2023.

“We’re going to take a lot of the practice fields the Atrium Dome (indoor practice facility) even the weight room and convert it over to be soccer-specific” he says. “Literally overnight we would be able to turn this into one of the best soccer facilities in the world … even when you start looking over in Europe. Our practice facility would be in uptown. Our headquarters would be in uptown. We’re not in a suburb coming in town for a soccer match. For a lot of these international players to have the ability to live play work all within an uptown South End type of lifestyle is an extremely attractive option when we’re recruiting talent to come here.”

The switch turned out to be less of a concern for many in Charlotte’s Latino community than ticket prices. “There were mixed feelings about (the headquarters) anyway” says José Hernández-Paris the executive director of the Latin American Coalition. The LAC is Charlotte’s most prominent Latino advocacy organization and Hernández-Paris’ office is 1000 feet from the Eastland site. “I’ve been to training sites in other countries and I’ve seen the training. … It’s a large field with a fence. I’m not sure what impact that would have on the community surrounding it.”

On the whole he says the Latino community eagerly awaits the first season.

“I didn’t really expect the community to be as excited as I’ve seen it—to be able to support a local team” Hernández-Paris says. “Many people in the community have made Charlotte home and it’s very traditional in most of Latin America that each city has their own team that symbolizes a pride or a connection to the city. I think people are finding that it’s an opportunity to connect to Charlotte and to have the pride of being a Charlottean particularly in a sport like soccer which is so ingrained in our culture.”

Even with the team’s uptown location and the extensive renovations to accommodate soccer—including a new synthetic-turf field to replace the natural surface the stadium has sported since its opening in 1996—some city officials expect Tepper and his organization Tepper Sports and Entertainment to eventually come back to the city for more public investment.

“We had intentions of having a big discussion on everything all at once: Eastland soccer headquarters football and an entertainment district around the stadium” says Tariq Bokhari a Republican who chairs the City Council’s workforce and business development committee. “COVID happened other things happened and we had a smaller initial discussion. We know that there are other discussions that likely have to still be had.”

Still Bokhari as the representative for District 6 in south Charlotte and a soccer dad to three young children says he sees MLS as a great opportunity for the city. For him the vision crystallized when he toured Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta with his fellow council members in 2018.

“What we learned primarily on that Atlanta trip—and why they had such drastic success so quickly—was the deep connection and leveraging of the fan base” Bokhari says. “Getting that excitement roaring hot and allowing that to fuel them going on this dominant journey where they control the airwaves they control the ratings and they won the championship. … I walked away from that knowing that the key to success or failure lies within the fan base.”

In the wake of George Floyd's murder corporate America pledged to do better saying it would diversify its leadership encourage equity and take concrete actions to root out systemic racism.

But a USA TODAY analysis of previously undisclosed hiring records from dozens of top firms found that more than a year later executive roles remain overwhelmingly white and male. Black and Hispanic workers particularly women tend to be concentrated in the lowest ranks and some of the nation's most powerful brands still refuse to disclose data on the gender ethnic and racial makeup of their workforce.

The eight-part series combed the records of the Standard & Poor’s 100 some of the most highly valued companies in the stock market.

Building pipelines for diversity success Anthony D. Wilbon dean of the Howard School of Business and Charlotte Newman senior manager at Amazon talk growth strategies for diversity and equity Jarrad Henderson USA TODAY

They revealed that while Black and Hispanic employees are often overrepresented as compared to U.S. census data on the nation's workforce among the technicians administrative assistants and laborers who form the backbone of many organizations they are less likely to be found at the company's senior levels or in other professional positions.

The lack of diversity in corporate roles that pay the highest salaries offer the best benefits and provide a path to promotions influence and leadership hardens the racial and gender wealth gap that's resulted in the typical white family having eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic household.

Companies are more transparent but not all

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies have become more transparent in the 14 months since Floyd's killing when protests condemning systemic bias and calling for social justice swept the nation.

Among the S&P 100 a record 54 companies including Merck Ford Motor Co Bank of America and Target gave USA TODAY their EEO-1 forms documents detailing the gender race and ethnic breakdown of their workforces that businesses are required to provide each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Another 23 corporations including Home Depot Walmart and Boeing said they would publicly disclose that information this year or in 2022.

Altria Abbott Laboratories AT&T General Dynamics and UnitedHealth Group were among the companies that provided their EEO-1 reports after publication deadline.

But some of the nation’s most well-known brands such as Exxon T-Mobile and FedEx rejected USA TODAY’s requests and gave no future date when they might provide such information to the public. Amazon which last released its EEO-1 report in 2016 also would not provide the most recent demographic data of its workforce but said it would release its 2020 data in the coming months.

Federal officials will not release these demographic records to the public without companies’ permission citing privacy protections in the Civil Rights Act. A civil suit filed by Reveal a nonprofit investigative journalism outlet challenges the legality of hiding these records from the public.

Boards are largely white and male

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies often point to the diversity of their boards of directors to distract from the concentration of white men in their corporate suites. But board membership at the 54 companies examined by USA TODAY also did not reflect the racial makeup of their business's workforces let alone the nation's overall population.

While white men make up about a third of U.S. workers they held half or more of board seats at 33 of the 54 companies.

Amgen a biopharmaceutical company had the highest percentage of white men on its board – eight people or 73% – even though only 30% of the company's workers are white males. White women held two of the remaining three board seats which is almost half of their rate in the company's workforce.

Compared to their company workforces white non-Hispanic men were only underrepresented on 12 company boards almost always by just a handful of percentage points. Among the remaining corporations reviewed the share of white male board directors often was two or three times higher than their business' workforce.

The companies also appointed white women to their boards at higher rates than people of color.

White non-Hispanic women held a disproportionately large share of board memberships at about two-thirds of companies.

White women had no seats on the board of Coca-Cola despite holding 23% of all jobs. At Starbucks they held just 9% of seats while accounting for 38% of the company's workers.

About a third of companies had boards where the percentage of men of color matched or exceeded their representation in the business's workforce. Six companies did not have any men of color on their boards.

Another 19 companies did not have any directors who were women of color. They were equitably represented or overrepresented on the boards of just 10 companies. But those figures are based on counting all non-white women together obscuring the lack of Black and Hispanic women board members in particular.

“We have to move from tokenism to transformation'' says Darren Walker who is head of the philanthropic Ford Foundation and a diversity advocate. ""Having one Black on the board or the chief diversity officer three levels down from the CEO will not result in a successful strategy. There has to be genuine authenticity.”

At about half of the companies reviewed the board membership had more representation for people of color than among the business's executives although men of color were much more likely to hold those seats than women.

For instance 44% of board seats at Gilead Sciences Inc. a pharmaceutical company are filled by four men of color but no women of color. Two white men and three white women hold the rest. Yet men of color account for 20% of the company's executives and 26% of its workforce.

Women of color account for a larger share of McDonald's workforce than any of the 54 companies reviewed: 44%. None sit on the company's 13-member board.

Again these tallies lump together ethnic and racial groups that face different challenges with workplace discrimination and gaining the kind of career recognition that leads to invites for board seats. Closing the gaps will take targeted strategies experts say.

Diversity strengthens the bottom line

A diverse board appeared to help some S&P 500 companies weather the economic downturn sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic better than businesses whose boardrooms were less inclusive according to a new report.

S&P 500 businesses whose boards were more than 30% people of color experienced a 4% bump in revenue as compared to the previous year while their peers whose boards were less than 20% people of color saw their revenue dip 2.8% according to BoardReady a nonprofit focused on making boards more inclusive.

Race inequity in corporate US

And companies where women made up more than 30% of the directors outperformed those whose boards had fewer women in 11 of the top 15 S&P 500 sectors last year.

“It’s striking that so many aspects of diversity correlated with better performance” the report’s lead researcher Rajalakshmi Subramanian said in a statement announcing the findings. “No matter whether you’re looking at racial diversity gender diversity or diversity in age companies with a broader range of perspectives at the board table did better.”

The gains that have been made in some board rooms have been hard-won and companies can easily backtrack if advocates aren't vigilant says Ursula Burns the former CEO of Xerox and the first Black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company. She's been leading the charge to diversify the boards of major corporations.

“The board level in many publicly traded companies is better than the C-suite data and it’s better than the employment levels” Burns told USA TODAY in an interview. “Basically if you beat the (crap) out of them about something – I’m sorry to say it this way – they will pay a little bit of attention to it with the hope that we will forget about it after a while and they then can take their foot off the pedal.”

Mondelēz International which produces snacks like Oreos and Ritz crackers has no women of color and only one man of color on its 12-person board. Nearly 40% of the company's workers are people of color.

In an emailed statement the company said that last year it signed on to the Board Diversity Action Alliance which aims to make boards more inclusive.

""We value diversity within our board of director members as we do throughout our organization'' the company said. ""We know we can and will continue to improve in this space.""

USA TODAY's series puts a spotlight on several industries including:

Tech

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

While white employees across all U.S. industries are three times as likely as their Black or Hispanic peers to get top jobs the gap is even starker among the nation's largest tech firms.

White employees at Facebook Google Amazon Apple and Microsoft are five times as likely to be executives as their Hispanic colleagues and seven times as likely as their Black co-workers USA TODAY found.

And while women are underrepresented among managers and executives throughout corporate America – a pattern that continues in the tech world – the disparity among Black tech employees is particularly striking. In that sector Black men are twice as likely as Black women to have leadership roles.

Black and Hispanic workers have a disproportionate share of lower-level jobs in big tech. At tech companies analyzed by USA TODAY nearly half of white employees had professional positions as compared to 1 in 5 Hispanic workers and 1 in 9 Black workers. The professional gap between white and Black employees in tech was three times greater than what is seen in the overall labor force.

Banking

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Leadership of the nation's major banks has traditionally been – and continues to be – predominantly white.

White people fill 73% to 87% of all executive positions at US Bancorp Bank of America Bank of New York Mellon Citigroup Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.

Wells Fargo says that it will release its EEO-1s for 2019 and 2020 later this summer roughly a year after its CEO Charles Scharf a white man drew criticism for saying the San Francisco-based company missed its diversity benchmarks because there was a limited pool of Black executives to draw from.

Food Retail

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

At some of the nation's largest or best-known food companies and chains the diversity in top jobs is vastly out of sync with the broader population.

White workers are 64% of the nation's workforce while Hispanic workers are 16.8% and Black workers are 11.2% according to U.S. Census data.

But 87% of executive positions at Costco are occupied by white people. Meanwhile 77% of executives at Pepsi and 74% at Coca-Cola are white according to records obtained by USA TODAY. McDonald's was the most reflective of the U.S.'s racial demographics with white people filling two-thirds of executive roles. Although the company's leadership was the closest to matching the overall American workforce McDonald's still had disproportionately high rates of Black and Hispanic people particularly women in lower-paying and lower-ranking jobs.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong.

The ‘Club of the Century’ are aiming to write history and become the first ever side to win the continental crown for a 10th time.

Al Ahly won the competition last season after beating Egyptian rivals Zamalek 2-1 in the final and could win consecutive finals for a third time after 2005/06 and 2012/13.

They enter the game against Chiefs on the back of an 11-game unbeaten run. The Red Devils ended up victorious in nine out of their 13 finals overall so far.

Mosimane’s men have just lost one of their last 20 matches in the CAF Champions League (W13 D6) a 1-0 defeat against Simba during the group stages – it was also the only game they failed to score in this run.

Al Ahly have scored the most goals (18) and had the most shots in the competition this season with a shot conversion rate of 14.3%.

Mosimane himself has won his two CAFCL finals he’s taken part in so far lifting the trophy with Mamelodi Sundowns in 2016 and with Al Ahly last season.

Here is how they line-up:

JOHANNESBURG – Kaizer Chiefs’ coach Stuart Baxter believes that being reduced down to 10-man after Happy Mashiane got his marching orders on the stroke of half-time resulted in his team’s Caf Champions League final defeat to record holders Al Ahly.

Out a deserted Stade Mohammed V Stadium on Saturday night Chiefs were targeting their first ever African crown in more-than-half-a-century. But they came unstuck as Al Ahly swept three goals past them to bag their record 10th continental crown.

Al Ahly’s goals from Mohamed Sherif Mohamed Afsha and Amr El Sofia all came in the second half having Chiefs held their nerves in the first. But they had ended the half in calamity as they were a man down after Mashiane hit an early shower.

In stoppage time the Chiefs’ winger was late for an interception. And as a result he recklessly and dangerously caught the ankle of Akram Tawfik. The referee initially cautioned with a yellow card but after a VAR review Mashiane was shown red.

And it’s there and then that Baxter reckons his charges lost the game. Chiefs were caught napping defensively as Al Ahly scored three winning goals with ease tarnishing Chiefs’ ‘solid defence’ having kept 11 clean sheets in 14 matches.

“Finals are defined by certain incidents. And I think this one was affected massively by the red card” Baxter said. “It changed the whole complexion of the tie. If we had a man on the field it could have been interesting to see what we could do in the second half.”

Baxter added: “We needed to keep the ball longer. But the first pass out the press was too bad. Our press became short. We didn’t get the ball into the front three the way we wanted to. But we did strangely enough when Khama (Billiat) came on.”

Baxter is not throwing Mashiane under the bus though. In fact far from it. He says the match of this magnitude might have demanded more from the 23-year-old winger and while he was second-best in crucial duels he grew in frustration on the night.

“We went into the game with (Njabulo) Blom ‘Mshini’ (Nkosingiphile Ngcobo) and Happy and this was potentially a bridge too far for them. But they were in a good mental balance. But I think you are right; the frustration grew with Happy” Baxter explained.

“We got him in the game in situations where you think he’s good in. And he let the ball get away from him and that frustrated him. Then he got smacked a couple of times and that frustrated him. The fact that he was chasing late in the half that frustrated him.”

Baxter added: “All that boiled over with him and he gave an unnecessary freekick. But he’s a young lad and the frustration boiled over. I think you are right that he wanted to give back what he was getting. He’s disappointed I am sure but he’ll learn from it.”

Warren Buffett once doubled his money with a clever bet on Arcata a timber company.

The investor pocketed $22 million after the US government settled a dispute over a redwood forest.

The pandemic has had a dramatic impact on lumber prices dragging futures below $300 per thousand board feet in April 2020 then lifting them as high as $1700 this May. Warren Buffett could well be having flashbacks to the time he doubled his money on a deal involving a redwood forest.

The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO described his Arcata bet as one of his ""more serendipitous arbitrage experiences"" in his 1988 letter to Berkshire shareholders.

Arcata a printing and forest-products company was sparring in court with the US government over its purchase of 10700 acres of Arcata timber in 1979 to expand Redwood National Park in California. Arcata argued the government's payment of $98 million for the trees was nowhere near enough and took issue with the interest rate it had proposed.

Meanwhile KKR had submitted a takeover bid of $37 per Arcata share and two-thirds of any further payments by the government and Arcata had accepted. Buffett and his team determined that the private-equity group was likely to close the deal based on its track record Arcata would probably find another buyer even if the deal fell through and there was potential for a major windfall once the redwood dispute was resolved.

""Your chairman who can't tell an elm from an oak had no trouble with that one: He coolly evaluated the claim at somewhere between zero and a whole lot"" Buffett quipped in his letter.

Berkshire promptly bought 400000 Arcata shares or 5% of the company in the fall of 1981. When the deal's closing date was pushed back but a definitive agreement was signed in early 1982 Buffett's company raised its stake to 655000 shares or 7% at an average cost of $38 a share — a premium to KKR's offer.

""Our willingness to pay up — even though the closing had been postponed — reflected our leaning toward 'a whole lot' rather than 'zero' for the redwoods"" Buffett wrote.

The transaction ran into further delays and KKR ultimately trimmed its offer to $35. Arcata's bosses rejected that bid in March 1982 accepting another offer of $37.50 per share plus 50% of any redwood money instead. The group's shareholders approved the deal and Berkshire received $24.6 million representing a solid 15% annualized return on its $22.9 million investment.

The redwood question was finally answered after a judge directed two commissions to assess the timber's value and an appropriate interest rate upheld their conclusions in 1987 and ruled that the government owed $600 million to Arcata. The parties settled on a $519 million payment in 1988. Berkshire received an extra $19.3 million as a result and Buffett wrote that another $800000 payment was slated for 1989.

Assuming the money came through Berkshire's total payout was $45 million netting him a $22 million profit on its investment. It may have taken the better part of a decade but Buffett must have been pleased to see his bet pay off in the shape of a 95% return.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vc3BzLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy1wcmVjaXNpb24tY2FzdHBhcnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SPS Technologies Owned By Berkshire Violating Stay At Home Orders?,"Many states have enacted stay-at-home orders to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and those orders require nonessential businesses to shut down. SPS Technologies which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway continues to operate in Pennsylvania although there are allegations that it isn’t an essential business. What makes matters worse is that there are reports that some employees at the factory are suspected to have COVID-19.

SPS Technologies: essential or nonessential?

A source at the factory in Jenkintown Penn. told ValueWalk that the plant makes screws. Under the Pennsylvania Essential Business Order makers of nuts screws and bolts are classified as nonessential businesses and ordered to close. However the company doesn’t classify itself as a maker of screws.

In a letter given to employees the company states that it is essential because the products it produces supply engine turbine and power transmission.

When ValueWalk contacted SPS Technologies a spokesperson told us they are classified under aerospace product and part manufacturing. Such businesses are considered nonessential unless they provide defense industrial products and transportation manufacturing.

The company did have a contract with Boeing which would mean that it could be involved in defense products and transportation manufacturing. However they also allege that the contract with Boeing which involved 777X and 787s has been suspended. When asked for further information about the Boeing contract and its classification as an essential business no response was given. Boeing and SPS remain in a lengthy legal dispute over the contract.

Management allegedly had told employees that they were looking for a way to stay open no matter what the governor said about nonessential businesses closing. They did receive a waiver from the state allowing them to stay open but the nature of that waiver and the business conducted at the factory remains unclear.

SPS Technologies history

SPS was incorporated in 1903 and started its Jenkintown plant in 1920. The company was purchased by Precision Castparts Corp in 2003 for $729 million. Precision Castparts was later purchased by Berkshire Hathaway for over $32 billion making it Buffett’s largest ever acquisition.

Allegations about working condition safety

Sources at SPS Technologies in Jenkintown also told ValueWalk that the company has not been taking adequate steps to ensure the safety of its workers during the coronavirus pandemic. Further sources say employees overheard managers speaking in hushed whispers that two employees were suspected of having the coronavirus and one was in the ICU.

When asked about the issue management denied that anyone at the factory had the virus. They also posted two pages of statistics showing how likely people are to die in various ways.

Sources tell ValueWalk that nothing at the factory has been cleaned and they ran out of hand soap and hand sanitizer. Hand sanitzer has finally been added as of yesterday per sources. They also say that after the first two employees were believed to be infected with the coronavirus four more were thought to be infected.

Someone reported SPS Technologies to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for the issues reported to ValueWalk. In response a spokesperson provided this statement to ValueWalk:

“We take the health and safety of our employees very seriously and we dispute the alleged matters in the OSHA letter. We will be responding to OSHA in due course.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vcmFpbGZhbi5jb20vbWVyZ2VyLW1hbmlhLXByZWRpY3RpbmctdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merger Mania: Predicting the Future,"Looking back at the proposed 1983 merger between Southern Pacific and Santa Fe executives had no idea that the Interstate Commerce Commission (predecessor to the U.S. Surface Transportation Board) would respond with a big fat “no” to their application.

If you think of Warren Buffett what are the first few things that come to mind? Self-made billionaire? A man of few words but those he does say are hung on to and dissected by millions? Someone who wears expensive suits that somehow still look cheap? A grandfather-type personality who still lives in the same house he bought in 1958 for $31500?

Yes to all of these.

The ""Oracle of Omaha"" has built his personal brand as being someone who is down-to-earth approachable conservative dependable stable and even risk-averse. He's the ""everyday American"" who made some smart investment decisions early on in his career: that ""anyone can do."" It's the perfect brand positioning for someone who has made a large chunk of his fortune convincing everyday people to back his investments.

Now let's pivot to Richard Branson and talk about his personal brand. Never one to follow the herd his most famous quote is ""Screw it let's do it."" His brand Virgin Airways uses one of the most emotionally charged terms in the English language paired with aviation to boot. He owns his own island has explored space and has even circled the world in a hot air balloon. Always tanned always sporting a wild crop of hair – Richard's personal brand and the brands of all the businesses he's founded are centered around taking a traditional model of doing anything throwing it out the window and replacing it with something more efficient and outrageously fun.

These two men illustrate the genius strategy of building a corporate brand from the founder's personality. Unfortunately most companies from Fortune 100s to start-up skip this vital step and then wonder why no one remembers their brand.

At its essence a great brand is a personality for a business. When this strategy isn't a fit the important thing is to build a brand that's personality infused. It was Aristotle who said we are what we repeatedly do — which by extension means that every action we take every interaction we have every piece of marketing we approve says something about us our personal brand and the brand of the businesses we run.

That old website you have that doesn't show up properly on mobile? That says that your brand is outdated. It doesn't matter how modern your marketing says you are or if it looks homemade and is clunky to navigate and slow to load (well that doesn't say anything good either.)

The physical location of your office — in a gorgeous high-rise building in the most sought-after part of the city or located in an aging secluded business center — speaks volumes about who your clients are and who you want them to be. From the car we drive to the way our assistant answers the phone they all speak loudly about who we are.

Brand building is about strategically deciding what you and your company want to be known for and then relentlessly executing on that decision to build consistency and trust. When inconsistency happens your business is damaged too. Just look at Elon Musk for example.

So what are some of the best ways to build your personal brand as CEO?

As always start with strategy by taking a 30000 ft view. What is it you want to be known for? It's a simple question with a million different possibilities.

Next ask: What do I want my business(es) to be known for? Who are we serving? Just as importantly who are we not serving?

Where these two answers intersect is where your personal brand-building journey begins.

Whether you're the CEO of a Fortune 100 or a fledgling start-up building your personal brand is just like your university education — an investment in yourself that you take with you wherever you go. If you are an entrepreneur your personal brand is the brand that anchors the brands of your other businesses. If you're a CEO your personal brand is the one the media look to your employees know you for and the Board of Directors knows they can rely upon.

The worst thing you can do is pretend you have no personal brand. We all have one. Now the question is: Are you going to let your personal brand just happen by default?

The untested and costly geothermal technology was at best experimental with the first unit expected to supply power for perhaps 10000 homes. Today Olkaria generates more than 50 times that and the technology is on track to become the backbone of the country’s electricity grid. “Our strategy going forward is geothermal” says Rebecca Miano  chief executive officer of the state-owned Kenya Electricity Generating Co. or KenGen.

For decades Kenya and surrounding countries focused on hydroelectric power and oil-fueled thermal stations but lately they’ve awakened to the potential of their vast underground energy resources. The region sits astride the Great Rift Valley an area where tectonic plates meet bringing the magma at the Earth’s core closer to the surface. It’s one of the world’s most active volcanic zones—Mount Kilimanjaro lies at its heart—with dozens of hot springs hinting at the intense heat lying just below. Kenya gets nearly half of its electricity from geothermal plants more than any other country according to researcher Fitch Solutions and it’s on track to increase that to almost three-fifths by 2030."

Don’t be silly. You should be asking “How many people in the country have an opportunity to watch high-quality college football in one of the nation’s best stadiums and student sections?'”

There are pockets of the incoming freshman class that have gone to dozens of Penn State football games and there are plenty that haven’t been to one. Regardless of which group you fall into getting season tickets can make a huge positive impact on your first semester of college. Esteemed college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit called Penn State’s student section “unparalleled” and it’d be a shame to miss out on it.

Ticket sales will launch on the following schedule:

Graduate students: Monday June 20 @ 7 a.m.

Seniors: Tuesday June 21 @ 7 a.m.

Juniors: Wednesday June 22 @ 7 a.m.

Sophomores: Thursday June 23 @ 7 a.m.

Freshmen: Friday June 24 @ 7 a.m.

Each sale begins at 7 a.m. and ends either at 2 p.m. or when the allotted number of tickets for the class of the day sells out. Sales will definitely end in the latter scenario as tickets will surely sell out in a few minutes.

You have to have a Ticketmaster account set up before buying tickets. Set it up here beforehand and have a valid U.S. credit card handy.

To buy tickets log on to Ticketmaster and follow the instructions given by Penn State athletics here.

It’s worth checking out your semester standing here. A friend of a friend of mine missed out on buying tickets a few years ago because he was entering his second year at Penn State but had enough credits to be classified as a junior. He logged on to Ticketmaster on the sophomore class’ day to buy tickets only to find out he was ineligible and was supposed to buy tickets the day before.

Now that we have all the technical info out of the way here are a few tips from OS alum Drew Balis (circa 2012):

Give yourself some extra time to prepare in case of computer problems.

Have a friend or parent on speed dial. If something goes wrong they can back you up and complete the process for you with your information.

Log on to Ticketmaster by 6:45 a.m. This is when the waiting room for the queue opens up and you’ll want to secure your spot as soon as possible. The longer you wait to do this the more people ahead of you in line to buy tickets.

As stated above there are time limits on certain pages. It helps to create a Ticketmaster account in advance and enter all of the billing information. This will save some time and limit stress.

Along with football tickets there is the opportunity to purchase the official White Out shirt ($26) and a student Nittany Lion Club Membership ($35). My advice: Don’t buy them here. This is not a knock on the offerings but there are plenty of other opportunities and events to purchase these things. Get your tickets and get out.

($26) and a student ($35). My advice: Don’t buy them here. This is not a knock on the offerings but there are plenty of other opportunities and events to purchase these things. Get your tickets and get out. As ridiculous as those browser requirements sound follow them. Just do it and you’ll thank yourself later when you hear of all your friends who missed out on their tickets by using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.

At one point during the sale ( after you press the blue “unlock” button on the right side of the screen ) you will be asked to enter a password. Remember that it is your nine-digit PSU ID number at the bottom of your ID. This has tripped some people up in the past. Don’t let it happen to you.

) you will be asked to enter a password. Remember that it is your nine-digit PSU ID number at the bottom of your ID. This has tripped some people up in the past. Don’t let it happen to you. At one point during the sale there will likely be a drop-down menu for Ticket Quantity and Seat Location. Click 1 and General Admission respectively.

Speaking of General Admission your confirmation page will likely say GA on it. Don’t be that guy frantically trying to figure out where Section GA is in Beaver Stadium.

You should have already received an email to your Webmail account saying what class you are with your corresponding day. Semester classification is determined by the number of credits earned. Be mindful and double check this. That biology class you late dropped last semester could change the day you buy tickets.

Your first attempt may result in some type of error occurring. Try not to panic. It’s likely Ticketmaster just being Ticketmaster. Go through the process again.

So to review:

Set up your Ticketmaster account before the day you’re scheduled to buy tickets. Log on to Ticketmaster by 6:45 a.m on your designated day (freshmen buy tickets on Friday). Keep refreshing the page and click “join waiting room” so you can secure your spot in the queue to shop for tickets. Starting exactly at 7 a.m. wait until it’s your turn in the queue and buy your tickets as fast as your internet connection lets you. On Saturday September 10 head over to Beaver Stadium bust out your mobile ticket and enjoy being a part of the best student section in college football.

Products don't always go through modifications because there's a defect; sometimes manufacturers revamp successful products because they see an opportunity for improvement. That was probably the idea behind Corsair's reworking of its thriving Vengeance RGB Pro memory which already holds a spot on our Best RAM list. For those that aren't fans of the brand the Vengeance RGB Pro SL will look like a brand piece of memory but Corsair aficionados on the other hand will likely spot the differences right off the bat.

Image 1 of 3 Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL DDR4-3600 C18 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL DDR4-3600 C18 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL DDR4-3600 C18 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Vengeance RGB Pro SL retains a similar design as the normal Vengeance RGB Pro. The memory modules still feature a black PCB with a matching black anodized aluminum heat spreader. The small aesthetic changes include the small triangle cutouts and a different selection of logos.

The biggest difference between the SL and non-SL versions is the height. The original Vengeance RGB Pro memory modules are 51mm (2 inches) tall while the SL variant checks in at 44.8mm (1.76 inches) tall. Corsair basically reduced the height by 12.2% which should be sufficient to make the Vengeance RGB Pro SL fit under the most CPU air coolers and compact cases.

Despite the height reduction the RGB diffuser remains intact on the Vengeance RGB Pro SL. There are 10 individually addressable onboard RGB LEDs inside the diffuser to provide bright and vibrant lighting. You'll have to use Corsair's iCUE software to take full advantage of the Vengeance RGB Pro SL's illumination which means installing another piece of software on your system.

The Vengeance RGB Pro SL consists of an eight-layer custom PCB with Samsung K4A8G085WB-BCPB (B-die) integrated circuits (ICs). The memory kit is comprised of a pair of 8GB memory modules with a single-rank design.

Out of the box the memory operates at DDR4-2666 with dull primary timings fixed at 18-18-18-43. The Vengeance RGB Pro SL has a single XMP profile for DDR4-3600 so you can't really go wrong. It configures the timings to 18-22-22-42 and the DRAM voltage up to 1.35V. For more on timings and frequency considerations see our PC Memory 101 feature as well as our How to Shop for RAM story.

The Vengeance RGB Pro SL placed at the bottom of the charts on our Intel platform. The memory's strongest showing came in the 7-Zip compression workload where it ranked second and outperformed the slowest memory kit by up to 7.3%. As for gaming performance the Vengeance RGB Pro SL's standing didn't change.

Despite employing Samsung B-die ICs the Vengeance RGB Pro SL doesn't have any fuel left in the tank. Increasing the DRAM voltage to 1.45V only got us to DDR4-3866 and we also had to sacrifice timings to get there. The memory wasn't stable with any value below 19-22-22-40.

The Vengeance RGB Pro SL's default XMP timings are 18-22-22-42 at 1.35V. A small voltage bump up to 1.45V allowed the memory to run at 16-20-20-40 making it a lot more attractive.

Bottom Line

Corsair markets the RAM as having a compact form factor. It's shorter than the previous revision but it's not exactly considered low-profile either. Even at 44.8mm the memory shouldn't cause any conflicts with CPU air coolers but it wouldn't hurt to measure the clearance space before picking up the Vengeance RGB Pro SL if you have an overly large cooler.

You shouldn't have any qualms with the Vengeance RGB Pro SL's design as the memory looks good just like its predecessors. Performance however is another case. Evidently the Vengeance RGB Pro SL performs better on AMD systems than Intel systems so that's one point to take into account. The Vengeance RGB Pro SL DDR4-3600 C18 retails for $109.99 and it's not a bad price considering there are equal or slower competitors out there that cost more than Corsair's kit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2lmaXhpdC1jZW8tbmFtZXMtYW5kLXNoYW1lcy10ZWNoLWdpYW50cy1mb3ItcmlnaHQtdG8tcmVwYWlyLW9ic3RydWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iFixit CEO names and shames tech giants for right to repair obstruction,"Image: Getty Images

iFixit co-founder and CEO Kyle Wiens has exposed how companies including Apple Samsung and Microsoft manipulate the design of their products and the supply chain to prevent consumers and third-party repairers from accessing necessary tools and parts to repair products such as smartphones and laptops.

Speaking during the Productivity Commission's virtual right to repair public hearing on Monday Weins took the opportunity to draw on specific examples of how some of the largest tech companies are obstructing consumers from a right to repair.

""We've seen manufacturers restrict our ability to buy parts. There's a German battery manufacturer named Varta that sells batteries to a wide variety of companies. Samsung happens to use these batteries in their Galaxy earbuds … but when we go to Varta and say can we buy that part as a repair part they'll say 'No our contract with Samsung will not allow us to sell that'. We're seeing that increasingly"" he said.

""Apple is notorious for doing this with the chips in their computers. There's a particular charging chip on the MacBook Pro … there is a standard version of the part and then there's the Apple version of the part that sits very slightly tweaked but it's tweaked enough that it's only required to work in this computer and that company again is under contractual requirement with Apple.""

He continued highlighting that a California-based recycler was contracted by Apple to recycle spare parts that were still in new condition.

""California Apple stops providing service after seven years so this was at seven years and Apple have warehouses full of spare parts and rather than selling that out in the marketplace -- so someone like me who eagerly would've bought them -- they were paying the recycler to destroy them"" Wiens said.

Weins also pointed to an example involving a Microsoft Surface laptop.

""[iFixit] rated it on our repairability score we normally rate products from one to 10; the Surface laptop got a zero. It had a glued-in battery … we had to actually cut our way into the product and destroyed it in the process of trying to get inside"" he said.

When asked whether 3D printing spare parts could be a potential way around repairing products Wiens acknowledged that while it could be a solution it would not be a practical one for tech-based products.

""3D printing is a wonderful idea … we do have some 3D printed models on iFixit … unfortunately in our analysis of parts about 2% of all parts can be 3D printed with current technology … where 3D printing is more compelling and interesting is in whitegoods"" he said.

The other major point that was covered during the Productivity Commission's public hearing was whether there is plausibility to introduce a labelling scheme much like one that exists in France in Australia.

Introduced at the start of the year the French repair index was designed to encourage manufacturers to display clear information about the repairability of their product. It currently applies to five product categories: Smartphones laptops televisions washing machines and lawn mowers.

Based on his observation Weins said the adoption of the French index has been ""pretty universal"" across all five categories. He also pointed out that a recent Samsung survey showed 86% of French citizens say that the index impacts their purchasing behaviour while 80% said they would give up their favourite brand for a more repairable product.

""This is really substantially driving consumer behaviour"" he said.

For consumer group Choice the possibility of introducing a labelling scheme to improve right to repair in Australia could work.

""We know from experience particularly with the water and energy labelling scheme that if you want manufacturers to improve the quality of products start by rating and ranking them"" Choice campaign and communications director Erin Turner said during the hearing.

""Consumers would really benefit from a scheme that ranked and rated products in durability and repair. It'd be even better if that ranking was translated to a publicly available piece of information: A label that lets them see the information when comparing products.

""Over time we would expect manufacturers to compete where they saw that durability and repairability were factors that were influencing consumer product decisions.""

She suggested if such a labelling scheme were to exist one of the first product areas it could be applied to would be for right to repair of technical electronic products.

""Laptops and smartphones is where people have a lot of anxiety and there's a lot of international information and standardisation of products. An Apple is an Apple from Australia New Zealand America so you can build a bit more in. You can build a scheme for Australia but [base its] rules on international data"" Turner said.

Besides supporting the idea of a labelling scheme Turner also believes there is an opportunity to amend the current Consumer Law so that product warranties and guarantees are more clear.

""I do think that there's room to amend the law to make businesses more responsible for … the sin of omission happens so often it's sometimes not even a sin of omission sometimes we hear from consumers that it's just an outright lie … we see where businesses consistently just deny that people have rights under the Consumer Law they do it consistently they do it in writing … and sometimes the products that are failing again and again … particularly tech we see it a lot with laptops"" she said.

Check Out These 3 Alzheimer's Therapy Stocks,"Treating Alzheimer's is extremely difficult but these innovative companies are taking a stab at it.

Neurodegenerative disorders extract a terrible human toll. In particular dementia affects more than 44 million people globally with Azheimer's being the most common cause accounting for 60% to 80% of all cases of dementia. Moreover dementia is the fifth most common cause of death worldwide. Thankfully there are a handful of companies working on treatments for Alzheimer's.

With the recent commercialization of Biogen's drug Aduhelm investors everywhere can take heart that the disease might finally be treatable. So the floodgates for Alzheimer's drug development are open and there's money to be made by investing in the most promising candidates. While there's no guarantee that any of the companies I discuss below will actually succeed in making an effective Alzheimer's therapy of their own they'll all have an edge over Biogen's Aduhelm if they do.

1. Annovis Bio

Annovis Bio (ANVS 25.10%) is a small biotech that's working on ANVS401 a drug which it hopes will be able to treat Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in people with Down syndrome. ANVS401 is currently in phase 2a of clinical trials and on June 1 the company reported that the drug appeared to help patients with Alzheimer's score significantly higher on a standardized test that measures the speed and accuracy of their cognition. Impressively the drug also helped patients with Parkinson's as well. That's a bombshell of a finding to say the least and Annovis' stock shot toward the moon as a result.

The secret to ANVS401's efficacy is its triple-pronged approach. Rather than attacking only one of the proteins associated with Alzheimer's as Biogen's Aduhelm does the drug targets three: beta amyloid tau and alpha synuclein. So there's a chance that it could blow Aduhelm out of the water if it ends up getting approved.

Investors will need to act quickly if they want to purchase the stock before what could be another major catalyst. Annovis will report the full results of the ANVS401 trial in August. Before that it'll present a lengthy update at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference which starts on July 26. If the previously disclosed results hold up it's hard to see the stock going anywhere but skyward.

2. Eli Lilly

The pharma giant Eli Lilly (LLY -0.45%) has a slew of different Alzheimer's therapies in development including a pair of candidates in phase 3 of clinical testing: Donanemab and Solanezumab. Both drugs target the beta-amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's but Solanezumab aims to remove circulating beta-amyloid whereas Donanemab is focused on dissolving immobile beta-amyloid plaques.

Eli Lilly's advantage is that it has developed several different diagnostic tools that it can use to identify characteristics of Alzheimer's patients which these drugs are the most likely to help. After using these tools to screen for patients in the second phase of its clinical trial of Donanemab it reported positive results.

In short patients treated with Donanemab experienced a slower progression of their disease as measured by a handful of different cognitive-functioning tests than patients treated with placebo. But cognitive functioning still declined over time so the therapy isn't a panacea. Still if these findings hold up Eli Lilly will probably be the next Alzheimer's drug developer to make it to the market after Biogen and based on the data as it stands right now its candidate is superior. But as Eli Lilly is a massive pharma stock with a plethora of other drugs on the market it remains to be seen whether the potential new revenue could make a major impact on its top line.

The company expects to report efficacy data sometime in the first half of 2023 so keep an eye out.

3. Prothena

Prothena's (PRTA -4.47%) selection of Alzheimer's projects is significantly earlier-stage than Eli Lilly's or Annovis Bio's. It has two programs in the tail end of preclinical testing and two others in the discovery phase. One of the candidates being investigated in the discovery phase is a vaccine aimed at recruiting the immune system to fight against two different proteins associated with Alzheimer's which could be extremely lucrative if it can be used preventatively.

The company's crown jewel PRX005 which Prothena is developing in conjunction with Bristol-Myers Squibb just started its phase 1 clinical trials on June 24. The drug targets the tau protein associated with Alzheimer's and studies in model animals have been quite positive. Bristol Myers Squibb will pay Prothena $80 million in exchange for the license to PRX005 should it be commercialized with the option to pay more to advance development after each phase of trials.

Given how early-stage Prothena's projects are the biggest thing for investors to watch for is safety reporting. Serious side effects could nip its promising therapies in the bud and the risk of investing right now is very high. Nonetheless if the company can show that its candidates are safe that will be a major boon to shareholders. And it'll pave the way for further investigations that would have a shot at demonstrating the drug's efficacy which is where the biggest returns lie.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVwaGFybWFsZXR0ZXIuY29tL2xpc3RpbmcvZm9jdXMtb24vbm92by1ub3JkaXNrLWNvbXBhbmllcy1tZXJnZXJzLWFuZC1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbnMtbmV1bGFzdGE_dGFnaWRbXT01MDkzJnRhZ2lkW109OCZ0YWdpZFtdPTI2MTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Focus On - Novo Nordisk Companies mergers and acquisitions Neulasta,Licensing agreements featured heavily in last week’s news starting with US biotech Biogen entering into an agreement that could cost it $1 billion to get rights to a BTK inhibitor – orelabrutinib for multiple sclerosis – from China’s InnoCare Pharma.

Their mission? To make sustainable clothing more accessible for all. Focusing on conscious consumerism over the high-street notion that more is always better the store comes fully outfitted with an exclusive range of environmentally friendly and ethically-made products.

South Dublin’s first sustainable clothing boutique their opening comes at a time when customers have been making a real effort to shop local and support Irish retailers… and with renewed interest in all things pertaining to the environment they couldn’t have timed their arrival better.

A complete labour of love by owner Evelyn Browne she poured hours of hard work into ensuring the final product was all she dreamed it would be and safe to say it paid off. Stocking a wide range of both clothing and lifestyle goods all of the brands were carefully selected by Browne herself who chose them based on their sustainable practices and the fact that they are “paving a new way within the style industry”. As she puts it “Some are better at production and some better at materials and energy management but they are all constantly striving to do things differently and better.”

Speaking as to the inspiration behind Slow Street Browne commented that the shop is all about “making it easier for people to own positive-impact clothing which is environmentally friendly and ethically made”.

“We also want to help change the style mindset. I believe that with quality comes longevity enabling people to enjoy their clothing as valued possessions instead of disposable trends.”

Acknowledging that navigating the sustainable fashion scene can be daunting at times she’s tried to make the transition away from fast fashion as seamless as possible for customers. “With lots of greenwashing and empty environmental and ethics claims by big fashion brands navigating sustainable fashion can be time-consuming and overwhelming. We have done all the hard work looking at fabrics used labour practices production processes and overall carbon footprint of each of the brands we select for our customers” she added.

Telling people “this is good” isn’t necessarily always enough though and Evelyn can often be found over on social media explaining the rationale behind why it’s good. Posting tidbits of information on everything from organic cotton to the downfalls of using synthetic fabrics it’s clear that the new business owner is a wealth of knowledge on the topic – and only too keen to share.

As we’ve noted previously the Federal Reserve’s “M2” monetary aggregate began growing significantly faster than the “GDP” measure of economic output in the United States beginning around 2008 amidst the 2007-2009 financial and economic crisis.

With the federal government’s massive fiscal and economic “stimulus” policies arriving together with a pandemic and government lockdowns M2 growth has recently risen dramatically higher than GDP growth.

Earlier this week the Bureau of Labor Statistics (within the U.S. Department of Labor) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose in June at one of its fastest growing rates in more than a decade. Some people have been pointing to the fact that year-over-year changes in the CPI may be high recently in part because the comparisons to last year’s levels were amidst the onset of the pandemic. But in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 and on a seasonally adjusted basis the CPI rose at an annualized rate of more than 8 percent which is the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 1981.

It’s always worthwhile to keep an eye on alternative inflation measures given the estimation issues associated with government statistics and considering the source of those statistics.

Along those lines a recent survey of small businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) returned a result for prices that hasn’t been reached since 1981.

And the prices component of the monthly Institute for Supply Management survey of business purchasing managers rose in June 2021 to its highest reading since July 1979.

Inflation can be considered as a tax and an especially regressive one falling harder on those with lower income and/or assets. Inflation can be considered one cost of government.

But it’s interesting to consider (and we will in coming months) how well the government a) measures inflation overall and b) covers the cost of government as an element of the overall cost of living.

Government sales taxes end up getting covered by the CPI for example as that statistic (uncertain and/or flawed in other respects) measures prices including sales taxes at the retail level. But significant issues arise for other taxes (like property taxes) that matter for the cost of government as well as taxes that are not explicitly covered by the CPI (or related measures like the PCE deflator).

Back in the Great Depression economists and government developed our modern framework for Gross Domestic Product (GDP the total value of goods and services produced in a given period). There were four main components (C+I+G+NX) – Consumer Spending Investment Spending Government Spending and Net Exports.

Some have questioned whether the G (Government Spending) belongs there at all from an opportunity cost perspective as government spending relies on taxes or borrowing money that could have been spent by somebody else.

But let’s put that interesting debate aside and consider whether what is good for the goose is good for the gander. If GDP should include government spending our government should do a better job of including the cost of government in its measures of the cost of living.

The first of its kind initial public offering of food delivery services company Zomato has given anxious movement not only to investors but also the company itself. On Day 1 Zomato borrowed a famous film dialogue to tweet “ mereko to aisa dhak dhak horela hai “. Body temperature and blood oxygen monitor GOQii SmartVital responded: ""Don't worry @zomatoin if heart ki dhak dhak is under 85 bpm then all is well! KeepAWatch.."" Investment app Groww quipped: “this time you can order Zomato from Groww”. With the issue oversubscribed on Day 1 Zomato's rival Swiggy signed off tweeting “Invest in something sweet to mark the special occasion? Gulab jamun ladoo barfi... delivered safely to your doorstep.” Given the tremendous retail response to the loss-making unicorn’s IPO one hopes investors do get to eat these goodies than humble pie.

There is room for failure

For Sudheesh K a home-stay owner in Kodaikkanal the world belongs not only to winners but also the failed ones. This is why he came out with an offer for students who failed the SSLC examination — free stay along with their family members at his facility. The offer is valid till the end of this month. Soon after his post went viral on Facebook Sudheesh started getting calls on how aspirants can win accommodation including on how many subjects one would ‘need’ to trip. Some 2230 students did not qualify for higher education from Tamil Nadu this year. But Sudheesh who has been in the business in Kodaikanal for 15 years offers some consolation. He is ready to accommodate even if all of them troop in together.

Vijayan-Gadkari avenue

The bonding between Kerala Chief Minister and unsparing Marxist Pinarayi Vijayan and Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways and Sangh Parivar loyalist Nitin Gadkari has for long amused political watchers. Recently on a visit to Delhi the Union Minister found ample time (even beyond the scheduled) to indulge his friend from Down South by signalling all others to leave the venue save John Brittas Rajya Sabha MP who is also known to be Vijayan’s Man Friday. Pleasantries apart Vijayan carried the day by winning approval for major road projects. Where there is a friend there is a National Highway or so it seems!

Headline management

The Union Cabinet at its first meeting after reshuffle cleared the much-awaited LIC IPO. But unlike the tradition of announcing Cabinet decisions at a media briefing this was not made public though three Cabinet Ministers did address a press conference. And a day or so later the news came out. Though senior Finance Ministry officials confirmed the approval they remained silent on the “no announcement”. The silence continued post the next Cabinet and CCEA briefing on July 14 too. Sources said the government did not want attention diverted from the other decisions taken on July 8 — modifications to the financing facility under ‘Agriculture Infrastructure Fund’ and Covid-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package: Phase II. The first was to convey a strong message about APMC to the protesting farmers and second intended to present the pandemic management effort. Both got time and space in the media. Of course the LIC IPO too made headlines.

Handle with care

Reports of Textiles Minister Piyush Goyal’s instructions to Ministry officials to move to eliminate child labour in the sector won praise from human rights activist Kailash Satyarthi who called it a “remarkable step”. While it is encouraging to get appreciation from a social reformer the government needs to deal with NGOs carefully. One shouldn’t forget that developed markets like the US are extremely sensitive to the use of child labour and restrict imports partly based on reports from NGOs. No doubt the government must ensure that child labour is wiped out through continuous vigil and action. But the achievements should be highlighted to send the right message to trading partners.

Now based in Shanghai Peter Hwang will oversee the management and development of DragonCor an entity created to manage mainland logistics assets owned by Blackstone funds the Manhattan-based firm said in a release. The collection includes the Greater Bay Area’s largest urban logistics park in which Blackstone acquired a majority stake earlier this year.

“We are thrilled to welcome Peter a recognised leader to spearhead the continued growth of DragonCor” said Justin Wai a Hong Kong-based managing director with Blackstone Real Estate. “Peter brings years of experience leading a regional team and orchestrating major transactions and we’re confident he’ll play an important role in building our rapidly growing China logistics platform.”

The upgrade for Blackstone’s China logistics operation comes just four months after the fund manager took in $2.9 billion from the sale of an Australian logistics portfolio as the company continues to look for ways to adapt and deploy its existing investment playbooks in new environments.

Engineering a Win

Hwang’s most recent title was managing director for Asia at records management company Iron Mountain where he led various mergers and acquisitions. During his time in the role Asia revenue grew significantly making Iron Mountain the region’s leading document and data management company Blackstone said.

With Asia logistics developers ESR and Logos having each announced data centre initiatives in recent months Hwang’s Iron Mountain experience also includes overseeing a co-location server facility in Singapore as well as joint ventures in Mumbai Pune and India’s national capital region.

Before his nearly eight-year career at Iron Mountain Hwang served as general manager for business development at pharmaceutical distributor Zuellig Group in Hong Kong. Prior to that he was chief of staff and vice president of corporate development at HKEX-listed China NT Pharma Group.

His earlier experience includes advisory work for McKinsey & Co and engineering projects for the International Space Station at Boeing.

Hwang received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from UCLA and later earned an MBA from Stanford.

“I look forward to working with the DragonCor team and further expanding Blackstone’s logistics footprint which is already among the biggest in China” Hwang said. “This is an especially exciting time for the sector in China which is seeing robust demand for warehouses driven by e-commerce trends.”

Assembly Required

Cliff Chen a Shanghai-based managing director at Blackstone Real Estate said the firm has built the DragonCor portfolio over the last three years into a collection of carefully selected high-quality logistics assets strategically located in China’s major hubs with a diversified tenant base across fast-growing sectors such as technology and third-party logistics.

Blackstone bulked up its mainland logistics holdings this year with the purchase of a 70 percent stake in Guangzhou International Airport R&F Integrated Logistics Park from Guangzhou R&F Properties for $1.1 billion an acquisition that increased the firm’s China logistics portfolio by a third. The deal was announced last November and completed in January.

Assembling countrywide mega-portfolios of logistics assets is becoming old hat for the firm run by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman. Blackstone in May completed its long-anticipated acquisition of Embassy Industrial Parks gaining a portfolio with 10.6 million square feet of logistics and warehouse assets near major cities in India.

In April Blackstone agreed to sell its Milestone Logistics portfolio in Australia to ESR Milestone Partnership a collaborative venture of Hong Kong-listed ESR and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC for $2.9 billion after a protracted bidding contest against four other contenders.

In 2017 Blackstone scored Europe’s single largest real estate deal ever when it sold the Logicor platform to China Investment Corporation for $13.82 billion. That deal which involved 630 distribution centres in 17 European countries came after Blackstone had completed more than 50 transactions to acquire and tune the Logicor platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2FybXktdmV0ZXJhbi1mb3JtZXItb3duZXItcmVsaWFibGUtZ29sZC1sdGQuLWxlb25hcmQtYS4tcm90ZW5iZXJnLWRpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Army Veteran & Former Owner Reliable Gold Ltd.

July 17 (UPI) -- Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft was secured atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Saturday in preparation for this month's second uncrewed flight test. The Starliner capsule was towed from Boeing's Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at to ULA's Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station for hoisting atop the Atlas V NASA said in a blog.

The commercial spacecraft will launch its second orbital flight test without a crew on July 30. During the mission it will autonomously dock with the International Space Station to deliver approximately 440 pounds of cargo and crew supplies for NASA.

It will be the last test flight before NASA and Boeing begin exploring opportunities for Starliner's first crewed mission which is tentatively scheduled for sometime toward the end of this year.

The Space Station serves as a microgravity research laboratory orbiting 250 miles above Earth.

The ULA tweeted a photo of the spacecraft being mounted stop the Atlas V rocket.

The upcoming flight test will demonstrate the end-to-end capabilities of the Starliner spacecraft and Atlas V rocket from launch to docking to a return to Earth in the desert of the Western United States and provide valuable data toward certifying it for crewed flights NASA said in statement.

Pre-launch activities launch and docking will air on the agency's website.

On its first unmanned flight test atop an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral in December 2019 the capsule hit a snag failing to reach the ISS as planned. It burned fuel too quickly because of an error in the automated system that maintained mission timing according to NASA. The trip to the ISS was aborted and the spacecraft was able to land safely in a New Mexico desert.

""Today a lot of things went right and this is fact why we test"" Jim Bridenstine the NASA administrator at the time told Space.com regarding the first Orbital Flight Test.

Editor's note: This article has been corrected. The current ground control station for the MQ-25 was developed by the Navy.

Three years ago Boeing (BA 0.50%) landed an $805 million development contract to build MQ-25A ""Stingray"" drones for the U.S. Navy with the promise of billions more as the Navy built out a fleet of 76 of the remotely piloted carrier-capable aerial refueling aircraft.

Over the last three years Boeing has developed and tested the new drone tanker conducted ""extensive simulations of aerial refueling"" and run a total of 25 actual test flights. Last month all that hard work paid off with the successful completion of the first-ever successful in-air refueling of a Navy fighter jet from an unmanned drone -- setting the stage for Boeing to collect the rest of its billions in revenue.

Fill 'er up Stingray

As UNSI News reports on June 4 2021 Boeing's ""T1"" prototype flew out of Illinois accompanied by a Navy F/A-18F fighter jet. Mid-air the fighter connected to the drone's fueling hose-and-drogue and received 325 pounds of aviation fuel.

That's not a lot -- only about 1% of the F-18's total fuel capacity. And with the MQ-25A expected to carry 15000 pounds of fuel it will take two of them to fill up an F-18 entirely. But it was enough to prove the concept and advance the T1 prototype to the next stage of testing.

What comes next

In this next stage the T1 will be shipped to Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia later this year to undergo ""deck handling trials"" aboard a U.S. Navy carrier. Meanwhile Boeing will get to work developing an even more advanced ""engineering and manufacturing development"" (EMD) prototype that will be specifically designed to conduct take-offs and landings at sea including ensuring that the aircraft is resistant to corrosion in a salt water environment.

The first such EMD prototype is expected to be flying by 2022 and if all goes well low-rate initial production of the drone could begin as soon as 2023 with full-rate production scheduled to start in 2026.

The Navy has simultaneously contracted Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.48%) to build a new ground control station for the MQ-25. In the future the Navy wants ""common control standards and systems"" that are interoperable and capable of controlling more than just one kind of drone unmanned carrier aviation program manager Capt. Chad Reed was quoted as saying.

What does it mean for Boeing?

That's good news for Lockheed Martin which lost out to Boeing in the competition to build the MQ-25 back in 2018 but will now at least get something out of the drone's development. It could be even better news for Boeing though.

If the Navy is looking ahead to a day when multiple models of autonomous drones will fly off of its carrier decks controlled by a common controller then that should give Boeing multiple opportunities to bid to build all of those new kinds of drones. Indeed the lead the company has taken in drone development by winning the MQ-25 contract should give Boeing a leg up on winning those contracts.

In the meantime according to the latest Weapons Systems Annual Assessment by the Government Accountability Office estimates for the MQ-25's total development cost have declined since the program began and now come in at about $2.3 billion. Acquisition costs for a full fleet of 76 MQ-25s exclusive of these development costs should total $8.8 billion resulting in a total program cost of about $11.1 billion -- and a unit cost of just $155 million per drone.

The fact that this purchase price is 12% below initial estimates suggests Boeing is now in possession of that rarest of franchises in the defense business -- a product that costs less than advertised. I have to imagine that bodes well for the prospects of the Navy ordering up more drone models in the future -- and for Boeing winning the contracts to build them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2Vjb2FzdGRhaWx5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3L3dhdGNoLWJvZWluZy1zdGFybGluZXItbGF1bmNoLXRvLXNwYWNlLXN0YXRpb24tbGl2ZS1vbi1zcGFjZS1jb2FzdC1kYWlseS10di1qdWx5LTMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Boeing Starliner Launch to Space Station Live on Space Coast Daily TV July 30,"Watch Boeing Starliner Launch to Space Station Live on Space Coast Daily TV July 30

(NASA) – NASA’s Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 mission to the International Space Station is scheduled to launch at 2:53 p.m. EDT Friday July 30 the second uncrewed flight for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program.

Starliner will launch on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

About 31 minutes after launch Starliner will reach its preliminary orbit. It is scheduled to dock to the space station at 3:06 p.m. Saturday July 31.

Prelaunch activities launch and docking will air live on Space Coast Daily TV the NASA app and the NASA website.

The spacecraft will carry more than 400 pounds of NASA cargo and crew supplies to the space station and return to Earth with more than 550 pounds of cargo including reusable Nitrogen Oxygen Recharge System (NORS) tanks that provide breathable air to station crew members.

OFT-2 will demonstrate the end-to-end capabilities of the Starliner spacecraft and Atlas V rocket from launch to docking to a return to Earth in the desert of the western United States.

The uncrewed mission will provide valuable data toward NASA certifying Boeing’s crew transportation system for regular flights with astronauts to and from the space station.

The deadline has passed for media accreditation for in-person coverage of this launch. More information about media accreditation is available by emailing: ksc-media-accreditat@mail.nasa.gov.

Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft is ready to launch again following a busy weekend where crews transported it from a the company’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at neighboring Kennedy Space Center to Cape Canaveral’s Launch Complex 41 Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) where the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket tasked with launching the capsule on its second Orbital Flight Test has been waiting.

“Seeing the Starliner atop the Atlas V just days away from launch is symbolic of how proud our team feels about executing this mission” said John Vollmer vice president and program manager Boeing Commercial Crew Program. “OFT-2 is a critical milestone on our path to crewed flights and we’re all ready to see our hard work come to life with a successful mission from beginning to end.”

Launch is currently targeted for 2:53 p.m. on Friday July 30 pending a Flight Readiness Review on July 22 by mission leadership at NASA Boeing and ULA and pending an upcoming integrated systems test which is a end-to-end electrical check of the 172-foot-tall Atlas V and Starliner stack. The mission will also mark ULA’s 145th flight aiming for liftoff at the precise moment the ISS’s orbital plane goes over Cape Canaveral.

Departing Boeing’s processing facility early on July 17 the spacecraft was transported via ULA’s motorized payload transporter adapted to carry Starliner moving at a blazing speed of 5 mph across 10 miles until arriving at the VIF. Crews with ULA then attached a four-point lifting sling called a Handling Fixture Hoist Tool and raised the spacecraft up the 30-story VIF with an overhead crane to carefully mate the capsule atop the Atlas V rocket.

The rocket itself designated AV-082 is uniquely configured to launch Starliner too as it is only the second flight of Atlas V’s N22 variant featuring two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) two RL10 engines on the Centaur upper stage and a Launch Vehicle Adapter that connects Starliner to Atlas. According to ULA the configuration is tailored for the necessary performance to deliver Starliner to the desired trajectory to each the ISS.

The mission comes following a questionable first Orbital Flight Test in 2019 where the spacecraft suffered a software timing anomaly shortly after launch which prevented it from ever reaching the ISS. And while they did save the spacecraft and were able to conduct various other test objectives and brought the spacecraft back to Earth safely the bottom line is they still have yet to prove it can safely rendezvous with the ISS which is the whole reason NASA awarded them a multi-billion dollar contract years ago along with SpaceX who has now been flying crews on their Dragon spacecraft for over a year (and with a smaller dollar amount contract).

Despite an incomplete OFT-1 mission Starliner successfully demonstrated its propulsion systems its communications systems its Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) its Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) and—through a series of in-flight extension/retraction tests—its NASA Docking System (NDS).

And although NASA noted that an actual ISS docking was not a mandatory requirement to “crew-certify” Starliner and pointed out that had a crew been aboard OFT-1 they could have taken manual control and likely overcome the automated timing problem it became increasingly likely as 2020 dawned that another uncrewed flight would need to take place.

A High Visibility Close Call (HVCC) Review led by NASA Associate Administrator for Human Exploration and Operations Kathy Lueders and Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich revealed a worrisome number of technical and organization root causes for the troubled mission. In March 2020 a joint NASA/Boeing Independent Review Team (IRT) found that three principal anomalies had plagued the flight. Two were classified as “software coding errors”.

You can read more in depth details on the issues HERE in our prior reporting along with the resolutions. Bottom line now is both Boeing and NASA are confident the issues are resolved and look ahead to the second OFT as soon as July 30 which is set to last approximately a week and will dock and undock autonomously at International Docking Adapter (IDA)-2 on the forward-facing port of the station’s Harmony node.

The spacecraft will also deliver approximately 760 pounds of payload including 440 pounds of NASA cargo and supplies for the current ISS crew members a commemorative U.S. flag that will remain aboard the ISS until it returns to Earth on Starliner’s first crewed mission the Crew Flight Test (CFT). That said OFT-2 will also deliver provisions for that mission like clothes and sleeping bags for CFT astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore Nicole Mann and Mike Fincke.

Boeing’s 320 pounds of cargo includes other special commemorative items for Starliner employees suppliers and partners who have worked to get the spacecraft flying safely. A card that Boeing’s founder Bill Boeing signed and used to travel the United States by air will also fly on OFT-2 along with Silver Snoopy pins which are presented by astronauts to people that directly contribute to the success of the U.S. human spaceflight program.

Rosie the Riveter commemorative coins will also be onboard created to celebrate last year’s passage of the Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act which honors 19 million American women who worked in the aerospace industry as men went off to fight in World War II.

And Boeing’s Rosie the Riveter ‘anthropometric test device’ will fly once again in the commander’s seat same as on OFT-1 except this time she will serve to help the spacecraft maintain its center of gravity throughout the various phases of the flight.

“She is a 180 pound test device in European tan that is meant to represent the 50th percentile of human dimensions in height and weight” said Melanie Weber the subsystem lead for Crew and Cargo Accommodations on the Commercial Crew Program. “Rosie’s first flight provided hundreds of data points about what astronauts will experience during flight but this time she’ll help maintain Starliner’s center of gravity during ascent docking undocking and landing.”

Both NASA and Boeing have also been busy with mission control teams in Florida and Texas conducting simulated mission dress rehearsals for OFT-2 and future crewed flights. Starliner’s landing and recovery teams are also doing on-site checkouts of one of the vehicle’s landing zones.

“I am extremely proud of the NASA and Boeing Starliner teams as they methodically work toward the OFT-2 mission” said Steve Stich NASA Commercial Crew Program manager.

Assuming that OFT-2 runs without significant wrinkles the way will be clear for the CFT with Commander Barry “Butch” Wilmore Pilot Nicole Mann and Joint Operations Commander (JOC) Mike Fincke before the end of the year.

Nowhere is that more apparent than in the airline's fleet strategy. Delta's just announced that it's adding 36 planes while also embarking on a year-long cabin retrofit program for some of its oldest international jets including the Airbus A330 and Boeing 767-300.

Earlier this week I had the opportunity to check out the first reconfigured Boeing 767-300 in Atlanta. While the entire plane is decked out with enhancements including mood lighting modernized seat covers and updated lavatories the real star of the show is the new premium economy cabin.

The 767-300 sports an 18-seat Premium Select cabin with recliners arranged in a three-row 2-2-2 configuration. This represents the fourth aircraft type to receive Delta's take on premium economy after the cabin first debuted on the flagship Airbus A350 in 2017 followed thereafter by the Airbus A330neo and Boeing 767-400.

In recent years Delta along with the other U.S. Big 3 competitors began realizing that a market exists for a product between a private lie-flat pod and a standard coach seat. That's exactly where premium economy fits — the cabin was designed to bridge the gap between business class and economy at an intermediate price.

On some planes the difference between the lie-flat business-class and premium economy cabins is stark. In Delta's case there's a night-and-day contrast between the Delta One Suites at the pointy end of the A350 or A330neo relative to the Premium Select recliners behind the biz cabin.

But on the newly retrofitted 767-300 that gap between biz and premium economy is much smaller: so much so that it might be worthwhile to save some money and stick with premium economy.

For one despite the reconfiguration project Delta isn't installing a new business-class seat in the biz cabin on the 767-300. That means you'll still find the woefully outdated first-generation Thompson Vantage seat when flying up front.

Sure the airline added all-new finishes with extra memory foam but the ""bones"" of the seat are ultimately the same. They're tight and offer limited privacy.

Additionally the seat-back entertainment screens are some of the smallest you'll find across premium cabins on U.S. carriers. At just 10.1 inches you might prefer to bring your own content on your higher quality iPad or laptop.

In premium economy you'll find a much more modernized recliner. Of course it's not a flat-bed pod so if you need to be horizontal to catch some z's then you're better off in biz.

For everyone else or if you're not planning to sleep the comfortable leg rest footrest and generous recline in Premium Select could be worth considering.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

While there's no privacy divider between seats this is Delta's most intimate premium economy cabin in the sky. With just 18 seats odds are that it'll be a quieter ride in this mid-cabin section than on other Delta widebodies. Plus if you're traveling with a companion you might find it more comfortable to be seated closer to each other.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Additionally the inflight entertainment system in the premium economy cabin is just as good if not better than the one up front. Like biz each premium economy seat has a 10-inch screen but these ones appeared to offer much better resolution than the old screens you'll find in Delta One.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Though inflight service remains modified due to the pandemic premium economy travelers can usually expect a watered-down version of business-class service. In Premium Select flyers are served elevated meals on real china a selection of wines beers and premium spirits and a Tumi-branded amenity kit.

It's not just the relative difference in products that might make it worthwhile to stick with a premium economy recliner on Delta's retrofitted Boeing 767-300. Consider the routes that the plane flies as well: many of them are within the U.S. including hops between Atlanta and both Los Angeles and San Francisco.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Internationally Delta flies the 767-300 on shorter flights like from Atlanta to Lima or New York to Madrid both routes between 3000 and 3500 miles or roughly six to seven hours. While it could make sense to splurge for biz on ultra-long-haul flights like Delta's longest route from Atlanta to Johannesburg the price difference might not be worth it for shorter hops.

Case in point: for a round-trip ticket from New York to Paris in early August Delta's charging a whopping $6600 for business class. Meanwhile premium economy is ""just"" $1500 a modest $500 upcharge compared to coach.

(For now the Premium Select cabin on the 767-300 is currently being marketed as extra-legroom Comfort+ so top-tier Medallion elites can select one of these seats free of charge. Delta will likely start charging for these seats once it consistently deploys the retrofitted plane on a specific route.)

If those flights were operated by a retrofitted 767-300 there's no chance I'd fork over an additional five grand for an outdated lie-flat bed. In that case — and in many others — Premium Select might be the way to go."

The NAR says it will take years of accelerated home construction — a full decade of building 2 million homes a year — to make up for that shortfall.

You don’t need an economics degree to understand why the median price of an existing home was up an astonishing 23.6 percent year over year in May: There are more people who want to buy properties than there are homes for sale — like millions more.

One big problem? At a time when we desperately need to build affordable homes it’s increasingly expensive or difficult to source basic construction materials and other housing supplies such as framing lumber plywood and appliances.

Wood costs skyrocket

In a May survey by the National Association of Home Builders single-family builders said their material costs had increased an average of 26.1 percent from a year earlier just to build the same house — the largest single-year jump in the survey’s history. Higher lumber prices alone added almost $36000 to the cost of building an average single-family home according to the NAHB.

After doubling last summer and then briefly falling the price of dimensional lumber — think common wood boards such as 2-by-4s — more than tripled from October 2020 to May 2021. Prices have eased a bit in recent weeks but remain high: Lumber futures contracts were trading at $797 per board foot at the end of June — 84.7 percent higher than a year earlier and roughly double the June 2019 price.

But it’s not just lumber. The cost of copper wiring for example has increased almost 40 percent from a year ago according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Producer Price Index for May. And to make matters worse it’s gotten harder to find: Seventy-seven percent of home builders the NAHB surveyed said they had encountered at least some shortage of copper wire.

The price of gypsum wallboard (drywall) meanwhile has risen more than 16.1 percent in a year and 70 percent of builders surveyed by the NAHB had some trouble sourcing it.

And more than half of builders (54 percent) had seen a serious shortage of oriented strand board or OSB — those structural panels of wood fragments and shavings glued together with resins to create a plywood-like material often used as sheathing for roofs and walls. As you can imagine it’s hard to build a house without you know walls.

“Oriented strand board has been extremely difficult to come by for builders in 2021” said David Logan NAHB’s director of tax and trade policy analysis. That’s partly due to the winter storms that took out much of the petrochemical industry in the South he said particularly in Texas. “They actually make the resins and adhesives that are used to stick OSB together.”

Since petroleum is also a key ingredient in PVC piping — the white plastic drains beneath your sinks — the supply of plumbing materials has been disrupted as well. “The construction industry supply chain has been sort of a terrible example of the butterfly effect in real life over the past year where a winter storm in Texas can affect the price of PVC pipe in New York” Logan said.

Tempering expectations

Builders have felt the impact of price hikes and product shortages and are doing their best to set expectations with clients and to mitigate delays that are largely out of their control.

“From building materials to the fixtures and finishes and appliances and mechanical equipment everything has really seen an impact one way or the other whether we’re paying premium costs for it or we’re dealing with delays or delivery dates that don’t really mean anything” said Nick Schiffer owner of NS Builders in Avon.

It’s taking weeks or even months longer than usual to secure even common building supplies. “Plumbing fixtures we’ve seen upwards of sixteen weeks; appliances we’ve seen as much as four or five months” Schiffer said. “We own a cabinet shop so for plywood we’re typically seeing a couple of days to maybe a little over a week just to get that stuff in stock.”

“Custom windows used to be four to six weeks — they’re flat out twelve weeks now” said David Cohen owner of Hampden Design in Newton. Kate Durrane principal of Columbia Contracting in Natick said one of her preferred window suppliers recently bumped its lead time to 18 weeks. And while Durrane said she hasn’t had trouble securing tile yet Cohen has seen lead times for some tile swell from two weeks to eight.

“A supply chain tends to be an all or nothing proposition” Logan said — if one part breaks the whole thing falls apart — and a confluence of factors is tugging at those chains from all sides. Shipping ports have been overwhelmed by an increase in import demand with container ships waiting days or even weeks to dock on the West Coast. A drop in the US dollar’s value has made Canadian lumber and other products — already subject to tariffs — even more expensive. And underpinning everything has been an insatiable demand for housing and remodeling.

“Businesses had to close including manufacturers at the onset [of the pandemic] and production was brought back online but wasn’t done so at a rate that reflected the increase in residential construction” Logan said. “That just put the whole industry behind the eight ball and ever since then we’ve been playing catch-up.”

So builders are following a new blueprint: Communicate the challenges get design decisions pinned down much sooner than usual and order products as early as possible.

“It’s about being flexible and really encouraging people to make their selections very early on in the process so that we can get those things in time” Durrane said. “I’m looking at a box of hinges in my office right now that I ordered three months ago just because I was afraid I wasn’t going to get them” she added. “As soon as I have the selection I’m ordering.”

In addition to project milestones like “finish rough electrical” and “install countertops” Cohen also includes client selection deadlines in his construction timelines — “choose countertops” or “select bath fixtures” for examples — and has now moved these dates ahead by several weeks in his schedules.

“It feels kind of artificially early — they’re demolishing and you’re picking out tile” Cohen said. But it’s become essential to make those decisions as early as possible even if it feels abstract. “You need an architect or an interior designer with the vision to understand that we’re picking things for a space that doesn’t exist right now.”

Dave Supple architect and owner of New England Design and Construction in Boston said his firm’s design-build approach has helped them limit delays because the people who specify a finish “are also the ones who are going to purchase it get it on site and install it.” But he hasn’t been immune to increased prices estimating that the cost of an addition has gone from roughly $350 to $400 per square foot to $450 to $500 a square foot. “We do adjust our costs yearly but this was definitely a larger increase” Supple said.

Appliances have the longest lead times

“Products are more expensive that’s undeniable” Durrane said. “Lumber itself has gone up windows have gone up hardware has gone up — everything.” In terms of delays Durrane said appliances have the longest lead times though it depends on the type and brand. “Refrigerators are really hard to get. Sub-Zeros I think they’re running six months maybe more” she said.

Steve Sheinkopf chief executive of Yale Appliance and Lighting in Boston suggests ordering appliances at least six months ahead of time. “Pre-pandemic you could choose from probably ten different manufacturers in whatever price range you wanted — it was that easy” he said. “Now it’s anything but.”

Part of that is because appliances are made in many locations from parts produced all over the world — a complex supply chain that Sheinkopf said helped hold prices down for most of his 30-plus years in the business. But the rolling global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic — in North America alone it first affected warehouses in New York and New Jersey then appliance factories in the South then parts manufacturers in Mexico — combined with shipping container backlogs and “exploding demand” from consumers has strained or broken many of those supply chains.

Quoting an industry adage Sheinkopf said “If it takes eighty-four parts to make a dishwasher and you only get eighty-one you’re not shipping the dishwasher.”

Major appliances aren’t just in short supply they’re more expensive too. “Since 2018 I would say the price of appliances is up probably fifteen percent if not more” Sheinkopf said. “Plus all the promotions that people did — like those ten- to thirty-five-percent-off sales for Memorial Day or Labor Day or Black Friday — those are gone.” Sheinkopf doesn’t expect things to settle down until at least 2022 maybe even 2023.

Appliance backlogs are among the most dramatic but as Sheinkopf said “We could be talking right now about pools or decks or any of that stuff.” He’s right: A salesman at New England Spas in Natick said that while some best-selling hot tub models were in stock because the store preordered them months ago most special orders now take a year to come in and prices have risen too. “It depends on the type of tub but mostly we’re looking at next summer” he said.

Other costs pile up

Decks have gotten more expensive along with lumber prices while other outdoor projects are affected by shortages.

“Concrete pavers composite decking and even bluestone have been difficult to obtain” said Jennifer Nawada Evans owner of Nawada Landscape Design in Boston. “I’ve had to wait one to three months on pavers and decking.”

Even trees and shrubs have been tricky to get Nawada Evans added. “Normally you can just walk into a nursery and get what you want but now in order to ensure your plants are at the nursery when you get there it’s best to order and tag your plants” she said.

Paint is in short supply too partly due to the winter storms in the South.

Mauro Henrique owner of Mauro’s Painting in Somerville said he recently ran out of exterior trim paint in the middle of a job and just needed a couple more gallons to finish up — but he couldn’t find a store that carried anything less than five-gallon tubs of the base paint.

“I called two local paint stores and they didn’t have it” Henrique said. “I ran out to my go-to paint store and my guy said the same thing: ‘We don’t have the single gallons and we don’t know when we’ll get them in.’ ”

Check Out These 3 Alzheimer's Therapy Stocks,"Treating Alzheimer's is extremely difficult but these innovative companies are taking a stab at it.

Neurodegenerative disorders extract a terrible human toll. In particular dementia affects more than 44 million people globally with Azheimer's being the most common cause accounting for 60% to 80% of all cases of dementia. Moreover dementia is the fifth most common cause of death worldwide. Thankfully there are a handful of companies working on treatments for Alzheimer's.

With the recent commercialization of Biogen's drug Aduhelm investors everywhere can take heart that the disease might finally be treatable. So the floodgates for Alzheimer's drug development are open and there's money to be made by investing in the most promising candidates. While there's no guarantee that any of the companies I discuss below will actually succeed in making an effective Alzheimer's therapy of their own they'll all have an edge over Biogen's Aduhelm if they do.

1. Annovis Bio

Annovis Bio (ANVS 25.10%) is a small biotech that's working on ANVS401 a drug which it hopes will be able to treat Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in people with Down syndrome. ANVS401 is currently in phase 2a of clinical trials and on June 1 the company reported that the drug appeared to help patients with Alzheimer's score significantly higher on a standardized test that measures the speed and accuracy of their cognition. Impressively the drug also helped patients with Parkinson's as well. That's a bombshell of a finding to say the least and Annovis' stock shot toward the moon as a result.

The secret to ANVS401's efficacy is its triple-pronged approach. Rather than attacking only one of the proteins associated with Alzheimer's as Biogen's Aduhelm does the drug targets three: beta amyloid tau and alpha synuclein. So there's a chance that it could blow Aduhelm out of the water if it ends up getting approved.

Investors will need to act quickly if they want to purchase the stock before what could be another major catalyst. Annovis will report the full results of the ANVS401 trial in August. Before that it'll present a lengthy update at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference which starts on July 26. If the previously disclosed results hold up it's hard to see the stock going anywhere but skyward.

2. Eli Lilly

The pharma giant Eli Lilly (LLY -0.45%) has a slew of different Alzheimer's therapies in development including a pair of candidates in phase 3 of clinical testing: Donanemab and Solanezumab. Both drugs target the beta-amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's but Solanezumab aims to remove circulating beta-amyloid whereas Donanemab is focused on dissolving immobile beta-amyloid plaques.

Eli Lilly's advantage is that it has developed several different diagnostic tools that it can use to identify characteristics of Alzheimer's patients which these drugs are the most likely to help. After using these tools to screen for patients in the second phase of its clinical trial of Donanemab it reported positive results.

In short patients treated with Donanemab experienced a slower progression of their disease as measured by a handful of different cognitive-functioning tests than patients treated with placebo. But cognitive functioning still declined over time so the therapy isn't a panacea. Still if these findings hold up Eli Lilly will probably be the next Alzheimer's drug developer to make it to the market after Biogen and based on the data as it stands right now its candidate is superior. But as Eli Lilly is a massive pharma stock with a plethora of other drugs on the market it remains to be seen whether the potential new revenue could make a major impact on its top line.

The company expects to report efficacy data sometime in the first half of 2023 so keep an eye out.

3. Prothena

Prothena's (PRTA -4.47%) selection of Alzheimer's projects is significantly earlier-stage than Eli Lilly's or Annovis Bio's. It has two programs in the tail end of preclinical testing and two others in the discovery phase. One of the candidates being investigated in the discovery phase is a vaccine aimed at recruiting the immune system to fight against two different proteins associated with Alzheimer's which could be extremely lucrative if it can be used preventatively.

The company's crown jewel PRX005 which Prothena is developing in conjunction with Bristol-Myers Squibb just started its phase 1 clinical trials on June 24. The drug targets the tau protein associated with Alzheimer's and studies in model animals have been quite positive. Bristol Myers Squibb will pay Prothena $80 million in exchange for the license to PRX005 should it be commercialized with the option to pay more to advance development after each phase of trials.

Given how early-stage Prothena's projects are the biggest thing for investors to watch for is safety reporting. Serious side effects could nip its promising therapies in the bud and the risk of investing right now is very high. Nonetheless if the company can show that its candidates are safe that will be a major boon to shareholders. And it'll pave the way for further investigations that would have a shot at demonstrating the drug's efficacy which is where the biggest returns lie.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pc2xhbmRwYWNrZXQvbmFtZS9mcmFuay1uZXJvLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEyOTQ0Mjc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frank Nero Obituary (1934 - 2021) - Cary NC - The Island Packet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/islandpacket/name/frank-nero-obituary?id=12944274 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pc2xhbmRwYWNrZXQvbmFtZS9mcmFuay1uZXJvLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEyOTQ0Mjc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

View image in fullscreen Sugar production has an ugly past with roots in slavery and abhorrent working conditions into the present. Photograph: Ethan Frisch

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY29va2luZy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS9yZWNpcGVzLzEwMjU0MDktYnJvd24tc3VnYXItc2hlZXQtcGFuLWZyZW5jaC10b2FzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Sugar Sheet-Pan French Toast Recipe,With a cracking caramelized brown sugar crust topping and soft custardy slices of challah this sheet-pan French toast is sweet perfection all by itself without the need for maple syrup or powdered sugar.

After she became the NCAA's all-time scorer Brown was among those to send congratulations to the Hawkeyes sharpshooter but it came in a strange way.

""Congrats to Caitlin Clark on becoming all-time leading scorer"" he wrote in a message on X accompanied by a GIF of actor Mel Gibson with long flowing hair.

Brown later called the former Iowa Hawkeyes star the ""Cracker of the Day"" after he revealed to his followers on X that she blocked him on the social media platform. It appeared that one lewd attack after another finally crossed the line for Clark.

Well the former NFL receiver went on Jason Whitlock's podcast to discuss their social media beef.

""Caitlin Clark we love you. There's no drama here. I'm excited about what you're going to do for women's basketball. You're an amazing player. I love to watch your game. You bring a lot of excitement and energy"" Brown said.

Brown later said his made-up network CTESPN ""would love to have you talk express what you deal with your traumas your adversities how you continue to be great"" saying his comments about Clark were ""all in fun and games.""

""Continue to be great continue to keep focus on being the best athlete you want to be. Continue to lead women's sports and pioneering it the way you want to pioneer it. I have a daughter they look up to you and look up to everything you guys are doing. So shout out to you Caitlin Clark.""

It was a nice message from Brown at first. But then he couldn't help but throw in one more crude comment.

""If it's hairy don't worry about it"" Brown concluded.

It's tough to imagine that Clark will be unblocking Brown any time soon after that.

The comment resulted in a sigh and little chuckle from Whitlock.

Bizarre interactions with Clark from IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel resulted in him no longer covering the WNBA for the outlet.

Clark scored 21 points in her first preseason game with the Indiana Fever last week after they selected her with the first overall pick in April. Her official WNBA debut will be next Tuesday against the Connecticut Sun.

Usher didn't say much to the crowd of sold out crowd of 4300 people during the 90-minute show instead letting his music and his never-ending barrage of No. 1 songs do the talking. The star also didn't hesitate to play his strings of hits including ""Yeah"" ""Caught Up"" and ""Confessions.""

In a city that doesn't shy away for its vast assortment of adult entertainment Usher's show got steamy at times featuring dancers showing off their moves on stripper poles.

The nightclub vibe was also enhanced with ""Ush Bucks"" faux dollar bills with Usher's face that fell from the rafters onto the crowd throughout the night.



As all this happened Usher continued to showcase his own dancing and singing skills much to the delight of the crowd. Taking things to a whole new level the eight-time Grammy winner even performed while on roller skates.

While he rarely addressed his fans directly during the night Usher did share a special moment with the crowd at the start of the show as he walked through the audience and gave them his attention.

""Vegas It's Up Tonight!"" he tweeted to his 12 million followers hours before the residency kicked off.

The Usher residency marked the first new major residency to hit the Las Vegas Strip since the coronavirus pandemic. The show itself was a runaway hit months before Usher ever stepped foot on the stage — the initial run of a dozen shows sold out so quickly that six additional performance had to be added.

It was clear that Usher's fans well got it bad.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL211c2ljLW5ld3MvdXNoZXItbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXJlc2lkZW5jeS0xMjM0OTg0MTI0L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL211c2ljLW5ld3MvdXNoZXItbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXJlc2lkZW5jeS0xMjM0OTg0MTI0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Usher Launches Las Vegas Residency: “I Don’t Want to Close the Curtain”,"Usher performs at the grand opening of “USHER The Las Vegas Residency” at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on July 16 2021 in Las Vegas Nevada.

During the grand opening of his first Las Vegas residency on Friday night it was difficult to tell who was having the most fun: Usher or the audience. But there’s no denying that the singer-songwriter has now left his own indelible stamp on The Colosseum at Caesars Palace home to previous residencies by Celine Dion Cher Elton John Mariah Carey and Rod Stewart.

“This feels so good that I don’t want to close the curtain” said a beaming Usher surrounded by cast and crew at the end of his sold-out 90-minute set.

Between then and the time the red velvet curtains opened at around 9:30 p.m. the singer kept a screaming audience on its feet the entire time — beginning with his electrifying entrance in the middle of the audience. Wearing a sparkly blue outfit and declaring “You’re in Vegas” Usher launched into a snippet of “My Way” as he strode around the right side of the venue to the stage.

From there Usher rolled out hit after hit as well as other fan faves curated from a Grammy Award-winning career that began in 1994. The energetic journey down memory lane kicked off with “Caught Up” followed by “Love in This Club” and “Party” (the Chris Brown song featuring Usher and Gucci Mane). It was a nonstop audience sing-along as Usher and his crew of dancers triggered a slew of oh-wow moments from there including “Lovers and Friends” and “There Goes My Baby.”

During a segment devoted to his Atlanta roots Usher donned skates along with his dancers and turned the massive Colosseum stage into a giant roller rink as he performed “Don’t Waste My Time” (featuring Ella Mai). Then in a nod to Magic City Atlanta’s famous strip club pole dancers showcased their flexibility amid a shower of Ush bucks to such songs as “I Don’t Mind” “Bad Girl” “Good Kisser” and “Back to Sleep” (Chris Brown featuring Usher and Zayn).

Noted Usher at one point “You all know I was raised in the ‘A’ … it’s the ATL in Vegas.”

Working his way through a playlist that also included “DJ Got Us Fallin’ in Love” “OMG” and of course “Yeah.” At one point Usher jumped off stage to interact once more with the audience on “My Boo” and “U Remind Me.” Back on stage Usher continued to display his own signature and mesmerizing dance skills especially on “You Make Me Wanna…” performing alongside four other smooth-moving male dancers.

Another crowd-pleasing moment occurred when Usher simmered his way into the Summer Walker mellow vibe on which he’s featured “Come Thru” complemented by sensual interplay between him and a lone female dancer. Rounding out the sexual tension in that segment during which Usher had women screaming thanks to his own suggestive moves: “Bad Habits” “Nice & Slow” and “Climax.” A major climax of the evening itself arrived with the ballads “Burn” and “Confessions Part II.”

Beyond the depth of his catalog the thread running throughout the evening was Usher’s showmanship and passion for his art. A close-up of his face flashed on the two giant video screens framing either side of the stage (below each of which were platforms housing the musicians) said it all: Usher grinning ear-to-ear through dripping sweat.

Before closing with a heartfelt performance of “Without You” the 2011 David Guetta track he guested on Usher told the audience “I want to take two seconds to appreciate this moment.” The song was a fitting way to end the show as the singer noted afterwards “Thank you so much for being here. I couldn’t do this without you.” Capping the evening: a shower of miniature $20 Ush bucks raining down on the sated audience.

Usher – The Vegas Residency continues Saturday through Aug 14.

This story first appeared on Billboard.com.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL211c2ljL3VzaGVyLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1yZXNpZGVuY3ktcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Usher's Las Vegas residency serves as a reminder he's unmatched: Review,"Inevitably whenever the subject of dream Verzuz guests come up the male artist that starts trending on social media is Usher. Though a decade removed from when the Atlanta-based singer last dominated the charts he has been repeatedly proposed as the ideal match up for the earnest Justin Timberlake or the frenetic Chris Brown.

Thing is in terms of commercial and critical success people forget how much Usher is in his own lane — and his new residency at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas is here to remind them.

The show which opened Friday night begins with a video of the performer throwing around general plaudits about his career (""I do it to celebrate music I do it to celebrate culture"" he says) before flashing through archival footage of the nearly three decades he's been a star. As the clip ends and the music kicks in the crowd is left scrambling to spot the artist before finding him right in the middle of the audience singing his spry 1998 single ""My Way."" He then runs through more fan favorites including ""Caught Up"" ""U Don't Have To Call"" and ""Love In This Club"" nailing strenuous choreography while the capacity crowd scream-sings his lyrics word for word.

Later during the show's centerpiece Usher returns to his Atlanta roots roll bouncing along in roller skates to recent single ""Don't Waste My Time"" before wheeling out a two-story set reminiscent of famed ATL strip club Magic City complete with various sized stripper poles. (The rumored infamous Usher bucks are indeed real and he showers both the dancers and the audience with them.)

For ""Bad Girl"" Usher invokes his beloved 2005 performance with Beyoncé throwing in a show-stopping pole dance for good measure. His performance of ""You Make Me Wanna"" rivals Magic Mike and the nearby Chippendales show with him sliding his hand down his pants and caressing the microphone stand. He showcases more theatrical talents on ""Climax"" pulling off the Grammy-winning ballad's rollercoaster of emotions. And ""Confessions Part II"" given a new arrangement for the show is still compelling enough to trick you into thinking its pulled from Usher's life (producer Jermaine Dupri has copped to it being based on his own past low point).

The show does have its faults. There's an interlude that feels more like a cognac commercial and the focus on ballads in latter half of the set dampens the momentum; by the time the singer's EDM era kicks off near the end the crowd has a hard time catching a second wind unable to match the high energy of ""DJ Got Us Falling In Love"" ""Scream"" and ""Yeah!"" Meanwhile the last portion feels a bit random: an interstitial soundtracked to ""Without You"" plays and the singer gives a classic crooning Vegas performance of ""U Got It Bad."" He then closes with a banter-y encore of ""Without You"" — tweaked to sound more inspirational as he tells the audience how much he appreciates them coming out as we're nearing the end of the global pandemic.

But those small setbacks don't detract from what this residency accomplishes: an impressive showcase for Usher's achievements and a reminder of how much he has achieved since he was a teenager: more than 100 million records sold eight Grammys nine No. 1 hits (a feat only matched or surpassed by Elton John Stevie Wonder Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley). That he easily has another hour of memorable songs left in the chamber by the end of his Caesars setlist makes the thought of him losing a Verzuz laughable.

Usher has officially brought the OMG to Las Vegas.

On Friday night the multi-talented performer 42 kicked off his residency show at the famed Colosseum in Caesars Palace — and he didn't hold back.

Usher didn't say much to the crowd of sold out crowd of 4300 people during the 90-minute show instead letting his music and his never-ending barrage of No. 1 songs do the talking. The star also didn't hesitate to play his strings of hits including ""Yeah"" ""Caught Up"" and ""Confessions.""

In a city that doesn't shy away for its vast assortment of adult entertainment Usher's show got steamy at times featuring dancers showing off their moves on stripper poles.

The nightclub vibe was also enhanced with ""Ush Bucks"" faux dollar bills with Usher's face that fell from the rafters onto the crowd throughout the night.



As all this happened Usher continued to showcase his own dancing and singing skills much to the delight of the crowd. Taking things to a whole new level the eight-time Grammy winner even performed while on roller skates.

While he rarely addressed his fans directly during the night Usher did share a special moment with the crowd at the start of the show as he walked through the audience and gave them his attention.

""Vegas It's Up Tonight!"" he tweeted to his 12 million followers hours before the residency kicked off.

The Usher residency marked the first new major residency to hit the Las Vegas Strip since the coronavirus pandemic. The show itself was a runaway hit months before Usher ever stepped foot on the stage — the initial run of a dozen shows sold out so quickly that six additional performance had to be added.

It was clear that Usher's fans well got it bad."

Unseld Jr. becomes the 25th head coach in the organization’s history.

“Wes is one of the most highly-regarded assistant coaches in the NBA and clearly separated himself from the large and diverse group of candidates we considered” said Wizards General Manager Tommy Sheppard. “His strong record as an in-game tactician along with his attention to detail on both sides of the ball combined with his reputation for player development and outstanding character during his 20+ years of coaching left no doubt that he was the best choice to guide our team to the next level.”

Unseld Jr. comes to Washington after spending the past six seasons in Denver including this past season as the Nuggets’ associate head coach. Under his guidance the Nuggets finished fifth in the West in opponents points per game during the 2020-21 season and 11th overall in defensive rating (while finishing sixth overall in offensive rating). During his six seasons in Denver the Nuggets finished at least 10 games over .500 four times (including a 54-win season in 2018-19) and have made the playoffs each of the last three seasons.

“I want to thank Tommy and Mr. Leonsis for the opportunity to lead this talented team both on and off the court and to continue moving the franchise in a positive direction” said Unseld Jr. “Becoming a head coach in the NBA is a goal that I have pursued my entire adult life and to have that dream realized by coming full circle back to Washington is truly special. I look forward to representing the DMV connecting with our fans and establishing a new standard for Wizards basketball.”

Unseld Jr. was instrumental in both developing Nikola Jokic into the lowest-drafted MVP in NBA history and the year-to-year improvement of Jamal Murray as one of the top young guards in the NBA. He also helped develop several mid-first round and second round picks into important contributors during his time in Denver.

“Tommy was very thorough during our search and the intelligence information and recommendations he had gathered on Wes were exceeded by how impressive his preparation and planning were during the interview process” said Monumental Sports and Entertainment CEO and Washington Wizards Governor Ted Leonsis. “We are excited to bring him on board and see those attributes in action with our players and in the community with our fans.”

Prior to joining the Nuggets he spent two seasons (2012-14) as an assistant coach with the Orlando Magic (where he worked with Nikola Vucevic Tobias Harris and Victor Oladipo during the early stages of their careers) and one season (2011-12) with the Golden State Warriors (where he worked with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson during the early stages of their careers).

Unseld Jr. returns to Washington after beginning his career with the Wizards as an advance/pro scout in 1997. He would continue in that role through 2005 while also serving as an advance scout for the Mystics for three seasons (which included a stint as an assistant coach in the 1998 season) before being promoted to assistant coach for the Wizards in 2005. During his six seasons on the Wizards bench Unseld Jr. was instrumental in game planning and player development and was largely credited with the success of the Wizards’ offensive game plans with the team posting four consecutive playoff appearances (2005-08) and three straight top 10 offensive finishes (2004-07).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLXByZW1pdW0tc2VsZWN0LXZzLWJpei03Njcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why premium economy is more attractive than biz on Delta’s latest plane,"Delta's making a big bet on the future of travel.

Nowhere is that more apparent than in the airline's fleet strategy. Delta's just announced that it's adding 36 planes while also embarking on a year-long cabin retrofit program for some of its oldest international jets including the Airbus A330 and Boeing 767-300.

Earlier this week I had the opportunity to check out the first reconfigured Boeing 767-300 in Atlanta. While the entire plane is decked out with enhancements including mood lighting modernized seat covers and updated lavatories the real star of the show is the new premium economy cabin.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The 767-300 sports an 18-seat Premium Select cabin with recliners arranged in a three-row 2-2-2 configuration. This represents the fourth aircraft type to receive Delta's take on premium economy after the cabin first debuted on the flagship Airbus A350 in 2017 followed thereafter by the Airbus A330neo and Boeing 767-400.

In recent years Delta along with the other U.S. Big 3 competitors began realizing that a market exists for a product between a private lie-flat pod and a standard coach seat. That's exactly where premium economy fits — the cabin was designed to bridge the gap between business class and economy at an intermediate price.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

On some planes the difference between the lie-flat business-class and premium economy cabins is stark. In Delta's case there's a night-and-day contrast between the Delta One Suites at the pointy end of the A350 or A330neo relative to the Premium Select recliners behind the biz cabin.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

But on the newly retrofitted 767-300 that gap between biz and premium economy is much smaller: so much so that it might be worthwhile to save some money and stick with premium economy.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

For one despite the reconfiguration project Delta isn't installing a new business-class seat in the biz cabin on the 767-300. That means you'll still find the woefully outdated first-generation Thompson Vantage seat when flying up front.

Sure the airline added all-new finishes with extra memory foam but the ""bones"" of the seat are ultimately the same. They're tight and offer limited privacy.

Additionally the seat-back entertainment screens are some of the smallest you'll find across premium cabins on U.S. carriers. At just 10.1 inches you might prefer to bring your own content on your higher quality iPad or laptop.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

In premium economy you'll find a much more modernized recliner. Of course it's not a flat-bed pod so if you need to be horizontal to catch some z's then you're better off in biz.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

For everyone else or if you're not planning to sleep the comfortable leg rest footrest and generous recline in Premium Select could be worth considering.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

While there's no privacy divider between seats this is Delta's most intimate premium economy cabin in the sky. With just 18 seats odds are that it'll be a quieter ride in this mid-cabin section than on other Delta widebodies. Plus if you're traveling with a companion you might find it more comfortable to be seated closer to each other.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Additionally the inflight entertainment system in the premium economy cabin is just as good if not better than the one up front. Like biz each premium economy seat has a 10-inch screen but these ones appeared to offer much better resolution than the old screens you'll find in Delta One.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Though inflight service remains modified due to the pandemic premium economy travelers can usually expect a watered-down version of business-class service. In Premium Select flyers are served elevated meals on real china a selection of wines beers and premium spirits and a Tumi-branded amenity kit.

It's not just the relative difference in products that might make it worthwhile to stick with a premium economy recliner on Delta's retrofitted Boeing 767-300. Consider the routes that the plane flies as well: many of them are within the U.S. including hops between Atlanta and both Los Angeles and San Francisco.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Internationally Delta flies the 767-300 on shorter flights like from Atlanta to Lima or New York to Madrid both routes between 3000 and 3500 miles or roughly six to seven hours. While it could make sense to splurge for biz on ultra-long-haul flights like Delta's longest route from Atlanta to Johannesburg the price difference might not be worth it for shorter hops.

Case in point: for a round-trip ticket from New York to Paris in early August Delta's charging a whopping $6600 for business class. Meanwhile premium economy is ""just"" $1500 a modest $500 upcharge compared to coach.

(For now the Premium Select cabin on the 767-300 is currently being marketed as extra-legroom Comfort+ so top-tier Medallion elites can select one of these seats free of charge. Delta will likely start charging for these seats once it consistently deploys the retrofitted plane on a specific route.)

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

If those flights were operated by a retrofitted 767-300 there's no chance I'd fork over an additional five grand for an outdated lie-flat bed. In that case — and in many others — Premium Select might be the way to go.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL2hhbW1ldHRzLWhvdGVsLW5ld3BvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hammetts Hotel: A stay at Newport’s latest luxury property,"My first job after college was as a reporter for The Providence Journal.

The guy scooping it for me was none other than a former state representative I used to write about.

I had come back to Newport to check out one of the city's newest and most luxurious hotels: Hammetts. But I also reconnected with a state and community that takes pride in its traditions and somehow balances that with the modern-day needs of tourists.

My journey started when TPG's editors sat down (virtually) to discuss the year's new and upcoming hotels especially high-end ones that are easy drives from New York Boston and other Northeast areas. Hammetts Hotel immediately caught my eye. It opened in June 2020 at the height of the pandemic but is now really ready for prime time.

So when the property invited us to spend two nights there I packed my bags. (Note: This isn't a formal review since the hotel knew we were coming.)

Luxury in the center of town

The hotel is a much-welcome luxury addition right in the heart of Newport. The design is spectacular and I could spend hours relaxing on the back deck. Even in winter I could imagine cozying up in a giant chair next to a lobby fireplace.

That location and luxury don't come cheap. Some winter midweek nights go for $200 summer weeknights for $450 and summer weekends start around $650. Some rooms can easily top $1000 a night. For those who can afford it and want a quiet oasis in the center of all the action Hammetts doesn't disappoint.

Just note this is an urban hotel. There's no pool or spa here. No room service or breakfast options. It's a place to unwind between your various local adventures.

We arrived from New York in our car and pulled into the valet entrance right under the hotel. (Nightly parking is $45. That might seem high but it's an outright bargain compared to the unprotected lot a block away charging $9 an hour.)

The hotel staff promptly welcomed us and led us and our bags to an elevator up to the lobby. Given the tight constraints of sitting on the edge of Newport Harbor the architects did a phenomenal job of planning a seamless all-season arrival experience.

One flight up was the spectacular nautical-themed lobby.

Don't worry it wasn't filled with fake pirates giant anchors or model ships. Instead floor-to-ceiling windows flooded the space with natural light. A classy mix of wooden beams a few nautical items and comfy furniture filled the space. Down the hallway is a series of three connected rooms that carried the theme but offered more intimate spots to unwind. The first-floor hallways were lined with unique and playful artwork.

The Mercantile Suite

Hammetts upgraded us to its largest room. Located on a corner on the third — and top — floor the room clocks in at 560 square feet and was selling for close to $1500 a night. Standard rooms were going for $670 during the mid-June weekend.

The hotel has 84 rooms split between the second and third floors. The first floor is filled with stores and the only on-site restaurant Giusto. (More on it later.) There is a total of four suites one of which is accessible. There are four other accessible rooms.

Our suite had a living room with a pullout sofa bed a daybed next to the oversized window and a master bedroom with the bathroom and shower. The suite could connect to both a king and queen room located on either side of the living room. Ten-foot-high ceilings made the room feel even larger.

The 7-foot-tall windows flooded the room with tons of light. More importantly Hammetts had two layers of shades: a privacy shade and a blackout shade that fit into metal slots around the window frame. When it came time to sleep our room was amazingly dark. There was no need for any of my normal tricks like propping pillows against the shade or holding curtains closed by leaning a chair against them.

Plus there were rocking chairs — a favorite of my daughter.

For such a large room the bathroom was underwhelming. There was a small area with a toilet and shower. Bulk dispensers had hair and body products from Lockwood. A sliding door separated this space from the rest of the room. Just outside the door was a small vanity which could have used more counter space. Then there was a large open space that wasn't really part of the bathroom or part of the bedroom. The room also lacked a closet and dresser. There were just some hangers against a wall.

Wi-Fi was plentiful throughout the property. It wasn't lightning fast but strong enough and fast enough to stream videos.

Dining (and drinking) at Hammetts

The real star of the hotel is its back deck.

Besides the restaurant Giusto there is a bar open to the public and a separate seating area just for hotel guests.

Sure it isn't as grand as the mansions the Vanderbilts and their friends build. But it is one great spot to grab a drink or two.

The chairs are comfy the breeze is strong and the cocktails are great. At night strings of Edison light bulbs illuminate the deck.

For those looking to just stay hydrated the hotel provides guests with a glass refillable bottle and a filling station on each floor.

This was something I recently had at a Canopy by Hilton in Washington D.C. and is a great trend that I hope is adopted by more properties.

We had an amazing dinner at the hotel's restaurant Giusto. However note that the eatery is operated by a third party doesn't serve breakfast and there is no room service. (Stay tuned for my tip for a fabulous breakfast.)

Giusto takes up half of the deck and serves some great seafood and Italian dishes. The views and outdoor tables are great.

As for the food I could write many superlatives to say how much we enjoyed the meal but really the photos below say it all.

Pro tip: Order the Scotch meatball. You won't be disappointed. Also order the steamed littlenecks with the garlic doughboy. That won't disappoint either. And you should also order the ... you get the point.

After a big meal there is a small but well-stocked gym for the next morning. Or just a comfy chair outside it with a nice view while you rest and continue to digest.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Scott Mayerowitz/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

The hotel does offer complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby. As for that breakfast take a quick hike up the hill to the Franklin Spa.

No this is not a spot to get a massage but rather a long-time local diner. A word of warning: It is cash-only but worth it.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Scott Mayerowitz/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

The spot is known for its eggs Benedict. I went with the classic but there was also a Maryland crabcake version the weekend we visited. My daughter got the Micky Mouse pancakes with chocolate chips and couldn't have been happier.

Bottom line

Hammetts offers a true luxury hotel in an unbeatable spot.

It is modern sleek and comfortable. For the price it charges I would like a few extras such as in-room robes and slippers. But I guess given the location and how strong it compares to the competition Hammetts doesn't need some of those extras that we usually see in high-end hotels.

The staff could not have been friendlier and everything looked perfectly maintained.

If you have the budget there is no better spot in central Newport for your stay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy9uYmEtY29tbXVuaXR5LXJlYWN0cy11bnNlbGQtanItaGlyaW5nLXdpemFyZHMtaGVhZC1jb2FjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA community reacts to Unseld Jr.'s hiring as Wizards head coach,"addByline(""Jackson Filyo"" ""WashingtonWizards.com"");

On Saturday the Wizards named Wes Unseld Jr. the 25th head coach in franchise history. Unseld Jr. began his coaching career as an assistant with the Wizards in 2005 after eight seasons with the team as a scout. He then went on to hold assistant coaching roles with the Warriors Magic and most recently the Nuggets. As a DMV-native and son of Bullets legend Wes Unseld Sr. the hiring of Unseld Jr. made waves across the NBA landscape as soon as it was announced.

Unseld Jr. comes to D.C. after spending the last six seasons in Denver including a season as the team’s associate head coach during the 2020-21 season. In his time with the Nuggets Unseld Jr. developed a widespread reputation as one of the premier assistant coaches in the NBA. In the Wizards’ announcement of the hiring general manager Tommy Sheppard said of Unseld Jr.: “His strong record as an in-game tactician along with his attention to detail on both sides of the ball combined with his reputation for player development and outstanding character during his 20+ years of coaching left no doubt that he was the best choice to guide our team to the next level.”

The announcement that he’d been hired as Washington’s next head coach garnered immediate praise and support out of Denver.

In addition to his work with the Wizards in the late 90s Unseld Jr. spent time on the Mystics staff in 1998."

CCL,Carnival,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLWFkZHMtc2VwYXJhdGUtbm9uLXNtb2tpbmctY2FzaW5vLW9uLXRocmVlLXNoaXBzLzUzNDEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Adds Separate Non-Smoking Casino on Three Ships,"Carnival Cruise Line is making some changes by introducing a new separate Casino which will be just for non-smoking guests. The new venue is now on three Carnival cruise ships and it could be rolled out to more.

New Non-Smoking Casino

Because many people do not enjoy the smell of smoke there have been changes made for Carnival Breeze Carnival Dream and Carnival Magic in the form of a non-smoking casino. The rules regarding smoking onboard remain pretty much the same post-pandemic as it was before. However for those that want a smoke-free environment there is the option now for a different casino.

Worth Reading: Which Carnival Cruise Ships Have Resumed Operations?

Located inside the former convention room on deck four on Carnival Breeze Carnival Dream and Carnival Magic the new casino areas on the three vessels will always be non-smoking while having the same gaming options as the original casino.

Although there will be no bar there will be a drinks service. For now the non-smoking casino will only be on those three vessels and Carnival may decide to roll out the concept fleet-wide in the future.

Seeing that the convention room had little use onboard except being used for the occasional crew meeting the new Casino area will be a welcome addition to those who want to avoid the smell of tobacco.

John Heald Carnival Brand Ambassador:

While half of the casino is going to remain smoking on all of our ships on those three ships for now we have designed a non-smoking casino. Now if you picture those ships if you go onto deck four there was a conference room where we would hold conferences. But those conference rooms which are very large on Breeze Dream and Magic have now been converted into a non-smoking casino.

Why Carnival Does Not Ban Smoking Inside

Although smoking is far less popular or common inside cruise ships these days than it was 20 or even 10 years ago Carnival Cruise Line still allows smoking inside its casino (Royal Caribbean and Norwegian allow it as well).

The reasoning for this seems to be that people gamble and spend more when they can smoke when they play. John Heald said the financial aspect was the deciding factor to allowing smoking to continue inside the Casinos nightclubs and Casino bars:

“So those people who always say to me we don’t like the smoke in the casino and I totally respect and understand that. We know that smokers gamble. And that’s why you know if we thought the revenue was going to remain the same if we took smoking away. However it won’t which is why we haven’t. I want to be straight here that um we have to look at both sides. We can’t make the casinos non-smoking if we don’t have good onboard revenue. We can’t keep the prices of the cruise the most affordable in the industry. And that’s why we’re doing this.“

As for Carnival’s newest ship Mardi Gras the company has not yet announced its smoking policies onboard or whether there will be a second venue for non-smoking guests while allowing smoking in the main casino.

For the ships sailing currently these are the smoking policies in place for Carnival Vista Horizon and Breeze keep in mind that Carnival has removed the Casino bar from the Vista-class cruise ships and replaced it with more slot machines:

Carnival Breeze: Cigarette smoking is permitted in the Winners’ Luck Casino and Casino Bar Liquid Nightclub and outdoors on Deck 5 (port side aft outside the Nightclub) and Deck 11 (starboard side aft).

Carnival Horizon: Cigarette smoking is permitted in the Horizon Casino and outdoors on Deck 5 (port side and starboard side forward) and Deck 11 (starboard side forward and aft).

Carnival Vista: Cigarette smoking is permitted in the Vista Casino and outdoors on Deck 5 (port side and starboard side forward) and Deck 11 (starboard side forward and aft).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydXplbHkuY29tL3RoZS1jb21wbGV0ZS1ndWlkZS10by1jYXJuaXZhbHMtaHViLWFwcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Can't-Miss Guide Carnival's Hub App (with Pics),"These days it seems like everyone has an app. From weather to sports scores to stock trading — you can seemingly get any information you need on your phone without visiting a traditional website. Cruising is no different. All the major cruise lines have an app for passengers to download to their phone that has all sorts of useful features to make the cruise more enjoyable.

Carnival has an app for its passengers called Carnival HUB. If you haven’t already heard about the service you definitely will once you book your cruise or board the ship. Mentions of the app are everywhere. And with new protocols put in place following the health crisis its importance is greater than ever.

What is the app? Carnival HUB is designed to be an all-in-one service that gives you everything you need to know about your cruise all in the palm of your hand. From maps of the ship to daily schedules of activities to a chat function — allowing you to stay in touch with other passengers — the app has you covered.

We recently completed a cruise and downloaded the app to put it to the test and review to see if it’s worth your time. Here’s what we found…

Downloading Carnival HUB

The Carnival HUB app is available for use on Carnival ships for both Apple and Android phones. The app is free and you can download from the App Store (iPhone) or Google Play Store (Android).

We’d recommend downloading before you get on board the ship. That way it’s just one less thing to worry about on cruise day.

When you first download the app it’s hard to see what the big deal is. You simply enter the details of your trip and it provides you with a countdown timer measuring how much longer you have until you sail. Other than that there isn’t much else to do on the app until you are aboard the ship.

Once you are aboard however there’s a big change.

On the ship you’ll connect to the ship’s wi-fi for the app to run. Don’t worry even though Internet is expensive on a cruise the app runs for free over the ship’s wi-fi. No payment is required.

After setting up a connection you’ll enter your shipboard folio details to sign in all of which are on your Sail & Sign card you received at check-in. This allows you to log in and connects your onboard account to the app.

Once you are logged in you can start to see the power of the app. Open up the menu and you can see the complete list of what’s available. Here are the items that we think most people will use during the course of a cruise:

Chat

What’s Happening (Daily Schedule)

Food & Drinks

Open Times

Ship Maps

Account Summary

Good to Know

Chat on Carnival Hub

Traveling with a family? Then you will likely want to use the chat feature to keep in touch. For $5 per person (for the entire cruise) you can unlock the chat feature. You can make plans to meet or check-in with kids while on the ship. Note that the chat feature works only on the ship as it runs through the ship’s wi-fi.

What’s Happening (Daily Schedule)

There’s always something on the ship from early in the morning into late at night. Every day you are delivered a schedule but who wants to carry that around with them while they have fun on board? As well on one of the first cruises back we weren’t even delivered a paper copy of the schedule. Instead we had to access it via the phone.

You have the entire schedule in the palm of your hand with the Carnival HUB app.

With a few clicks you can see what’s going on now or even later days in your cruise. And if you aren’t sure what an event is you can click it for more details about it.

Food & Drinks

Want to hit up the nearest bar or grab a bite to eat? This section of the app tells you what’s open and more information about the restaurant. By the second or third day you will have a good idea of what’s available but it’s extremely valuable when you first get on the ship and aren’t sure where to go to grab lunch or a fruity cocktail. One thing we liked is having menus available for to check out for restaurants around the ship.

Open Times

Just as you would guess open times tells you when everything on the ship opens and closes — from the casino to Guest Services to restaurants. What’s amazing is that everything is included on the list and it’s updated each day as schedules change due to port days.

Ship Maps

Without a doubt the most valuable reason for downloading the Carnival Hub app is the access to maps. Every single deck is available and you can quickly switch through them. Every restaurant bar or other facility has an icon you can click to get more information about what that spot is on the map. The search features is also helpful if you want to search for a specific spot on the ship instead of looking deck by deck.

Account Summary

If you want to keep an eye on your spending then you can with the app. A couple of clicks shows you everything you’ve spent onboard with your Sail & Sign card. You can also look through the spending of other members of your party.

It’s a great way to keep an eye on if kids are being responsible in the arcade. Just like a credit card statement there are details on each transaction not just an amount spent. Best of all the summary appears to update in near real-time.

Good to Know

There are tons of little FAQs that many passengers have when on the ship. The “Good to Know” section of the app attempts to answer many of these questions. From dress codes to stateroom calls dozens of questions are covered.

Virtual Queues & Reservations

In an effort to reduce the number of lines around the ship Carnival recently introduced “Virtual Queues” to the app. So instead of going to the dining room or to Guest Services to stand around until it’s your turn you can check-in through the app online. Then when it’s your turn a notification will come up alerting you.

As well you can also select reservation times to eat at specialty restaurants without having to contact the staff.

Booking Excursions

One other thing you can do that’s helpful is booking excursions. With the app you can look through all the options with details and descriptions of each. Find one you like? There is the option to go ahead and book through the app. It’s an easy way to save some time versus going down to book with the Shore Excursion desk in the lobby.

How Does the App Work on the Ship?

We’ve used the app several times before and it’s worked flawlessly. On our most recent trip however there were some hiccups here and there. albeit minor. On the first day of the trip we had trouble logging in. It wasn’t until later in the day that we were finally able to get access.

Additionally there is an option to have food delivered to you through the app. That feature kept telling us it was unavailable at the moment no matter when we tried.

Other than that it was quick and easy to navigate all the features of the program. During our time we featured no crashes or other problems.

In our opinion Carnival Hub is extremely useful for anyone taking a cruise aboard Carnival. In fact with the menus and planner it’s practically a necessity. Since it’s free (except for $5 if you want to use the chat function) there’s no reason not to download the app. You can download here for iPhone or here for Android.

Frequently Asked Questions About Carnival Hub

Do I have to pay for the app?

No. The app is free to download and use. It’s a perk for traveling on Carnival and makes it easier to sail by packing a lot of information into your pocket. The only part that is a cost is the messenger service. That costs $5 and lets you message other people on the ship.

Do I have to download it before I get on the ship?

You can download the app after you board however we recommend downloading it at home beforehand. Once you are on the ship there is a lot going on. You don’t want to spend your time downloading an app on your phone.

Do I have to pay for wi-fi to use the Hub app?

One of the handy things about the app is that while it connects to the ship’s Internet service you don’t have to pay for wi-fi to use it. That said just because you connect through the ship’s wi-fi you won’t have access to the regular Internet. If you want to check email or do other things you have to pay for service.

Admission is free.

Chris Schafer brought his wife and three of his six kids ages 10 to 14 up from Loveland near Cincinnati. It was their first time at the Carnival. Already an aviation fan and skydiver from his days in the U.S. Army Schafer frequently goes by the Springfield exit for his work and decided to make a weekend of it.

“I follow biplanes anywhere. There’s a guy who lives near me who has his own biplane and when I see him doing that stuff it makes me go I wanna’ be there” he said.

Staying the weekend gave the Schafers a chance to see other places including Yellow Springs. For Chris the goal was to take a ride choosing the WWII-era craft that allows aerial acrobatics and for him to take the control stick for part of the ride.

Chris Schafer couldn’t have heard more encouraging words than son Rashawn’s thoughts about going up in a biplane.

“I’d be more than glad to go in anything with my dad” he said.

The early part of the day saw rain hold off but numerous clouds with enough departing to let people take rides to the skies.

Marilyn Busic of Westerville and Angie Tieu of Powell didn’t know each other before Saturday. Both say they are adrenaline junkies so it was fate that brought the women together to go up in a 1929 craft.

Busic is the veteran having ridden in one the first time in 2019 when the last Barnstorming Carnival was last in Springfield. She found the rush just as exhilarating the second time.

“It was such a smooth ride. It could get rough in the wind but still so smooth” said Busic.

Now Tieu can say the same as well. She also gained a new friend and said she was glad for the experience.

“Do it even if you’re nervous” Tieu advised others who may be considering taking a ride.

Dewey Davenport of Jamestown who founded the Barnstorming Carnival and piloted people including Busic and Tieu in his vintage biplane takes pride in this bringing people together.

“It’s a family-friendly event it’s for the community” he said. “It’s going great. We were wondering about the rain but it’s moving on.”

On the ground future generations to go up in planes were getting their first experiences in much smaller planes that were operated with their feet. Luna Bonardi age 2 was one of those.

Her parents Camden and Maggie live near Davenport in Jamestown and have been to his hangar there to look at the planes and ride in them.

“Any plane that goes over our house Luna looks at and asks ‘Dewey?’” Maggie Bonardi said smiling.

Davenport received several calls from people asking if the Barnstorming Carnival would go on in recent weeks.

Sunday’s activities will include a pancake breakfast at 8-11 a.m. and a food truck rally from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.

The ill-fated Admiral Kuznetsov became the only carrier of its line and is now undergoing major repairs following a series of catastrophic incidents including an onboard fire and collapsed drydock.

The post-refit handover of Russia’s Admiral Nakhimov battlecruiser has reportedly been postponed.

A defense industry source told Russian news outlet TASS earlier this week that the delivery of Admiral Nakhimov has been pushed back “due to problems with suppliers.” The source did not give a concrete timeline but told TASS that the handover is “postponed until 2023 at best.”

One of the largest and heaviest surface combatant ships in the world the Kirov-class nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov was commissioned in 1988 under a different name: Kalinin. The Kirov class has its roots in a prominent strain of Soviet 1970’s military thinking. Initially conceived as a battlecruiser— that is a lighter and faster variant of battleship— to counter the U.S. navy’s latest submarines with its large payload of SS-N-14 anti-submarine missiles the Kirov line grew into another no less important role: namely containing the threat from U.S. carrier strike groups (CSG’s). Armed with twenty onboard P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles Kirov-class vessels were meant to threaten U.S. aircraft carriers and other large surface ships. There was yet another broader strategic goal: Kirov-class battlecruisers were intended to operate alongside a class of dedicated modern aircraft carriers heralding a new era of Soviet global power projection.

The grand strategic visions driving the Kirov-class project collapsed alongside the Soviet Union. The ill-fated Admiral Kuznetsov became the only carrier of its line and is now undergoing major repairs following a series of catastrophic incidents including an onboard fire and collapsed drydock. Meanwhile the four Kirov-class cruisers—Admiral Ushakov Admiral Lazarev Kalinin and Petr Velikiy— fell into disrepair over the 1990s. Two of these Petr Velikiy and Kalinin were deemed to be in a salvageable state. Kalinin was renamed to Admiral Nakhimov in 1992 and has been docked since 1999. Modernization work on Nakhimov began in earnest only in 2013. As part of its deep refit Admiral Nakhimov will be upgraded to carry 3M22 Tsirkon winged anti-ship hypersonic cruise missiles Kalibr cruise missiles and Otvet anti-submarine missiles as well as the Fort-M (a naval S-300 variant) and Pantsir-M air defense systems. The Russian navy is likewise reportedly planning to outfit Admiral Nakhimov as well as its counterpart Petr Velikiy with a naval version of the S-400 missile system. These prodigious armament updates will be accompanied by a modernized radar and onboard electronics suite. If successful this refit will place Admiral Nakhimov high among the ranks of Russia’s most capable large surface warships.

Initially projected to rejoin the Navy in 2018 the Nakhimov’s handoff was subsequently postponed to 2022. Sevmash CEO Mikhail Budnichenko repeated the 2022 projection at Russia’s ARMY 2020 military exhibition. That date was also reaffirmed by Russia’s United Shipbuilding Corporation (UAC) head Alexei Rakhmanov. “We are planning to complete the ship’s repairs in 2022” said Rakhmanov during Shipbuilders’ Day celebrations in 2020. Russian officials have not formally confirmed this latest alleged delay to 2023 or later nor has its cause been identified as of the time of writing.

China's domestically developed reusable suborbital spacecraft made its successful maiden flight on Friday taking off and returning safely back to Earth. Experts hailed the progress in reusable spacecraft as a major step toward developing self-made space planes having laid a solid foundation for more Earth-space shuttles.The spacecraft which was launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gansu Province landed at an airport in Alxa Right Banner in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.It served as a flight demonstration and verification project state-owned space contractor China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC) announced in a statement on Friday.The development is an advanced integration of aerospace and aviation technologies and ""indicates China's transition from a big space-faring nation to a strong one"" CASC said reported China Space News which is co-published by CASC and another industry giant China Academy of Space Technology.It had laid a solid foundation for reusable space-Earth transportation technology representing the country's first step to achieve innovative independent development in this field the statement said.The State Administration for Science Technology and Industry for National Defense shared the news on its official social media accounts saying that the mission was an ""original and leading national scientific research project.""While no images or further details were revealed the flight soon prompted waves of attention among curious netizens. However responding to their curiosity the administration only said kind of proudly ""This is too advanced to be put on display.""Song Zhongping a space analyst and TV commentator told the Global Times on Sunday that suborbital spacecraft which are used for sending payloads to about 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface could serve a variety of purposes such as ferrying satellites.Suborbital spacecraft can also be developed into vehicles for space travel as they take off vertically and land horizontally Song noted.""The most remarkable highlight of this mission is the craft's reusability since it has verified a number of breakthroughs in materials and technologies that are required in developing a carrier capable of returning safely to the Earth"" Song said.Technologies required for reusable suborbital spaceflights are even more demanding as the spacecraft had experienced both the environment in space and that under the Earth's atmospheric influence.""China's mastery of the technologies will greatly boost the research into space planes having laid a solid foundation for developing one of our own in the future"" Song said.China launched a reusable experimental spacecraft in September 2020 via a Long March-2F carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. After spending two days in orbit it returned safely to the scheduled landing site.The successful flight in 2020 marked an important breakthrough for China in reusable spacecraft research and it is expected to offer convenient and low-cost round trip transport for the peaceful use of space according to the Xinhua News Agency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9mcmVuY2gtYmVlLWluYXVndXJhbC1uZXdhcmstcGFyaXMtZmxpZ2h0LXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Now boarding: A review of French Bee's inaugural Newark-Paris flight,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

In September 2019 international low-cost carrier French Bee (formerly known as French Blue) announced that it was launching flights between Newark-Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Paris Orly Airport (ORY). When the flights were first announced the airline was offering introductory fares of $139 each way.

But the pandemic and travel restrictions pushed the launch date to Aug. 1 2020 then that date fell away. But on July 15 2021 the launch finally came to fruition and I bought a seat on the inaugural flight. Here's what it was like.

Booking my flight

I booked my flight online and it was what you'd expect when choosing a low-cost carrier. You get your base fare with a bunch of add-ons including seat selection baggage fees a meal priority boarding and more. I decided to fly to Paris in economy and premium on the flight back to Newark. (I don't know many travelers who actually like the A350's 3-4-3 economy configuration no matter how standard it's become in the industry.)

As you can see they were pushing Basic $139 fares (see screenshot above) -- but as with any airline there's usually only a handful of the cheap seats and they tend to sell out quickly. I wasn't able to get that fare on either leg of my flight. And even if you did get it the fees add up which is typical for low-cost carriers. French Bee also offers Smart and Premium fares which come with a few more perks.

I chose the Smart fare which includes a checked bag (that I didn't use) a meal and a free reservation change (with fare difference) for $553.20.

For the ride back I opted for a bit more comfort and booked a Premium seat for $568.90. It included two checked bags a meal a free seat choice in a slightly more comfortable 2-3-2 configuration with a foot and leg rest 36-inch pitch and an 18-inch wide seat.

While Premium class comes with a meal I decided to pay $40 for an upgraded snack with champagne. Below I filled out the information for my flight. I brought my Away soft-sided Bigger Carry-On as my hand baggage and am testing The Takeaway Collection's Expat Duffle Bag as my under-seat carry-on. Be warned -- your hand baggage and smaller personal under-seat item will be weighed at the check-in desk. If the carry-on luggage and personal handbag or backpack weigh more than 12 kg (26 lbs.) total you will be asked to remove items to make the weight.

After the information was entered I added my credit card information (5x points on my The Platinum Card® from American Express) earning 6359 Membership Rewards points worth $121.18 using current TPG valuations (earn 5x points on airfare when booking direct with the airline or via American Express Travel on up to $500000 per calendar year.) I hit send and my booking was confirmed within seconds.

Extra precautions

These are the current rules for foreign travelers visiting France:

Masks are still required at all indoor venues including shops cafes and restaurants.

You still need to take either a PCR or rapid antigen COVID-19 test up to 72 hours from departing Paris.

You can also find antigen testing at most pharmacies around Paris for around 30 euros. There are also testing centers at Paris-Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Paris-Orly (ORY) airports.

But on July 12 French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled new measures he hopes will encourage more citizens to get COVID-19 vaccines as the Delta variant continues to spread. Starting on Aug.1 for anyone wanting to dine out take a long-distance train or visit a shopping center you'll need to show either proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.

Anyone 12 and over who wants to visit an amusement park attend a show concert or festival will need to have a French health pass starting on July 21. U.S. citizens who want to get a health pass must show either that they have been fully vaccinated have a negative PCR test (good for 72 hours after the test) or have a negative antigen test (good for 48 hours after the test) according to the U.S. Embassy in France.

The CDC vaccination card does not serve as a health pass. For those vaccinated in the United States with a CDC card any willing French doctor or pharmacist can enter the vaccination information in the French system even for people who do not have a French social security number or carte vitale. This will allow them to generate a paper or electronic version of the health pass.

Check-in

I chose to check in online using my iPhone and it was a bit messy. Every time I tried I either got the directions in French or I kept being directed back to the French Bee home page. I received a text from the airline on the day of my departure offering online check-in and this time it worked.

I stood in a long TSA line at Newark-Liberty (EWR) that took about 30 minutes since only one person was checking ID and only one checkpoint was open. Unfortunately French Bee is not one of the 80 airlines that participate in the TSA PreCheck program. And Clear is only available at Newark's Terminal C.

When I put my phone on the checker I got the dreaded red light — which meant TSA couldn't read the French Bee QR code boarding pass. The woman told me I had to get a paper pass and that she'd let me back in without having to wait again.

I went to the check-in counter which was crowded. I spoke to someone who was guiding people explained my situation and she told me I could use the kiosk. The only problem was French Bee wasn't one of the airlines so she took me to a short customer service line where I got my pass quickly.

I went back to the TSA checkpoint to the front of the line as ordered. By that time they had a second person checking passes and after a short wait I went through screening.

Celebrating the inaugural

There really wasn't much of a celebration. There was a sign at the gate announcing the start and there were women handing out French and American flags.

Boarding was chaotic with staff giving different instructions and no clear line markers or boarding priority signs. Instead there were unmarked stanchions for those in wheelchairs and those with children under age six. There were also unmarked stanchions for premium customers and priority boarding (which I paid for); I just happened to be in the right place at the right time. It led to people pushing up to the gate to board with no rhyme or reason.

They boarded about half the wheelchairs and families with children then stopped to board the premium and priority boarding customers. We stood on the jet bridge for about seven minutes -- with no explanation -- before we were allowed to board. We were greeted by crew handing out hand sanitizer.

Passengers continued to board the flight in what appeared to be random order well after our 10:55 p.m. departure time. The aircraft doors finally closed at almost midnight and finally took off at 1:00 a.m. EDT. The delay was blamed on FAA traffic management initiatives at Newark.

The flight was on a brand-new A350 in tighter 3-4-3 configuration which can definitely feel cramped when fully booked. I paid extra to get seat 27C on the left side of the plane because it was right over the wing. And at the time I booked it there was no one booked in the other two seats. Miraculously I managed to have a whole row to myself which was nice because it was a pretty full flight. Even the flight attendant commented on my luck having a row to myself.

I'm a big fan of the A350's overhead bins. They are deep and roomy and I had no trouble fitting my Away Expanded Carry-on inside. The seats had the winged headrests which are always nice for sleeping. There were blankets but no pillows (not that I ever used them in economy before the pandemic).

The aircraft had two power outlets and two USB ports under my row of three. My adapter easily fit in and stayed put. There was also a USB port at the bottom of the setback screen which was handy for charging my iPhone and iPad.

There was a nice selection of 76 American and French movies including ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" ""Promising Young Woman"" the French thriller ""Une Affaire de Détails"" and the comedy ""Comme des Garçons."" There was also a mix of American and global music along with games such as Sudoku.

The pickings were slim with television programming with only around 20 choices. Oddly enough there were only two or three episodes of each show to watch which meant missing out on an ideal opportunity for a binge-watching session for those who can't sleep on overnight flights.

After take-off we were given an amenity pack that included socks a sleep mask and a meal voucher.

The good news is that the airline offers its branded iZiWi-Fi at four different levels. The bad news was that it didn't work that well for me foiling my plans to do some writing onboard the flight. The flight attendant I called for help was apologetic but couldn't seem to help. My across-the-aisle neighbor even tried to help to no avail.

(Screenshot courtesy of French Bee)

There were two food menus -- Dining and Le Blue Cafe. The dining menu was a list of the meals served on the flight depending on your destination and time of day. Le Blue Cafe was snacks sandwiches soups soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. For 10 euros (USD$11.80) you could purchase a drink combo of two small bottles of Jack Daniels two cans of Coca Cola and a can of Pringles potato chips. For the same amount you could also buy a tapas plate of meats and cheeses paired with a glass of red or white wine.

Because the flight was so late there was no evening meal offered. So I paid $7.75 for a bag of cashews and a bottled water and watched downloaded content on my iPad.

We were served breakfast about two hours before landing. The meal was a soft croissant with jelly and butter along with potatoes eggs a sausage and a pack of Oreo cookies which was pretty bland for a French carrier. No coffee was available. But in celebration of the inaugural flight champagne was offered to anyone who wanted a glass.

Right before we landed the flight attendant asked those who had U.S. and French flags to wave them as we landed.

Getting through French Customs was pretty simple. They were fine accepting a photo of my COVID-19 vaccination card.

Bottom line

This flight was a long time coming and despite some major hiccups we made it to Paris. It's nice that U.S. travelers have yet another option -- and low cost at that -- between New York and Paris. Personally I was absolutely thrilled to be traveling out of the country again.

However French Bee still has some work to do to improve the passenger experience. It needs to become part of TSA PreCheck work on a smoother boarding process and do a better job of explaining the availability of meals.

U.S. travelers who like flying on Spirit Airlines know that there are tricks to avoiding fees such as not paying for a particular seat traveling with only a free under-seat bag packing your own food filling up a water bottle before boarding and going for priority boarding. These tricks can be used on French Bee too.

Budget travelers don't mind doing these things to keep their fare on French Bee as low as possible so if you choose to fly on the low-cost carrier know what you're getting before you pay for your flight. Boarding was chaotic (although I'm hoping that will improve as the airline gets more flights under its belt) they didn't serve dinner the 3-4-3 seating configuration is pretty tight there's no TSA PreCheck and the Wi-Fi didn't work on my flight. It isn't my favorite way to travel (as seen by my purchases) but French Bee is an option for those wanting to go to Paris as cheaply as possible -- especially if they manage to iron out the kinks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9nYXJ1ZGEtbG9zcy0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garuda Indonesia Faces $2.4bn Loss,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9nYXJ1ZGEtbG9zcy0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vb3BpbmlvbnMvZml2ZS1yZWFzb25zLXdoeS1pbnRlcmNvbm5lY3Rpb24td2lsbC1jb250aW51ZS10by1ncm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five reasons why interconnection will continue to grow,"Sponsored

Organizations running hybrid multi-cloud IT - ie: almost all of them - need fast reliable low-latency interconnections to keep up with always-growing traffic

Everyone knows that users connect to data centers and clouds over the public internet. But data centers cloud providers colocation facilities and even edge infrastructure sites need more than simple connections to deliver seamless predictable responsiveness. They need an overlapping mesh of connections. Or to put it simply interconnection.

Your data center might be state-of-the-art but what about the interconnection?

Today most organizations have more than one data center most use more than one cloud and many are evolving toward hybrid multi-cloud infrastructures that span many sites across many countries. Data suggests that around 40 percent of organizations’ workloads run in a combination of private and hybrid cloud while the remaining 60 percent is split evenly between public cloud and internal infrastructures. That means there is a significant amount of network traffic criss-crossing between data centers cloud providers cloud customers and ultimately users. Therein lies the challenge for organizations operating these hybrid infrastructures. More often than not the public internet isn’t fast responsive or reliable enough to keep up with the traffic.

That's why having the right interconnection strategy is critical. If your organization operates on a hybrid model a viable interconnection strategy ensures that you can distribute workloads across your entire infrastructure. So instead of disparate nodes you get an integrated resilient mesh. Those are the broad strokes of why interconnection still matters and will only continue to grow in importance for businesses. Here are five use cases to consider:

Cloud Connectivity

When surveyed for Flexera's 2021 State of the Cloud report 92 percent of respondents reported having a multi-cloud strategy while 82 percent said they are taking a hybrid approach using a mix of public and private clouds. This figure underscores the scale of network traffic moving in and out of the cloud. If your organization needs to leverage private secure connections from the data center to major cloud service providers for compute storage network and other services without going over the public internet you need to ensure that the connection is absolutely reliable. Multi-cloud connectivity

As you can see from the statistics above most organizations use multiple clouds in their infrastructure. While 49 percent of respondents to the Flexera survey reported that they silo workloads in different clouds many (around one-third) are using more advanced architectures that require workload mobility that span public and private clouds. Cloud redundancy

In the event of a major disaster (natural or otherwise) individual connections may go offline. Interconnection enables business continuity by creating redundant connections from the data center to a single cloud service provider across different geographic regions. Data center interconnection

Flexible pricing models interconnected high-speed connectivity and the ability for users to connect to their own distributed infrastructure make colocation data centers attractive for a wide range of applications such as backups disaster recovery workload distribution and more. That's why many organizations opt for data centers for latency-sensitive applications that require processing to be as close to the point of delivery as possible like edge computing and IoT environments. B2B private connectivity

Organizations often need to connect from their colocation data center to partners or vendors over a private and secure connection. Interconnection enables the fastest data exchange between two or more entities by combining high-performance networks with physical proximity. Using direct connections also bypasses the unpredictable and potentially insecure public internet. What does that mean for you? These are not in fact discrete use cases. Any given modern IT infrastructure will likely need to account for at least a few if not all of these use cases. Chances are that as the pace of digital transformation ramps up so too will the need to modernize and re-architect technology stacks. These updated tech stacks will need to include intelligent infrastructure (i.e. a shift from traditional WAN to SD-WAN) globally interconnected data centers (i.e. exiting legacy data centers with no interconnection or cloud connectivity strategy) and adopting cloud and hybrid multi-cloud strategies. This means that interconnection will need to be front-and-center in any IT strategy.

And surprisingly we are not even talking about a mass weapon as a threat here. The potential threat recent findings have warned us against is–Purcell’s hunter slug or caterpillar slug which could become an invasive species attacking western and Peninsula India the study added. The slug (Laevicaulis haroldi– first described in 1980) entered India around 2010-2012 accidentally through international trade via Mumbai. It has been listed as an endangered species and reportedly feeds on leaves and barks of mulberry plants. Not much we know as of now about this species but it has been spotted on neem trees calotropis and papaya plants. There are now 60 records of this species from all over the country.

The distribution of this species has been studied with the help of the Biodiversity Portal iNaturalist website and other relevant past studies by Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE). Additionally they have also studied future climate change scenarios to understand and explain the places which could be vulnerable to the slug attack. “We have used two scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 (on the scale of best and worst case scenario) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)” Aravind N.A Corresponding author and Associate Professor at ATREE was quoted as saying in the Indian Express report. “2.6 here is the best-case scenario where emissions and anthropogenic could be limited upto a certain extent.

About the economic loss

This invasive species has cost nearly $1.3 trillion dollars to the global economy (since 1970) and an average of $26.8 billion per year suggest reports. Several studies have also pointed out that invasive species are responsible for the extinction of native and endemic species on the planet. According to Dr Aravind predators and prey evolve together in a locality and when a new species takes birth there is no one to consume/eat it or keep a check on it. He also added that this kind of species thrives as they don’t have major predators in the newly grown region.

Early detection is the key

The early detection and control are key for managing newly introduced species before they become invasive the report suggested. We need to spread a word and awareness among the forest managers agriculturists horticulturists and farmers to detect manage and control this newly found species. A strict quarantine in the ports should also come into play to avoid further introductions concluded the paper.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmVnb25saXZlLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxLzA3L29yZWdvbi1zaWx2ZXJzcG90LWJ1dHRlcmZseS1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLWNvbnRpbnVlcy10by1kZWNsaW5lLWxlYXZpbmctcmVzZWFyY2hlcnMtcHV6emxlZC5odG1s0gGaAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9yZWdvbmxpdmUuY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50LzIwMjEvMDcvb3JlZ29uLXNpbHZlcnNwb3QtYnV0dGVyZmx5LXBvcHVsYXRpb24tY29udGludWVzLXRvLWRlY2xpbmUtbGVhdmluZy1yZXNlYXJjaGVycy1wdXp6bGVkLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oregon silverspot butterfly population continues to decline leaving researchers puzzled,"Erica Henry carefully lifts the netting from the side of the small improvised tent and squirms underneath.

Once partly inside she begins to poke among the grasses and tiny wild violets in search of rare caterpillars transplanted weeks earlier from a special breeding program at the Oregon Zoo.

That caterpillar carries the hopes and efforts of state and federal agencies the zoo and dozens of other partners to keep the Oregon silverspot butterfly from extinction.

The silverspot is found naturally in two fields south of Yachats on Mount Hebo and Cascade Head in Oregon and near Lake Earl in California’s Del Norte County.

Henry estimates 200 butterflies will emerge this summer from the grass fields near Yachats.

Researchers with the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service have been have been studying and trying to revive the declining population of the Oregon silverspot since 1980 when it was put on the federal threatened species list.

The effort has increased this year focusing on the habitat at Rock Creek and Brays Point in an effort to determine how to best manage the coastal fields that are the only home to the butterfly.

Despite 30 years of effort the numbers of silverspots in the wild – as far as researchers can determine – continues to decline. The question is why?

“We need to figure out why our management is not influencing the silverspot” said Deanna Williams head biologist for the Siuslaw National Forest. “We’re trying to turn this around with science guiding some of our management.”

And that’s why researchers are concentrating on the fields south of Yachats this summer.

“This is the first time we’ve tried to do this type of research in the wild in their natural habitat” said Michele Zwartjes the field supervisor of the USF&WS office in Newport. “We are really ramping up our efforts to increase our understanding of the butterfly — and the research you’re witnessing is a part of that effort.”

The silverspot once ranged from the Long Beach peninsula in southwest Washington to northern California. But when it was first listed as endangered in 1980 its only known location were on two “salt-spray” meadows overlooking the ocean near Rock Creek south of Yachats.

Wild populations were subsequently discovered nearby at Brays Point and on Mount Hebo Cascade Head and the Clatsop Plains south of the Columbia River. Over the years the butterfly disappeared from the Clatsop Plains and Long Beach peninsula.

In 2017-18 two experimental populations were established at Saddle Mountain in Clatsop County and the Nestucca Bay National Wildlife Refuge using caterpillars and butterflies from the Oregon Zoo’s breeding program.

Mount Hebo has the most robust population measured in an “index” that indicates the numbers over time and is considered to be less than the actual population. The 2020 index had 1423 silverspots at Mount Hebo 190 at Rock Creek 18 at Brays Point and just three at Cascade Head.

The Fish & Wildlife Service says the butterfly is vulnerable to extinction because of the small size and isolation the habitat-friendly sites. These open meadows were never common the agency wrote in 2001 but created by Native American tribes or salt-laden winds grazing or controlled burning.

It is that habitat at Rock Creek and Brays Point that agency researchers are more intensely focusing on this year.

“It’s such a tricky place. There’s so much wind sometimes” says Henry a post-doctoral researcher with Washington State University who spent the last 10 years on the East Coast studying endangered butterflies.

Making the Oregon silverspot population even more fragile is that its life cycle revolves around a single host plant – the early blue violet. The small plant is the only flower on which the butterfly larvae can successfully feed and develop.

After learning how to successfully augment the butterfly population with the zoo’s hatchery program more attention is now focused on habitat improvement – including transplanting patches of violets mowing and cutting back or removing invasive grasses.

“If you change the structure of the meadow does that alter survival?” Henry asks. “That’s what we’re trying to determine.”

While the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is the lead agency to keep the silverspot from extinction it has help – up to 30 different agencies or groups. The U.S. Forest Service Oregon State Parks and Recreation the Oregon Zoo in Portland and Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle the Nature Conservancy and local soil and water conservation districts are all involved.

In addition to Henry and field technicians the Newport office has a lead biologist focused on the silverspot and is now sharing a habitat restoration specialist with the Forest Service.

The USF&WS’s regional office in Portland was unable to provide an estimate of the yearly cost of the conservation effort but the agency’s 2001 conservation plan estimated the effort from 2001 to 2019 would cost $14 million.

“This is what the Endangered Species Act is meant to do … it’s not something that we decided was important but that the American public has said through their support of the act” said Zwartjes. “And it’s not just the Oregon silverspot butterfly … we’re losing the coastal native grasslands. The effort to help the silverspot also helps other species.”

The story of the Oregon silverspot is unusual. This is where it gets even more so.

From 1980 to 2020 there was only one – yes one – silverspot caterpillar detected in the wild by a human. Yet researchers could see and count butterflies when they emerged in the summer.

Williams was using a specialty dog service based in eastern Washington to search for droppings of the rare Pacific Marten when she asked if they could train the dogs to detect caterpillar poop – called “frass.” The answer was yes.

A trained rescue dog from Rogue Detection Teams first worked the Rock Creek fields in 2015 but because it was a severe drought year the dog was “indicating” caterpillars in unusual areas Williams said. While researchers could not spot the actual caterpillars she said they were able to find signs they had been feeding on blue violets.

This year a detection dog returned to Rock Creek in late May helping Williams and other researchers confirm 13 caterpillars over four days.

“Remember there had been just one caterpillar found in the wild since 1980” Williams said. “This helps us determine what kind of habitat in which they are successful.”

The butterfly emerges from the caterpillar’s chrysalis in late summer and begins feeding on nearby flowering plants. In a few weeks the silverspot lays 200 or so eggs the size of sesame seeds near the blue violets. The eggs hatch in about 16 days and tiny larvae travel a short distance to find a suitable spot where they hibernate and try to survive the winter.

If they survive the larvae awake in the early spring and begin to feed. As they grow they go through five molts – shedding their outer covering – before they enter their adult stage and form the chrysalis. About two weeks later the silverspot emerges begins feeding on flower nectar possibly find a mate and begin the process all over.

“They’re always here” Henry says. “Their whole lifecycle is in these meadows.”

Henry’s job this summer is to collect data from the fields at Rock Creek and on Brays Point.

In one field the Siuslaw National Forest cleared grasses and planted dozens of blue violets. In the adjacent field patches of grass were mowed during the fall.

Several weeks ago Henry erected tents that she designed – PVC pipes in an X-shape that form a half-dome four feet wide on each side. She sewed the netting herself and then used 3-inch medical bandages filled with sand to anchor the sides.

That’s what motorists on nearby U.S. Highway 101 are seeing to the west as they travel between Yachats and Florence.

Sixteen of the tents are at Rock Creek six in the new violet patches and 10 in the meadows. Ten more are on the steep hillside of Brays Point’s high above the highway.

“It’s the first year we’ve used the dome tents” Henry says and therefore “There’s a lot of troubleshooting involved.”

The Oregon Zoo has been raising Oregon silverspots for 20 years – think fish hatchery except with butterflies – and each spring delivers 1-inch caterpillars and in late July hundreds of butterflies to the coastal meadows and hopes for the best.

But this year seven caterpillars were released inside each of Henry’s tents so their development can be tracked – do they do best in the field of transplanted violets or in the mix of grasses and violets or in areas where grasses have been trimmed?

“Things in the wild operate quite differently” Henry says based on temperature wind and available plants. “They have to work a little harder.”

Last week the first “wild” butterflies emerged from the grasses Henry said but there are none yet from the zoo-raised caterpillars inside the tents.

“We saw butterflies flying so we know there’s wild butterflies out there now” she said.

Once more butterflies emerge in late July and August Henry and two technicians will be in the two fields seven days a week counting and marking – yes with a fine-point Sharpie – wild and zoo-raised butterflies to study their movement. They will also capture some to send to the zoo for the breeding program.

The fields at Rock Creek and Brays Point are the only ones where research is taking place this summer.

“We wanted to start small” Henry says. “There’s hope that if this works we can expand it across the range.”

And what is learned at Rock Creek and Brays Point is designed to provide science to help the Forest Service manage thousands of acres of coastal lands it oversees.

“It’s a systems thing” said Williams. “The silverspot has been telling us that the coastal systems are struggling. We have to understand all the pieces so we can help save the larger system.”

Williams said the detection of caterpillars this spring and wild butterflies spotted already this summer is a good sign.

“We’re discovering there is enough food out there for caterpillars” she said. “It’s giving us hope that we haven’t lost Rock Creek yet … we just have to be more targeted in how we manage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlYWZpZS5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlcy9kYW5rLWJha2VyeS1lZGlibGVzLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interview with Pablo Chocobar founder of Dank Bakery,"Haven’t heard of Dank Bakery? Where have you been hiding? These seriously talented chefs have been causing spontaneous drooling across the internet for a couple of years now. We’re big fans in the leafie office so we had to find out more.

Hey Pablo thanks for sitting down with us for those who don’t know Dank Bakery tell us about the brand.

Nice to meet you guys! We’re an infusion bakery specialising in medicinal bakes and confectionary – enjoying the widespread cannabis adoption in the UK and helping as many people as we can with natural alternatives to modern pain relief.

The level of your bakes is a fair bit higher than the average kitchen brownies. Did you work in catering before opening Dank?

Our full team have all come from culinary backgrounds so we hold high standards in our kitchen. This also extends to our operational crew – we really want to bring forward a level of professionalism to this underground industry – especially in terms of the retail experience and customer service. Our main goal is to provide a trustworthy destination for medicinal bakes and confectionery.

Outside of the slightly more underground products you recently did a CBD rich collab with SIOP in NQ. Any more high street link-ups in the plans?

We loved the collab with Siop and we have a few more plans in the pipeline – it’s going to be an exciting few months/year ahead and we hope the regulations keep up with us!

Psychedelics are having a much-needed renaissance as we all try and process the madness of COVID. Any plans to branch out into some artisan mushroom chocolates?

Mushrooms are definitely the future! Their medicinal benefits are undeniable especially their use in depression and mental health issues. It’s ambitious to speculate mushrooms becoming mainstream anytime soon in the UK so mushroom treats are just for the personal collection. Having said that we’re following the breakthroughs in the US closely but for now it’s best for us to focus on helping all our current medicinal customers.

Speaking of COVID you seemed to be the saviours of lockdown how was it keeping business running while the world ground to a halt?

It was definitely challenging. Our team was a fraction of the size and we were getting battered with supply and delivery issues near enough every day. Very stressful – but we vowed to stay open through the entire time and we managed to do that!

We actually want to give a big shout out to everyone who stayed with us through that time considering how long some of the wait times were. Our process is now incredibly streamlined and our team is much bigger and stronger so we can deal with the odd issue from time to time. And hearing feedback about our products helping with people’s mental health issues made all the stress worthwhile.

Your menus are always changing keeping the feed looking fresh and tasty. Where do you get your ideas?

That’s what we’re here for! We love developing and bringing new products to the market – it’s especially important for our medicinal clients we want to make fun and nostalgic products that are also helping people. As well as new products the consistency of our regular items is equally important.

Our business was built off the back of the items such as OG brownies and more recently DB gummies which have become incredibly popular. Regarding the classics – brownies and cookies have that inherent marketability – everyone wants an infused brownie or cookie. It’s also so ingrained in popular culture we really wanted before anything else to make sure these staples were the best they could possibly be. A lot of work has gone into this: taste; texture; stability in delivery; and shelf life. The same goes for our confectionary development – finding popular items with a long shelf life so you can consume them on your own time.

And in terms of our new ideas we have amazing development chefs who create these fun and delicious creations. The new menu should be an experience for our customers – looking forward to the next drop and making sure they don’t miss out. It’s really important to keep innovating and moving forward regardless of the underground nature of the industry.

Cannabis would be nothing without music what’s playing in the kitchen at the minute?

Radio 6 all day every day. Big shout out to Techno Tuesdays! When the radio’s not on it’s a pretty eclectic mix. We’ve been working like crazy so we’re itching to get out to a proper night – there are some big parties booked in to look forward to!!

Finally Chronic the Caterpillar is the party cake of our dreams. Will he be around much longer or have the M&S suits gone all Aldi on you?

Unfortunately he was only on for two weeks – and the demand was crazy so he’ll defo be back at some point soon!"

Thick clouds and thunder claps began supplanting the usual clear-skied view of surrounding desert expanse in Barstow around 7 p.m. Sunday. For almost an hour from there powerful rains and winds swarmed the city — throwing dumpster-lids wide open blowing debris across streets and inconveniencing anyone who happened to be outdoors at the time.

A monsoon flow moved from the mountains near Big Bear during the day dumping an estimated 1.6 inches of rain just east of the community. It then continued north through Barstow which saw nearly an inch of rain National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Tardy told the Daily Press. He added that it was “not the first thunderstorm of summer” for the area “but the most significant.”

The weather caused brief power outages in and around Barstow but services such as Internet were restored during the evening according to Charter Communications spokesperson Pam Collazo.

Barstow Fire Protection District responded to “several calls” for power lines brought down by the monsoon “as well as some flooding along with trees and roofing blown off or over” Battalion Chief Nick DiNapoli said in a text message.

Barstow resident Linda Ponce posted the resulting damage to her property in a local Facebook group Monday morning. What used to be a rock yard is now a thin layer of dirt. Thick utility cables that should be completely submerged instead bulge out to the naked eye. Parts of her RV were torn off by the wind too and she told the Daily Press that many roof tiles were also ripped from the front of her house.

Earlier in the day the NWS forecast for the Barstow-Daggett Airport region painted a different picture for the evening. As of 12:54 p.m. the agency’s website predicted a 40% chance of showers and thunderstorms until 4 p.m. and a 20% chance of such conditions in the evening.

The most recently updated NWS data shows that throughout the prior three days visibility in the Barstow area was consistent at 10 miles meaning a person standing in the city could see far out into the desert with clear conditions. Then suddenly as of 6:39 p.m. Sunday visibility plunged to 3 miles in the span of 40 minutes.

Most High Desert communities situated south and southwest of Barstow avoided the monsoon's intense conditions.

A doppler radar shot provided by Tardy visualizes the discrepancy as of 7:13 p.m. with a blanket of red and bright orange signifying strong rainfall above Barstow and lighter shades of green over Victorville and Hesperia to the south.

A monsoon is a weather pattern that occasionally occurs in unique locations and intensities from July to September each year usually in one-to-two-day spurts but sometimes lasting as long as a week according to Tardy.

Monsoon flows bring the moisture needed for powerful rains and often carry thunderstorms with them.

When Krispy Kreme went out of business social media was abuzz that Chipotle would be moving into the vacated space. Instead that space is becoming a Chase Bank. But fear not Chipotle lovers there is a new location headed to Saco and it appears to be coming with a friend.

According to Saco Bay News the Saco City Council approved a contract zone that will allow a developer to turn the abandoned Pizza Hut location at 507 Main Street into a multi-unit commercial property that will include a new Chipotle location as well as a New Jersey Mike's Subs location. The contract zone granted to the developer also allows for a unit to feature a drive-thru. It's unclear whether Chipotle would feature a drive-thru or if another new business could join the building and utilize the drive-thru.

Saco and Biddeford is likely to welcome Chipotle with open arms. After repeated rumors and disappointment fans of the fast-casual restaurant will finally get their wish. But before you start planning a burrito party you'll be waiting for a bit before the location actually opens. As of this writing there was no firm timetable as to when Chipotle or Jersey Mike's will open in Saco. There are currently six Chipotle locations in Maine and only one Jersey Mike's operating in the state.

Swanson on a broad range of U.S. agricultural market issues restaurant reservations Conagra’s earnings outlook CPG inflation and more.

Wells Fargo Economist Addresses State of U.S. Agriculture

In a recent episode of The Food Institute Podcast Wells Fargo agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson discussed how current market conditions like record heat extreme drought and supply chain constraints are affecting farmers.

Swanson said the hot and dry summer will hurt crop yields across much of the nation but farmers experienced in navigating serious weather challenges should be able to weather the storm. Regulatory and supply chain issues however may prove to be more significant obstacles.

Transportation Storage Issues Press on Growers

Rising transportation costs are among the top problems facing farmers with operators forced to either absorb price increases or pass them along to customers the economist noted. Additionally farmers are losing opportunities to ship to international markets with container supplies limited and highly priced.

Swanson also said pandemic-related constraints depleted reserve stocks of key commodities which some operators did not see coming and COVID-19 exposed vulnerabilities in the “just-in-time” system of inventory management. While the system works well when fully primed it does not do well with shocks as showcased in 2020.

Effects of Heat and Drought in California

Swanson said California’s current situation is dire because its agricultural system was not designed to handle years without sufficient snowpack. The situation has only worsened under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.

In years past farmers would be able to rely on subsurface water extraction for irrigation needs but under the legislation they quite literally cannot return to that well. As such some agricultural producers have opted to fallow land.

Swanson also said that some farmers are buying properties or utilizing existing farmland with water rights in order to divert irrigation to their most profitable crops. However with the water situation unlikely to improve in the years to come he said production in California could plateau which may require a reassignment of resources among farmers in the region.

More About Dr. Michael J. Swanson:

Michael Swanson is an agricultural economist and consultant for Wells Fargo. His responsibilities include analyzing the impact of energy on agriculture and strategic analysis for key agricultural commodities and livestock sectors. His focus includes the systems analysis of consumer food demand and its linkage to agribusiness.

Chipotle  Target  WWE and Shopify are among the companies teaming up with TikTok Resumes a pilot program that lets job candidates submit video resumes on the social platform. The recruitment offering is yet another way for companies to connect with potential employees as the war for talent rages on.

Restaurants bars and fast-food chains are finding it especially hard to hire staff to replace those let go at the beginning of the pandemic. Many of these workers are either not comfortable returning to the profession and are still on the sidelines or have left the industry completely.

Marissa Andrada the chief people officer for Chipotle says the restaurant chain already had 1.6 million followers on TikTok when it considered the idea of partnering with the platform on video resumes.

""We have a crazy brand following and it's always great to see what fan videos are about"" Andrada said.

Since the majority of employees in Chipotle restaurants are Gen Z and millennials ""why not lean into their energy?"" Andrada said. ""TikTok Resumes is a way to engage with them in a way they already like to connect with us.""

With the rise of career and job-related content on social media platforms Andrada said that letting people show off their creativity is an effective way for the company to find the right talent.

A New York man has been arrested for allegedly trying to snatch a five-year-old boy off a city street.

The child’s mother fought back and was able to drag her son through the open window of a car after he was bundled into the vehicle in Queens.

Police say the driver was caught on video getting out of the car before grabbing the boy and forcing him into it.

Queens resident James McGonagle 24 has been arrested and charged with attempted kidnapping reckless endangerment and acting in a manner injurious to a child.

NYC: We need your help identifying these guys. They attempted to kidnap a 5-year-old yesterday in front of 117-02 Hillside Avenue in Queens around 8:00 pm.

Dolores Diaz Lopez said she was taking her children to see her husband at work when the man who is a complete stranger grabbed her little boy.

“I said ‘Oh my God my kids oh my God my boy’” she told ABC7. “I don’t know why that happened. I didn’t see those people ever.

“You have to do what’s necessary no matter what. The car was just parked there. I would never have imagined that a man would get out of the car and grab my son. You always have to be aware of your surroundings and not be on your phone.”

When several passers-by approached the car the man who was in the car with a second suspect fled the scene. No-one was injured in the incident.

The suspect was later arrested at Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn when officers attending on an unrelated matter recognised him from video of the incident. The suspect was at the hospital seeking treatment. Police say the suspect underwent an evaluation at the hospital.

A second suspect in the car has not yet been arrested. Authorities described him as a light-skinned man approximately 50 to 60 years old and was wearing glasses an orange shirt blue jeans and black shoes.",,,

The Cleveland Browns will be an interesting team for fantasy football players to assess but Nick Chubb continues to be reliable for fantasy production.

The Browns will be a difficult team for fantasy owners to make decisions related to both sides of the ball. The defense is talented on paper but is relying on a lot of new players and some very young ones. The Browns also face some of the best quarterbacks in the league this season making their defense less stable in fantasy.

On the offensive side of the ball there is a lot of talent but not a lot of certainties. Baker Mayfield played well last season but is a quarterback in a run-first offense. Odell Beckham Jr. is explosive but hasn’t really clicked with Mayfield and is returning from a major knee injury. The rest of the Browns pass catchers including Jarvis Landry have talent but are either not explosive or won’t get a ton of targets to make them highly valuable in fantasy football.

It is at running back that the Browns may have the most fantasy value but even there have some limits. Chubb is paired with Kareem Hunt in the Cleveland backfield. Last year with Chubb missing four games due to injury the pair almost evenly split 388 carries. The previous season Hunt only played in eight games but had 80 touches in that short span.

How the Browns split carries could greatly impact the duo’s fantasy value but Chubb’s ability to break long runs with limited carries is a positive sign:

2020 Leaders in Gash % (Percentage of runs to go for 10+ yards) — (Powered by @FTNData) ◾️Nick Chubb (17.9%)

◾️Jonathan Taylor (15.1%)

◾️Alvin Kamara (15.0%)

◾️J.K. Dobbins (14.9%)

With less than 200 carries in 2020 Chubb made a lot out of a little. For fantasy football owners this information is encouraging that Chubb could be in for a breakout season despite Hunt’s presence. If Chubb can stay healthy for the entire season and garner closer to 260 carries he could be in line to be the top back in the league in 2021 if he keeps his “gash %” high.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWF0dC1jaGFuZGxlci1yZWZsZWN0cy1vbi1ncmFjZS1oZS1yZWNlaXZlZC1hZnRlci1jb250cm92ZXJzeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy,"Home News Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy

Matt Chandler has opened up about what he learned about grace and accountability after being restored to the pulpit following a tumultuous period in 2022 in which he took a leave of absence from teaching and preaching at The Village Church in Flower Mound Texas.

In August 2022 Chandler announced to The Village Church congregation which he has led since 2002 that he had an inappropriate online relationship with a woman and would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from preaching and teaching.

Though the relationship was not sexual or romantic Chandler said church elders deemed the messages exchanged over Instagram ""unguarded and unwise"" and ""revealed something unhealthy in me.""

""We cannot be a church where anyone is above the scriptures and above the high heavenly call into Christ Jesus"" Chandler said adding he agreed with the elder's assessment. ""The Word of God holds me to a certain standard. And I fell short.""

He was restored to the pulpit a little over three months later following a ""profound time of healing.""

In an interview with The Christian Post the 49-year-old husband and father-of-three reflected on that time and said that when he ""stumbled"" he was instantly met with grace and accountability from those around him.

""The thing about [2022] in particular was that the kind of culture we had tried to build here — one of accountability and a higher standard for a person in public ministry — held strong"" Chandler explained. ""When I stumbled I was met with both grace and accountability.""

For Chandler — who has made messages on God's grace a hallmark of his ministry — the experience solidified the notion that grace is not an abstract concept but a tangible force that exists alongside the weight of accountability.

He credited his church's transparent handling of the controversy with allowing his congregation to witness the reality of both concepts in action; they saw firsthand he said that while grace offers forgiveness there is often a price for missteps.

In the aftermath Chandler observed that the church community became more willing to confess their struggles taking proactive steps to address what he described as ""little lions"" or small issues that could grow into significant problems if left unchecked.

""What that produced in our congregation is another visible picture that that grace is real and that there is still at times a payment for stumbling that is costly in other areas"" he said.

""We have seen since people are more apt to confess more quickly … we have seen a tremendous amount of trust in the processes we have in place to deal with those kinds of things in the lives of people. And so that's been the fruit of that.""

Reflecting on the unique pressures of pastoral ministry Chandler who also serves as executive director of the church-planting network Acts 29 spoke candidly about the loneliness and mental health challenges often faced by spiritual leaders.

Chandler previously served as president of Acts 29 replacing Mark Driscoll who was later disqualified from leadership due to ""ungodly and disqualifying behavior.""

""I think I'm an outlier on this but I've never bought into that a pastor can't be close friends with the guys that he does ministry with"" he said.

Though acknowledging that stories of betrayal and sabotage from within the Church aren't uncommon Chandler said that throughout his ministry he's chosen to cultivate meaningful relationships with those around him.

""I've been involved at the highest level with church planning stuff the number of stories of men being betrayed and sabotaged by other people in the church or other staff members in the church is a very real thing. I'm just not built personality wise to want to do this by myself.""

At The Village Church — a Southern Baptist congregation — Chandler is one of three lead pastors. While his influence might be more visible due to his pulpit presence he emphasized that he has no greater vote in decision-making.

""I have done life deeply with a group of five guys that are on staff with me"" he said. ""Two of those relationships are over 15 years going now and the other ones are right at a decade. I have chosen to not give in to the 'I'm going to carry this thing by myself.' I'm going to invite guys into my life.""

For Chandler this network of trust has been critical particularly when it comes to the ups and downs of the ministry.

""I would encourage guys as best they can to create a strong circle of trust where they don't have to be the hero but can be human. And I say that because they are human"" he advised.

The pastor recently released his first book since returning to the pulpit The Overcomers highlighting how Revelation can help Christians find their ""identity and purpose in God's plan."" He cautioned against creating a culture where pastors are seen as infallible.

""If you create a world where you're the Messiah where you have all the answers you're making an already difficult situation impossible"" he stressed. ""I would encourage any pastor … to begin to create slowly but surely a circle of trust for him that's deeply honest and vulnerable for the good of his own soul.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RpZGFob25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvY2h1cmNoLWVtcGxveWVlLWFsbGVnZWRseS1zdGVhbHMtb3Zlci0zMzAwMDAtZnJvbS1wcmVzYnl0ZXJpYW4tY2h1cmNoLW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church employee allegedly steals over $330000 from Presbyterian church organization,"IDAHO FALLS — A 31-year-old church employee was arrested after she allegedly stole over $330000 from a local Presbyterian organization.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGhvbGljbmV3c2FnZW5jeS5jb20vbmV3cy8yNTc2NDIvb3J0aG9kb3gtY2h1cmNoLW9yZGFpbnMtZmVtYWxlLWRlYWNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Orthodox Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa ordains female deacon,"Ann Arbor Michigan May 9 2024 / 18:05 pm

The Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa ordained Zimbabwean Angelic Molen as a deaconess in the Orthodox Church. Taking place on May 2 Orthodox Holy Thursday the ordination was conducted at St. Nektarios Mission Parish near Harare Zimbabwe by the archbishop of Zimbabwe Metropolitan Serafim.

The St. Phoebe Center for the Deaconess a U.S.-based organization that has advocated for reviving the ancient female diaconate said in a press release that Molen’s ordination would prepare the way for the restoration of the role in other branches of the Orthodox Church. The group’s board chair Dr. Carrie Frost wrote: “Being the first to do anything is always a challenge but the Patriarchate of Alexandria has courageously chosen to lead the way with Metropolitan Serafim laying his hands on Deaconess Angelic.”

According to the release Molen said: “At first I was nervous about going into the altar but when Metropolitan Serafim blessed me to enter the altar as part of my preparation this week those feelings went away and I felt comfortable. I am ready.” According to the St. Phoebe Center Molen was well received by her community and parish.

“The Alexandrian Patriarchate in Africa felt the need to revive this order to serve the daily pastoral needs of Orthodox Christians in Africa” the release read. Metropolitan Serafim said that Molen will have both liturgical and pastoral roles. He said: “She is going to do what the deacon is doing in the liturgy and in all the sacraments in our Orthodox services.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 100 tires left on church property as vandals strike again,"We’re Sorry!

When she goes home each day to her house in the West End of Hartford she becomes the Disheveled Diva. The Diva is a chef who bakes and sells “purposefully imperfect” custom cakes and treats: jar cakes push pops cookie cakes cake bites.

Day is one of 545 people statewide getting a start in the food industry with the use of cottage permits which allow them to run micro businesses out of their homes.

“A cottage food license is really good for people who want to dip their toe in the water safely with low investment” said Day who started her business in September 2020. Cottage work is done in home kitchens so permittees don’t have to spend a lot to rent or build out commercial kitchens.

Cottage permittees are the smallest of small businesses. Their food work is often a side gig from their regular job. Anyone whose cottage business earns more than $25000 a year must move on to a commercial license. That is a goal for many permittees: to see if their products sell then move upward.

Day who donates a portion of her profits to charity wants to move upward with Disheveled Diva eventually becoming a consumer packaged goods company. But she’s taking her time. “I have big plans but it does not involve retiring from corporate America” she said. “I love my job.”

Success story

Kevin Masse isn’t retiring either. He still works for a publisher producing a baking magazine. On the side he runs Small State Provisions which started as a cottage business in 2019.

“West Hartford passed cottage legislation in 2019 because there is not a lot of incubator kitchens in our area” said Masse. “The failure rate for a new food business is extremely high and a big out-of-pocket expense. Cottage operators can build that audience following before moving onto the next phase.”

Masse is a success story. “I quickly outgrew my kitchen’s capacity and the revenue limit” he said. In June Masse moved into a small commercial kitchen inside West Hartford’s food truck hub GastroPark. Thursday to Sunday he makes sourdough bread granola scones cookies and chocolate babkas.

The clientele he built followed him to GastroPark. That following is especially large on Sundays when babkas are sold. “When I open at 9 a.m. there’s a line out the door and into the parking lot” he said.

Requirements

Kaitlyn Krasselt of the state Department of Consumer Protection said cottage applicants must fulfill several requirements before license approval.

“They have to get permission from their town. If they are on a well they need a water test from within three months or a copy of their water bill. They must complete food safety handler courses” she said.

“Then they can fill out an application and pay the fee. They will be contacted by a member of our team who will ask what kind of products they sell and how they will make them. They must show a sample label” she said. “After they get a license they have to get a business ID and register their business.”

State cottage permits which are renewed each February costs $50 a year Krasselt said. She said Norwalk and Waterbury are the state’s only two municipalities that do not allow cottage businesses.

Cottage-made foods must be shelf-stable; nothing requiring refrigeration is allowed Krasselt said. For that reason the cottage industry is dominated by bakers.

Zoning concerns

Some municipalities also may charge fees Krasselt said. West Hartford is one of them. Masse learned that when customers wanted to be able to pick up goods at his home rather than have them delivered.

Brittany Bermingham a zoning enforcement officer in West Hartford said a home occupation permit at $135 allows a cottage business to proceed without home pickup signs or additional employees. A special exception permit at $430 allows a sign up to two outside employees and on-site pickup.

“It’s about being in a residential zone and having people coming to that home” Bermingham said.

Waterbury City Planner Bob Nerney said that city’s decision not to allow cottage businesses is rooted in zoning concerns “the potential for people to come onto a property on a potentially unregulated basis.”

Access to child care

Stefanie Robles facilitates the Food Incubator program at reSET a Hartford-based mentorship program for emerging small businesses. Many clients in the Food Incubator start with cottage permits. Robles said in addition to the financial advantages cottagers can juggle child care and building their business.

“When working from home it allows for a different level of flexibility and access to care” Robles said. “If you only can get child care on certain hours you can build your business around those hours.”

Stephanie Thomacos of Enfield started cottaging to make some money while staying home with her kids. Thomacos bakes macaroons and dacquoise cakes under the name Mama’s Macs. She sells at farmers markets in Ellington and Coventry and at Brignole Vineyards in East Granby.

Thomacos’ creations have become so popular that now she needs to move up to a commercial kitchen. “I can only make 1000 cookies every weekend. I usually sell out in the first hour at both markets and then people are disappointed” she said. “I’m sort of being forced to try to expand.”

Watch CNBC’s full interview with Cigna CEO David Cordani

David Cordani on Global Health Services Company:

We think at the core of our business we're a health services company we’re global health services company. And the most important thing we do every day is to try to help our customers – all 165 million of them around the world -- live healthier vibrant more productive lives. A big part of that is making health care affordable and predictable. So we think with the outcome of any dimension of the election affordability improved predictability at the individual level and then working to simplify programs is going to be mission critical under any dimensional that manifests itself politically. And we've positioned our company to continue to drive towards that.

David Cordani on Durability:

We've delivered in excess of 40% TSR over the last ten years on average. So when you look at the longevity of that over an environment coming out of the financial recession going through the ACA dealing with geopolitical environments dealing with changes in the environments 40% TSR on average over an elongated period of time. The conversation—you have the short-term dynamic of ‘What might a legislative disruptive environment do to business models?’ As a company we've built the business to actually be quite durable.

David Cordani on Pointing Fingers:

There are tens of millions of individuals who are pre-diabetic in the United States today. They will become diabetic in the next few years. How do we help them avoid that in this first place? Through lifestyle management through diet through physical activity and supporting through medications. How do we align incentives around that? There is no one party in a $3.5 trillion industry that is the cause of all good or all bad. And we do not think that actually pointing a finger is a constructive way.

Watch CNBC’s full interview with Sarepta CEO Doug Ingram

SCOTT WAPNER: The biggest health care investing event is taking place in San Francisco right now. And Our Meg Tirrell is live at the JP Morgan Health Care Conference with the CEO of high-flying Sarepta Therapeutics. Meg it is all you.

MEG TIRRELL: Well Scott thank you so much. And Doug Ingram thank you for being here with us.

DOUG INGRAM: Thank you for having us. We appreciate it.

MEG TIRRELL: Of course the program that people are looking at closely with you is your gene therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy which could just be transformative for this devastating disease. Tell us about the timelines from an investor standpoint when you see this being de-risked and for a patient standpoint when this could potentially get on the market.

DOUG INGRAM: Well I think in one sense every day we are de-risking along the way. And we still have a lot to do at the same time. Just to remind us so we have a gene therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It relates to this disease that results in a lack of a protein called dystrophin which is a shock absorber in the muscles.

We are trying to literally insert into the muscles of these children a significantly truncated but still functional version of that same structural protein to try to keep them alive and keep them healthy.

And we just – we had a really fascinating and very significantly impressive data on first four children both in 2018 and 2019. And we started a study we call Study 102 which is a placebo-controlled trial. We just completed the dosing of all the children in that trial.

It’s about 41 children in that trial. We are going to start another trial if all goes well by around the middle of this year. And we could be in a position if we are successful to have a readout on those studies and apply for approval in the U.S. and around the world in 2021 or so.

MEG TIRRELL: And you are not the only company working in this space. Actually in the next hour we’re going to have the CEO of Pfizer joining us. And they’re also working on gene therapy for DMD. How do you compete with a behemoth like that?

DOUG INGRAM: Well a couple things. First of all we are really immodestly the experts in the natural history and the understanding of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. So I do believe we can do a very good job serving the community. And we have done that already. We have two therapies right now treating patients who have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I think it is a very positive signal when we see companies like Pfizer taking an interest in trying to advance therapies that might treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

It is one of those things that will give parents and patient a lot of hope that we are going to find solutions for them. With that said we are razor-focused on our therapies and our approach and we are very excited about the results we’ve seen to-date. And we are going to stay essentially head down executing getting our therapy out to those patients if it works as soon as possible.

MEG TIRRELL: And you’ve already got two drugs on the market for this disease. Which you know not as transformational as the gene-therapy in your pipeline. But you have to do a confirmatory study of your first drug because you got conditional approval from it from the FDA. And some folks have said the timelines are more delayed than expected. When can we see the readout?

DOUG INGRAM: So that read out will probably occur somewhere in the 2023 2024 range. We do have a confirmatory trial for Exondys ongoing right now. Essentially it is looking at our current therapy Exondys at 30 milligrams per kilogram versus a much higher dose of the same therapy to see which of those doses would be more beneficial to patients. And we are aggressively pursuing that. That is Exondys. That treats about 13% of the children with Muscular Dystrophy.

We received an approval in December of last year for a therapy called Vyondys. That treats another 8% of children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. And we’re already serving the community with Vyondys now.

And then we’ve just started a rolling submission and our goal is to get it approval as soon as possible hopefully this year for what’s called Casimersen another 8% of children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. So if we are successful by the end of this year we could be in a place where we have more than doubled the number of patients who are benefiting from our Morpholino technology this so called PMO that we have.

Watch Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla’s first TV interview with CNBC

Albert Bourla on New Pfizer:

Our new Pfizer the remaining Pfizer that will be 20% smaller in revenue retains this new base all the growth drivers and the entire pipeline. So now the company is becoming best in class revenue growth story sustainable for the long-term and with a balance sheet that is relatively unlevered. So I think we can do miracles.

Albert Bourla on Acquisitions:

We never say never to any opportunities. But strategically we are very interested in acquiring or in licensing phase two phase three projects. Projects that could get products in 2004 5 6 7. And in six therapeutic areas we are mastering. This is where we have the best scientists that they can select rightly make fewer mistakes in selection. But also they are the scientists that can develop the best products.

Albert Bourla on Policies:

Well I think our role it is not to focus on the politics but to focus on the policies. So whoever is in the administration and with both sides of the aisle we try to promote policies that are pro-innovation.

Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan Speaks with CNBC’s Meg Tirrell on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Today

Vasant Narasimhan on UK Deal / New Cholesterol Vaccine:

The idea here is with the UK government we signed a partnership that allows them to really work to drive a utilization of this medicine. It’s really hundreds of thousands of patients. It’s a pretty revolutionary agreement. It kind of takes population health of vaccine-based approach to cardiovascular disease. So we’re pretty excited.

Vasant Narasimhan on Cost Effective for UK / New Cholesterol Vaccine:

The UK government believes this will be a highly cost-effective intervention. I think that’s why they’re very excited about it. No numbers yet. But I think they believe this will be an important contributor to their ability to hit their targets to reduce cardiovascular disease.

Vasant Narasimhan on Drug Pricing:

We really commit to pricing our medicines in a value-based way. And being thoughtful about how we think about any pricing increases.",,,,,,,,,

Opinion contributor

We all sat in the living room staring into space not a word uttered among us. It was the loudest silence I had ever heard. This was the scene in my home hours after my family learned that my Uncle David had died by suicide.

The news came piece by piece. At first I was only told that he died suddenly. A number of hours later my mother informed me that it was suicide. Uncle David shot himself the night before while my Aunt Josefina and cousin Jamie were out of the house.

When the initial shock wore off after that first day filled with silence a new question entered our minds: What do we do now? For my aunt and cousin the path moving forward was full of uncertainty. The primary breadwinner of their family was gone and now deep financial hardship was added to their heartache. Everything from paying their mortgage to paying Jamie’s college tuition and even putting food on the table became a struggle. And to add insult to injury they would most likely not receive insurance due to Uncle David’s cause of death.

Additionally there were numerous logistical tasks to be done. The funeral was to be held soon in just a few days. We worked with the funeral home visited the cemetery where Uncle David would be laid to rest and planned the gathering after the funeral. We picked out black outfits. We wrote an obituary.

The planning seemed to keep everyone busy and pushed the grief temporarily aside so that the necessary work could be done. But on the morning of the funeral the loud silence returned as we all drove to the graveside service.

As I looked out around the grave I was struck by the size of the crowd and that’s when the scale of suicide made itself crystal clear. It reaches people in waves in layers that extend far beyond immediate family. It reaches in-laws friends co-workers neighbors teachers bosses childhood pals and so many others. Such a tragedy can crumble an entire ecosystem of people in a second leaving dozens at a loss for words facing the same deafening silence in their own homes that I experienced in mine. If it takes a village to raise a person it takes a village to mourn them too.

Unfortunately the scene I have described is familiar to far too many villages and too many families. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. showing the scale of the mental health crisis in this country and around the world. This crisis has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic as 4 out of 10 adults in the U.S. have reported experiencing anxiety or depression since the pandemic began.

The crisis is also compounded by the destructive stigma of mental illness which contributes to the desire to keep deaths by suicide a secret. When Uncle David died many of my family members felt not only sadness and shock but also embarrassment. They did not know if people would judge David for what happened or think less of him. This was especially painful since my Uncle David was a truly wonderful man who lived his life just like anyone else. He was a fiercely devoted father he loved barbecues and camping and he was a connoisseur of stand-up comedy. His mental illness does not define him nor does his cause of death.

Given the massive scale of the mental health crisis the question ""what do we do now?"" is a global one. For the sake of our loved ones and our fellow human beings the answer is clear. We need to work together to break the stigma of mental illness so that those who are suffering do not need to suffer alone. The National Alliance on Mental Illness offers several suggestions to reduce stigma such as talking openly about mental health showing compassion for those with mental illnesses and fighting self-stigma.

While these suggestions sound easy in theory they are much more difficult in practice. When it is you or your family member who is struggling it takes a great deal of bravery to speak out. So to honor those we have lost to suicide and to support those who are still here please be brave. Please speak out.

Hopefully in sharing my family’s story we can keep my Uncle David’s memory alive and chip away at the stigma so that those who need help can have the courage to seek it.

CSCO,Cisco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmNpc2NvLmNvbS9jL3IvbmV3c3Jvb20vZW4vdXMvYS95MjAyMS9tMDcvY2lzY28tZmVsbG93LW5hbmN5LWNhbS13aW5nZXQtYS1wYXNzaW9uLWZvci1tYWtpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLXVzZWZ1bC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nancy Cam-Winget: A passion for making technologies useful,"Nancy Cam-Winget is part of the 0.02 percent.

That’s the percentage of employees at Cisco who hold the title of Cisco Fellow. 20 to be exact.

The promotion caps a 19-year history at Cisco for Nancy who is of Chinese descent grew up in Peru and now lives in Mountain View California. During her time here she has become a towering presence on the worldwide security industry stage.

She played a key role in driving Cisco’s security technology strategy for most of the company’s history in the security business. Without her contributions much of today’s Cisco Security portfolio — Wi-Fi security Network Access Control Network Segmentation IoT (Internet of Things) security — would not exist.

Her superpower? Taking ideas and turning them into award-winning products and standards-based technologies. Among the many tangible results: security architectures across several multibillion-dollar product lines over 50 foundational patents to the security industry and a long list of protocol standards that permit the world’s security technologies to talk and work with each other.

Along her journey she has worked tirelessly to mentor and share her love for technology and problem solving with up-and-coming engineers.

We caught up with Nancy to ask her today’s cybersecurity landscape what made her become an engineer and more.

Cisco: You’re considered a worldwide leader in wireless and network security. What accomplishments got you there?

Nancy: I was one of a handful of architects in the industry who shaped Wi-Fi security. This became the foundation for changes to other wireless modalities.

We designed the idea on a napkin in the wee hours of the morning. It’s pretty cool knowing something used as commonly as Wi-Fi has stuff I designed.

The innovations launched my security career and brought a degree of recognition because it was a time where wireless was relatively new. We literally had to influence the industry — as well as some government bodies — because we had to create new constructs to secure the wireless medium.

Our work also spotlighted things we needed to improve upon in general security so it drove quite a few technologies in Cisco as well the industry.

In the last decade as IoT and its security was in the limelight I was one of a few people tasked with looking into what it meant for Cisco. I influenced and helped define IoT security protocols and mechanisms for our products and driving them in various standards forums.

Cisco: What does being promoted to a Cisco Fellow mean to you?

Nancy: I feel very honored. Throughout my career what’s driven me is closing gaps and trying to ensure we bring out practical technologies that people will use.

I’ve always done what’s needed to help our customers and Cisco. The promotion gives me validation that all my efforts have been important.

Cisco: How do you plan on using the promotion as a platform? What do you hope to achieve?

Nancy: I’m passionate about trying to ease the path for others to succeed. I’ve been doing quite a bit of mentoring and I want to see how I can scale those efforts better.

I’m an introvert by nature so if you’d asked me this question 25 years ago I don’t think using this platform would have crossed my mind. But being one of the few to get to this stature taught me the importance of reminding people that if they follow their passion and energy they can achieve their goals.

Cisco: Cybersecurity is constantly changing and evolving. How do you keep pace with all of the trends and decide what goes to the top of your innovation list?

Nancy: It’s not only true of cybersecurity but of the whole technology innovation curve. It’s moving so fast and there are so many areas where you can innovate — it’s hard to keep up and it can be overwhelming even for me.

What drives me are the seminal areas where unless we close a certain gap we will be in trouble. It takes discipline to pick the one or two I believe are going to be focal.

If we don’t address something appropriately are we helping the attackers? Are we allowing them to do more harm while trying to do more good?

One area I’m driving within Cisco and trying to help elevate across the industry is that balance of wanting to provide security and privacy. There’s this notion that all your data should be confidential and nobody should be able to disclose anything about you — except we need to protect you!

It’s about striking the balance of providing the appropriate information to trusted sources so protections can still be enabled while respecting privacy.

It’s an area that’s ripe for innovation.

Cisco: It’s been said that without your contributions our security portfolio wouldn’t be where it is today. How have you helped shape our products and solutions and driven our technology strategy?

Nancy: My contributions were part of a full team across the industry to make Wi-Fi secure and the success it is today. Beyond defining Wi-Fi security our wireless products were one of the first in industry to come out with and adopt how we provide a secure unique identifier to our products themselves — this is now IEEE 802.1AR.

In recent years I’ve influenced the industrial side of IoT markets so best security practices get used.

These days beyond IoT security I’m focused on the encrypted Internet and an initiative we call “Dark Data.”

Cisco: Where do you see the cybersecurity landscape in the next several years?

Nancy: Being able to detect threats accurately and in a timely manner is still our target. I see our landscape in a race to make real time accurate detection a reality. I would love to see this become a reality and see it automated in my lifetime.

However remediation of security threats — especially in IoT — may still require some human intervention.

For example if you think about automating the shutdown of a power plant there are huge implications. But being able to automate the shutdown of a phishing attack is something I’d like to see soon.

Cisco: What made you want to be an engineer? Was it something you always knew you wanted to do?

Nancy: As a little girl I was influenced by the Apollo launch and Neil Armstrong’s 1969 landing on the moon. I aspired to be an astronaut but my dad said little girls don’t do that.

I really liked math but I never envisioned being an engineer. Technology was not a predominant theme in Peru but I knew computers existed because in high school a teacher gave us an 8080 microprocessor board you could program.

At 17 I came to the U.S. for college through a partial scholarship to specialize in theoretical math. But I took one class in computer engineering/programming and that was it. I really liked that I could apply my math to it and went on to get my bachelor’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

Growing up my parents had that stereotype of you’re a woman how can you be an engineer? It’s kind of what’s driven me — not necessarily to prove them wrong but to prove it can be done.

Cisco: What does innovation mean to you?

Nancy: There’s a quote by Thomas Edison that resonates with me: “The value of an idea lies in the using of it.”

What it means to me is if you know you need to solve a problem or you think you have this great idea to solve a problem what matters is how you shape it so it becomes something useful. So people will like it enough to use it and have it become a mainstay.

Cisco: What motivates you?

Nancy: If someone has doubts about whether something can be done I take it as a challenge. Let me see if I can change your doubt into a reality. I’m always curious which is what keeps me going.

Hollywood logic usually dictates that an actor with musical inclinations – however shaky – issues a record. Hence releases by William Shatner Leonard Nimoy Peggy Lipton Annette Funicello and a million more. Yet nothing from the evidently musically capable Karen Black. (In 1965 there had been one single: a stage play spin-off)

She was recording and writing though and after her 2013 death the singer-songwriter Cass McCombs found reels of tape in her garage. She had appeared on “Dreams Come True Girl” from his 2009 album Catacombs. After their first collaboration the friendship thrived and they considered making an album together. That did not happen but McCombs is the guiding hand behind the fascinating illuminating and marvellous collection Dreaming Of You (1971-1976).

Dreaming Of You makes it clear Black was on the path to completing tracks which might have been released. Six of Dreaming Of You’s 17 selections are solo demos produced by Bones Howe whose credits range from Jan & Dean and The Mamas & The Papas to Elvis Presley and Tom Waits. The sessions would not have taken place unless there was some idea things were going to be taken further. There are also four fully arranged full-band recordings produced by Elliot Mazer who also worked with Jack Nitzsche Linda Ronstadt Neil Young and more. The final two tracks (included as a seven-inch with the LP version) “I Wish I Knew the Man I Thought You Were” and “Royal Jelly” were completed by Black and McCombs just before her death: she’d originally written the lyrics as poems.

Unsurprisingly a country lilt colours a lot of what’s heard but much of Dreaming Of You – two tracks are cover versions – has an angularity and distinctiveness which could not have originated in Nashville. The direct delivery and sudden pitch shifts in “You’re Not in my Plans” “Headache” “The Wind Doesn’t Speak to me Anymore” and “Well I Know You’re Lonely Now” are analogous with Karen Dalton but without the indebtedness to roots music or gut-bucket inclinations. This is not the work of a folk-influenced singer-songwriter. Granted these are demos but the only comparison springing to mind – especially on “You’re Not in my Plans” and the creepy “Dreamland” – is the currently active Mary Ocher. (pictured left Karen Black with Cass McCombs. Photo by Aaron Brown)

In contrast the two cover versions imply a dance with mainstream expectations. “Question” is a Moody Blues song and Black’s solo version leans towards Gordon Lightfoot. In the UK ""If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind"" is best known from Cilla Black’s 1969 version. In Sweden as “I Will Bring You Flowers in the Morning” it was a success for Blond. Karen Black’s version is more like the latter than the former and comes across as a potential single. Her own “Thank God You’re Mine” also feels like a single. It has pedal steel piano acoustic guitar and a slight Emmylou Harris ambiance. The most direct recording is the fully produced “Babe Of Babe” a dramatic mid-tempo performance fusing country and southern soul which brings to mind Marianne Faithfull in her country period. The question of why nothing was released is unaddressed unanswered. It is unfortunate there is no essay digging into the whys and wherefores of what is on the album.

Setting its two final tracks aside – the ones made with Cass McCombs – the eye-opening Dreaming Of You (1971-1976) confirms that Karen Black was serious about her music during the Seventies. Clearly she was contemplating making a record. Or records. Also it’s obvious she had her own voice. Most importantly what’s here demonstrates that if something had been issued it would have stood on its own merits. An actor who sings? No a singer-songwriter who also acts.",,,

The index climbed to a new intraday record high after the announcement.

Other stocks that helped push the Dow Jones to a record high included those that benefit from the reopening of the economy like United Airlines and Carnival. Bank stocks like Wells Fargo Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase also pressed the index higher.

Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) surges led by Apple big tech

October 12 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) climbed more than 300 points out of the gate this morning as Apple advanced on hopes about this week’s iPhone event. The jump in U.S. stocks comes despite a statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who said that talks over the next round of coronavirus stimulus have officially stalled.

She wrote in a letter to House Democrats that the White House’s proposal is “wholly insufficient.” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in their own letter to lawmakers over the weekend that they will keep negotiating with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

The Dow Jones’ (INDEXDJX: .DJI)’s gain this morning follows a strong week last week. The index posted its largest weekly gain since August last week and the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 had their best weeks since July. Investors are also getting ready for the third-quarter earnings reports which are slated to start rolling out this week with a number of airlines and major banks scheduled to report.

Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) slips as presidential debate approaches

September 29 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) slipped today after rallying on Friday and Monday due to renewed hopes that there would be another stimulus package. Today the index is falling ahead of the presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

Globally more than 1 million people have now died from the coronavirus and that’s serving to shake up global stock market indices as well. When Trump and Biden take the stage for their debate tonight they are sure to discuss the handling of the pandemic and plans for the economic recovery. The U.S. has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world at 7.1 million and the highest death toll at more than 205000 of any country in the world.

The debate could set the tone for the markets leading up to the November presidential election.

Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) declines amid economic uncertainty

September 18 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) fell 150 points before cutting its losses in morning trading today. U.S. stocks have been pressured by signs of trouble in the economic recovery and a fresh surge in coronavirus infections.

Today is also a quadruple witching day which means both options and futures on indexes and stocks are expiring at the same time. The result is volatility on the stock market. The phenomenon often results in above-average volumes due to the way traders are moving out of hedges on their futures and options contracts.

Other pressure on the Dow Jones is coming from the presidential election and Congress’ lack of a deal on further coronavirus stimulus measures.

Survey puts Dow Jones Industrial Average at 52k in 5 years

August 17 2020 Update: A new survey suggests the average investor is excessively optimistic—so optimistic in fact that they see the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) at 52000 in only five years.

MarketWatch reported on the survey which was conducted by money-management firm Schroders. The firm surveyed 23450 private investors in 32 different countries including 1500 people in the U.S. U.S. investors are even more investors than those in other countries.

The average investor expects stock prices to continue skyrocketing putting the Dow Jones at around 52000 after accounting for dividends. The average investor predicted a return of 15.4% per year for the next five years.

How The Dow Jones Industrial Average Works

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) has fallen off a cliff the past few weeks. The index is up almost 5% in trading on March 13th 2020 but that is still several thousand points below the recent high. The DJI is currently trading at 22188.26. Previously the Dow climbed to a new record high at 29408 in early February before pulling back not long after the market opened. However as the day rolled on the index flipped back into the green.

The Dow Jones was up about 84 points amid further progress in the trade talks between China and the U.S. China plans to slash in half its tariffs on some $75 billion of imported U.S. goods starting on Feb. 14. It’s the first step in the nation’s phase-one trade resolution with Washington. Tariffs on many goods will be cut from 10% to 5% while other goods’ tariffs will be slashed from 5% to 2.5% according to China’s Ministry of Finance.

INDEXDJX: .DJI: Previously

Commenting on today’s trading which saw the Dow Jones INDEXDJX: .DJI near 29000 Gorilla Trades strategist Ken Berman said:

It seems that the resilience of domestic stocks continues to be impressive. Indeed it only took a few days to completely erase last week’s scary sell-off. It wasn’t that long time ago that we celebrated Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) 28000 and thanks to today’s broad rally the industrial average got very close to topping 29000 and bulls already have the historic 30000 level in their crosshairs.”

The major indices all finished in the green for the second day in a row and the large-cap benchmarks also closed at their highest levels ever. Equities were boosted by the de-escalation between the U.S. and Iran. The Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) was up 212 or 0.7% to 28957 the Nasdaq gained 74 or 0.8% to 9203 while the S&P 500 rose by 22 or 0.7% to 3275. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an almost 3-to-2 ratio on the NYSE where volume was slightly above average.

Even though the major indices finished below their intraday highs. This was due to a shallow afternoon dip. However all of the key sectors gained ground with even the defensive utilities edging higher. Tech stocks consumer goods and services were the strongest issues which is as healthy as it gets when it comes to bull market rallies. The relative weakness of small-caps was the only major red flag today. This was despite the fact that large-caps continue to hit record highs the Russell 2000 remains much weak from a technical perspective.

Dow 29000 I ndexdjx:.DJI this week?

The Volatility Index (VIX) hit its lowest level since last week’s airstrike. Additionally short interest continues to decline on Wall Street. Analysts agree that there is no lack of risk appetite among equity investors. That said we did have several short-lived pullbacks in recent weeks. These downturns ensure that the positive sentiment hasn't turned into exuberance. In fact the positive shift in global economic trends provided another boost for stocks just after the trade agreement between the U.S. and China. The lofty gains will eventually lead to a deeper correction until the bullish catalysts keep on coming. In the meantime the foundation of the rally remains solid.

Iran in focus

The traditional safe-haven assets such as Treasuries Silver and gold all declined today and the price of oil also continued to fall in the face of the improving economic outlook as the odds of a new military conflict in the Middle East declined. President Trump unexpectedly called for the resumption of the talks with Iran. While the hardliners in the Persian state called for revenge downplaying the effects of yesterday’s missile attacks. However the two sides seem to be steering away from a major conflict.

The government jobs report will likely steal the show tomorrow. Volatility could already spike higher in pre-market trading because of the release. All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls figure following last month’s blowout reading of 266000. This week’s bullish ADP payrolls number also indicates further gains. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 3.5% while hourly earnings are forecast to rise by 0.3%. As the global economy has been showing signs of life in recent weeks Treasuries yields could explode higher. Yields will follow if the U.S. labor market continue to show robust growth.

Dow (I ndexdjx:.DJI) 29000 next?

Technical Corner. Since the major indices all erased last Friday’s dip. It’s no surprise that technicals continue to be bullish across the board. Indeed not a single trend indicator flashing red. The major indices are still well above their rising 200-day moving averages of 8153 for the Nasdaq 2981 for the S&P 500 and 26817 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and now just shy of Dow 29000. Despite the late-day pullback the benchmarks are also north of their steeply rising 50-day moving averages of 3149 for the S&P 500 8682 for the Nasdaq and 28024 for the Dow.

Thanks to five consecutive bullish months Apple’s (AAPL) stock achieved yet another technical milestone passing the $300 per share level yesterday. Apple lost the title of the most valuable public company due to the IPO of the Saudi oil giant Aramco. However Apple took over Microsoft (MSFT) while crossing $1.3 trillion in total capitalization. The stock hit another record high today and it’s well above both its moving averages. However an orderly pullback of the INDEXDJX: .DJI could happen anytime. Apple is still likely to lead the way higher in 2020. Stay tuned!",,,,,,,,,

The Mets are having such a hard time staffing home games with food and drink vendors amid a dry labor market that the service company responsible has to bus in labor from the rival Philadelphia Phillies The Post has learned.

Vendors who usually sling hot dogs and beers at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia have been shuttled on an hours-long bus ride to Citi Field to serve unsuspecting Mets diehards at some recent home games according to employees and a union leader.

Food service firm Aramark which hires vendors at both ballparks is so desperate to fill positions amid the coronavirus crisis and its related economic downturn it’s paying Philly-based workers to undertake the sometimes three-hour commute into enemy territory said Ryan Nissim-Sabat director of Union 174 in Philadelphia.

“They’re busing them back and forth and paying them for the ride” said Nissim-Sabat.

“My guess is they’re struggling to fill positions because they don’t pay a high enough wage” he said adding that concessions workers make roughly $15 an hour. “At the end of [the] day we’re still in a pandemic and asking workers to be in front of 10000 strangers at a stadium is still somewhat risky.

“They should be paying more.”

On June 11 as the Mets prepared for a home tilt against the Pittsburgh Pirates some Citi Field workers noticed buses of food vendors from the Phillies’ stadium arriving in Flushing.

“I saw buses full of workers in the parking lot and saw they came from Philly” said longtime Citi Field food vendor Bobby Lee.

In recent months the food service industry in New York City has been plagued by a shortage of workers some of whom say they’re better off collecting unemployment checks — fattened by COVID-19 relief bills — than returning to work.

But Lee said that the arrangement has been going both ways.

“It’s reciprocal” said Lee. “They’ve been busing people there [to Philadelphia] too.”

Aramark may simply want to fill vacant positions with people who already work for the company instead of hiring temps said Nissim-Sabat — while arguing that it would be more efficient for the company to have vendors stick to home games.

“They should be hiring locally” he said. “It’s a waste of resources to send them back and forth.”

An Aramark rep said the company has been occasionally busing workers from Philadelphia to Citi Field for decades — but workers said it’s been happening more frequently in recent weeks.

The rep didn’t respond to inquiries about whether the company is having trouble hiring locally.

Harold Kaufman a spokesman for the Mets declined to comment.

For their part Mets fans were split on whether they wanted to be served by the road team.

“I would never work at Citizens Banks Park because it’s that grit. I’m a huge Mets fan so I would never want to work for the Phillies organization” said Jamie Lynch a lifelong supporter who said he’d only be OK with the outsiders if they were fellow Mets boosters — or at least agnostic.

“If [slugging first baseman Pete] Alonso hits a home run … and I’m standing there and grabbing food and they are handing it to me and they are upset it definitely crushes my vibe at the park” explained the 21-year-old Westchester resident wearing the jersey of Amazins ace Jacob deGrom. “I want all pro-Mets.”

Another sports buff who declined to be identified by name said that the important thing was the service not who was providing it.

“If I want to buy a beer at a game I don’t care if it’s from a Phillies worker” the fan said. “I’d be madder if I wanted a beer and couldn’t get one.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXRlY29hdGludmVzdG9yLmNvbS9kb2N0b3ItbW9ydGdhZ2UtbG9hbi10aXBzLWZyb20td2NpLXJlYWRlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doctor Mortgage Loan Tips from WCI Readers | White Coat Investor,"By Dr. James M. Dahle WCI Founder

Physician mortgage loans have been around since before I started writing this blog in 2011. All of the doctor mortgage lenders on our recommended list will lend to physicians and most will lend to dentists. Other professionals such as CRNAs attorneys veterinarians pharmacists podiatrists optometrists and even accountants often qualify as well.

What Is a Physician Mortgage Loan?

While some definitions differ my definition of a doctor mortgage loan is one that:

Does not charge PMI despite having a down payment of less than 20%

Will close with a signed employment contract rather than pay stubs

Only considers the payments of student loans (not the entire loan burden)

Is not an FHA or VA loan

Often these loans are “portfolio loans” (i.e. are kept in house at the bank that issued them). These lenders will also have experience working with self-employed (1099/independent contractor) doctors—which adds a level of complexity to getting a mortgage.

As a general rule the rates and fees on these loans can be slightly higher than what you can get with a 20% down conventional mortgage. That's the price you pay for the convenience of not having to meet conventional mortgage rules and for being able to use your down payment money to pay off student loans max out retirement accounts or something else.

The terms are highly variable and include 30-year fixed 15-year fixed 5/1 ARMs 7/1 ARMs and 10/1 ARMs. As a general rule I'm a big fan of a 15-year fixed mortgage but there are certainly other circumstances that merit using other types of mortgages. For example if you know you will sell in 7 years a 7/1 ARM is a fixed mortgage for you. Others prefer a 30-year amortization so paying it off in 10 or 15 is optional not mandatory.

AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY DC

In today's post I wanted to discuss the real-life experiences of doctors who have shopped for a doctor mortgage in the last year or so. So I sent out an email to thousands of my readers and received a couple of hundred responses. Don't worry not all will be included in this post but it will be enough to provide a good sample of what I received.

Bear in mind that a lot of the variation in interest rates you will see below is explained by the fact that we are looking at people who took out mortgages between 2017-2019. These are not the same rates available to you today.

This can be an input to help you understand if a physician mortgage would be a good idea for you.

Doctor Mortgage Experiences from WCI Readers

Read Up and Shop Around

Lance went to Fulton Bank for his physician mortgage loan because he didn't have a down payment and a friend had a good experience there. He put 0% down and ended up with a rate of 3.75%. He advises “read up and shop around.”

10% Down Payment

Richard checked out US Bank and Fairway Mortgage and ended up with US Bank because “They were very helpful throughout and offered the best interest rate by quite a bit.” He put 10% down for a rate of 4.375%. That was a lot better than he could get with any other mortgage given the lack of a 20% down payment.

Closing Four Months Before Contract Start Date

Luke took a look at Arvest and US Bank and chose Arvest “because they allow closing up to 4 months before contract start date and they offer 100% financing up to a certain house price. I have been very happy with my choice to go with Arvest. Previously used Suntrust for my current home 5 years ago and there was a bit more ‘red tape' in getting things finalized compared to Arvest.” 0% down 4.25%. He went with a physician loan because he is “just finishing residency and do not have enough liquid cash for a conventional down payment.”

Low Down Payment on an Expensive Home

Alexander bought in 2017 using a physician mortgage in order to only put 10% down on a $930K home a year out of fellowship in a high COLA. Rate was 3.99% with Suntrust the lowest rate he found.

“Pushed Off to Someone Else”

Michael got a doctor's loan because he wanted to use his saved money for home improvements. He went with BMO Harris but was disappointed because the rate (4.75% with 5% down) ended up being 0.75% higher than the original quote and the agent “pushed me off to someone else in a different state who was not good at communicating or coordinating with the title company so we did not meet our deadline.” He wishes he would have used a 10-year ARM instead of the 15-year fixed he got.

Used a Local Credit Union

Andy checked out many options in Michigan but ended up with a local credit union because he got better rates 0% down and a 3% checking account up to $30000. He ended up with a 4.24% 10/1 ARM because he plans to pay it off in less than 10 years.

Make the Lenders Compete for Your Business

Lindsey looked at Citizens One and SunTrust and ended up putting 11% down with Citizens One to get a 3.375% 15-year mortgage. She advises “Make the lenders compete for your business. My husband and I have credit scores in the 800s so all the banks wanted our business. Be creative and don’t just focus on interest rates. Ask for credits at closing too.”

Days of 0% Down Gone for Jumbos

Rishi put 10% down to get a 4.375% interest rate on a jumbo loan with Citizens Bank. He says “make sure you have enough money saved prior to looking. Sounds obvious but you need more than just an attending contract before you get approved. The days of 0% down are almost gone definitely unavailable for jumbo loans.”

Two Doctor Loans in Three Years

Benjamin has done this twice once in 2014 (Key Bank 10% down 30-year fixed 3.675%) and once in 2017 (Fifth Third Bank 10% down 30-year fixed 4.125%).

Locked It in Instead of Saving Up a Down Payment

Adam went with the physician mortgage because he found the rates to be very competitive with conventional mortgages but only had to put 5% down. He says “I could have saved up a bit more for a higher down payment but rates were rising at the time so I wanted to lock it in quickly. Overall it's been a good experience.” He looked at US Bank and PNC Bank before going with Huntington Bank with a 3.325% 7/1 ARM.

A 5/1 ARM

Anton chose the physician loan because he didn't have a down payment. He chose Simmons Bank over Bank of America put down 5% and got a 5/1 ARM at 4.25%. He recommends looking for the best interest rate and locking it in.

Just Rent a Cautionary Tale

Ashmi closed on her doctor loan (5% down 3.75%) with Bank of America after checking out Wells Fargo and Union Bank. She says “I was in the middle of finishing fellowship moving preparing for my new job and also studying for my specialty boards. In retrospect I don’t think I was in the right mindset to make all these decisions. Waiting 3-6 months until we had the 10% down payment (and interest rates relatively low still) would have been a much better deal. Or waiting 1-2 years to have the full 20% down.

We underestimated the costs of buying closing and the amount of repairs/renovations buying a 40-year-old home in Los Angeles (which actually is “newer” for our neighborhood) would cost. Now that I have read WCI I would definitely recommend waiting. Renting what you need (i.e. we would have been fine in 2 bed/2 bath townhome or apartment) and then deciding the next step based on 1) finances 2) children/family 3) choosing the best neighborhood after exploring for a year or two.”

Mortgage Broker Instead of a Bank

Aaron a self-employed periodontist ended up working with a mortgage broker because the banks would not even look at him without two years of tax returns. 0% down 5.25%. He recommends “explore the options of “buying down” the interest rate by paying points. My broker gave me that choice and if you’re financing that large a number ($330K) it’s advisable to pay the thousand or so up front to buy a lower interest rate.”

Rates a Little Higher Than Before

This doc closed in November 2018 with 0% down and a rate of 5.4% on a $225K loan with Sun Trust. He is pleased but hated all the paperwork.

A Serious Mortgage Loan Shopper

Ryan bought early in attendinghood and so didn't have a down payment but doesn't regret it given other job options he had in the area if the first didn't work out. He emailed 8-10 lenders off this site and 3 local banks and credit unions but only had 3-4 email back. He simply chose the best rate he could get which was a local bank who gave him a 90/10 loan instead of a doctor loan. The 90% loan had a 30-year term 10% loan had a 5-year term but both were fixed at 4.25%.

He says “Everyone seemed helpful I'm sure they will be because they are about to make a lot of money off of you. I seemed to get the best responsiveness from the local folks and actually the best rate as well. I highly suggest shopping around—I had rates range from 4.375% to 5.75% that can really change payment structures. Overall this was a bit more stressful and difficult than refinancing my student loans.”

Ask Who Will Service the Loan Post-Closing

Sara used First Citizens Bank and then refinanced from 4.75% to 3.99% with Suntrust 6 months later after her credit score improved and she had an improved loan to value ratio after doing some renovations. Both were 30-year mortgages. Sara found SunTrust to have a lower rate but higher credit standards. She was surprised to find rates to be similar to conventional mortgages.

She and her husband really liked the “portfolio loan” aspect of the physician loans. “For us it seems like physician mortgages are serviced by the actual bank who loans the money. This has been a much better experience than previous conventional mortgages that were sold to a third-party servicer. For example I had a house before meeting my husband (he's the physician in our relationship) and it's serviced by Rushmore Lending Group after being sold from the original bank I financed through. Horrible horrible experience with Rushmore in attempting to obtain information early pay-off escrow etc.

In contrast both First Citizens and Suntrust kept our loan in their portfolio. It's been super easy to set-up extra principal-only payments as well as obtain information anytime about the loan. That can be a real win time-wise. And if needed I could go into my local branch and talk to the bank about the loan at any time.”

Did as Much by Email as Possible

Jimmy is now coming out of fellowship and recently got preliminary quotes from 13 lenders (Suntrust Synovus First Tennessee BB&T BBVA Citizens Physician Loans US Bank FNB IBeria Simmons UMB and Willow Bend) and went with First Tennessee because they had the best terms (0% down to $1M 5% down to $1.5M) rates were as good as anyone else's and the agent was easy to work with. 5% down 4.25%. He says “I sent a form email to everyone on your website and got some information on basic terms and conditions and then circled back with those who had agreeable basic terms to get final rate quotes before proceeding with the “winner.” I tried to do as much as possible via email so as to have minimal impact on my day-to-day work. If people weren't willing to work via email they were cut. At the end of the day I figure that they are competing for my business and that I'm not required to bend to their needs in order for them to get my business.

Used the WCI Recommended Mortgage Lenders

Nabil looked at Regions Bank BBVA and Fairway before going with Cadence Bank with 5% down and a 4.375% 30-year fixed mortgage. He says “All the lenders I reached out to were recommended by WCI for physician loans in Texas. They all provided good service and an overall good experience. I mentioned I found them through WCI. Went with the one that gave me the best rate. No issues with the process and closed on time and everything went smoothly.”

Careful with Construction Loans

Elizabeth looked at Bank of America and then settled on SunTrust for a 4.49% loan with 5% down. She warns “I found not all banks were willing to do physician mortgages for new construction so that's something to ask about up front if that's what you're planning. ”

Expect Some Inconvenience

Tyler just closed on a house last month with a physician mortgage to avoid PMI and put less down. He put 10% down and got 4% with US Bank. He notes “Working with someone in another state was a little inconvenient since there were no person to person meetings. There were lots of emails and scanned documents with some things getting lost.”

Rate Was Most Important But Service Matters Too

Steven's wife is coming out of residency and they wanted a mortgage that didn't count her student loans and would accept her signed contract. They were quoted 5% down 4.99% by Fairway but are looking at a local bank offering 0% down 4.25%. They were willing to put more down but there wasn't much benefit. He said “Fairway was great to work with. They went back and forth with me on the various options (fixed vs. variable 30 vs 15 buy down options etc.) updating the presentation with each of my requests. They answered all my questions. Honestly Fairway was so helpful I feel kinda bad going with the local bank especially since Fairway doesn't charge an application fee (so we got all their help for free). But the rate difference is significant and it gets us established with a local bank which could be helpful down the line especially since I'll likely be self-employed (in a non-medical field).”

Flexibility Matters

Aubrene looked at Fifth Third Bank and some local banks and chose Fifth Third because “they were more willing to be flexible with closing dates and paperwork.” She put 5% down and got a 4% rate.

Closing This Month

Jessica is closing this month with Fulton Mortgage after looking at SunTrust. 4.25% on a 15/1 ARM with 6% down on an $850K home. She is looking forward to using her cash to pay off student loans instead of a down payment.

I don't dare make this post any longer but after looking through more than 100 emails the story is mostly the same. Mostly great experiences with minor inconveniences and the occasional major hassle. Rates mostly in the 4-5% range—again be mindful that these experiences were sent to us in 2019 and rates are sure to change. Down payments mostly in the 0%-5% range. People mostly doing it because they don't have down payment money or have a better use for it but still expect to be in the home for many years. The amazing thing is just how many different lenders people are using. There really was no one lender that stood out over the others. You just need to take a look at the ones in your state and shop around to get the best rate terms and service for your personal situation.

What do you think? Have you taken out a physician mortgage loan in the last year? Why did you choose it? What rate and terms did you get? What companies did you look at and how was your experience with each? Comment below!"

However when you buy something through our links we may earn a commission.

Comet isn't an ""every-single-purpose"" cleaner but it dang sure is close. Good with fiberglass won't scratch ceramic tile deodorizes and disinfects as it goes. Stainless steel? Fahgetaboutit'. Tough stains or stuck-on soap scum— it doesn't matter. Comet cleanser is an old-fashioned powder cleaning product that's been scrubbing since 1956.

Mr. Clean Clorox— these brands are like the Infinity Stones of the household cleaner's universe. Comet from Procter & Gamble is right there with them (don't forget Lysol). Use water and a soft scrub or stick with a tough sponge— however you want to clean just spread Comet powder cleanser and plenty of water.

Boom. Your countertops are shining like a rocket heading for space.

Disinfectant Comet Cleaner

Comet can be used for a lot of things but the top five for me are:

1. Stainless steel

2. Fiberglass

3. Ceramic Tile

4. Porcelain toilets

5. Kitchen cooktops

Disclaimer: one place you should never use Comet is on natural marble! P&G also doesn't recommend it for wood.

Comet lemon-fresh is a thing but I've always been impressed with the original high-powered disinfectant cleaner. Baby Boomers have been using the antibacterial cleaning power of Comet in place of healthcare for decades. They're still holding strong.

Jokes aside the disinfecting clean-up ability that Comet has on both delicate surfaces and harder ones is pretty timeless. Don't be mistaken: this is bleach powder. If chemical surfactants are your preference then get to spreading this disinfectant cleanser around.

The Comet compound is made to be non-scratch which means your steel and glass cooktops are about to get a good safe scrubbing. Sprinkle Comet overtop of your appliances then wet and wipe clean.

After you've got the kitchen cleaned head on down to the bathroom. Your toilet and other porcelain places need some love. Scrubbing them with a good brush and Comet will disinfect your bathroom as few other products can.

You'd think a bleach powder cleaner would have a certain smell and you're right. Comet's smell is a fresh scent and it's both deodorizing and stings the nostrils a little bit. That's how you know it's working.

If you've got a high-traffic bathroom fill a spray bottle of water and go to town with this multi-purpose surface cleaner. Spread the powder across the porcelain toilet bowl and stainless steel faucets. Use it to mop up on tile and linoleum. I've never used it on glass but other than that it's an all-in-one bathroom cleaner.

If powder cleaners aren't your thing the Comet family has a 32 fl oz spray bottle option as well. Check out more Comet cleaners today. It can scrub just about anything!",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Comex contract has rallied 57% in the year to date making cobalt one of the best-performing industrial commodities this year.

Interest in cobalt futures is being boosted by carmakers and battery companies looking to hedge their price exposure and by banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. which recently has been buying up physical cobalt as it seeks to build a more active trading business according to people familiar with the matter. A Goldman Sachs spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.

While trading volumes are still small CME Group has ambitions to become the dominant pricing venue in the market for the material that is extensively used in electric vehicle batteries. The bourse has already extended the length of the tradeable futures curve twice since launch responding to requests from industrial clients CME Group’s global head of metals Young-Jin Chang said in an interview.

“With any new contract like this the first movers tend to be the physical industry with their hedging needs” Chang said. “These kinds of tools to be able to manage fixed costs and secure profit margins are becoming more and more important.”

A further surge in volumes on Comex would be a setback for the London Metal Exchange CME Group’s larger rival in the industrial metals markets which has been looking to draw the industry toward its own cobalt contracts for years.

The LME launched a physically-deliverable cobalt contract in 2010 but after a promising start trading activity has ebbed in recent years amid concerns that some of the metal in its warehouse network might be linked to child labor which prompted the bourse to undertake a supply chain review. It launched a second cash-settled contract in 2019 but there’s been no trading activity so far.

A LME spokeswoman declined to comment.

The rapid growth of the CME Group contract — which settles against the same Fastmarkets index as the LME offering — is down in large part to the energetic marketing efforts of brokers channeling clients to the Comex product according to two cobalt traders familiar with both exchanges.

By contrast London brokers have been less eager to set up clients to trade LME cobalt primarily due to concerns about cost overheads they said.

To be sure the Comex contract is still a long way from gaining widespread acceptance and the small size of the physical industry may place a natural cap on the growth of futures trading. Global annual cobalt production is currently about 130000 tonnes compared with about 20 million tonnes for copper and 65 million tonnes for aluminum the largest base metals markets by value and size respectively.

Tyler Heagy of Annville a dairy farmer and custom harvester said the fields he has seen have been holding enough moisture.

“The weather has been cooperative” he said. “Fingers crossed it stays that way.”

Nearly 300000 acres of winter wheat were planted in the fall. That’s up 15% from the previous year and is the most acreage planted in the state since 1976 according to USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service.

Farmers took advantage of a recent string of warm and dry weather days resulting in about 60% of the crop being harvested in the two weeks ending July 12.

In Lancaster County farmers were halfway finished with their harvest by Independence Day. With the sunny weather and a nice golden crop it was hard not to get into the fields said Jeff Graybill an agronomy educator with Penn State Extension.

Dalton Gish a custom harvester in Lebanon County said he’ll spend a few more weeks operating the grain cart while following his dad David in a John Deere combine.

Gish started harvesting wheat after July Fourth and said he and his father finished 120 acres in two days. He said he hasn’t noticed a major difference from last year’s weather and yield which ranged from 90-100 bushels per acre.

This year’s yields have been around 100 bushels per acre or better for farmers in the southeast region. One farmer in Lebanon County recorded an average of 130 bushels which Graybill plans to send to the National Wheat Growers yield contest.

Fungal toxin levels have been below 2 parts per million which is considered nonexistent.

“The yield is good. The price is good. The quality is good. It’s kind of a trifecta” Graybill said.

The timing of the harvest has also been helpful for farmers because they have been able to take their wheat off early enough to plant soybeans. Graybill said many are capitalizing on this opportunity to make money by double-cropping.

Good wheat prices seem to have encouraged farmers to expand acreage.

Heagy thinks that many farmers especially dairy farmers who have sold their milking herds have moved into cash crop farming.

“You just see a lot less forages being harvested on dairies” he said.

Graybill said that while the Midwest produces most of the hard wheat used for bread Pennsylvania’s wheat varieties mainly go to animal feed with a small percentage for bakery products.

“We need wheat for cookies and such so it doesn’t need to rise as much” Graybill said. Farmers are also watching the price of straw which tends to push up the price of wheat Heagy said.

On July 9 the price for wheat closed at $6.08 a bushel in Chicago according to CME Group. In Kempton Pennsylvania Albright’s Mill had wheat listed for $5.95 on its online grain board.",,,,,,,,,

""Efforts to restore the Grand River have been underway for over a decade” said Matt Chapman of Grand Rapids Whitewater. “We are honored that the entire Whitecaps organization believes in the tremendous opportunity our community has with the Grand River. With the support and awareness from The Grand Rapids Dam Breakers we will work to restore the rapids in the Grand River for everyone.""

The Grand Rapids Dam Breakers persona was created to bring awareness to the Grand River restoration project. Spearheaded by Grand Rapids Whitewater the goal is to restore the rapids back to a 2.5 mile stretch of the Grand River.

“There’s no doubt the Whitecaps love Grand Rapids and the unique history our city and even our ballpark have with the Grand River” said Whitecaps CEO Joe Chamberlin. “This Dam Breakers persona is an awesome opportunity for us to bring awareness to this very special project and we will be doing all that we can to highlight the efforts of Grand Rapids Whitewater. The Whitecaps are an important part of the West Michigan landscape and we are excited to support this new vision of revitalization economic growth and plenty of new fun for everyone in our community.”

Why?

Residents and visitors alike flock to downtown attractions on both sides of the Grand River. It makes smart economic sense to make the riverfront a central gathering place for everyone.

The Anderson Economic Group projects 230000 net new visitor days and more than 500000 people each year a boon that translates up to almost $19 million in net economic impact for the city and 80-100 new jobs. In addition $250+ million in capital investments are anticipated within 10 years of the project completion.

“By embracing the Dam Breakers brand our fans business partners and all of West Michigan can join us in helping to create momentum and support for this exciting project that has the potential to mean so much to our city” Chamberlin added. “A healthy and thriving Grand River helps create a healthy and thriving Grand Rapids and through the Dam Breakers brand we invite all of our Whitecaps fans to be part of this historic movement” Chamberlin said.

Consumers Energy is one of those business partners who embraces the message and already responded as the Grand Rapids Dam Breakers game sponsor on August 21**st**.

“Consumers Energy is proud to be part of this community effort to put the Rapids back in Grand Rapids – a project that will provide west Michigan families significant recreational economic and environmental benefits” said Lauren Youngdahl Snyder Consumers Energy’s vice president of customer experience. “We are committed to better protecting our planet for generations to come and we applaud the Whitecaps temporarily the Grand Rapids Dam Breakers and Grand Rapids Whitewater in their mission to enhance the natural resources here in the Grand Rapids community.”

In early July the Whitecaps began teasing the announcement and the new name with cryptic sounds of water images of waves and dates on their social media. The announcement tonight was the collaborative work of the Whitecaps Grand Rapids Whitewater and Consumers Energy.

The Whitecaps organization plans to give a portion of the proceeds of all Grand Rapids Dam Breakers merchandise over to the Whitewater project.

The Grand River restoration project proposes to bring natural cultural and commercial excitement back to our waterway by restoring a 2.5-mile stretch of the river to its rightful rolling state.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd 's plans for investing Rs 75000 crore in solar batteries fuel cells and hydrogen could create valuation of USD 36 billion (Rs 2.6 lakh crore) for the new energy business Wall Street brokerage Bernstein Research said in a report.Reliance currently has three verticals -- oil-to-chemical ( O2C ) business that houses its oil refineries petrochemical plants and fuel retailing business; digital services that comprises telecom arm Jio; and retail including e-commerce. New Energy will be the fourth vertical.At the company's annual general meeting of shareholders last month Ambani announced a plan to invest Rs 75000 crore in a new energy business over the next 3 years in the next stage in its transformation. Under plans announced the company will invest across solar batteries and hydrogen to create an integrated clean energy ecosystem.Other big announcements at the AGM were the launch of the new smartphone JioPhone Next and induction of Aramco chairman to the RIL Board  which is positive for the spin-off in O2C business.""Clean energy has the potential to be value accretive if Reliance can pull it off"" it said. ""Based on capex for clean energy we see a route to Reliance building a clean energy business which could be worth USD 36 billion.""It put a valuation of over USD 69 billion for the O2C business USD 66 billion for digital services and USD 81.2 billion for retail. Upstream oil and gas operations are worth another USD 4.1 billion. Other investments such as in the media and hospitality space are valued at USD 3.7 billion.The entire conglomerate is worth over USD 261 billion.""Many oil companies have tried and failed to become clean energy manufacturing companies and instead focus on clean energy production. Reliance's focus on manufacturing is distinctive and potentially offers higher margins but is also higher risk given their limited capabilities in clean energy"" Bernstein said.Reliance will need to find partners to work with them given the technology requirements needed for fuel cells and batteries.""While companies will be reluctant to share their technology with a potential competitor the market opportunity in India may be enough to persuade some"" it said. ""Korean battery makers could be potential partners in energy storage while companies like Plug and Ballard could be partners in fuel cell manufacturing.""Funding is not an issue for Reliance given the current balance sheet. Reliance is almost debt free and will generate cash flow of Rs 65600 crore in FY22 and grow to Rs 1.5 lakh crore by FY26 it said.The logic of investing in clean energy is compelling. USD 70 trillion will be spent globally on the energy transition over the next 30 years.While India has yet to declare a net zero target the direction towards low carbon is clear it said adding with solar becoming cheaper than coal and hydrogen reaching cost parity with diesel there are clear economic and energy security reasons to believe that India will transition towards clean energy.In this context it is also logical to assume that India will seek to develop technologies in manufacturing capacity given the huge investments which are needed.Bernstein said O2C margins continue to improve raising hopes for Aramco investing in buying 20 per cent stake in the business.""For FY22 we expect Reliance will deliver O2C EBITDA of Rs 52200 crore (+90% y-o-y)"" it said.

The government has already set its sights to produce 350 GW of solar power. Until June 2020 the country achieved close to 35 GW. Owing to the sub-standard quality of components being used at several places the country is likely to witness a faster rate of early loss of PV modules.By 2030 close to 300000 tons and by 2050 nearly 7500000 tons of solar waste is likely to pile up.Currently there are no laws that mandate safe disposal of solar energy waste unlike WEEE in Europe and it needs to be accorded priority to ensure no land filling. A not-for-profit organisation can formulate a roadmap to pave the way for a safe end of life management using low-cost recycling equipment and ensure they are used for re-powering. About 240000 MW of new panels can be re-produced without extracting new materials. It will result in the overall CO2 abatement of 360 billion tons in their lifetime. Jaideep N Malaviya is an expert on solar energy waste management. He spoke to TOI about the pros and cons concerning the issue.Excerpts...Q. Why do solar panels need recycling?A. India has set an ambitious target of 450 GW of renewable largely using solar energy. All solar energy systems must be subject to the extended producer responsibility (EPR). Recycling will create more jobs and re-harvest the basic raw material to re-power. Let the new 3Rs be ‘recycle reuse and regenerate’ instead of reject. Re-use of materials will greatly reduce the carbon foot-print as compared to fresh mining. The recycling entity can recover its cost by trading the raw material.Q. How do solar panels become a waste?A. The crystalline solar modules (panels) last 20 years or so. However some manufacturers also claim life beyond this period. Our analysis shows that with recurring high efficiency solar cell technologies end-users may opt for re-powering once the investment is recovered as it will give a higher yield. This will result in far sooner waste. We anticipate about 20000 tons of waste by the year 2030 and eventually 20000000 tons by 2050.Q. Are solar panels hazardous to the environment?A. Typical crystalline silicon solar modules (panels) have almost 95% (by weight) aluminium glass silicon copper and metal parts that are recoverable and recyclable. The balance 5% polymer sheets are still a challenge to recycle and are a potential hazard to landfill as it contains fluorspar. Solar thermal panels (collectors) are 100% recyclable and easy to do. It will be interesting to undertake a detailed study on how much carbon footprint will be avoided if solar modules are recycled and reproduced instead of freshly mining raw materials. This is the only way it can put pressure on the government to consider it earnestly.Q. How is the government planning to address the issue of solar energy management?A. While inverters and batteries are already governed under electronics and battery waste management laws in India there are none for solar modules. It is understood that an initiative has already been taken by the government to address the issue of solar energy ‘Circular Economy’ by forming a committee comprising of Industry associations institutes and experts. What is required at this stage is to undertake R&D on developing low-cost recycling techniques to make it economical. India can set a benchmark for the consortium countries of the International Solar Alliance (ISA).Q. How does the current landscape of solar recycling in India compare to the markets across the world?A. There is no regulation or law that binds any solar module to be mandatorily sent for recycling. There is a need for an immediate bylaw to make sure all future solar modules made/imported in India have a cost of recycling built in as EPR. The classification of EPR has also to be clearly defined. Only Europe has a mandatory law on solar energy recycling under the Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment (WEEE). India needs to be ‘atmanirbhar’ in the entire value chain.Q. What are some of the main barriers for solar panel recycling?A. A database will have to be created of all installed domestic and imported solar modules in the country. This is necessary to ensure they are not dumped and break the EPR law. The EPR definition will require manufacturers to take back the waste and recycle which will be an expense to them as they had not built in the recycling cost earlier. A preliminary study shows that a minimum 5000 tons of solar module waste is feasible for setting up a recycling facility. Considering our vast geographic location we will need multiple collection centres after de-framing the modules at the site. A central recycling facility that reduces the logistics cost will be economical. Nagpur fit the bill as it is centrally located and well connected with the rest of the country. Refurbishing modules if disposed early should be avoided as it may lead to fraud and malpractice.Q. What are some of the advantages for solar manufacturers that integrate recycling practices into their business operations?A. There is not much knowledge available on low-cost recycling. Manufacturers of solar modules have a very prominent role to play. The policies for recycling must be manufacturer-friendly. A devoted not-for-profit organisation of solar module manufacturers can function as a catalyst between the government regulatory bodies and end-users to facilitate safe disposal. The body can invite entrepreneurs and researchers to offer low-cost solutions funded as part of the industry-institute partnership. The recovered materials can be then traded with the module manufacturers.Q. What is the current status for disposal of solar panels?A. Presently it is sold as scrap in the open market.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9mcmVxdWVuY3ktb2YtY3ljbG9uZXMtaW4tYXJhYmlhbi1zZWEtaW5jcmVhc2VkLWJ5LTUyLXBjLWZyb20tMTk4Mi0yMDE5LXN0dWR5L2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg0NTA2MzkxLmNtc9IBkAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9mcmVxdWVuY3ktb2YtY3ljbG9uZXMtaW4tYXJhYmlhbi1zZWEtaW5jcmVhc2VkLWJ5LTUyLXBjLWZyb20tMTk4Mi0yMDE5LXN0dWR5L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NDUwNjM5MS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frequency of cyclones in Arabian Sea increased by 52 pc from 1982-2019: Study,"

In the wake of George Floyd's murder corporate America pledged to do better saying it would diversify its leadership encourage equity and take concrete actions to root out systemic racism.

But a USA TODAY analysis of previously undisclosed hiring records from dozens of top firms found that more than a year later executive roles remain overwhelmingly white and male. Black and Hispanic workers particularly women tend to be concentrated in the lowest ranks and some of the nation's most powerful brands still refuse to disclose data on the gender ethnic and racial makeup of their workforce.

The eight-part series combed the records of the Standard & Poor’s 100 some of the most highly valued companies in the stock market.

Building pipelines for diversity success Anthony D. Wilbon dean of the Howard School of Business and Charlotte Newman senior manager at Amazon talk growth strategies for diversity and equity Jarrad Henderson USA TODAY

They revealed that while Black and Hispanic employees are often overrepresented as compared to U.S. census data on the nation's workforce among the technicians administrative assistants and laborers who form the backbone of many organizations they are less likely to be found at the company's senior levels or in other professional positions.

The lack of diversity in corporate roles that pay the highest salaries offer the best benefits and provide a path to promotions influence and leadership hardens the racial and gender wealth gap that's resulted in the typical white family having eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic household.

Companies are more transparent but not all

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies have become more transparent in the 14 months since Floyd's killing when protests condemning systemic bias and calling for social justice swept the nation.

Among the S&P 100 a record 54 companies including Merck Ford Motor Co Bank of America and Target gave USA TODAY their EEO-1 forms documents detailing the gender race and ethnic breakdown of their workforces that businesses are required to provide each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Another 23 corporations including Home Depot Walmart and Boeing said they would publicly disclose that information this year or in 2022.

Altria Abbott Laboratories AT&T General Dynamics and UnitedHealth Group were among the companies that provided their EEO-1 reports after publication deadline.

But some of the nation’s most well-known brands such as Exxon T-Mobile and FedEx rejected USA TODAY’s requests and gave no future date when they might provide such information to the public. Amazon which last released its EEO-1 report in 2016 also would not provide the most recent demographic data of its workforce but said it would release its 2020 data in the coming months.

Federal officials will not release these demographic records to the public without companies’ permission citing privacy protections in the Civil Rights Act. A civil suit filed by Reveal a nonprofit investigative journalism outlet challenges the legality of hiding these records from the public.

Boards are largely white and male

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies often point to the diversity of their boards of directors to distract from the concentration of white men in their corporate suites. But board membership at the 54 companies examined by USA TODAY also did not reflect the racial makeup of their business's workforces let alone the nation's overall population.

While white men make up about a third of U.S. workers they held half or more of board seats at 33 of the 54 companies.

Amgen a biopharmaceutical company had the highest percentage of white men on its board – eight people or 73% – even though only 30% of the company's workers are white males. White women held two of the remaining three board seats which is almost half of their rate in the company's workforce.

Compared to their company workforces white non-Hispanic men were only underrepresented on 12 company boards almost always by just a handful of percentage points. Among the remaining corporations reviewed the share of white male board directors often was two or three times higher than their business' workforce.

The companies also appointed white women to their boards at higher rates than people of color.

White non-Hispanic women held a disproportionately large share of board memberships at about two-thirds of companies.

White women had no seats on the board of Coca-Cola despite holding 23% of all jobs. At Starbucks they held just 9% of seats while accounting for 38% of the company's workers.

About a third of companies had boards where the percentage of men of color matched or exceeded their representation in the business's workforce. Six companies did not have any men of color on their boards.

Another 19 companies did not have any directors who were women of color. They were equitably represented or overrepresented on the boards of just 10 companies. But those figures are based on counting all non-white women together obscuring the lack of Black and Hispanic women board members in particular.

“We have to move from tokenism to transformation'' says Darren Walker who is head of the philanthropic Ford Foundation and a diversity advocate. ""Having one Black on the board or the chief diversity officer three levels down from the CEO will not result in a successful strategy. There has to be genuine authenticity.”

At about half of the companies reviewed the board membership had more representation for people of color than among the business's executives although men of color were much more likely to hold those seats than women.

For instance 44% of board seats at Gilead Sciences Inc. a pharmaceutical company are filled by four men of color but no women of color. Two white men and three white women hold the rest. Yet men of color account for 20% of the company's executives and 26% of its workforce.

Women of color account for a larger share of McDonald's workforce than any of the 54 companies reviewed: 44%. None sit on the company's 13-member board.

Again these tallies lump together ethnic and racial groups that face different challenges with workplace discrimination and gaining the kind of career recognition that leads to invites for board seats. Closing the gaps will take targeted strategies experts say.

Diversity strengthens the bottom line

A diverse board appeared to help some S&P 500 companies weather the economic downturn sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic better than businesses whose boardrooms were less inclusive according to a new report.

S&P 500 businesses whose boards were more than 30% people of color experienced a 4% bump in revenue as compared to the previous year while their peers whose boards were less than 20% people of color saw their revenue dip 2.8% according to BoardReady a nonprofit focused on making boards more inclusive.

Race inequity in corporate US

And companies where women made up more than 30% of the directors outperformed those whose boards had fewer women in 11 of the top 15 S&P 500 sectors last year.

“It’s striking that so many aspects of diversity correlated with better performance” the report’s lead researcher Rajalakshmi Subramanian said in a statement announcing the findings. “No matter whether you’re looking at racial diversity gender diversity or diversity in age companies with a broader range of perspectives at the board table did better.”

The gains that have been made in some board rooms have been hard-won and companies can easily backtrack if advocates aren't vigilant says Ursula Burns the former CEO of Xerox and the first Black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company. She's been leading the charge to diversify the boards of major corporations.

“The board level in many publicly traded companies is better than the C-suite data and it’s better than the employment levels” Burns told USA TODAY in an interview. “Basically if you beat the (crap) out of them about something – I’m sorry to say it this way – they will pay a little bit of attention to it with the hope that we will forget about it after a while and they then can take their foot off the pedal.”

Mondelēz International which produces snacks like Oreos and Ritz crackers has no women of color and only one man of color on its 12-person board. Nearly 40% of the company's workers are people of color.

In an emailed statement the company said that last year it signed on to the Board Diversity Action Alliance which aims to make boards more inclusive.

""We value diversity within our board of director members as we do throughout our organization'' the company said. ""We know we can and will continue to improve in this space.""

USA TODAY's series puts a spotlight on several industries including:

Tech

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

While white employees across all U.S. industries are three times as likely as their Black or Hispanic peers to get top jobs the gap is even starker among the nation's largest tech firms.

White employees at Facebook Google Amazon Apple and Microsoft are five times as likely to be executives as their Hispanic colleagues and seven times as likely as their Black co-workers USA TODAY found.

And while women are underrepresented among managers and executives throughout corporate America – a pattern that continues in the tech world – the disparity among Black tech employees is particularly striking. In that sector Black men are twice as likely as Black women to have leadership roles.

Black and Hispanic workers have a disproportionate share of lower-level jobs in big tech. At tech companies analyzed by USA TODAY nearly half of white employees had professional positions as compared to 1 in 5 Hispanic workers and 1 in 9 Black workers. The professional gap between white and Black employees in tech was three times greater than what is seen in the overall labor force.

Banking

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Leadership of the nation's major banks has traditionally been – and continues to be – predominantly white.

White people fill 73% to 87% of all executive positions at US Bancorp Bank of America Bank of New York Mellon Citigroup Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.

Wells Fargo says that it will release its EEO-1s for 2019 and 2020 later this summer roughly a year after its CEO Charles Scharf a white man drew criticism for saying the San Francisco-based company missed its diversity benchmarks because there was a limited pool of Black executives to draw from.

Food Retail

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

At some of the nation's largest or best-known food companies and chains the diversity in top jobs is vastly out of sync with the broader population.

White workers are 64% of the nation's workforce while Hispanic workers are 16.8% and Black workers are 11.2% according to U.S. Census data.

But 87% of executive positions at Costco are occupied by white people. Meanwhile 77% of executives at Pepsi and 74% at Coca-Cola are white according to records obtained by USA TODAY. McDonald's was the most reflective of the U.S.'s racial demographics with white people filling two-thirds of executive roles. Although the company's leadership was the closest to matching the overall American workforce McDonald's still had disproportionately high rates of Black and Hispanic people particularly women in lower-paying and lower-ranking jobs.

1 of 4

Kentucky’s own signature soda brand is celebrating its 95th anniversary.

July 13 marked the birthday of Ale-8-One which calls Winchester home and is colloquially known as “Ale-8.” The ginger and citrus-based soft drink was concocted by George Lee Wainscott who previously introduced Roxa-Cola in 1906. Roxa-Cola was named after Wainscott’s wife Roxanne and ended up the subject of a lawsuit battle with Coca-Cola who alleged the soda was an infringement of trademark. This suit was won by Wainscott who would continue in the independent soda business.

Wainscott discovered ginger beer during a trip to Europe inspiring him to work on the recipe that would become Ale-8. This recipe was introduced at the 1926 Clark County Fair drawing attention with a concurrent contest to name the new soft drink. Based on 1920s slang for “the latest thing” the name “A Late One” won with the phrase still engraved on Ale-8 bottles to this very day.

In celebration of the anniversary staff at the Ale-8 bottling company enjoyed a barbecue and axe-throwing. What the company truly wants to recognize according to Ale-8’s marketing director Chris Doyle is the brand’s heritage and the community that has supported it for nearly a century.

“There aren’t many independent soft drink brands that still exist because the market is dominated by two global giants” he said “It’s our communities where we have been able to grow such a successful brand over 95 years. We listen to our consumers whether it’s our guys out delivering product or on social media where we have a tremendous following.”

It was on social media that the brand learned of people mixing cherries with Ale-8 leading to the launch of the cherry Ale-8 flavor in 2018.

It was also through social media requests Doyle adds that Ale-8 Zero Sugar and the seasonal orange cream Ale-8 came to be.

“We’ve got some fun new products but we’re not far enough along to introducing them quite yet” explained Doyle “but we have several that we have been working on and tasting internally and we are expecting to have something new by next summer.”

Ale-8 also takes part in several ongoing community projects. The brand currently has a partnership with Kentucky State University in Frankfort working with the school to develop a new scholarship. They also sponsor the Red River Gorge Climbers Coalition and the Kentucky Mountain Bike Association. Additionally Ale-8 frequently donates drinks to local events and food banks.

“Anything that involves Kentucky and the community we strive to give our support” Doyle said. “We have such a passionate following here in Winchester and we certainly have fans throughout the state. But we want everybody in Kentucky to feel the way about Ale-8 that our hometown does.”

Doyle accredits the success of Ale-8 to its closeness and participation with the community and the company’s efforts listening to fan feedback. He said Ale-8 fans can make their voices heard on Facebook Instagram Twitter and the comments section on ale8one.com.

“We plan to continue listening to our consumers and our fans really staying close to them. That’s what kept us around for so long” Doyle concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbG92aW4uY28vZHViYWkvZW4vbGF0ZXN0L2NhdGNoLXJlbm93bmVkLXBsYXliYWNrLXNpbmdlci1zdW5pZGhpLWNoYXVoYW4tbGl2ZS1hdC10aGUtY29jYS1jb2xhLWFyZW5hLW5leHQtbW9udGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Catch Renowned Playback Singer Sunidhi Chauhan Live At The Coca-Cola Arena Next Month!,"Sunidhi Chauhan the songstress of Delhi will soon make her way to Dubai for a live performance at the Coca-Cola arena.

Morikawa 24 is just the eighth golfer to win two majors before his 25th birthday. He won his first major the PGA Championship last summer. He also became the first golfer to ever win two different major championships on his first attempt.

Morikawa is one of the top U.S. golfers set to compete at the Olympics. As of this writing he is the fourth-ranked golfer in the world. Dustin Johnson who will not be competing in Tokyo is ranked No. 1 while Justin Thomas is ranked third. The remaining U.S. golfers competing in Tokyo — Xander Schauffele and Bryson DeChambeau — are ranked fifth and sixth respectively.

Sub-Saharan Africa has a young population with a projected high population growth at a rate of 2.7% per year more than double the rate of growth in South Asia and Latin America. As a result telecom operators are expected to invest $52bn in infrastructure from 2019 – 2025 much of which will be in rural deployment.

Commenting on the partnership Miriam Tuerk CEO and Co-founder of Clear Blue Technologies said: “We are thrilled to partner with Avanti to provide key telecom services to rural regions in sub-Saharan Africa ultimately connecting the billions worldwide who lack telecom and internet access. With only 26% of Sub-Saharan Africa already connected through mobile internet we’re looking forward to bringing connectivity to areas where costs and lack of infrastructure make internet services prohibitive.”

This partnership will accelerate the rural rollout of low-cost connectivity solutions in areas where network coverage and broadband services have been limited or non-existent. Avanti and Clear Blue have already successfully provided these connectivity solutions in significant deployments across Africa’s largest economies.

Avanti’s rural network coverage solution supports 2G 3G 4G and Wi-Fi connectivity across Africa. As part of this joint rural deployment effort Avanti will provide critical high throughput Ka-band satellite connectivity and VSAT equipment. At the same time Clear Blue will deploy its smart off-grid solar-powered solutions with remote management and control.

Libby Barr Chief Operating Officer at Avanti added: “Our core belief is that everyone deserves the socioeconomic benefits of a more connected life and this partnership with Clear Blue will bring life-enhancing coverage to rural communities in remote areas. Together with Clear Blue we will be able to deploy thousands of sites across Sub-Saharan Africa connecting a population that is growing at 2.7% per year. We expect the remote telecom market to continue to take off and we are looking forward to being at the forefront of the rural network coverage expansion.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvam9pbnQtdGlwLXdlZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buy a joint tip for germ-free weed sharing,"Post-vaccine life is in full swing for many people in the United States which means a return of summer barbecues and kickbacks.

Even if summer 2021 was a ""normal"" season there wouldn't be a shortage of mind-altering substances — but given that we've all survived in the past year and a half parties may have an even higher stock. What's more numerous states legalized weed in the past two years so usage is poised to go up.

All this to say: You may soon be at a party where joints are passed around. Buy a joint tip.

A joint tip is a hollow cylinder often made out of glass and designed to be placed on well the tip of your joint (or blunt or spliff). Oftentimes you can use them as a substitute for filters when rolling a joint but you can also place them over an already-packed one. The latter is more useful for party settings because you can simply slide on the tip when it's your turn to take a hit then slide it off before you hand it off to a friend.

In this latest phase of the pandemic we're all more cognizant of germs. While the risk of COVID is lower than ever especially for fully vaccinated folks the possibility of contracting it is certainly still here. Even without COVID cold and flu viruses are still out there too — and have been raging since the country began opening up.

A joint tip prevents you from inadvertently swapping spit with someone keeping at least some of those sweet sweet particles to oneself. It's also easy to cleanly share one if you want to: Just wipe the glass with alcohol before exchanging.

Even if you aren't the most germ-conscious joint tips can be a fashion statement. It's very easy to find plain glass ones but with a little digging online you can find fun novelty tips like this gold RAW joint tip ring or this sparkly joint holder necklace .

""It has always been a dream of mine to represent the USA at the Olympics and I hope there will be many more chances for me to make this come true in the future"" she said in a tweet.

Gauff 17 was set to be the headliner of the U.S. Olympic tennis team.

She would have been the second-youngest U.S. player ever after 16-year-old Jennifer Capriati took home a gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games.

After making it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in June Gauff was the headliner on a United States roster that was ravaged by big-name opt-outs. On the women's side top-ranked women Serena Williams and Sofia Kenin declined their invites to the Games and on the men's side the top three -- John Isner Reilly Opelka and Taylor Fritz -- opted out.

Jennifer Brady Jessica Pegula and Alison Riske are the remaining women set to represent the U.S. in singles and Tommy Paul Frances Tiafoe Tennys Sandgren and Marcos Giron will represent on the men's side. Nicole Melichar and Rio mixed doubles gold medalist Bethanie Mattek-Sands are the doubles-only picks along with Rio mixed double silver medalist Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek.

While for some companies the share of e-commerce still remains sub 5% for Mumbai-based Marico Ltd sales via e-commerce contributed to 8% of revenues for the quarter ended 31 March 2021 analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note on the company released Sunday.

The report compared salience of e-commerce for other companies as well.

Dabur India and Tata Consumer Products Ltd draw upwards of 5% of their sales from e-commerce.

While for Hindustan Unilever Ltd the contribution of e-commerce to the company’s sales is in the range of between 5% to 6%. “E-commerce has become the channel of choice for many consumers. A strong focus on building a portfolio fit for this channel building capabilities and driving everyday great execution resulted in doubling of the growth rate and contribution from this channel on a year -on-year basis"" the company’s top management said in a March quarter earnings call. This is for the period ended 31 March 2021.

Meanwhile—for ITC—sales through the e-commerce channel more than doubled during the last year taking its salience to over 5% of segment revenue (FMCG-others) the company said in its annual report for last fiscal. Its brands include Aashirvaad flour Bingo! chips YiPPee! noodles Sunfeast biscuits and Savlon.

Dabur said e-commerce continues to be out-performer with growth via the channel doubling. “This channel now contributes around 5% to 6% of our sales"" the company’s top management said in March quarter earnings call.

Mumbai-based Godrej Consumer Products Ltd draws slightly over 4% of its sales via e-commerce. The maker of Cinthol soaps said the channel is going to be an ""important"" one not just in current times but also for many years to come ahead.

Meanwhile Britannia Industries and Jyothy Labs Ltd see significantly lower salience of sales via online commerce drawing between 1 to 2% of sales via online marketplaces and e-grocery sites.

For Emami Ltd and Colgate Palmolive India e-commerce sales remain less than 3%—as a contribution to overall sales.

In the March quarter Nestle India said e-commerce continued to deliver strong performance and grew by 66% for the maker of Maggi noodles. By the end of the March the contribution of e-commerce to domestic business stood at 3.8% the company said then.

CMCSA,Comcast,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvY29tY2FzdC12aWFjb21jYnMtbGlvbnNnYXRlLW1lZGlhLW1lcmdlcnMtZWFybmluZ3MtMTIzNDc5NDgzMy_SAV9odHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3L2NvbWNhc3QtdmlhY29tY2JzLWxpb25zZ2F0ZS1tZWRpYS1tZXJnZXJzLWVhcm5pbmdzLTEyMzQ3OTQ4MzMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast ViacomCBS Lionsgate! M&A Speculation Swirls As Earnings Hit: Will Wall Street’s Streaming Obsession Ease As Legacy Businesses Revive?,"ViacomCBS Chair Shari Redstone was doing the rounds at Sun Valley but contrary to reports she did not have a meeting with Comcast CEO Brian Roberts at the Allen & Co. mogul mountain retreat according to a person familiar with the situation. But the Philly-based conglom has been the subject of constant deal speculation ever since two big mergers promised to redraw the entertainment landscape if and when they close.

Within a week in May AT&T’s WarnerMedia announced plans to combine with Discovery and Amazon to buy MGM – the latter deal currently being scrutinized at an FTC led by antitrust reform champion Lina Khan. Both agreements were geared towards streaming content in an increasingly competitive market. Platforms multiplied and subscribers surged in 2020 during the worst of Covid. But more recently investors got jittery when Netflix and Disney added fewer subscribers in the March quarter further fueling talk of a content arms race.

Now however theme parks are crowded advertising robust and the Tokyo Olympics starts July 23. As Netflix and AT&T kick off media earnings next week the question said one analyst is “Will the Street forgive a so-so streaming number if the core legacy business is doing well?”

It might. Even with slower DTC growth Disney stock has been upbeat (although down Friday in a dour market) on a volley of positive research reports. The recovery is taking hold in parks with Disney anticipating domestic capacity likely to hit normalized levels in the current quarter. All parks worldwide were open by the end of June for the first time since the pandemic hit. Parks and resorts has historically been about a third of Disney’s revenue. Disney reports earnings August 12. (Netflix which reports next Tuesday has no legacy business but has been adding content which will now include a push into games.)

Neither Netflix nor Disney which only recently digested its 20th Century Fox acquisition are the names heard most often in a wave of M&A speculation from Hollywood to Wall Street. That would be Comcast — which tried to outbid Disney for Fox but lost the battle. One day bankers are said to be drawing up deal papers for a Comcast-ViacomCBS merger. The next Lionsgate is the NBCUniversal parent’s rumored target. After decades of consolidation there just aren’t all that many players in the mix anymore.

“Everyone is talking to everyone” said one Wall Streeter. Apple could be a buyer. AMC Networks a seller. Smaller entities from Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine Media to LeBron James SpringHill are fielding interest.

Lionsgate is a wildcard. It’s got a market cap of $3.5 billion and would sell for some premium to its enterprise value of $5 billion to $6 billion. Last week highlighting two of its strong suits it announced the acquisition of the 200-title Spyglass library and a 20% stake of the company and held an NYC premiere for Power Book III: Raising Kanan the prequel to the popular franchise which debuts on Starz Sunday.

‘Power Book III: Raising Kanan’ Starz

“Lionsgate would be a cleaner deal it’s a better size” said one Wall Streeter noting a few other smaller moves by Comcast including acquiring DreamWorks Animation in 2016 for about $3.8 billion and a pact worth about $1 billion that NBCU signed with the WWE earlier this year to bring Peacock exclusive U.S. rights to the WWE Network. “That was quite smart. It makes you wonder if it’s a prelude to buying the whole thing. But that depends on what the McMahons want to do [and] they’re probably not ready to sell the whole thing” he said.

As for ViacomCBS he said “My sense is that Comcast does not have a significant appetite to do a deal like that. It would be a regulatory headache” since both companies own broadcast networks cable networks and film studios. “It would appear that so far Brian is taking the path of just milking what he’s got. It’s an acceptable strategy.”

Another Wall Streeter wonders if Roberts is a bit gun shy after paying top top dollar for Sky. “Brian is a super long-term person. [But] does that [Sky] affect his thinking in terms of deals?”

That said Comcast is indeed focused on growing Peacock and probably needs to acquire more content. A key piece is kids and ViacomCBS has that. From a regulatory perspective there are ways to make it work and to make existing Comcast shareholders happy. Most would be delighted to see NBCU as its own company if the content and distribution businesses spit said one investor — “I would love to see it.” He called Shari Redstone “pretty financially driven. Would she rather throw in with Comcast and take Comcast stock. That’s a pretty attractive currency.”

Comcast can bide its time — even wait and do a deal with WarnerMedia Discovery once that closes expected mid-next year. It’s not impossible MGM may become newly available in the wake of the FTC probe amid a flood of anti-Amazon anti-big-tech sentiment. “It happens. Sometime a company makes a deal to gum up the works and take another company off the table in a long regulatory process. If it doesn’t get approved it’s ‘Oh well’ but you keep someone else from getting it” said one analyst.

Brian Roberts Comcast

Comcast has the financial capacity to buy ViacomCBS and has fresh billions coming at some point in the near future when it hands over to Disney its minority stake in Hulu.

The company declined to comment on merger speculation. Asked about deals at Comcast’s last earnings conference call Roberts said “We’re very pleased with the company we’ve got. Roughly 70% of the company being broadband-centric – proved to be a really successful model.” He told shareholders at the annual meeting in early June “We are very pleased with our talent our assets our culture our resources. I think we have a unique company well positioned to compete vigorously for talent for customers and growth in the years ahead. He’s likely to repeat same when he next takes the inevitable deal question on the second-quarter earnings call July 29.

Backing that up is the fact that Comcast announced in late May it’s reinstituted a share repurchase program which Wall Streeters take to mean that it’s not close to any substantial deal. Said one: “They didn’t have to start buying back stock. They could have waited and husbanded cash.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9zaXhlcnMvd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tY2VudGVyLXNpeGVycy1mbHllcnMtcmVub3ZhdGlvbnMtcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLTIwMjEwNzE3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia's Comcast Spectacor will resume Wells Fargo Center renovations. Will 76ers stay?,"Comcast Spectacor will resume on Monday its $300 million renovation of the Wells Fargo Center a project that was stalled for more than a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and that could affect the long-term relationship between the company and one of the arena’s primary tenants: the 76ers.

The renovation which began in 2016 is still $100 million away from completion according to Comcast Spectacor which owns the Flyers and rents the center to the Sixers. Installation of new and improved guest seating in the arena’s club level is expected to be finished this fall and additional changes – an upgrade of the exterior facade remodeled and updated entrances a greater variety of food and beverage vendors – will begin next summer.

“We’re a local company and we take pride in our sports teams and our arena” Valerie Camillo the center’s president of business operations said in a phone interview Friday. “We want to invest to give the best fans in sports what they deserve and that’s the best experience in sports with the best arena.”

Camillo said that Comcast Spectacor is the sole source of funding for the project. “There are no public monies of any kind” she said. “There are a lot of needs in Philadelphia and quite frankly we don’t think it’s reasonable that we would expect public money to help deliver that.”

It was natural to interpret Camillo’s words as a salvo in the public-relations tug-of-war between Comcast Spectacor and the Sixers whose plans for a taxpayer-funded arena of their own at Penn’s Landing were revealed last August.

Comcast Spectacor sold the Sixers to Joshua Harris the founder of Apollo Global Management and his partners in Harris & Blitzer Sports & Entertainment in 2011 and the team’s lease at the Wells Fargo Center expires in 2031.

Harris and the Sixers’ ownership group want their own arena for a host of reasons according to an Aug. 28 Inquirer report. Those reasons include additional revenue streams priority in scheduling the team’s games and concerns about how much the Wells Fargo Center’s condition will deteriorate between now and the end of the lease.

“Comcast Spectacor is a great long-standing partner of the 76ers and we’re excited by their continued commitment to delivering a world-class arena experience” a Sixers spokesperson said via email. “We have a lease with our partners at Comcast Spectacor for another decade. We will continue to explore all options in Philadelphia for when our lease expires in 2031 with a focus on delivering the best experience for our fans.”

When asked whether the renovations were in any way intended as a carrot for the Sixers Camillo said: “We’re not thinking about our transformation in terms of enticing the Sixers to stay. We’re thinking about it in terms of every guest who comes into the building and the Sixers are certainly part of that. But we also host Flyers games concerts family events shows. This is an investment in the city in the community in the stadium district. We want to provide the city of Philadelphia a world-class arena.

“Look I don’t want to get into speculation about how the Sixers think about this” she added. “The Sixers know we want them to stay.”

The Wells Fargo Center opened in 1996 kickstarting a massive refurbishment of the South Philadelphia sports complex that continued with the building of Lincoln Financial Field and Citizens Bank Park and that led to the razing of Veterans Stadium and the Spectrum. Comcast Spectator owns the development rights for the land next to the center “and we have exciting plans for that” Camillo said. “In the next several months we’re going to have exciting announcements to come there too.”

That declaration seemed a direct counter to the argument or perception – one that the Sixers have promoted merely by the nature of their plans one that existed in the early 2000s when the Phillies were weighing where to build Citizens Bank Park – that a downtown arena would be better for the city’s economy and civic life.

“The stadium district is such a unique urban-planning success story” Camillo said. “It’s well-planned. It’s managed. It’s a significant well-functioning traffic-management plan – ingress and egress everyone’s down here together. The partnership structure works very well between the teams. I would be hard-pressed to think that there’s anything better out there than what we have today.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb3V0aGJlbmR0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMS8wNy8xNy9pbXByb3ZpbmctcG9vci1yYWRpby1yZWNlcHRpb24tZG9lc250LWhhdmUtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWludGVuc2l2ZS83ODkwOTQwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Improving poor radio reception doesn't have to be expensive or intensive,"Don Lindich

I need help with my stereo receiver’s FM reception. I listen primarily to WQED in Pittsburgh approximately 35 miles away but the direct line of sight to the transmitting tower is blocked by a hill. I reside in an apartment and cannot install an outside antenna. I have tried mounting an indoor wire antenna but it is of almost no help. Our building has Comcast service for TV and we have access to Wi-Fi. I believe the hill is blocking signals of any kind. Is there any solution to my dilemma? — J.G. Greensburg Pennsylvania

The wire antennas included with receivers are notoriously poor performers. A set of unamplified $10 TV rabbit ears makes a fantastic FM antenna. Try it I think you will be surprised at the dramatic improvement. Your Comcast Xfinity X1 box has analog outputs you can connect to your receiver. Add the NPR One app to your X1 box and you can use it to listen to WQED. There is an iHeartRadio app available for the X1 as well and if you get a Bluetooth box for your receiver you can tune most FM stations via the internet and stream them to your receiver.

Panasonic ES-L97-K ARC5 Electric Shaver

I like a very smooth shave and this has kept me using shaving cream and multi-bladed disposable razor blades for my entire adult life. I loved the idea of an electric razor but had never had much success with them and had resigned myself to long shaving sessions and a lot of waste and clean-up. I was recently encouraged to try the top-rated Panasonic ES-L97-K ARC5 ($249) and was told it would satisfy me. Indeed it did!

The ES-L97 is an electric razor with a flip-up trimmer and a lockable pivoting head. It can be used wet or dry and comes with a cleaner-charger that makes owning and using it very easy. In my testing I only used it dry and was rewarded with a smooth good looking shave that seemed very close to what I was achieving with my conventional setup.

After my first two shaves I went back to my conventional blade/cream setup expecting it to come out much smoother. Surprisingly though it was somewhat smoother it was not a dramatic difference and there was no visible difference in the mirror. With practice I believe I can improve my technique to the point where the tactile difference is almost indistinguishable. Still alternating with a razor and shaving cream every few shaves may be a convenient way to get the best of both worlds.

The cleaner-charger is great. You remove a tray and fill it to the water line then add a special detergent sold by Panasonic. (The razor comes with one detergent packet and additional packets sell for three for $15 online.) When you are finished shaving you put the shaver in the charger and push the clean button. The charger/cleaner then runs through a cycle that leaves it perfectly clean and dry for the next time you use it. The solution lasts for 30 cycles with some users cleaning it every few shaves so the cleaning solution lasts several months. If you are traveling the shaver can be charged directly with the AC cord and it comes with a travel case.

I have a trip coming up in a few weeks and I can tell you now that the ES-L97-K is going in my suitcase and the can of shaving cream and blades are staying out! shop.panasonic.com

One Pennsylvanian Happily Disagrees As Expected - FLYERS,"Photo Credit: Katelynn Reiss

The season is upon us where sports are fading away and there isn’t much to talk about. That being said I happened to step into an establishment in Newtown PA. I was sitting there ready to order my dinner and a bartender approaches me with a New Jersey Devils tattoo that was visible. We immediately started a debate. What do you think of Claude Giroux?

The debate had started and clearly the (hometown kid not me) was against the Captain in the BIGGEST way. The bartender named Conor Wegimont at “Clubhouse Bar and

Grill” appears to not think too much of the Flyers Captain.

“He Doesn’t have the heart he hasn’t played to his potential in years it’s time to move on.”

Even fans from PA are still having the debate that Giroux must go but not me. It’s a difficult topic to discuss for years Giroux has led the team as their captain and the locals still aren’t on board. It’s a difficult time in New Jersey for Devils fans as they are not playing to their potential all the while with having some top

picks. It was a great conversation I got to have with Conor- a true hockey fan.

That being said he did agree on one

thing which was a huge turnaround for the conversation:

I asked Conor this “Would you take Claude Giroux on your

team?.”

His answer “Right now Well Yeah absolutely”.

I rest my case.

Great spot here in NewtownPA. Get out to the “Clubhouse Bar and Grill” on 501 South state street and go to see Conor and Emily at the bar.

He never looked back.

Baddoo's flying helmet often signifies a stolen base infield single double or triple. In this situation he was determined to reach third. Even a small stumble after touching second base didn't stop him from a stand-up triple with two outs in the second inning.

The 22-year-old outfielder cleared the bases for three RBIs early in Saturday's Game 2 but 38-year-old veteran Miguel Cabrera played hero for the Tigers (42-51) with a walk-off bloop single into center field. He scored a hustling Jonathan Schoop — displaying his best Baddoo impression — from first base giving his team a 5-4 win and a sweep of the doubleheader at Comerica Park.

""I knew they were playing deep"" Schoop said. ""They wanted to catch the ball even if it was hit into the gaps. I thought 'I'm going to run as fast as I can. If it drops I'm going to score.' That's what I did. I showed them I have some wheels when I need to.""

GAME 1: Tigers snap losing streak against Minnesota Twins in Game 1 of doubleheader

ROSTER MOVES: Tigers place starter Jose Urena utility player Niko Goodrum on injured list

There were 31624 fans at the nightcap.

""Thanks to the fans for coming out and creating a great night"" Tigers manager AJ Hinch said. ""It was the first time that it really felt like kind of an Opening Day atmosphere a buzz in the crowd from the very beginning.""

Hinch later added: ""We get more brand of baseball like this we're going to earn their respect to come back to the ballpark and fill this place up. ... It's a step in the right direction for the entire organization to have this environment and deliver while the people are here.""

BASH IS A SMASH:Tigers' young arms connect with fans at 'Detroit's Biggest Summer Baseball Bash'

In the top of the eighth — an extra inning after the scheduled seven innings under MLB's doubleheader rules — Tigers reliever Joe Jimenez threw a wild pitch past catcher Jake Rogers. Nick Gordon started the inning at second base because of MLB's extra innings rule advanced to third and crossed home plate on Jimenez's misfire.

But Detroit bounced back.

Derek Hill started at second base stole third with one out and then scored on a single from Schoop to tie the game. Twins left-hander Taylor Rogers struck out Robbie Grossman but Cabrera delivered the winning hit.

Detroit took Game 1 of the doubleheader 1-0 behind Grossman's first-inning leadoff homer. After losing four games in a row to the Twins to end the first half of the season the Tigers returned to action by sweeping the doubleheader as part of a now-three-game series. (A planned fourth game was rained out Friday and will be made up in August.)

After Baddoo's triple in the second inning Twins starter Kenta Maeda retired 10 straight batters. He finished with three runs allowed on three hits one walk and eight strikeouts over five innings.

""For me he's not a Rule 5 (draft pick)anymore"" Schoop said about Baddoo. ""He's not a rookie anymore. He is mature. I saw it when he got a really good start got into a little bit of a slump and then got out (of the slump). For a first year it's tough.""

Alexander starts

Tyler Alexander isn't a true starting pitcher right now but the left-hander can start bullpen-only games when Hinch needs him. Of his 27 appearances this season Alexander has started three.

Alexander carried the Tigers through 3⅓ innings in Game 2. He allowed two runs on four hits without a walk. He struck out one batter and threw 35 of 48 pitches for strikes. After the Game 1 injury to right-hander Jose Urena Hinch needs another starting pitcher. Alexander could help fill the void if the Tigers decide to stretch him out.

""Barring any change he's likely to be the starter that last day (Thursday) against Texas"" Hinch said. ""We may change our mind between now and then but that was the thought in extending him into the fourth inning.""

LOOKING AHEAD: Eight storylines to watch for Tigers in second half of season

NOTEBOOK: How Michael Fulmer Matthew Boyd are recovering from injuries

The Twins opened the scoring in the first: Nelson Cruz (who had doubled) scored on Josh Donaldson's single to center. Donaldson added a solo home run in the fourth inning cutting the Tigers' lead to one run.

Alexander used 22 pitches in the first inning 13 pitches in the second six in the third and seven for one out in the fourth inning. After Donaldson's 413-foot homer Alexander retired the ensuing batter and was removed from the game.

""Job well done by Tyler"" Hinch said. ""We'll see if he's the answer here in the next couple of days.""

The rest of the bullpen

The Tigers went to righty Erasmo Ramirez who completed the fourth but allowed the game-tying run in the fifth inning. He gave up back-to-back singles forcing Hinch to call on one of his best relievers — righty Jose Cisnero — to escape the jam.

Cisnero walked the first batter he faced to load the bases.

Cruz 41 then followed with an infield single up the middle knotting the game at three. Second baseman Harold Castro gloved the ball with a sharp play but he fumbled the ball while trying to start the double play. (The run was charged to Ramirez.)

BIG RISK BIG REWARD: Why Tigers think prep pitcher Jackson Jobe is 'total package'

Left-hander Derek Holland used 11 pitches in a perfect sixth inning. Jimenez kept the game tied with a scoreless seventh. He returned for the eighth — the first extra inning — and allowed a run to score with his wild pitch.

Defense shines

The Tigers made many strong defensive plays highlighted by Hill's catch in center field. He tracked a line drive from Cruz to the warning track in center field. The ball traveled 396 feet and came off the bat at 104.4 mph — providing a .680 expected batting average.

But Hill made a diving catch to steal extra bases from Cruz and complete the third inning.

Castro got his opportunity to flash his leather in the second inning. A ground ball from Andrelton Simmons ricocheted off the mound and continued to accelerate up the middle. Castro made a sliding back-handed grab; his throw to Schoop at first base beat Simmons to end the inning. (Castro caught a low line drive in the fourth inning as well.)

To start the third Schoop made a running over-the-head catch in foul territory.

Swanson on a broad range of U.S. agricultural market issues restaurant reservations Conagra’s earnings outlook CPG inflation and more.

Wells Fargo Economist Addresses State of U.S. Agriculture

In a recent episode of The Food Institute Podcast Wells Fargo agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson discussed how current market conditions like record heat extreme drought and supply chain constraints are affecting farmers.

Swanson said the hot and dry summer will hurt crop yields across much of the nation but farmers experienced in navigating serious weather challenges should be able to weather the storm. Regulatory and supply chain issues however may prove to be more significant obstacles.

Transportation Storage Issues Press on Growers

Rising transportation costs are among the top problems facing farmers with operators forced to either absorb price increases or pass them along to customers the economist noted. Additionally farmers are losing opportunities to ship to international markets with container supplies limited and highly priced.

Swanson also said pandemic-related constraints depleted reserve stocks of key commodities which some operators did not see coming and COVID-19 exposed vulnerabilities in the “just-in-time” system of inventory management. While the system works well when fully primed it does not do well with shocks as showcased in 2020.

Effects of Heat and Drought in California

Swanson said California’s current situation is dire because its agricultural system was not designed to handle years without sufficient snowpack. The situation has only worsened under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.

In years past farmers would be able to rely on subsurface water extraction for irrigation needs but under the legislation they quite literally cannot return to that well. As such some agricultural producers have opted to fallow land.

Swanson also said that some farmers are buying properties or utilizing existing farmland with water rights in order to divert irrigation to their most profitable crops. However with the water situation unlikely to improve in the years to come he said production in California could plateau which may require a reassignment of resources among farmers in the region.

More About Dr. Michael J. Swanson:

Michael Swanson is an agricultural economist and consultant for Wells Fargo. His responsibilities include analyzing the impact of energy on agriculture and strategic analysis for key agricultural commodities and livestock sectors. His focus includes the systems analysis of consumer food demand and its linkage to agribusiness.

Bank of America Analyst Bryan Spillane: “In our view FY22 will be akin to a transition year as CAG takes action to combat inflation while at the same time cycles difficult COVID-related volume comparisons. Management is prudently managing the situation by maintaining its pressure on the consumer (marketing and new products). However with the inflation-related earnings gap this year we see the stock being range bound until the market gets a better sense on sales and earnings growth prospects for FY23.”

Today’s session was another major confidence boost for bulls as the ‘buy-the-dip’ mentality seems to be well and alive on Wall Street. Despite the lofty valuations investors were eager to jump back into stocks on the first somewhat upbeat reports regarding the coronavirus epidemic which led to today’s spectacular short-covering rally.

Q4 2019 hedge fund letters conferences and more

Stocks surged higher across the board today and the major indices finished significantly higher for the second day in a row thanks to the positive U.S economic numbers and the easing coronavirus-related fears. The Dow was up 408 or 1.4% to 28808 the Nasdaq gained 195 or 2.1% to 9468 while the S&P 500 rose by 49 or 1.5% to 3298. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where volume was well above average.

The major indices surged higher this morning and as bulls continued to chase stocks higher throughout the session the benchmarks registered their biggest one-day gains of the year. Value investors shrugged off Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOG - 2.5%) revenue miss from yesterday and the Nasdaq hit a new all-time high in the afternoon erasing the pullback that was triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. Consumer-related issues services industrials and financials all shined today and even the battered energy sector managed to bounce back thanks to the improving global sentiment.

Great British pound and currency markets

Today's most important earnings reports were mixed with ConocoPhillips (COP - 4.6%) missing both on its top and bottom lines confirming the bearish trends in the energy sector but with Disney (DIS +2.4%) posting encouraging numbers in after-hours trading. Disney's shares jumped higher in the wake of the report and since the firm's Dsiney+ streaming service already has over 26 million subscribers the stock could remain bullish. The price of crude oil recovered above the $50 per barrel level but since the travel restrictions concerning China remain in place the commodity might only be in for a ‘dead-cat-bounce’.

Tesla’s (TSLA +13.8%) epic short squeeze might be nearing its end at least judging by the violent intraday moves that Tesla stock has been experiencing this week. The shares of the company rallied by a whopping 60% in two days and Tesla was up by more than 300% since October before today's late-session pullback with the stock's short interest still standing at over 17%. With the company’s financials improving and its battery-related operations showing more and more promise the fundamental story remains intact even if the stock’s current rally seems unsustainable.

Economic data ahead

A very busy day of economic releases is ahead of us but in light of the much better-than-expected ISM manufacturing PMI bulls might be in for another treat. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI has been consistently outperforming the manufacturing measure and while analysts only expect a small uptick in the measure to 55.1 a larger increase wouldn’t be all that surprising. The ADP payrolls number will also be out two days before the all-important government jobs report and analysts forecast a reading of 150000 a sizable drop in comparison to last month’s 202000 figure.

Technical Corner. Although the relatively weak Dow has been tethering on the edge of a bearish short-term trend change this week stocks are still bullish from a long-term perspective and most of the key trend indicators are pointing higher. The major indices remain well above their rising 200-day moving averages of 8272 for the Nasdaq 3010 for the S&P 500 and 27013 for the Dow and the benchmarks also closed above their steeply rising 50-day moving averages of 3209 for the S&P 500 8973 for the Nasdaq and 28427 for the Dow.

The coming weeks could be crucial for the Great British pound and in turn global equities as currency markets will start to ‘price in’ the effects of the Brexit which just got official over the weekend. The currency drifted sideways before the country’s exit from the European Union (EU) after hitting an almost two-year high against the dollar in December. While the pound fell substantially this week and GBP/USD pair is still trading above both its short- and long-term moving averages and should its advancing trend continue U.S. and overseas stocks could get a long-term boost. Stay tuned!",,,,,,,,,,,,

(CBSNewYork) -- Con Edison says more than 1000 gallons of nonhazardous oil leaked from underground transmission cables into New Rochelle Harbor on Saturday.

As CBS2's Andrea Grymes reports it looked like water was gurgling up from a manhole but it wasn't.

The New Rochelle fire chief says it's actually oil streaming down the street and around the corner into Wright Island Marina spilling into New Rochelle Harbor which empties into the Long Island Sound.

""This is a catastrophe over here. I just got off my boat from fishing I fish these waters every day and now you see this. It's honestly crazy"" fisherman Mike Coccherst said.

""I feel sorry for the people at Wright Island Marina because all that oil is under their boats. All that oil has to be cleaned up"" New Rochelle resident Judith Cassara said.

Water in New Rochelle Harbor was speckled with what Con Edison believes is dielectric fluid on July 17 2021. (Credit: CBS2)

The water earlier Saturday was speckled with what Con Edison says is dielectric fluid.

Well over 1200 gallons of the fluid started leaking Saturday morning until 5:30 p.m. A spokesperson says it coats transmission cables to keep them cool describing it like a mineral oil and nonhazardous.

""Right now the only danger is slippage things of that nature. We're told it's that dielectric oil not PCBs anything like that"" New Rochelle Fire Chief Andrew Sandor said.

The fire department hazmat unit responded along with Con Edison and the Coast Guard. They put out yellow booms on the water to try to contain the fluid.

Despite Con Edison's assurances residents are still concerned about what this means for the Long Island Sound.

""People talking how much of this is going into the Sound what's the effect going to be on the wildlife on the fish"" New Rochelle resident Barbara Barletta said. ""Really sad. I mean you can smell it.""

One boater who was on the Sound told CBS2 she didn't notice any oil outside of the harbor so hopefully that's a good sign.

The Coast Guard says a water main break caused the massive spill. Con Edison says it 's responsible for the cleanup.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Coronavirus Delta variant was previously known as the Indian variant based on the mutation's origin.

The names were officially changed by the World Health Organization in May using the Greek alphabet to prevent stigma and simplify discussion but that does little to stop people making a connection between already-established brands which also share the name.

And it seems Delta are doing their best to avoid any link to their brand.

'We just call it the variant' Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal.

Other executives have 'privately grumbled' about the name sources told the Journal.

Executives with Delta Air Lines are unhappy the latest coronavirus variant shares the same name as the company

'We just call it the variant' Delta CEO Ed Bastian pictured said in an interview

Bastian says so far there has been no significant lull in bookings as a result of the connection. 'We haven't seen any drop off at all' Bastian confirmed.

'We prefer to call it the B.1.617.2 variant since that is so much more simple to say and remember…' said Dr. Henry Ting Delta Air Lines' chief health officer in a tweet.

The airline which is based in Atlanta was named after Mississippi Delta region where the carrier began as a crop duster.

Delta which in pre-pandemic times would fly 750 aircraft to more than 300 destinations around the world has been the butt of some jokes by their competitors.

'We prefer to call it the B.1.617.2 variant since that is so much more simple to say and remember…' said Dr. Henry Ting Delta Air Lines' chief health officer in a tweet

The airline says despite the crossover there has been no drop off in bookings. On Wednesday Delta Air Lines reported its first quarterly profit since the pandemic devastated the airline industry more than a year ago

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby was jokingly asked at a virtual Q&A at the Economic Club of Washington D.C. how he arranged to have the latest variant named after the airline.

'I did enjoy giving Ed Bastian a hard time when I saw him a few weeks ago' Kirby said.

Bastian isn't too concerned with the Delta variant affecting the business with the WHO already identifying other named strains of the disease.

'There's other variants coming up behind it.' he said. The WHO has noted Eta Iota Kappa and Lambda as 'variants of interest.'

The coronavirus pandemic lead to a difficult year in travel with demand for flights decimated. Major airlines lost $35 billion last year according to the Journal.

The names were officially changed by the World Health Organization in May using the Greek alphabet to prevent stigma and simplify discussion but that does little to stop people making a connection between already-established brands which also share the name (file photo)

Delta Air Lines say that with many customers being vaccinated there are few signs that the current variant is affecting travel bookings.

On Wednesday reported its first quarterly profit since the pandemic began boosted by about $1.5 billion in government aid and a summer rebound in vacation travel.

Delta said Wednesday that it earned $652 million in the second quarter. However Delta’s report shows that airlines still face turbulence as they try to rebound from their worst year ever.

Without $1.5 billion in federal pandemic relief and other one-time events the Atlanta airline would have posted an adjusted loss of $678 million.

Even though crowds at the nation’s airports are approaching 2019 levels Delta’s operating revenue is still only half of pre-pandemic levels.

Delta was the most profitable U.S. airline going into the pandemic and it is likely to emerge from virus outbreak at or near the front of the pack.

The Delta variant meanwhile is now the dominant strain of the virus in the U.S. and appears to be slightly better at evading vaccines compared to other variants that have preceded it.

The airline isn't the only Delta to have had a problem with its name.

Delta Goodrem 36 (pictured) has joked she's considering changing her name as the Delta variant of Covid-19 locks down millions of Australians

Australian singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem revealed she is considering changing her name.

The 36-year-old who is currently isolating in Sydney with her boyfriend Matthew Copley floated the idea with fans last week on Twitter while promoting an upcoming series of online performances.

'Hi all it’s me the artist formerly known as Delta [wonky face emoji]' the Born To Try singer lamented.

'Looking for a new name and Tour songs to sing for THURSDAY NIGHT BUNKERDOWN SESSION!! Let me know your dream songs and ideas for the setlist xxx' she added.

At the start of the pandemic last year Corona beer suffered an initial drop in sales after sharing a similar name to the pathogen that shares the same name.

‘There is no question that Corona beer is suffering because of the coronavirus’ said Ronn Torossian the founder of 5WPR the public relations firm which conducted the survey at the time in March 2020.

'Could one imagine walking into a bar and saying ""Hey can I have a Corona?"" or ""Pass me a Corona""' he said.

Unfortunately the racing and cruising days of this particular McLaren 720S Spider have been brutally ended by a horrific crash which took out a big chunk out of its right-hand side complete with the front axle. The bumper and front hood have seen better days and so has the windscreen.The interior will need some TLC too because the side airbag has deployed in the accident. And since we’ve moved on to the interior it is worth noting that the odometer indicated only 3049 miles (4907 km) at the time of the crash.Why did we mention that? For the simple fact that it is offered for sale with Copart listing it for one of their upcoming auctions. The car is located in Atlanta Georgia and has an estimated retail value of $345113 according to the ad.While it doesn’t exactly look salvageable anything is possible for the right person. So if you feel like this would make a fine project  then you should definitely get in touch with the vendor and assess the entire wreck including the underbody and oily bits.The latter include that fine twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 engine  with an 8500 rpm redline that develops 710(720 PS / 530) and 568 lb-ft (770 Nm) of torque according to the official spec sheet. A seven-speed SSG channels the power to the rear wheels which rockets the British supercar to 62 mph (100 kph) in 2.9 seconds and up to a maximum speed of 212 mph (341 kph).",,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the last year’s model that was still a mid-range smartphone with Snapdragon 765G this year’s model will have flagship-like performance thanks to the MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI. Yesterday we saw a leaked poster revealed by OnePlus that confirmed the smartphone’s design and its upcoming Blue Hazer color finish. Now more renders have emerged through an online report. The report reveals all the colorways in which the OnePlus Nord 2 5G will arrive. The leak also confirms the OnePlus 9-esque design.

According to a report from Pricebaba alongside tipster Ishan Agarwal confirmed the previously leaked design on the OnePlus Nord 2 5G. The design language is reminiscent of the OnePlus 9 series. In addition the device will come in just two colorways – Grey Sierra and Blue Haze. Both variants can be seen through the newly leaked renders.

HQ,"Irvine-based real estate investor and developer J+R Group has bought the creative office building that holds the headquarters of dental-practice manager Pacific Dental Services Inc. in what’s the largest reported single-building office transaction in Irvine so far this year.



The company paid $34 million for 17000 Red Hill Ave. a 118000-square-foot building across the street from the headquarters of Edwards Lifesciences Corp.



The deal works out to a price of about $288 per square foot and marks a nearly 30% premium over the $26.5 million that Palo Alto-based Menlo Equities LLC paid for the complex in 2014 shortly after a major renovation project that converted the former industrial site into its current use.



The Newport Beach office of Eastdil Secured represented Menlo Equites in the sale according to CoStar Group Inc. records.

Dental Work



A holding company with ties to the ownership group of Pacific Dental paid about $13.6 million for the Red Hill building in 2012 then a 40-year-old warehouse last occupied by an electronics and communication unit of defense and aerospace manufacturer Rockwell Collins.



It subsequently spent nearly another $11 million to renovate the building.



Pacific Dental is one of the largest dental support organizations in the country with over 800 affiliated offices across 24 states. The company builds and manages office practices for dentists taking care of just about everything except the actual dentistry.



With $1.6 billion in 2020 revenue the company ranked No. 11 among OC’s largest private companies on this year’s list.



In addition to holding the dental management company’s headquarters the site also includes a dental office among other tenants.

J+R Portfolio



The acquisition is the first reported local buy in a few years for J+R Group an investor with ties to China that over the past decade has amassed an extensive portfolio of commercial properties and development sites along the West Coast primarily in and around the airport area of Irvine and in Portland Ore.



It has been a buyer and seller over that time. Notable sales include 2581 Alton Parkway a project J+R Group bought in 2013 and sold three years later to PLC Land Group which then converted the warehouse site into a 170-unit apartment project dubbed The Murphy. The complex is near the intersection of Jamboree and Alton; construction wrapped in 2019.



Menlo Equities and J+R Group have been involved in other local transactions. J+R paid Menlo about $36 million in 2014 for a 143700-square-foot office and data center project at 2525 Main St.



J+R has since sold the two buildings for about $27 million to an affiliate of World Financial Group though the property still serves as the company’s headquarters. Apartments are expected on another part of the Main Street property.

SCP Development



In other notable area projects J+R Group is developing a new two-story food hall within the Bloomingdale’s wing of South Coast Plaza.



J+R founder and CEO Morgan Zhang told the Business Journal earlier this year that he carefully selected the brands going into the 16000-square-foot Collage project which he said will “raise the bar in terms of cohesive luxury design.”



Collage which is located where the Charlie Palmer restaurant previously operated is expected to include about nine concepts. The first tenant there had a soft opening a few weeks ago and more are coming online this summer.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This weekend a group of Costco members compiled a list of bakery goods they said they'd dream to see in the food court. Check out what happened when one Costco employee said they'd made this recommendation to upper management.

Read the Costco bakery wish-list that members want to see in the food court—and do not miss The One Costco Bakery Hack Everyone Should Know About. (Editor's note: Some images may differ slightly from the actual products at Costco though we aimed to meet the closest representation.)

Costco's Chocolate Chip Cookies

It all started Saturday when u/Middle-Journalist762 posted a recommendation in the Costco community on Reddit:

They should sell their chocolate chip cookies in the food court. I'd buy one every time I shopped! Can't commit to a giant container of them from the bakery but if they were available at the food court. Game changer. There is no prep easy to dish out . . . Man! Who do I need to contact to make this happen!

We saw the post and we got on it. Meantime u/scooterj76 suggested an idea for how Costco could keep their food court chocolate chippers warm: ""Options for lightly frozen or warmed in the churro case would be the bomb!"" Touché.

Cinnamon Rolls

u/slavnar95 got in on the brainstorm: ""The cinnamon rolls they sell would be easy and awesome. They are huge. 2 bucks apiece I'd get one every now and then."" [sic]

Indeed the Costco cinnamon rolls are so popular the company created a giant box of the miniature version at one point.

Costco Chocolate Chip Cookies with Soft Serve

U/sauce07 saw the convo and offered this upgrade to the chocolate chip cookies: ""Combine the cookie with the soft serve charge me $3. Please and thank you.""

That might seem a little over-the-top but we'll give it to you Sauce07. After all it is National Ice Cream Day.

A Costco Bakery Rotation

Redditor u/Evan_Evan_Evan was all about problem-solving and innovation: ""I wish they would rotate bakery items in the food court so people would try them. Saves them on sampling them."" We're fans.

On that note…

Clearly aware of the passion many Costco members feel for the food court u/cursesonyourmom appears to be a Costco employee who had the forethought for this awhile back—they'd thought of u/Evan_Evan_Evan's idea too and did something about it. ""I actually suggested this to my warehouse manager during a one on one meeting a bit before covid hit the fan"" they said. ""No idea if it went anywhere with all the craziness."" (Costco we know you reward dedicated employees!)

One possible solution for now…

Unless the decision-makers of Costco put members' input to use on this food court/bakery collab (as one popular steakhouse chain just did with their beloved bread) some Costco community members on Reddit offered what proved to be a common recommendation on the thread: Buy the cookies from the bakery then freeze them until a craving strikes.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

U/nycgirl2112 was one who said: ""I buy the entire container and put them in the freezer. The chocolate chip cookies freeze beautifully. I take one out when I want one and set in on the counter for about 5 min. Freezing also helps so I don't sit and eat the entire container in a day!"" [sic]

Whatever it takes to practice mindful eating—even from Costco's bakery!

Clearly anyone with a nut allergy should avoid the mix at all costs. A post on Reddit a month ago noted that the mix has also been reformulated somewhat and that there are now also peanut M&Ms though not reflected (yet) in the packaging's art (via Eat This Not That!).

Some might be surprised to know this snack is listed as Kosher on the Costco website (via Costco). Those with allergies should be aware however that the product is packaged in a facility that also contains wheat and eggs. There are about 60 quarter-cup servings per bag which yields about 160 calories per serving.

And when it comes to eating everyone has their own method. Says fan tahoeparis ""I set aside the M&Ms (mostly) and give them to guys in the office. I'm more about the salty nuts and sweet raisins!"" while another fan yusuphysique shared ""All the mms are gone already lol and then the almonds!"" Meanwhile user abandhanship added ""i take out all the raisins first.""

However you eat them this Costco find seems like a pretty good deal and a longtime favorite. Sometimes classics are the best.",,,,,,

July 18 2021

Story By Mike McGlothlin

Just when you thought there couldn’t possibly be another 6.0L Power Stroke competing in one of diesel drag racing’s fastest classes we’ve got another one to tell you about. And just when you assumed that every Dodge Ram in 5.90 Index packed a common-rail Cummins under the hood we’ve got an old-school P-pumped 12-valve to show you. For even added diversity the GM camp gets represented in this installment too and Dan Zelten’s compound turbocharged GMC does a fine job of proving what a Duramax is capable of in this extremely fast neck-and-neck racing category. Whether you root for Ford Ram or GM we’ve got a wicked-fast example for you to study up on below.

Logan Yelton’s ’93 First-Gen

Things are certainly different for Logan Yelton now than they were when he was a teenager—and that includes his ’93 Dodge W250. The old-school first-gen Cummins was his first diesel and he’s held onto it for many years even transforming it into the 5.90-second screamer you see here. Logan has only been to one race so far in 2021 and has yet to use much of the truck’s immense potential but when he becomes a regular on the ODSS circuit watch out. Logan owns his own transmission shop Loganbuilt and works closely with industry icons Scheid Diesel and Goerend Transmission so you know the powertrain will be rock-steady as soon as Logan is fully able to turn the truck loose.

Logan’s Mechanical Monster

Under the hood it looks like something you’d find on a Pro Stock pulling truck. All Scheid the P-pump hanging off the side of the block makes use of 13mm plungers and an auto governor sending fuel through 0.120 oversize lines to a set of International-based injectors equipped with massive 5x0.035-inch nozzles. A concrete-filled factory 5.9L Cummins block houses R&R rods 14.8:1 compression Wiseco pistons and a Scheid Diesel cam. Larger diameter 14mm main and head studs are employed with the OEM 12-valve head receiving extensive port work at Scheid. A single Pro Mod 88 from Precision Turbo & Engine sits on a custom stainless steel exhaust manifold and we’re told the setup is good for at least 1800 hp.

Steel Body Back-Half Four-Link Suspension And A Full Interior

As with most of the truck Logan built the transmission. It’s a Loganbuilt dump valve trans-brake 48RE with a Goerend non-lockup converter and a full manual valvebody (also from Goerend). A Cory Dow-built NP241 constant 4-Hi transfer case sends power to a factory Dana 60 with aluminum 5-lug hubs and dual caliper Wilwood brakes and to an Advanced Chassis-built 9-inch rear axle with a Strange HD third member and 35-spline axles. The truck sports an all-steel body but has been back-halved and graced with a four-link suspension system front and rear. The cage certifies Logan for 8.50s in the quarter-mile but didn’t come at the expense of gutting the interior.

Dan Zelten’s Fire-Breathing GMC

Wisconsin native Dan Zelten doesn’t mind traveling to the ODSS circuit’s East Coast events and has yet to miss a race in 2021. His GMC Sierra is different than most with a Ford 4R100 from Brian’s Truck Shop parked behind his big cube Duramax. His Truck Source Diesel-supported GMC is nasty to say the least competing at a 5000-pound race weight whereas most competitors tip the scales at much less than that. Despite the heft Dan has been 5.71 in the past on a different engine and believes his new power plant is capable of 5.50s.

SoCal Stroker Big Compounds And Plenty Of Fuel

Machined and assembled by SoCal Diesel Dan’s Duramax is one of the Valencia California company’s coveted 7.1L stroker builds. As you can see the engine is fed boost from two turbochargers arranged in a two-stage compound arrangement. The big guy (i.e. atmosphere turbo) is a 98mm GT55 and the valley charger (high-pressure unit) measures 80mm on the compressor (inducer) side. The duo combines for as much as 119 psi of boost according to data logs and is matched by a potent fuel system from S&S Diesel Motorsport. The injectors are internally modified and equipped with 350-percent over nozzles while twin 12mm CP3’s maintain rail pressure.

Trey Dunavant’s No-Frills 6.0L Ford

You’ve read about Trey Dunavant’s 6.0L Power Stroke on DrivingLine before but now it’s even faster. Recently Trey has been as quick as 5.72 through the eighth-mile (at 119 mph) making his truck one of the fastest 6.0L Fords in the nation. On race day he slows the 4300-pound Super Duty down a peg or two in order to avoid breaking out. Trey’s build represents another solid effort from the 6.0L faithful in a very fast racing category. Plus his Power Stroke still sports the factory-based (HEUI) injection system.

Big Injectors Single Turbo Nitrous And A 4R100

Trey’s juiced-up 6.0L is made possible thanks to a host of companies that have remained dedicated to the 6.0L platform over the years. For high-flow injectors Warren Diesel stepped in with a set of its 430cc 7mm hybrids. Trey keeps the big sticks happy with a dual high-pressure oil pump system he pieced together himself. The engine was put together by Kill Devil Diesel and features Carrillo rods Kill Devil’s stage 3 camshaft and O-ringed heads. An S476 with a 96mm turbine wheel from Forced Inductions pushes boost through an On 3 Performance intercooler and a 4R100 from Twisted Diesel helps the truck plant roughly 1100 hp to the pavement. The engine is armed with a pair of Nitrous Express kits too.

Actress Laura Niemi chatted with Digital Journal’s Markos Papadatos about starring in “Pool Boy” with Pat Towne and she opened up about her experience in the hit series “This Is Us.”

Laura Niemi is known for playing Milo Ventimiglia’s mom Marilyn Pearson on the hit NBC series “This Is Us.” “This experience is a gift. It’s one of the best gigs in town. I feel very lucky to be a part of that world. Great people to work with people at the top of their game” she said. “Dan Fogelman is the coolest guy in the world. Milo Ventimiglia is just a love he is a wonderful human being.”

She is currently in the Warner Bros. film “Those Who Wish Me Dead” starring Angelina Jolie and directed by Taylor Sheridan. “That movie was great. I filmed that in New Mexico a couple of years ago” she said. “Angelina is a wonderful person to work with as well. She was very down-to-earth cool and committed to her craft. She was fierce.”

Niemi will star with Pat Towne in the world premiere production of “Pool Boy” tonight. It is presented poolside at a gorgeous home on Mulholland Drive with a spectacular view of Los Angeles from the Hollywood Hills. This unique theater event will have a limited run on Saturdays and Sundays at 5:15 p.m. starting on July 17 and it runs thru August 22. “I am very excited” she admitted. “Nervous excited the whole thing. All of the things that you are supposed to be feeling.”

“I call it a beautiful date night” she said. “Everybody gets to enjoy this beautiful view at Mulholland as the sun is setting.”

This covid-friendly outdoor event will be the first site-specific play under the Lost Angels Theatre Company’s banner. LATC which won the 2005 Ovation award for Tracy Letts’ Killer Joe is once again teaming up with director Scott Cummins (Killer Joe Bug) and will mark their third collaboration. Cummins won the Ovation Award for his direction in LATC’s production of Killer Joe. Playwright Wendy Hopkins penned this two-hander comedy which features a cast of two Ovation award-winning actors Laura Niemi and Pat Towne.

The play “Pool Boy” is set in Los Angeles during the 2020 pandemic and house sitter Glenn is looking after an elite home in the Hollywood Hills. Isolated and desperate for human contact she attempts to make a connection with an atypical Pool Boy. Despite their contrasting personalities and rusty social skills they forge an unlikely bond in a Covid colored world.

After an inconceivably odd year LATC presents this unique theatrical experience as a love letter to the “City of Angels” celebrating its art and beauty in a quintessentially Californian way with the sun on their faces. “The reason I did ‘Pool Boy’ is that it’s my love letter to Los Angeles. It really is” she said. “I wanted to acknowledge the elephant in the room with this beautiful play since it addresses what happened last year and how weird we all got. Being able to have a catharsis and laugh at what just happened.”

For young and aspiring actors she said “Have a job that will help you support acting through the hard times. Do something else that gives you joy. Just keep the joy alive without having the financial stress of it.”

On being an actress in the digital age she exclaimed “I love it. This is fantastic. I get to shoot things on my iPhone it has been incredible. I filmed a pilot on my iPhone and it came out fantastic.”

She listed Oscar winners Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell as her dream acting partners in the entertainment business. “I adore Frances” she said. “I love Sam Rockwell too. Also directors really intrigue me. It is nice to have scene partners that have different ways of working.”

Regarding the title of the current chapter of her life she said with a sweet laugh “Saving the Best for Last.”

Niemi defined the word success as “peace” and “having serenity.”

An Irishman has been named one of the best bartenders in the world after serving up a curious flavour at a world cocktail-making contest with a drink infused with natural dyes used in Irish wool jumpers.

Cal Byrne 27 picked the novel ingredients as a way to highlight his project to connect artists and traditional craftspeople whose livelihoods have been hit during the pandemic.

Mr Byrne who is originally from Galway was among 50 finalists competing at the first-ever virtual version of the World Class Bartender of the Year finals earlier this month.

He is the first Irish person to ever reach the final ten in the prestigious competition.

Canadian James Grant was awarded first place at the event.

Rather than making cocktails in person finalists presented remotely to a panel of judges based in London with the help of ‘avatar’ assistants who mixed the drinks on their behalf on site.

Mr Byrne a barman at the Blind Pig Speakeasy in Dublin has created an online platform to make it easier for people working in arts and crafts to find opportunities in the hospitality industry in the wake of Covid-19.

“I’ve seen so many amazingly talented young craftspeople artists and musicians who have been really hit hard maybe more so than our industry at this time” he said.

“So I created an internet-based forum to basically connect our industry with these craftspeople who are as integral to a wonderful cocktail experience as somebody who makes the drinks.

“The music that’s on the design of the space the art of the space the implements you’re using to drink and to eat – it’s all so important.

“So I wanted to create a space that allows those people all over the world to connect.”

In a nod to his initiative he will represented Ireland at the finals wearing a jumper made by his friend Co Donegal knitwear designer Aisling McCallion.

And the natural flower-based ingredients used to dye the wool have inspired a cocktail he presented to the judges.

“I found out that all the materials that the dyer ladies in Ireland used to use are all edible and quite nice so I made a drink to go alongside the jumper that is made with the ingredients used to dye the jumpers so I’m pretty happy with that. I think that’s a pretty fun one” he said.

Simon Earley Global Head of Diageo World Class said: “Our first-ever virtual World Class Final has been a huge success and has resulted in one the most innovative and creative competitions we have ever seen.

“The judges were blown away by James Grant's creativity and originality creating serves that were amazing to experience visually virtually and in person. They are a fully deserving winner and I’m really excited to start working with them as a World Class ambassador in the year ahead.”"

The burning heat of summer has us all reaching for sunscreens. But before you slather that product on your skin first check to see if it is part of a voluntary recall by sunscreen brands Neutrogena and Aveeno.

The companies recently pulled several sunscreens from market shelves after independent testing had found they were contaminated with a cancer-causing chemical called benzene.

“Exposure to benzene increases the risk of developing leukemia and other blood disorders” according to the National Cancer Institute.

CVS Health also stopped selling two of its after-sun care products due to similar findings. But other sunscreens and after-sun cosmetics which also tested positive for the toxin remain on the market (the full list is below).

The vast majority of tested sunscreens however were free of benzene and experts stress the importance of sunscreen use to protect skin from the aging and cancerous effects of the sun.

“It is NOT a reason to stop using sun protection which is known to prevent skin cancer. To do so would be like hearing a particular car model was recalled and then committing to never drive again” dermatologist Dr. Ranella Hirsch a past president of the American Society of Cosmetic Dermatology and Aesthetic Surgery posted on Instagram.

How did brand-name sunscreens become contaminated with benzene? Should you be concerned? And what can you do to protect yourself and your family? We’ve gathered answers to these questions and more.

Which sunscreens were recalled?

All batches or lots of these four Neutrogena spray sunscreens and one Aveeno spray were voluntarily recalled this week by parent company Johnson & Johnson (J&J) “out of an abundance of caution”:

Neutrogena® Beach Defense® aerosol

Neutrogena® Cool Dry Sport aerosol

Neutrogena® Invisible Daily™ defense aerosol

Neutrogena® Ultra Sheer® aerosol

Aveeno® Protect + Refresh aerosol

“While benzene is not an ingredient in any of our sunscreen products it was detected in some samples of the impacted aerosol sunscreen finished products” J&J reported in a statement. “Consumers should stop using these specific products and appropriately discard them.”

Specific lots of all recalled Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreens can be found here and customers can call with questions and request a refund by completing this form or calling 1-800-458-1673.

CVS also stopped selling CVS Health After Sun Aloe Vera and CVS Health After Sun Aloe Vera Spray a day after the Johnson & Johnson recall was announced.

Mike DeAngelis senior director of CVS Health’s corporate communications told CNN the company is “cooperating with Johnson & Johnson’s voluntary recall.”

He said that “CVS products have not been recalled” but the company has paused sales of the two CVS products which tested positive for benzene “out of an abundance of caution.” CVS Health is working with the supplier of the products to “take appropriate additional steps” he added.

However one of the CVS products on the list of benzene-contaminated products After-sun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel “is still for sale” DeAngelis said.

Why were the sunscreens recalled?

The voluntary recalls and pause in sales came after an independent lab tested 294 samples from 69 brands of sprays lotions gels and creams designed to protect the skin from the sun or care for the skin after sun. Of those 78 samples tested positive for benzene.

Contamination appeared in specific batches of sunscreen rather than a specific brand said David Light CEO and founder of Valisure the independent lab that ran the tests.

“The finding of benzene in sunscreen was certainly surprising to me as a scientist and a consumer. I’m quite a heavy user of sunscreen myself; I have five kids and we all use sunscreen so it was rather concerning to find such high levels” Light said.

Multiple samples contained “significantly detectable benzene and some batches contained up to 3.1 times the conditionally restricted limit” according to the citizen petition asking for action that Valisure filed with the US Food and Drug Administration.

“We petitioned the FDA to recall or to request recalls of the products that are 0.1 per million and above” Light told CNN. “It’s obvious that we shouldn’t be taking that risk and we just wanted it cleaned up.”

Samples of three of the recalled Neutrogena spray sunscreens – Beach Defense Invisible Daily and Ultra Sheer – and one CVS brand – After-sun Aloe Vera Soothing Spray – had levels of benzene that were 2 parts per million or higher according to Valisure’s tests.

Another spray Neutrogena’s Cool Dry Sport and CVS Health’s After-sun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel tested at .01 to 2 parts per million of benzene in some samples.

Aveeno’s Protect + Refresh aerosol which was the fifth sunscreen recalled by J&J was not tested by Valisure.

“We did not have the chance of acquiring any of the Aveeno sprays but it certainly sounds like Johnson & Johnson’s own internal testing confirms our overall concern with benzene in the sunscreens” Light said.

According to J&J daily exposure to benzene in these sunscreen products “at the levels detected in internal testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.”

“There is not a safe level of benzene that can exist in sunscreen products” said Dr. Christopher Bunick associate professor of dermatology at Yale University in Valisure’s press release. “Even benzene at 0.1 ppm (parts per million) in a sunscreen could expose people to excessively high nanogram amounts of benzene.”

Which products were not recalled?

Samples of Eco Formula Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 Advanced After-Sun Gel by Sun Burst Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 by SunBurnt Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 by Goodsense Ultimate Sheer Sunscreen Lotion SPF 70 by TopCare Everyday and UV Aero Broad-Spectrum Full-Body Sunscreen Spray SPF 45 by EltaMD all tested for benzene at levels of 2 parts per million or higher.

Samples of three Banana Boat products also contained levels of benzene at those levels: Kids Max Protect & Play Sunscreen C-Spray SPF 100 UltraMist Deep Tanning Dry Oil Continuous Clear Spray SPF 4 and Ultra Sport Clear Sunscreen Spray SPF 100.

To date CNN was not able to verify that any of these products have been recalled following Valisure’s request to that effect to the FDA.

The sunscreens tested by Valisure were only a tiny sample of the more than 11000 registered sun care products on the market.

The Personal Care Products Council an industry association said its members were “firmly committed” to providing products with “ingredients that have been thoroughly tested for safety and follow the requirements of the law.”

“We are aware of the study reporting the presence of benzene in some of the sunscreen products tested” the council said in a statement. “There is nothing more important than safety. If our consumers can’t believe in a product or rely on it to do what it says then nothing else matters.”

What is benzene?

Benzene is a natural component of crude oil gasoline and cigarette smoke and ranks in the top 20 chemicals used for production of “lubricants rubbers dyes detergents drugs and pesticides” as well as “plastics resins and nylon and synthetic fibers” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At room temperature benzene is a colorless or light yellow liquid with a sweet odor. Highly flammable it will float on water and while it evaporates quickly it is heavier than air and can sink into low-lying areas the CDC noted.

Gas emissions from volcanoes and forest fires are natural sources of benzene but the largest sources are emissions from burning coal and oil motor vehicle exhaust and evaporation from gasoline service stations according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).

Exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause death the ATSDR says but the impacts of eating foods or drinking liquids containing lower levels of benzene are not known.

“If you spill benzene on your skin it may cause redness and sores. Benzene in your eyes may cause general irritation and damage to your cornea” the ATSDR said.

Cigarette smoke and off-gassing from furniture wax detergents glue and paint are sources of indoor exposure to benzene according to the CDC while outdoor air can be polluted with benzene from “gas stations motor vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions.”

How did benzene get into sunscreens?

No one knows for sure how the toxin ended up in sun care products. Benzene was not an ingredient in any of the sunscreens so experts suspect contamination had to have occurred during the manufacturing process.

“There are a lot of theories” said Scott Faber the senior vice president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group (EWG) a non-profit consumer health advocacy group which puts out a yearly guide to safe sunscreens.

“Benzene could be a byproduct of the process of making the chemicals that companies sell to the formulators of personal care products and sunscreens. Or it could be that some of those chemicals break down into benzene although that seems less likely” Faber said.

“But it’s very alarming especially since the FDA does not require companies to test ingredients for contaminants nor does it require testing for such chemicals at a finished product stage” he added.

What is the FDA doing?

In response to Valisure’s petition the FDA told CNN that it “evaluates and assesses the information provided in citizen petitions of this type and generally initiates an independent testing and verification process.”

“While the FDA evaluates the citizen petition submitted by Valisure we will continue to monitor sunscreen manufacturing and marketing to help ensure the availability of safe sunscreens for U.S. consumers” an FDA spokesperson said.

How can I tell if my sunscreen is contaminated?

Because the contamination was sporadic and likely occurred accidentally there is no way for consumers to look at a label and choose a product without benzene Faber said.

“Sadly consumers are screwed. There’s no way to shop around this problem” Faber said adding that consumers can petition for new regulations to more thoroughly test consumer care products for toxins and contaminants.

“People can tell the FDA to require over-the-counter sunscreen product companies to test for contaminants like benzene and people can tell Congress to pass laws to modernize cosmetics safety laws” he said.

Valisure has committed to testing additional sun care products as they have space in their lab schedules and it is encouraging people to send in sunscreens and sun care products they have purchased to be analyzed.

If you’re interested in having your sunscreen tested in their crowdsourcing study the full instructions on how to package and send your product can be found here.

How can I protect my family?

Benzene is not the only concern when it comes to sunscreen. A number of sunscreens have been shown to be ineffective or contain chemicals that can enter the bloodstream and disrupt hormones. In EWG’s 2021 guide to sunscreens they analyzed over 1800 products and found that 75% did not provide adequate sun protection – or included ingredients linked to harm. Still there were over 200 products that did meet their safety standards.

All of this uncertainty may leave consumers unsure of what to do and experts worry some may forgo the use of sunscreen altogether. But experts warned that’s an even worse idea. Melanoma one of the most deadly forms of skin cancer has been on the rise globally for decades. And while survival rates are getting better melanoma is still the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States.

And of course it’s always a great choice to use common sense practices as well to protect your skin from harmful rays. Wear shorts shirts pants and hats to help block dangerous rays and apply safe sunscreens to exposed skin. Wisely choose your time in the sun by avoiding the most intense rays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and seek shade whenever possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3czQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbmVlZC1hLWpvYi1jaGFybGVzdG9uLXZpcnR1YWwtY2FyZWVyLWZhaXItaGFwcGVuaW5nLW1vbmRhedIBXmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3czQuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lZWQtYS1qb2ItY2hhcmxlc3Rvbi12aXJ0dWFsLWNhcmVlci1mYWlyLWhhcHBlbmluZy1tb25kYXk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Need a job?

The town gossip mayor knows everything about everyone and she has a hard time keeping any of it to herself. Still the only thing bigger than Hope's mouth is her heart. (Mel and Jack might've never gotten together without her!) So Virgin River fans were pretty worried when when Hope who is played by actress Annette O'Toole was largely absent from the Netflix drama's third season.

Read on for everything you need to know about Hope's absence from Virgin River—and whether she's ever coming back.

Where is Hope in Virgin River?

During the first episode of season 3 we learned that Hope had to leave town to visit her sick aunt. She never showed up after that with the exception of a few appearances via FaceTime while video chatting with Doc (Tim Matheson). But it's still Hope we're talking about—and drama follows her wherever she goes! Cue a dangerous hurricane a delayed return home and a scary accident that left Hope's future very uncertain. (Uncertain like say when Jack got shot. No spoilers though!)

Although Hope's presence was definitely felt in every episode she was actually supposed to play a much bigger part in season 3. Showrunner Sue Tenney explained to Entertainment Weekly that her virtual role was a ""pandemic pivot"" to keep Annette and the rest of the Virgin River cast safe.

Hate to ask but...does Hope die in Virgin River?

We told you—no spoilers! Still despite the ominous cliffhanger at the end of season 3 it sounds like Hope will return to Virgin River at some point in the not-yet-confirmed season 4.

""We've worked very hard to make sure she was still very much in the show"" Sue said. ""If we have a fourth season everyone is now vaccinated and the pandemic is not what it was. So I would hope that we would have Annette back.""

Phew! Can't wait 'til season 4 to find out exactly what happens? There might be some answers in Virgin River book series!

Residents can now access free at-home self administered COVID-19 testing kits through the Webster County Health Department as part of a partnership with the Iowa Department of Public Health and Test Iowa.

“This is an added method for COVID-19 testing that is now available to residents who think they may have COVID-19” said Kari Prescott Webster County Health Department director.

The free COVID-19 test kit will walk residents step-by-step through collecting a saliva sample at home. These kits are available by calling the Webster County Health Department at 515-573-4107.

“We want to ensure that residents have access to a testing kit if they feel that they need one” said Prescott. “We can drop a test off on a person’s doorstep if they feel that they are too sick to pick one up. We can meet them in our parking lot and hand it to them as they drive through. We can also leave a kit in the lobby of our building if we know a resident is coming to pick it up. We would only ask that if you are sick that you wear a mask.”

Once the saliva sample has been collected the kit can then be shipped by UPS to the State Hygienic Lab. Results will later be sent via email. All test kits include step-by-step information to help residents through the collection process.

Testing continues to also be available in Webster County at UnityPoint Health-Fort Dodge and at Community Health Center of Fort Dodge.

The best way for residents to protect themselves against COVID-19 is to get vaccinated. The vaccine is available to limit the severity of the illness. Vaccines continue to be available in Webster County at Daniel Pharmacy HyVee CVS and Walgreens.

“Our message is simple” said Prescott. “Get vaccinated. Wash your hands. Stay home if you are sick.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzE3L3N1cGVyd29tYW4tbnljLW1vbS1zaWJsaW5ncy1yZWNvdW50LXNhdmluZy1ib3ktZnJvbS1raWRuYXBwZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Superwoman' Queens mom siblings recount saving boy from kidnapper,"The apparently deranged stranger who snatched a boy off a Queens sidewalk and threw him into a car — only to have the child’s quick-thinking and faster-moving mom grab him back — handled the kid “like he was a bag of garbage” the victim’s big brother told The Post.

Dolores Diaz Lopez 45 was walking along Hillside Avenue in Richmond Hill Thursday night taking her three kids to see their mechanic dad Benjamin Diaz at work when a man she didn’t know leapt from a nearby maroon sedan.

Jacob had just let go of her hand running a little bit in front of her on the wide and fairly empty sidewalk. She said she was watching him.

The next thing she knew a man sprinted out of a car grabbed Jacob and ran back to the vehicle with him.

“Then I saw the man coming out of the car. He ran towards Jacob” Lopez told The Post. “I was scared. I screamed ‘Oh my God he is taking my kid!”

“He picked him up like he was a bag of garbage” said Jacob’s 9-year-old brother Benny. “The car was close by. He opened the passenger door in the back and threw my brother in the car. He shut the door and locked it.”

James McGonagle 24 has been charged with attempted kidnapping in the bizarre shocking incident.

Diaz Lopez Benny and 8-year-old daughter Zuriely sprang into action like a trio from an action movie — and rescued a stunned Jacob.

“I ran around the other side of the car and tried to open the door” Zuriley told The Post. “I pulled it but it didn’t open. The man locked the door with my brother inside the car.”

Benny recalled McGonagle’s passenger in the sedan ask the apparently crazed kidnapper “What are you doing?”

“He was sitting in the passenger seat in the front” Benny said of the man who police sources identified Saturday as McGonagle’s father. “The man who took Jacob said ‘We are kidnapping the kid.’”

It was up to Mom to finally save the day.

“Jacob stood up in the back seat and I pulled him out through the front passenger window” she said as she gestured out both arms made fists and pulled her arms in showing how she grabbed her son out of the car.

She grabbed Jacob through the front window because the windows in the back were locked.

“Give me that stupid kid back!” McGonagle yelled. But by then a crowd had gathered and the men took off.

“He didn’t want to get caught” said Benny.

Lopez said she was beyond relieved when Jacob was back in her arms.

“I was in shock. My kids were in shock” she said. “I hugged my three kids. They held on to me and I held them tight. I was saying Thanks God thanks God. I was determined to get Jacob back. I would do anything to rescue any of my children.”

Benny said all the kids were in tears after Jacob was rescued.

““I was non-stop crying” the little boy told The Post. “One of the detectives went to the deli to buy us three ring pops to calm us down but I was still crying non-stop. I only stopped when I went to the police station and I saw cartoons.”

Said Zuriely “I was afraid. I hugged my brother. I didn’t say anything. I just hugged him.”

McGonagle 24 was arrested Friday after he showed up at Brookdale Hospital apparently in the middle of a meltdown and punched an innocent bystander. He was admitted to the hospital’s psychiatric unit.

His father also named James McGonagle 55 was with his son at the time of the attempted abduction and was also with him at the hospital.

Cops they are looking for the father who was reportedly shocked when his son tried to kidnap Jacob as a witness.

Lopez said Jacob never cried during the ordeal and she thinks he was “confused.” But he wasn’t confused when cops showed him photos of McGonagle and he identified him.

The detectives showed Jacob a picture of the man and Jacob said in Spanish ‘He robbed me’” said Benny who added “I don’t want anything to happen to my brother again or my sister.”

Lopez said she called her husband to tell him and he’s “still in shock.”

“I’m superwoman for my kids now” Lopez recalled noting she’s a little nervous to go back out onto the street with her kids again.

“Oh my God I want to have three hands” she said laughing."

Chipotle  Target  WWE and Shopify are among the companies teaming up with TikTok Resumes a pilot program that lets job candidates submit video resumes on the social platform. The recruitment offering is yet another way for companies to connect with potential employees as the war for talent rages on.

Restaurants bars and fast-food chains are finding it especially hard to hire staff to replace those let go at the beginning of the pandemic. Many of these workers are either not comfortable returning to the profession and are still on the sidelines or have left the industry completely.

Marissa Andrada the chief people officer for Chipotle says the restaurant chain already had 1.6 million followers on TikTok when it considered the idea of partnering with the platform on video resumes.

""We have a crazy brand following and it's always great to see what fan videos are about"" Andrada said.

Since the majority of employees in Chipotle restaurants are Gen Z and millennials ""why not lean into their energy?"" Andrada said. ""TikTok Resumes is a way to engage with them in a way they already like to connect with us.""

With the rise of career and job-related content on social media platforms Andrada said that letting people show off their creativity is an effective way for the company to find the right talent.

1 of 7

CHINA GROVE — Wearing his favorite cowboy boots Jacob Morrison drew the crowd’s attention on Saturday morning as he did donuts in his miniature John Deere tractor under a big tent in Hanna park.

His showman-like display won over the hearts of the judges and earned him a trophy in the 3-5 year-old division of the Little Mr. and Miss Farmer contest during China Grove’s 40th annual Farmers Day. The third time was in fact the charm for Morrison who competed in the contest twice before.

The secret to Jacob’s success on Saturday?

“I guess he was just being a confident little farmer” said Jayme Morrison his proud mother.

Morrison was one of 23 toddlers who competed in the contest which is organized by Atrium Health and has been going on as long as Farmers Day itself.

“It’s probably one of the most fun things about Farmers Day and it’s such a good tradition” said Sherry Wilson a senior associate of community engagement and corporate responsibility with Atrium Health. “It really is an honor for us to host.”

Every contestant went home with a ribbon and a gift bag full of Atrium Health goodies but the top boy and girl in each of the four categories also took home shiny gold tractor trophies. Lee Edward Ealey Jr. took first in the boys 1-2 year-old division. Sunny Rae Turner claimed the top prize in the girls 1-2 year-old division. Morrison was first in the boys 3-5 division. Olivia Smith was the cream of the crop in the girls 3-5 division.

Choosing which toddlers walked away with a trophy was difficult for China Grove Mayor Charles Seaford who was one of six judges on the panel.

“Every one of them should have won” Seaford said.

Seaford was joined on the panel by Salisbury Mayor Karen Alexander Rowan County Chamber of Commerce Board Chairman Bob Honeycutt Rowan-Salisbury Schools Superintendent Tony Watlington Atrium Health’s Vice President of Administration Tri Tang and Landis Mayor Meredith Smith.

Bringing in judges from outside of China Grove Seaford said gave them an opportunity to experience the town.

The judges scored each candidate on a scale of 1-10 in three different metrics including originality maintaining the Farmers Day theme and a judge’s discretion category.

While there were fewer participants this year than in years past Wilson said there was plenty of spunk to go around. Every contestant was dressed in their best farmer getup including overalls sun dresses straw hats boots and plenty of denim.

Agriculture-related props were also utilized by many contestants. One girl pulled a little red wagon filled with stuffed barn animals. Another brought with her a basket of wooden eggs. An especially entertaining contestant toted a white duck that she dropped on the ground and danced around while smiling for the judges.

“It was very cool to see the kids have fresh corn or fresh flowers or whatever they may have had in their basket or pulling in their wagon” Smith said. “One boy was pulling hay with his John Deere tractor and that was very cool.”

Although some contestants were timid clinging to the legs of their parents others galloped before the judges to blow kisses or wave.

“It was fun to see all of their personalities” Smith said. “Some of them were a little shy at first but then they kind of came to once they got past the crowd and could see our faces. It was fun to see them open up.”

Wilson said the contest hasn’t changed much since Atrium Health began organizing it seven years ago. But this year Atrium Health invited 2021 North Carolina Watermelon Queen Anna Young to co-host the competition with Steve Monday who is chief forecaster for Rowan County Weather.

The full list of contestants who competed in the Little Mr. and Miss Farmer contest is as follows: Parker Coe Maeve Abbate Stella Abbate Audrey Hill Maicyn Arnette Charleston Donaldson Kyley Shiane Rogers Kai McCravy Joanna Pinyan James Pinyan Anna Kate Kramer Aubrey Lewis Everett Stubbs Emilia Mabrito Montgomery Sigmon Cameron Alley Skylar Miller Joshua Stewart Julie Morrison Jacob Morrison Lee Edward Ealey Jr. Sunny Rae Turner and Olivia Smith.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzcHJlc3Nub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9lZHVjYXRpb24vdHJhY3RvcnMtaGl0LXRoZS1yb2FkLXRvLWtlZXAtbWlzc291cmktZmFybWluZy9hcnRpY2xlX2Q0ZGVlNjVhLWU3NTQtMTFlYi1iYmNkLTIzMzFkM2QzNGIzNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tractors hit the road to keep Missouri farming,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Special to The Daily Telegram

CAMBRIDGE TWP. — Friday's rainy opening day of Faster Horses 2021 at Michigan International Speedway ended on a high note following a lineup of country music stars.

The day opened with Callista Clark followed by Carly Pearce who took extra time to thank her fans for “getting her through a really tough last year.”

Chris Lane then took the stage and kept the crowd going for Jon Pardi who had a great performance despite the throat issues that have been rumored to have had him taking three months off because of doctor's orders.

But the crowd made it clear they were there to see the headliner Luke Combs.

Some 40000 people were at the Main Stage at Michigan International Speedway at 9:30 Friday night; many were chanting ""U-S-A! U-S-A!"" in hopes of bringing the country music singer-songwriter to stage a tad early. Then the fog started rolling off the stage and there was chatter about the COVID-19 pandemic what it meant to many businesses across the nation the shutdowns and then Combs took to the mic to say “That ends right NOW!” and opened with ""Cold As You.""

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

The crowd stayed amped up the entire two hours as Combs performed some of his biggest hits including ""Better Together"" ""Hurricane"" ""When It Rains It Pours"" ""One Number Away"" and an obvious crowd favorite ""She Got the Best of Me.""

He had a great stage presence with his band joining him on the catwalk several times throughout the night and taking time during the show to thank the fans for being able to pay his whole crew “every dime they earned” during the pandemic. During a series of cover songs Combs introduced each band member while starting off with them all singing ""In the Jailhouse Now"" from the movie ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" switching to different pieces of songs like ""Queen of My Double-wide Trailer"" while naming Jake the drummer and Rob on lead guitar then ""John Deere Green"" was heard as he introduced Delaney on bass quickly moving to ""The Dance"" with Tyler on guitar and ""Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)"" with his final introduction of Dustin on guitar.

Luke chatted about his third studio album gifting the fans with ""Five-Leaf Clover"" a new track from the long-anticipated album. He shared how his parents sacrificed for him told stories about his wife Nicole's influence on his songwriting and ended with a crowd-participating performance of ""Houston We Got a Problem.""

Just as it appeared the night was drawing to an end the entire crowd demanded “ONE MORE SONG! ONE MORE SONG!”

Combs' response? “I guess we have time for a few more huh?”

Many couples were dancing to his latest No. 1 song ""Forever After All"" and the crowd went crazy when he finished the night off with ""Beer Never Broke my Heart"" — even changing the lyric from ""A couple of beautiful girls tell me goodbye"" to ""Faster Horses blue jean baby girls tell me goodbye.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2dlcmFsZC1lcm5zdC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02MDk4MDY10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gerald Ernst Obituary (2021) - Bellevue IA - Hachmann-Mier Funeral Home & Cremation Service,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/gerald-ernst-obituary?id=6098065 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2dlcmFsZC1lcm5zdC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02MDk4MDY10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZtb250aGx5LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy90aGUtZ2FtZS9keWxhbi1mcml0dGVsbGlzLWNhZGRpZS0yMTI4MDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Is Dylan Frittelli's Caddie? - Meet John Curtis here,"We take a look at who currently caddies the bag of the South African golfer.

Who Is Dylan Frittelli's Caddie?

Dylan Frittelli has had one win on the PGA Tour two on the European Tour and is one of the most global travelling golfers out there right now. But who carries his bag? Below we take a look.

Who Is Dylan Frittelli's Caddie?

Frittelli's current bagman is John Curtis and it appears they have worked together roughly since August 2017.

They have been working together ever since and Frittelli has joked in the past how they both have terrible eyesight! Speaking after his victory in 2019 at the John Deere Classic Frittelli said;

""My caddie he jokes with me he's pretty blind and I'm like half-blind. So we're watching the ball going John where is it where is it? I can't see it. Can you see it no we don't know where it is.""

What they have seen together is a couple of years of consistency around the 100 mark on the world golf rankings.

There doesn't seem to be all that much information out there on Curtis so we are unsure of his past caddie experiences but we do know for certain he has worked with Pablo Larrazabal Anthony Wall and Steve Webster in the past."

Want to book Delta premium cabin award space with a partner airline? Forget about it…it’s like trying to find a unicorn.

Delta Award Space On Partners Is As Common As A Unicorn

Maybe I’m not looking hard enough but I’ve earmarked Virgin Atlantic miles for a transatlantic trip on Delta…it’s has been more than six years since I have flown Delta transatlantic and I’ve yet to step onboard a Delta Airbus A330-900neo or A350-900. I’d like to review Delta’s current soft product and more importantly review the Delta One Suite on a long(er) flight.

Because of the ridiculous no-notice devaluation on Virgin Atlantic I’m sticking to European routes. While that doesn’t leave much I’m happy to book any flight between:

Atlanta (ATL) – A350

Detroit (DTW) – A350

New York (JFK) -A330neo

and Amsterdam (AMS).

But in both directions for the entire calendar (through next June) there is not a single seat available in saver business class bookable with Virgin Atlantic or Air France/KLM Flying Blue miles.

Not one seat.

Should I be congratulating Delta on thinking it can sell out all its seats and need not offer any seats to partner?

I realize Delta has always been stringy with award space and we are still in a pandemic but compare Delta to American Airlines and United Airlines which have made quite a bit of transatlantic and transpacific “saver” award space available at very reasonable prices if you book in advance.

If I did want to use points Delta wants over 300000 SkyMiles each way for their flights…yeah right.

CONCLUSION

It seems I won’t be reviewing Delta anytime soon. That’s because Delta has chosen to to not make any award space in business class available to partners a sad development. Of course I could always pay retail if I really wanted to review it but where is the fun in that? This whole game of miles and points is about avoiding exactly those situations.

But the game of miles and points is becoming increasingly frustrating and Delta has shown it just doesn’t care. And that is increasingly making Delta award space like trying to find a unicorn…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJlY292ZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta's International Market Recovery By Geography,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJlY292ZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTk3OTY4NzcvRGVsdGEtQWlyLUxpbmVzLWV4ZWNzLXByaXZhdGVseS1ncnVtYmxpbmctSW5kaWFuLUNPVklELTE5LXN0cmFpbi1oYXZpbmctbmFtZS5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTc5Njg3Ny9hbXAvRGVsdGEtQWlyLUxpbmVzLWV4ZWNzLXByaXZhdGVseS1ncnVtYmxpbmctSW5kaWFuLUNPVklELTE5LXN0cmFpbi1oYXZpbmctbmFtZS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines execs 'privately grumbling' about the Indian COVID-19 strain having the same name,"Executives at Delta Air Lines are unhappy the current strain of the coronavirus which is fast spreading throughout the United States shares the same name as their company.

The Coronavirus Delta variant was previously known as the Indian variant based on the mutation's origin.

The names were officially changed by the World Health Organization in May using the Greek alphabet to prevent stigma and simplify discussion but that does little to stop people making a connection between already-established brands which also share the name.

And it seems Delta are doing their best to avoid any link to their brand.

'We just call it the variant' Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal.

Other executives have 'privately grumbled' about the name sources told the Journal.

Executives with Delta Air Lines are unhappy the latest coronavirus variant shares the same name as the company

'We just call it the variant' Delta CEO Ed Bastian pictured said in an interview

Bastian says so far there has been no significant lull in bookings as a result of the connection. 'We haven't seen any drop off at all' Bastian confirmed.

'We prefer to call it the B.1.617.2 variant since that is so much more simple to say and remember…' said Dr. Henry Ting Delta Air Lines' chief health officer in a tweet.

The airline which is based in Atlanta was named after Mississippi Delta region where the carrier began as a crop duster.

Delta which in pre-pandemic times would fly 750 aircraft to more than 300 destinations around the world has been the butt of some jokes by their competitors.

'We prefer to call it the B.1.617.2 variant since that is so much more simple to say and remember…' said Dr. Henry Ting Delta Air Lines' chief health officer in a tweet

The airline says despite the crossover there has been no drop off in bookings. On Wednesday Delta Air Lines reported its first quarterly profit since the pandemic devastated the airline industry more than a year ago

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby was jokingly asked at a virtual Q&A at the Economic Club of Washington D.C. how he arranged to have the latest variant named after the airline.

'I did enjoy giving Ed Bastian a hard time when I saw him a few weeks ago' Kirby said.

Bastian isn't too concerned with the Delta variant affecting the business with the WHO already identifying other named strains of the disease.

'There's other variants coming up behind it.' he said. The WHO has noted Eta Iota Kappa and Lambda as 'variants of interest.'

The coronavirus pandemic lead to a difficult year in travel with demand for flights decimated. Major airlines lost $35 billion last year according to the Journal.

The names were officially changed by the World Health Organization in May using the Greek alphabet to prevent stigma and simplify discussion but that does little to stop people making a connection between already-established brands which also share the name (file photo)

Delta Air Lines say that with many customers being vaccinated there are few signs that the current variant is affecting travel bookings.

On Wednesday reported its first quarterly profit since the pandemic began boosted by about $1.5 billion in government aid and a summer rebound in vacation travel.

Delta said Wednesday that it earned $652 million in the second quarter. However Delta’s report shows that airlines still face turbulence as they try to rebound from their worst year ever.

Without $1.5 billion in federal pandemic relief and other one-time events the Atlanta airline would have posted an adjusted loss of $678 million.

Even though crowds at the nation’s airports are approaching 2019 levels Delta’s operating revenue is still only half of pre-pandemic levels.

Delta was the most profitable U.S. airline going into the pandemic and it is likely to emerge from virus outbreak at or near the front of the pack.

The Delta variant meanwhile is now the dominant strain of the virus in the U.S. and appears to be slightly better at evading vaccines compared to other variants that have preceded it.

The airline isn't the only Delta to have had a problem with its name.

Delta Goodrem 36 (pictured) has joked she's considering changing her name as the Delta variant of Covid-19 locks down millions of Australians

Australian singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem revealed she is considering changing her name.

The 36-year-old who is currently isolating in Sydney with her boyfriend Matthew Copley floated the idea with fans last week on Twitter while promoting an upcoming series of online performances.

'Hi all it’s me the artist formerly known as Delta [wonky face emoji]' the Born To Try singer lamented.

'Looking for a new name and Tour songs to sing for THURSDAY NIGHT BUNKERDOWN SESSION!! Let me know your dream songs and ideas for the setlist xxx' she added.

At the start of the pandemic last year Corona beer suffered an initial drop in sales after sharing a similar name to the pathogen that shares the same name.

‘There is no question that Corona beer is suffering because of the coronavirus’ said Ronn Torossian the founder of 5WPR the public relations firm which conducted the survey at the time in March 2020.

All references must be sourced to CNBC.

WILFRED FROST: CES kicking off in Las Vegas. More than just tech companies are making headlines this year. Delta Air Lines announcing a number of new ventures including plans for a digital concierge service that expands the airlines relationship with Lyft and a new venture into robotics. Delta is exploring the use of exoskeleton suits its employees can wear to help with lifting heavy cargo or machinery. Joining us now live from CES in a first on CNBC interview is Ed Bastian the Delta Air Lines CEO. Ed a very good afternoon to you. Thanks for joining us.

ED BASTIAN: Hey Wilf. Thanks for having me. A lot of excitement going on out here.

WILFRED FROST: I bet. We’ve had great coverage from our colleagues all day. And delighted for you to be a part of it. Ed tell us what will you launching there at CES? I guess not typical for an airline to be there. It’s very much app-based expansion.

DELTA AIRLINES CEO : Yeah it was great. We were -- we delivered -- I delivered the opening keynote for CES. The first time an airline had ever done that. In fact the opening question that the CEO of CES gave me is why is an airline here? And it gave me the opportunity to tell our story. And our story really is about all of the investment we’ve made to improve the quality of our operations. We’re the on-time leader. We’ve got the most reliable highest performance airline in the industry.

Investing billions in dollars in the in-flight experience. And now we’re doing the same to improve the ground experience. And you see our airports going up in many parts of the country and the improvements. We need to bring technology alongside that whether it’s digital whether it’s the Fly Delta app whether it’s new technology like parallel reality. And that was our opportunity to describe that.

WILFRED FROST: And in terms of the new technology aspect to what extent is it only really for on the ground services for the consumer? I mean you were disappointed that free WiFi on all flights is still not a reality.

DELTA AIRLINES CEO ED BASTIAN: Well we’re working on free WiFi. We’re committed to getting to free WiFi. But it has to be WiFi that has the expectations that consumers deserve: high-quality content high-quality bandwidth and speed. We’re not quite there yet but we’re on the path to getting there. And as I said this morning we will get there within the next two years. Sooner if we can. And then when we get there we have to make it the same price on the ground which is generally free.

COURTNEY REAGAN: So Ed you explained a little bit about technology helping the operations of Delta. What about on sort of on the consumer-facing side? When we all travel it’s become stressful experience. Obviously there are many players that tie in together from the TSA and security the airline itself as well as the airport operations. But have been really announced any technology for making my experience potentially less stressful?

DELTA AIRLINES CEO: Sure well that was one of the key themes for the presentation is that we need to find ways to destress consumers as they’re traveling. And we all know that there’s stress in the environment particularly in the ground experience. So we announced together with Lyft a closer integration. So when you’re traveling on Delta yew the Fly Delta App you’ll be able to monitor your arrival or destination information through Lyft. They’ll have cars there available waiting for you.

We unveiled a vision of the future because it was really a visionary presentation going out over the next five years whereby you don’t even need to bring your bag to the airport. Because we know how much stress is involved in bringing your bag and checking it or trying to get an overhead bin for it.

Why not have the opportunity to have us get your bag from your home to your destination so it’s waiting for you when you arrive at that hotel. If you’re in a business meeting you can go directly to the business meeting. Or if you’re going to a new city you have a chance to go explore it. I mean there’s many many things that we’re doing. But we’ve got the credibility because we’ve got the core reliability performance of the airline fixed. And now it’s our opportunity to bring technology to make a real difference with our consumers.

WILFRED FROST: And I wanted to ask you about Boeing if I may another story relating to the timing of the return of the 737 Max today. Today the airline saying that it’s going to push for a simulator training for all pilots moving forward. But either way there’s been a delay after delay as to when this plane might return. To what extent do industrial executives like yourself losing fate in the company whenever it makes any target whether it’s related to the 737 Max return or anything else are you losing faith in the ability of this company to make – to meet the promises it makes?

DELTA AIRLINES CEO : Well Wilf as you know we don’t fly the 737 Max. So we’re not directly impacted by that issue. We’ve been monitoring it. We’ve been in touch with Boeing around it. Yes we have to -- we do have concerns regarding what it will mean for future development and future technology innovation in our space. We have basically two suppliers in our space we have Airbus and we have Boeing.

And we need Boeing to get through this crisis. We need them to get focused on the innovation and the development of the new technology for the new aircraft that we’re waiting to order. And they continue to push our industry forward not just from an efficiency with cleaner emissions but also better comfort for our customers. So I have confidence in Dave Calhoun. I’ve known Dave for a long time. I think he’s the right man for the job. We’re staying in close touch. But it is frustrating yes.

WILFRED FROST: That said that frustration aside Ed is there a part of you that actually weirdly welcomes further delays in the 737 Max? Of course the original tragedies aside because you don’t fly the plane? Have there been some gains in market share for you because of the delays in the 737 Max’s return?

ED BASTIAN: No. We’re not – we’re hoping for that plane to get in the sky. You know you’re right. We have on the margin some additional revenue and some additional share that we’ve gained because the plane has not been flying. But all the other airlines that do fly the plane I think gave a good job of covering off their key competitive markets.

You know the great thing about airplanes is they move and they can go fly to different revenue pools to make sure they’re protecting their key markets. So we’ve had some marginal benefit. When it does come back I’m sure there will be marginal negative impact. I think it will be small for us. But you know we really want -- it’s not good for any of us to have that plane out of the sky.

COURTNEY REAGAN: Ed there’s been a lot of focus on the energy market this week as you well know after the events in Iran after the assassination of the General there. What is your outlook for jet fuel prices? I know the airline stocks got taken down a bit yesterday as energy prices moved higher albeit preparing some of those losses by the end of the session. So how are you focused on the cost of jet fuel going forward this year?

DELTA AIRLINES CEO : Well we watch it closely Courtney as you can imagine. You know we’ve built our business to be able to sustain short-term shocks like this. And we talk about short-term shocks going from $60 to $70 a barrel. You know we’ve been built on a model where we had to cover over $100 a barrel not that long ago. So I think the industry is in a good spot.

I know Delta is in a very good spot. We’ve built our business to cover oil and we expect oil to be on range-bound somewhere between $60 and $80 a barrel where it’s been for the last several years. If it gets above $80 obviously there’s some decisions that we’ll have to take over time. But right now there’s no change to our strategy. We’ve got a great plan for 2020 and we’re not seeing any real negative impacts from you know the most recent short-term spike we’ve seen this week.

WILFRED FROST: Ed I wanted to ask you about the investment you made in LATAM Airlines Group. Is that a sign that you think the domestic airline travel market is somewhat saturated in ex-growth? And if at the moment 72% of your revenue comes from the domestic market where will that number by in five years? Significantly lower than 72%?

ED BASTIAN: Well it’s a fair point. Because over time -- not yet but over time the domestic market will become relatively saturated. You see how congested air travel can be at times in our key markets. We’re building bigger airplanes and we’re building bigger airports but we’re not building new destinations in the domestic market to fly.

You know we’re doing well. We’re growing 5-7% a year. And we’ll continue. And I see that growth rate staying pretty strong over the next couple of years. But over time certainly as we enter the next century of our future which will be happening in the next few years international I think is the place we need to be.

That’s why we’re investing in Latam. And a great airline they have 40% market share throughout all of South America. A really important future partner for us. That’s why we’re investors in Virgin Air France KLM Korean China Eastern. We have taken a contrarian view that we need to get inside these other airlines not just as commercial partners but as equity owners to try to bring a longer-term opportunity for us and for them to the future.

WILFRED FROST: Ed great to speak as always. Thanks for joining us.

ED BASTIAN: Appreciate you guys having me.

The safety-themed video filmed in 2019 before the Pandemic began no longer adheres to the safe-travel protocols. A spokesperson from Delta told CNN

“While we previously hoped to bring the ‘Queer Eye’ safety video onboard the video was produced and filmed in 2019 prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the federal mask mandate remains in effect we ultimately made the determination to look for other ways to highlight the video.”

As previously reported on CNN “the four-minute video sees presenters Antoni Porowski Bobby Berk Jonathan Van Ness Tan France and Karamo Brown help demonstrate the usual safety briefing alongside a very diverse crew. It also features cameos from participants from past seasons of the makeover show.”

What would the Delta safety video look like if reimagined by the Fab 5? We’re glad you asked. Enjoy this special version of our safety video and on your next Delta flight don’t miss a new episode of Netflix’s @QueerEye featuring one of our employees. pic.twitter.com/PLEBAkuDXV — Delta (@Delta) July 2 2021

Viewers took to the comment section to lavish praise on the video for many aspects especially the inclusivity with one commentator saying

“That’s nice to see how diverse this safety video is. Very diverse flight attendants and LGBTQ references. Really good.”

The “Building to Net-Zero” blueprint appears to be quietly gaining momentum within the Energy Department where a top official has discussed ways to put elements into action using the agency’s existing powers.

The pipeline network would be twice the size of the current U.S. oil pipeline network by volume according to the blueprint released by a recently formed group calling itself the Labor Energy Partnership. Backers say the proposed pipeline network — including CO2 “hubs” in the Gulf Coast the Ohio River Valley and Wyoming — would help reduce climate-changing pollution by transporting captured carbon dioxide to either the oil industry which would undo some of the climate benefits by using the CO2 to revive aging oilfields or to as-yet unbuilt facilities for underground storage.

The blueprint however leaves open many questions about how the carbon would be captured at the source — a process that so far has proved difficult and expensive — and where it would be sent focusing instead on suggesting policies the federal government can adopt to boost CO2 pipeline construction.

Climate advocates fear that building such a large CO2 pipeline network could backfire causing more greenhouse gas pollution by enabling aging coal-fired power plants to remain in service longer produce pipes that could wind up carrying fossil fuels if carbon capture efforts fall through and represent an expensive waste of federal funds intended to encourage a meaningful energy transition.

In March over 300 climate and environmental justice advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress arguing that subsidizing carbon capture “could entrench the fossil economy for decades to come.”

The AFL-CIO and the Energy Futures Initiative which jointly produced the blueprint did not respond to questions about concerns over their proposals.

Proponents of carbon capture usage and sequestration (CCUS) often highlight ways that it could be used for sectors like steel and cement whose carbon pollution is generally considered “hard to abate.” Yet the pipeline network envisioned by Moniz would be capable of carrying over 10 times as much carbon dioxide as the steel and cement industries emit in total nationwide according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2019. In fact it could transport more CO2 than the entire industrial sector emits in the U.S. leaving the rest of the pipeline network’s capacity available for carbon from fossil fuel-fired power plants or from “direct air capture” technologies that would remove ambient CO2 but don’t currently exist at a commercial level.

“Even the advocates of direct air capture technology acknowledge that they don’t anticipate that it would be at a scale to make any meaningful reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels until 2060 2070 and beyond” said Carroll Muffett president of the environmental law nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law. “When we’re dealing with a world where we need to cut emissions in the next decade direct air capture just has no meaningful place in that conversation.”

Instead the proposed CO2 pipeline network would be used to offer a lifeline to existing fossil fuel power plants. In Appalachia for example 90 percent of the carbon emissions the plan seeks to capture would come from existing coal-fired power plants in the Ohio River Valley. Those plants none of which are currently outfitted with the costly upgrades needed for capture carbon are already facing difficult questions about their ability to compete economically with wind and solar energy.

Nonetheless momentum behind the project appears to have been gathering behind the scenes in Washington D.C. particularly inside the Department of Energy (DOE).

“It’s a great pleasure to have our first kind of public interaction with our good friend Dave Turk” Moniz said of Biden’s Deputy Secretary of Energy at the blueprint’s online launch on July 1.

“It’s incredible the volume and quality of the thought-leadership that you all are behind” Turk who is second in command to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Moniz. “And I think the report that you all have put together is incredibly helpful to show that we need to do more from the DOE side other agencies and Congress” he added describing the blueprint as “actionable.”

Figuring the Federal Funding

A day before the blueprint launch event the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) sent a report to Congress on carbon capture and its associated infrastructure.

“CO2 pipelines are critical to the future nationwide deployment of CCUS” the CEQ wrote leaving open the question of just how large of a CO2 pipeline network the White House supports.

The report calls carbon capture “especially important for decarbonizing the industrial sector where high-temperature heat can be difficult and expensive to electrify” and carbon pollution difficult to avoid. The CEQ was less sure about the role carbon capture should play in electricity generation writing that it “may also play an important role in decarbonizing the global power sector.” It also highlights the possibility that future technologies that could draw carbon dioxide from the air might use the same kinds of underground storage infrastructure.

Building a national CO2 pipeline network to support CCUS would be extremely expensive. The pipelines themselves could cost between $170 and $230 billion to build the CEQ noted citing an estimate from Princeton’s Net-Zero America study. That’s roughly the net worth of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — or twice the $100 billion that Biden has proposed spending to upgrade the nation’s electrical power grid.

The CEQ’s memo was greeted with enthusiasm by Moniz’s Energy Futures Initiative (EFI) a co-author of the gigaton pipeline blueprint.

“I would also like to give a big shout out to the Biden administration and its CEQ for the CCUS report they released yesterday” said Melanie Kenderdine a principal of EFI. “There are many similar thrusts between that report and ours.”

Discussion at the blueprint’s launch suggested that higher-ups within DOE are focused on how exactly to move forward on CO2 pipeline construction.

“So we do have authorities right now as you certainly know from the DOE side” Deputy Secretary Turk explained at the blueprint’s launch. “Our Fossil Energy and Carbon Management office has authorities has funding we’re trying to move various programs along in that way.”

He also discussed the controversial tax credits for carbon capture known as 45Q. “And then there’s some significant money billions of funding being proposed by the President through the American Jobs Plan that Congress is deliberating right now that could be hugely hugely important on the CCUS side” he went on. “So we’ve got some tools on the table right now at the Department of Energy but we’re really hoping and it’s encouraging to see the bipartisan support for CCUS up on the Hill increasing the tools that we have and the size of those tools so that we can really get at the gigaton opportunities as you all lay out incredibly well in your actionable report.”

The Department of Energy also did not respond to questions about the blueprint or how often Deputy Secretary Turk has met with Ernest Moniz the Energy Futures Initiative or the Labor Energy Partnership this year.

An unnamed White House official told Bloomberg Law that the approach in the CEQ report remains open to modifications. “It should be interpreted as ‘Here are the areas in which the administration plans to act. Here is how they might act in those areas. That is subject to refinement and change as the agencies carried out the more detailed process that’s necessary under their statutes’” the unnamed official said.

Pipelines to Nowhere?

It’s not clear that carbon capture is remotely ready for prime time particularly on a gigaton scale. “The world has been experimenting with [carbon capture] since the early 1970s” Wood Mackenzie noted this month. “Around 68 projects started and terminated primarily because the projects are super-expensive.”

Right now all of the world’s existing CCUS projects combined have the capacity to remove just 37 million metric tons of carbon per year — a tiny sliver of the 1000 million metric tons (or one gigaton) that the EFI blueprint for a U.S. CO2 pipeline network proposes.

There’s a long list of reasons that CCUS — despite decades of public subsidies and numerous high-profile pilot projects and “demonstration” plants — has floundered commercially.

First adding carbon capture equipment to existing coal or natural gas power plants for example fundamentally adds costs — and today those fuels are already under significant cost pressure as the price of renewable energy continues to fall.

The engineering side of capturing carbon can also be very difficult particularly for some industries. When researchers who included representatives from academia and a Chevron official studied the costs of adding CCUS to U.S. industrial sites they found 656 sites which they considered “suitable” for carbon capture retrofits — roughly two out of every five sites in the country.

There’s also the question of what to do with the carbon after it’s captured. Most CCUS projects right now sell carbon to the oil industry which uses it to produce more oil from aging oil fields — not exactly a climate-friendly solution.

While backers of CCUS often focus on its role in capturing carbon not from electrical power plants but instead from industry a one gigaton pipeline network would dwarf the size of the carbon emissions produced from “hard to abate” industries in the U.S.

For example the EPA’s greenhouse gas inventory lists 41.3 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2 from iron steel and metallurgical coke production in 2019 and a nearly equal amount 40.9 MMT from cement production. That’s a huge amount of greenhouse gas — but it’s only enough to fill 8.2 percent of a one gigaton pipeline network. All told the entire U.S. industrial sector emitted 822.4 MMT of CO2 that year EPA reported — far short of the gigaton that Moniz’s organization proposes.

“What you see in that report is a demand for a colossal expansion of CO2 infrastructure” Muffett said “even while acknowledging that it’s fundamentally not economic to build it even with the massive federal subsidies that are already flowing into it.”

Fossil fuels have powerful backers in Congress including at least one senator who has suggested he might spike Biden’s climate proposals if carbon capture is not included as a way to preserve the fossil fuel industry. “I told him that I was concerned about some of the language I’d seen to move us away from fossil” Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) said he told President Joe Biden on July 14. “I said if you move our country away from fossil and there won’t be another country that will step to the plate to do the research and development that will fix the emissions that are coming.”

A senior ExxonMobil lobbyist recently named Manchin as “crucial” to the oil giant’s lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. in secretly recorded remarks made to an undercover representative of Greenpeace UK and reported by the UK’s Channel 4 News adding that the Exxon lobbyist met with Manchin’s office weekly.

Prolonging ‘Negative Attributes of Fossil Fuels’

The blueprint itself carries a long list of warnings about carbon capture’s uncertainties and flaws. “Public perceptions that contribute to negative opinions of CCUS include hesitancy about technology risks limited track record cost and investment tradeoffs compared to other emissions abatement options” the blueprint notes. “Worries about the risk of geologic CO2 leakage are also common.”

“Other concerns about CCUS include its perception as a ‘delaying tactic’ that forestalls other climate change mitigation actions such as improved energy efficiency or transition to non-fossil fuels” it adds. “There are also concerns that CCUS prolongs negative attributes of fossil fuels such as pollutants environmental disruptions and negative community impacts.”

Fossil fuel power plants with CCUS can also remain highly polluting beyond greenhouse gases — and existing plants are often located within communities of color. “Energy and industrial infrastructure is disproportionately located in or near neighborhoods of lower-income households and with larger minority group populations” the blueprint notes. “The environmental impacts of these facilities have contributed to negative health outcomes and lowered property values in the adjacent communities.”

“I’m concerned about federal funding to support pipeline and hub construction when the feasibility of CCUS remains extremely unclear” Megan Hunter a senior attorney with the environmental group Earthjustice told DeSmog.

And while carbon might be captured with CCUS technology there are many other pollutants released by fossil fuels.

“It’s also important to note that these plants petrochemical facilities and the other sites mentioned in this report emit more than just carbon dioxide; they emit harmful particulate matter hazardous Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other toxic pollutants that severely threaten the health of nearby communities” Hunter added. “The Ohio River Valley is already burdened by significant legacy pollution and experiences intense subsurface and surface activity — including underground and surface mining pipelines hydraulic fracturing injection wells and solution mining.”

“I’m also deeply concerned about the potential for federal funds to be directed towards a buildout of natural gas and petrochemical infrastructure under the guise that this infrastructure will one day be repurposed for CO2 or hydrogen” Hunter added.

For example utility Southern Company sank $7.5 billion into attempting to build a coal-fired power plant that would capture carbon in Kemper County Mississippi before abandoning those efforts amid cost overruns and increasingly evident design flaws.

The pipeline that Southern originally built to carry captured CO2 won’t be torn down however as the company had previously contemplated. Instead it will be converted from a CO2 pipeline into a natural gas pipeline Southern reported in its annual SEC filing for 2020 and used to fuel a gas-fired power plant.

Before he joined the Obama administration Moniz pushed natural gas as a solution to climate change arguing in 2010 that the fossil fuel “truly is a bridge to a low-carbon future.” The following year Cornell professors Robert Howarth Renee Santoro and Anthony Ingraffea published their landmark paper showing that natural gas-fired electricity may be twice as climate-altering as coal-fired electricity — or worse depending on just how much climate-warming methane escapes from the nation’s gas infrastructure.

During his time at DOE Moniz continued to push natural gas as a way to curb the country’s CO2 emissions despite growing evidence that the fossil fuel’s methane leaks are very damaging to the climate. In 2020 methane levels in the atmosphere reached a record high prompting urgent warnings from the United Nations.

Prior to the 2020 election Moniz’s name was rumored to be among those that Joe Biden considered for Energy Secretary — but under pressure from green groups Biden ultimately passed him over opting instead for Granholm a former Michigan governor.

In November 2020 Little Sis a Public Accountability Initiative project highlighted the number of Moniz’s associates that played a role in Biden’s transition team including Turk who had served under Moniz in the Obama administration. “All this raises concerns about Moniz’s influence over the policy direction and staffing decisions within Biden’s DOE and suggests that — even if Biden rejects Moniz himself — Moniz’s network could play a critical role in setting energy policy in the Biden administration” Little Sis wrote.

“Moniz also launched two projects — the for-profit consulting firm EJM Associates and the non-profit think tank Energy Futures Initiative — intended to shape the policy debate around energy issues” it added. “The Energy Futures Initiative is advised by a board chaired by former BP CEO Lord John Brown Madingley and includes former CIA director and Cheniere Energy board member John Deutch and J. Todd Mitchell whose family fortune comes from the fracking company Devon Energy.”

Erratic Track Record

Previous attempts to use carbon capture have largely run aground amid technical and financial issues.

“The costs of carbon capture have decreased by 35% between a first-of-a-kind power plant with carbon capture and the second facility using the same technology” the White House CEQ wrote in the memo’s executive summary citing a report that details the costs of Saskatchewan’s Boundary Dam project in 2014 and Texas’s Petra Nova plant in 2017 — with no mention of Southern Company’s failed attempt at carbon capture in Mississippi.

Also not mentioned: NRG’s Petra Nova project doesn’t actively capture carbon despite its $1 billion price tag. “Petra Nova has been mothballed since May 2020 because it is uneconomic” POWER Magazine a trade publication reported in late June. “Even before the plant was mothballed NRG had taken three impairment charges totaling $310 million against the project.”

“What they’re ignoring in this report are the massive risks that are entailed in dramatically expanding pipeline infrastructure.” Carroll Muffett President Center for International Environmental Law

Even before the full effects of the pandemic unfolded in the U.S. the DOE itself warned that carbon capture projects aren’t financially competitive. “Additionally as is the case for the [Petra Nova] Project the economics of large-scale carbon capture facilities are challenging” DOE wrote in a March 31 2020 final scientific and technical report on Petra Nova.

That makes the Boundary Dam project in Canada the world’s only operating coal carbon capture project. The project made headlines in March when it announced it reached its 4 millionth metric ton of CO2 captured a lifetime total equal to what one coal-fired power plant emits in one year EPA estimates. The company was originally slated to reach this milestone by October 2018. “The carbon capture facility at Boundary Dam was designed to capture 3200 metric tons of CO2 daily or slightly more than 1 million metric tons annually” the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote in April. “It has barely achieved that goal on any single day and has never done so over any extended period.”

“From a purely economic perspective [carbon capture and sequestration] does not make sense” the Center for International Environmental Law wrote in a recent report. “The simpler surer and cheaper solution is to end this and similar subsidies for the fossil fuel economy and invest the savings in accelerating the transition to clean energy.”

“What they’re ignoring in this report are the massive risks that are entailed in dramatically expanding pipeline infrastructure” Muffett told DeSmog describing both the physical risks borne by people living near CO2 pipelines and the financial risks of investing in carbon capture rather than renewable energy. “These are communities that have dealt with the impacts of environmental injustice and environmental racism for decades and that’s laid the foundations that leads to them being targeted for the build-out of these pipelines.”

“At its heart the conversation about CCUS has never been about addressing the climate crisis or about reducing CO2 emissions” Muffett added. “At its heart the thing that has always driven this conversation is how do we deal with the problem of stranded assets what can we do to go on burning coal natural gas and oil into the indefinite future?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Learn how you can take your savings up a notch this year.Image source: Getty Images.

Want to save more money this year?

You're not alone there as saving money is a popular goal with 37% of Americans even making it one of their New Year's resolutions. But simply wanting to save more isn't enough. Here's how you can turn those savings dreams into reality.

Set specific concrete savings goals

You're much more likely to be successful with a savings goal if you figure out:

What it's for

The amount you need

Your deadline

These details help you calculate exactly how much you need to save each month and keep you motivated to achieve your goal.

Here's the difference between good and bad savings goals -- a bad goal would be ""I'm saving for a vacation."" Without going into more detail about your desired vacation you won't feel very attached to the goal so it will be hard to stay motivated. Since you don't have an amount and a deadline you won't know how much you need to save every month.

A good savings goal would be ""I'm saving $2000 for a trip to Hawaii in 10 months."" Now you have a goal you can sink your teeth into. You know you need to save $200 per month which will be $100 per paycheck if you get paid biweekly. And you have a goal that matters to you giving you motivation even when you'd rather not save.

You can set any type of savings goal this way and break it down into smaller steps. For example if you're 30 years old and want to save at least $200000 for retirement by the time you're 50 then you'll need to stash away $10000 per year.

Be realistic about how much you can save

We all like to dream big and it's good to challenge yourself but it's also important to be realistic with your savings goals. If you aim too high you're more likely to get discouraged when you discover that you can't save enough.

Before you set savings goals figure out how much money you have left over after paying your bills each month. This will give you an idea of how much you could save and what kind of goals are within your reach.

Remember that you'll probably have some discretionary spending here and there so you shouldn't assume that you can save every last dollar of your disposable income. When you get too strict with your budget you're bound to burn yourself out.

Choose the right savings tools

There are plenty of places you can put your money and the ones you choose will depend in large part on your goals. A lot of people don't think about this too much but that can cause you to miss out on earning a better return. Here are some general guidelines on what type of accounts to consider based on your saving timeline:

Short-term goals (within a year) -- These are the smaller financial goals such as a vacation a down payment on a car or new furniture. Stick with the best bank accounts here where your money can earn a bit of interest and will be easy for you to access. High-interest savings accounts work well for this as do money market accounts if you can deposit enough to earn the highest interest rate.

Mid-range goals (two to 10 years) -- These are big-ticket goals that will require more saving such as down payments on a home or a major remodel. Since you'll spend more time saving for these you should consider opening an investment account with one of the top stock brokers where your money could earn a greater return. While stocks can be volatile bonds are a more conservative option that will still typically earn more than any bank account.

Long-term wealth-building (over 10 years) -- Once you get into long-term saving an investment account is your best bet. If you have an employer-sponsored plan available that's most likely the way to go as there could be an employer match for any contributions you make. Other options include investing in index funds or opening your own individual retirement account.

Automate your savings

Once you know how much you need to save it's a matter of setting that money aside after every paycheck. The best way to do this is by automating the process so there's nothing required on your end.

You can typically have direct deposits split among different accounts such as your checking and savings accounts. Or you can have a set amount automatically transferred from your checking account to another account every month.

It may not seem like a big deal but this will give you one less obstacle to saving which makes you more likely to follow through with it.

Meeting your savings goals

Savings goals are a great way to put more money away consistently. You can use that money for any big purchases you have coming up so that you won't need to go into debt to pay for them and you can also set goals that will help you increase your wealth and build a retirement nest egg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL29yZ2FuaXNlci5vcmcvMjAyMS8wNy8xOC8xMzg4MzMvYmhhcmF0L3doZW4tcmFtYXlhbmEtaW5zcGlyZWQtYS1uYWdhLWNocmlzdGlhbi10by1kaXNjb3Zlci1naW5zZW5nLWluLW1vdW50YWlub3VzLXdpbGRzL9IBhAFodHRwczovL29yZ2FuaXNlci5vcmcvMjAyMS8wNy8xOC8xMzg4MzMvYmhhcmF0L3doZW4tcmFtYXlhbmEtaW5zcGlyZWQtYS1uYWdhLWNocmlzdGlhbi10by1kaXNjb3Zlci1naW5zZW5nLWluLW1vdW50YWlub3VzLXdpbGRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When Ramayana inspired a Naga Christian to discover Ginseng in mountainous wilds,"New Delhi: It was around 1990. A large section of Nagas was still into the primordial economy. Neighbouring ‘Myanmar’ was still Burma. Political headhunting was a political norm in Nagaland among state lawmakers and violence and anti-Naga killings were the order of the day. In Tobu region of the state – two tribal groups had clashed fiercely and at one point even ‘refugees’ from Burma had sneaked into Nagaland looking for ‘greener pastures.

“I could never imagine I would be a herbalist” said Dr Somba Chang a Naga herbalist from Tuensang district adjoining Myanmar.

He recounted to this journo – then a fresher – how a film he had seen 30 years ago led him on this search for the wonder herb. This was 31 years back in 1990 !

“The film was ‘Ramayana’ in Hindi and I saw it in the 1960s. I saw how Hanuman brought the herb Sanjeevani from the Himalayas to save Lakshman. Later I learnt from the Ramayana text that the medicinal herb was of yellow colour. Then in a Chinese magazine I saw a colour picture of Ginseng and immediately I knew it was the same Sanjeevani of the Ramayana” Somba Chang had said.

That inspired him to undertake an extensive search “more earnestly and at last I was rewarded by the discovery of the wonder drug in Nagaland”.

In the business of pharmaceuticals in the 1990s – it was probably recording the highest growth sale. Suddenly a variety of over-the-counter aggressively advertised ‘energy rechargers’ were flooding the market all aimed at the urban Indian male over 30. Aphrodisiac health tonic or whatever it was marketed as most of the pills contained the stimulae Ginseng the wonder herb of the ancient Chinese believed to cure ‘all ailments’.

The Indian drug manufacturers used to obtain the herb primarily from South Korea and its demand according to a top executive of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals “was growing at the rate of 80 per cent annually”. For Glenmark and its rivals however there was good news from the wilds of the northeast. Botanists in Nagaland had discovered the magic herb! In fact there was another claimant.

“We have it here in India as we had always believed” said Sapu Changkija regional director of Sophisticated Instrumentation Centre Shillong.

Changkija first made the claim in October 1989 but this had touched off a minor battle for credit with Dr Somba Chang saying it was he who first discovered Ginseng in Nagaland.

Somba has in fact even named the Naga plant after himself calling it Panax Somba.

True Ginseng that the Chinese prize has the scientific name Panax Schinseng while a North American varietyused as a substitute but now almost extinct is called Panax Quinquefolius.

Panax comes from the Greek words ‘pan’ meaning all and ‘akos’ for cure. The English word Panacea incidentally is similarly derived.

Somba had said he first chanced upon the herbs in August 1985 in the northeastern Changsang forest on the Saramati mountain range not far from the Burmese (Myanmar) border.

Two years later he also earned a certificate from the Department of Botany in the North Eastern Hill University(NEHU) in Shillong (headquartered) to practice as a herbalist.

The state government also had granted him financial assistance of Rs 20000 to run the clinic. Sapu Changkija made his ‘discovery’ of Ginseng in the Japfu range and had described the plants as 30 to 50 cm tall having five to six compound leaflets.

According to him it grew in highly shaded deep loamy soil at high altitudes preferably in thick forest rich in humus or disintegrating organic matter.

That description did not tally with Somba’s Ginseng plants which he had said were 60-70 cm tall having green fruits which turn red when ripe.Changkija’s discovery in fact in 1990 was seen with a degree of skepticism by the Nagaland government.

“The Economic Plants Cell of the state’s Department of Industry has not yet recognised his claim” Y Jamir a senior official of the department had said then.

“The claim may be true or false we can’t say yet (that is 1990). We have not heard anything. But the Saramati and Japfu mountain ranges have similar topographical conditions so this second discovery should not be surprising”.

“No I received no financial assistance from the government. But I did not ask for it either” Changkija had said.

He said there could be three varieties of the herb growing in the wilds of Nagaland and perhaps one in Arunachal Pradesh too. “Perhaps the Naga people who came from southeast Asia once knew the curative properties of the plant. But later forgot”.

Because of its rarity and its supposed magical properties Ginseng has always been surrounded by an aura of mystery.

But for the people of Nagaland it was hoped the discovery would usher in a boom of sorts with not only the Indian drug manufacturers but also firms from the west flocking the state.

Sadly however this was the story of Ginseng discovery in Naga hills cradled in the wilds of northeast India in 1990. After that nothing much moved and happened on that front as politicians and the administration in general focused on politics insurgency law and order and so called peace talks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvYmFua3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGhlLTctbXVzdC1oYXZlLWZlYXR1cmVzLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1sb29rLWZvci1pbi1hLWJhbmstYWNjb3VudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 7 Must-Have Features Americans Look for in a Bank Account,"If you could choose a bank account based on just one perk what would it be? Here's what other consumers said.

When you're planning to open a bank account it's easy to get overwhelmed by all the benefits on offer. A good way to narrow down your options is to start with one must-have feature you can't do without.

The Ascent recently ran a survey to find out what consumers want from banks. In it consumers were asked what they'd want if they had to choose a bank based on a single factor. Here are the top seven choices along with the percentage of respondents who chose each one. If you're new to banking or you want to know what to look for in your next bank account these responses could be a big help.

1. Low fees (21.25%)

Over 1 in 5 consumers wanted to keep fees to a minimum. The good news is that bank accounts without monthly fees are more common than ever especially among online banks.

Some bank accounts waive monthly fees but only if you fulfill certain requirements. This could involve maintaining a minimum balance or receiving a minimum number of direct deposits. To avoid unnecessary fees make sure you understand any conditions before you open an account.

If you want your banking to be as straightforward as possible there are also bank accounts with no monthly fees or account minimums.

2. Mobile and online access (18.97%)

Whether it's an online-only bank or one with physical branches consumers want to be able to access their accounts online. And they want to do so from both computers and smartphones.

This highlights the importance of quality mobile banking apps. Banks need to have mobile apps that offer the same services as their websites. You may want to save your banking login to your phone so you can conveniently review your balances deposit checks transfer money and handle anything else you need to on the go.

3. Quality of customer service (10.66%)

Customer service comes in third as it was chosen as the most important feature by slightly more than 10% of respondents.

There's a lot that goes into quality customer service beyond how friendly a bank's representatives are. It's an advantage if a bank offers multiple forms of customer service such as live chat and messaging instead of only phone service. Response times are just as important considering people rarely like waiting on hold.

4 (tie). Easy ATM access and convenient branch locations (8.37%)

In fourth place there was a tie. An equal number of consumers picked easy ATM access and convenient branch locations as their must-have features. That's fitting since there are similarities between the two. Each involves being able to do some of your banking in person if the need arises.

Obviously these features matter much more to some consumers than others. After all there has been a move to digital-only banks in recent years and these banks don't have convenient branch locations -- or any branch locations at all.

6. A good brand reputation (8.26%)

Brand reputation is a critical factor for more than 8% of consumers. It's no surprise that people want to feel comfortable with the company that's in charge of their money.

We should note that U.S. financial institutions tend to be very safe places to park your cash. Most popular banks have FDIC insurance which provides up to $250000 per eligible account in the event of a bank failure.

7. Competitive interest rates (7.73%)

Interestingly enough competitive interest rates were one of the less common choices. Consumers who haven't shopped around for accounts based on their interest rates could be leaving money on the table.

It's true that you won't get rich from bank account interest and interest rates did keep dropping for most of last year. But a high-yield savings account will still pay a much better interest rate than the average. If you don't already have one you should consider it to maximize the interest you earn on your savings.

There were quite a variety of responses when consumers were asked for the one factor they'd use to pick a bank. As you shop for a bank account it's a good idea to figure out what your must-have feature is so you can find banks that will deliver it.",,,,,,

Sign up for the free Billy Penn newsletter to get everything you need to know about Philadelphia every day.

After a passerby photographed coffin-shaped indentations at a Northern Liberties construction site and developers confirmed 19th century graves were discovered neighbors just want answers.

“There are a lot of questions raised that could potentially be concerning” said Claire Adler president of the Northern Liberties Neighbors Association. “I”m not going to say this is necessarily a problem in itself that the excavations are happening. The problem is that we don’t know if it’s a problem.”

A Facebook user’s post on July 12 was the first Adler learned of the excavation even though her organization was tasked months prior with approving the developer’s plans for the site at 5th and Spring Garden.

What stands now as a strip mall anchored by a Dollar General in a rapidly developing area at the edge of Northern Liberties is set to become a 13-story mixed-use development.

Developer RREI run by father and son duo Neal and Victor Rodin is planning more than 380 residential properties and over 60000 square feet of commercial space for the corner which is across the street from Silk City Diner and Yards Brewing. An Amazon grocery store has reportedly signed on to be a tenant.

In the 19th century however the site was home to the Fifth Street Methodist Episcopal Church. The area excavated for construction is part of one burial ground known to have belonged to that church. The human remains discovered are thought to be just a handful that were left behind from the 1830s.

After discovering the possible existence of the disinterred cemetery from the mid-1800s RREI contracted an archaeology firm the developers said in a statement. The firm Philadelphia-based AKRF which has a division specializing in cultural resources then took the lead on clearing the gravesites.

“As part of the advice we received our next steps will be to reach out to the descendant church and work with them on a proper conclusion” the RREI statement said.

Confusing process for burial grounds found all over Philly

Burial grounds have been either unearthed or affected by development in Philadelphia on nearly 90 occasions said Doug Mooney president of the Philadelphia Archaeological Forum.

The Forum maintains a map of known and discovered burial grounds around the city. The colonial-era First Baptist Church cemetery was discovered during construction in Old City in 2017 for example. About a year later a historic Black burial ground was uncovered during construction in University City. The newly discovered 5th and Spring Garden site will be added to the database.

Mooney said unmarked graves fall under jurisdiction of Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court according to state law. Orphans’ Court processes legal matters involving parties that cannot handle a case themselves such as incapacitated persons minors and the dead.

Engagement with Orphans’ Court is crucial to ensure proper handling said Mooney.

RREI said it does plan to engage with Orphans’ Court but is first waiting for archaeology firm AKRF to track down the descendant church of Fifth Street Methodist Episcopal to make sure they’re part of the process.

City ordinance doesn’t mandate developers seek guidance from the court in every situation but a spokesperson for Mayor Jim Kenney’s administration said it’s encouraged “if appropriate.” The spokesperson said the RREI did not violate city ordinance in its handling of the remains.

“I’m kind of surprised that we haven’t come up with a clearer process for this yet” said Adler the Northern Liberties Neighborhood Association president.

Neighborhood leaders hope for better communication

Ann Lastuvka is operations manager at the Northern Liberties Business Improvement District. She said she was taken aback when she first learned of the graves on Facebook.

“I was really surprised” she said. “We’ve got a ton of development going on in this area and this is just one instance that has come up.” Lastuvka added that knowing the graves are related to an interred church cemetery makes this a special circumstance.

Lastuvka offered a mixed perspective on RREI’s approach to the discovery. On the one hand the developer’s choice to contract with a recognized archaeology firm early and carefully extract the graves is a welcome approach. She commended what she called “the social responsibility of that developer.”

Still she wasn’t thrilled that she and other neighbors and community leaders learned of the graves via social media.

“We totally did not know about any of these instances” Lastuvka said.

“I think during the community development review process if they had said ‘This is what we’re doing’ … it just kind of gives you a better feeling that they’re doing their due diligence all around” she continued “and aren’t just constructing and not really taking an investment in the neighborhood.”

Adler’s organization is the one that led the civic design review back in February 2020. She said the neighborhood association has since reached out to the developer’s attorney and is waiting to hear back.

Ultimately Adler said neighbors want transparency on the process from someone whether that’s the city or the developer. “I think the point is it’s people wanted to know from the start. I don’t want to have to find out about this as the leader of this organization from a Facebook comment.”

Moving forward neighbors and Northern Liberties organization leaders said they want to make sure the bodies are handled with respect.

Mooney said that is of the utmost importance. “Ultimately these are the remains of fellow Philadelphians” he said. “These are our ancestors. They certainly mean a great deal to members of the congregations and the communities that they belonged to.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9mb29kLzIwMjEvMDcvMTgvaWNlLWNyZWFtLWRheS0yMDIxLWZyZWUtaWNlLWNyZWFtLWRlYWxzLXNwZWNpYWxzLWNvbnRlc3RzLzgwMDI4NzAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to get free ice cream on National Ice Cream Day plus deals at Dairy Queen McDonald's and more Sunday,"Baskin Robbins has two deals for Ice Cream Day including free ice cream-scented kinetic sand.

Reagan’s proclamation noted the ice cream industry generated $3.5 billion in annual sales.

Five Below has announced that it will open its doors July 30 joining several new businesses that have already opened or that are planning to do so in the next few weeks at the shopping center at 2495 Brunswick Pike.

The Five Below chain which opened its first store in Wayne Pennsylvania in 2002 operates 1050 stores in 39 states. This year it plans to open 13 stores including the new store at the Lawrence Shopping Center according to its website.

Five Below is opening a few weeks after Lidl the German grocery store chain opened in the former ACME supermarket space in June. Starbucks and Aspen Dental are slated to move into the former Wells Fargo bank building across the parking lot and which is under renovation.

The three soon-to-be-opened stores and businesses are among the new businesses that have opened in the past two years at the Lawrence Shopping Center. The shopping center is anchored by Burlington Coat Factory and Staples.

New Jersey Camera the Cafe du Pain bakery and Plato’s Closet which sells second-hand clothing for teenagers and young adults were among the first to open in the revitalized shopping center.

The Dollar Tree discount store which opened its doors in August 2020 moved across the street from its former location on Brunswick Pike. It is next door to the Auto Zone automotive parts store that also opened for business. The two businesses are in part of the space that was formerly occupied by the CVS drug store chain.

The Island Sports Bar and Grill opened for business in late 2020 in the space formerly occupied by the Fusion House restaurant. Next door to the Island Bar and Grill is the Heavenly Hounds dog training business.

City Electric Supply which is a wholesale electric supply company occupies the space that used to house the R&S Strauss auto supply store in the same one-story building as Island Sports Bar and Grill and Heavenly Hounds.

Princeton eBikes which sells electric bicycles has also opened its doors. Princeton eBikes donates its profits to the Boys & Girls Club of Mercer County which has a site on Spruce Street in Lawrence Township. The club offers social enrichment and recreational activities to young people ages 3 to 18 years old.

The LA Fitness gym is planned for the former Huffman Koos furniture store which was demolished in January 2020 to make way for the construction of the gym. Construction has been stalled. The Lawrence Township Planning Board extended site plan approval for the project until Oct. 15.

There are still a few vacant store fronts and signs advertising those vacancies have been taped to the storefront windows.

The 393430-square-foot Lawrence Shopping Center was purchased by JJ Operating Inc. for $16.2 million in December 2016 according to the Lawrence Township Tax Assessor’s Office.

The prior owner wbcmt 2007-c33 Brunswick Pike LLC acquired the Lawrence Shopping Center at a Mercer County sheriff’s sale in 2013. Lawrence Center LLC which owned the shopping center defaulted on a $39.5 million loan which led to the sheriff’s sale to satisfy the debt.

JJ Operating Inc. the current owner is a family-owned real estate investment and management company based in New York City.

The Lawrence Shopping Center which opened in 1960 was the first major shopping center in Lawrence Township. It consisted of 150000 square feet and 13 stores. The shopping center underwent expansions and renovations several times between 1966 and 1997.

Among the original stores at the Lawrence Shopping Center were W.T. Grant which was a 5- and 10-cent store; the Rexall drug store; Dunham’s department store; the Pantry Pride grocery store and Lawrence Liquors according to records on file at the Lawrence Township Tax Assessor’s Office.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbGlzYnVyeXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTgvcHJlc2VudGF0aW9uLW9uLXBsYW5zLWZvci13ZXN0LWVuZC1wbGF6YS13aWxsLXNlcnZlLWFzLXJlZnJlc2hlci1mb3ItY29tbWlzc2lvbmVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Presentation on plans for West End Plaza will serve as refresher for commissioners - Salisbury Post,"Presentation on plans for West End Plaza will serve as refresher for commissioners Published 12:00 am Sunday July 18 2021

SALISBURY — At its first meeting in almost a month the Rowan County Board of Commissioners on Monday is slated to receive a presentation regarding future plans for West End Plaza.

The presentation will be delivered by ADW Architects a Charlotte-based firm hired several years ago to create a proposal to move Rowan County Cooperative Extension the soil and water conservation district N.C. Forestry Service and the Farm Service Agency to West End Plaza.

“Nothing regarding the plan is changing” Chair Greg Edds said. “It is really to kickstart the project again let them refresh where we were and really to go over any cost differences. We know there’s going to be some. That’s a fact. The question is just how much.”

Rowan County purchased West End Plaza formerly the Salisbury Mall in 2013. The facility still houses a handful of retail businesses including Dollar Tree and Bath and Body Works. The 33800-square-foot former JC Penney space is rented out by the county for events. West End Plaza was most recently used by the Health Department for vaccine clinics and as the site of a large job fair.

Commissioners have been considering renovating the facility for some time but those plans were on hold last year due to COVID-19 and a moratorium on capital projects.

When the commissioners last month passed the county’s budget for the current fiscal year they approved transferring about $1.7 million into a savings account for West End Plaza improvements which brought the money available in the account to roughly $6 million. The county’s budget also includes new debt totaling $15 million for West End Plaza renovations.

The board will convene Monday at 6 p.m. in the J. Newton Cohen Sr. Room on the second floor of the Rowan County Administration Building. The meeting can be joined virtually at https://bit.ly/rowanboc0719 with password 071921 or by phone at: 602-753-0140 720-928-9299 or 213-338-8477.

Also on the meeting agenda:

• A representative from McGill Associates engineering firm will deliver a presentation regarding plans to create an access road near the Rowan County Animal Shelter. The plan includes the construction of a roadway from Julian Road to serve James River Equipment a farm equipment store located near the shelter. It will also include the extension of water and sewer to serve the new Dog Adoption Center which is currently under construction.

• Commissioners will consider approving the purchase of 18 vehicles including 14 Dodge Durangos and four Dodge Chargers for the Rowan County Sheriff’s Office. The vehicles will be purchased at a total cost of $572730 from Ilderton Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in High Point. The 14 Dodge Durangos will cost $33677 each and the four Dodge Chargers will be $25313 each.

• The board will consider formally authorizing the execution of a $400000 building reuse grant the state awarded the county in support of Eastern Wholesale Fence’s relocation to the Mid-South Industrial Park on Statesville Boulevard. Last October Eastern Wholesale Fence announced that it would create 142 jobs and invest $17.5 million with the project.

• Commissioners will consider authorizing County Manager Aaron Church to prepare and release a request for proposals to solicit interest from registered lobbyists to work with Rowan County. After discussing the idea of hiring a lobbyist to advocate for the county’s interests on the state and national level last year commissioners included $60000 for lobbying services in the current fiscal budget.

• Commissioners will consider approving a request from District Attorney Brandy Cook to hire two assistant district attorneys to “assist in the speedy disposition of cases involving a threat to public safety.” The positions will each cost the county $82459 ($164918 total) and the term of the agreement will be for a one-year period starting on Sept. 1 and ending on Aug. 31 2022.

• Commissioners will consider declaring a .17-acre plot of land at 608 South Carolina Ave. in Spencer as surplus which would initiate an upset bid process. The market value for the property is currently listed in the tax records at $14500. The lot is buildable with the required setbacks and water and sewer are available. The town of Spencer received an offer in the amount of $8250 for the property.

• The board will consider approving a request from the Health Department to reduce the number of temporary COVID-19 related positions. Last year the department requested 11 positions be funded using state dollars but is now asking for the positions to be reduced to 7.5 full-time equivalents. The change would reduce staff costs by almost $120000 per year.

• Commissioners will consider approving an agreement between the county and the North Carolina Department of Transportation for a $247140 Community Transportation Rural Formula Grant Program that will help Rowan Transit with administrative costs related to rural transportation activities.

• The board will consider an amendment to an interlocal agreement between the county and the city of Kannapolis for the county to allow the sale of the former site of the Kannapolis Intimidators Stadium. The Kannapolis City Council in May approved the sale of the stadium site for $3 million to Concord-based Fortius Capital Partners who plans on constructing three industrial buildings. The county is agreeing to waive $2.625 million in debt that Kannapolis still owes on the stadium as long as the city funds infrastructure installations on the Old Beatty Ford Road interchange.

• The board will consider a request to authorize the operation of the septic tank system installed at the new concession stand at Dan Nicholas Park.

• Commissioners will hear an update from the Rowan Economic Development Council.",,,,,,,,,

In 2020 builder of pipeline sued owner claiming underpayment and builder attached liens of $19M on rights-of-way

Case failed to end in mediation; lawyers gathering more evidence as litigation resumes in federal court in Erie

A federal lawsuit is keeping uncertainty in place for hundreds of property owners who sold rights-of-way for a natural gas pipeline in western Erie County.

The suit over the 28.3-mile Risberg Pipeline has failed to settle in U.S. District Court in Erie and both sides in the case are asking for more time to gather evidence as they prepare for trial.

As the case advances slowly in court a far-reaching aspect of the dispute is staying intact: mechanic's liens of $18946185 each are still attached to pipeline work on hundreds of swaths of land near Albion in Erie County.

The liens are an outgrowth of the federal suit that the builder of the pipeline the Wood Group USA Inc. of Houston Texas filed in August against the Erie-based RH Energytrans which owns the $86 million project. The pipeline which opened in 2019 is made up of 15 miles of 12-inch steel pipe in Elk Creek Township in Erie County and about 13 miles of pipe in Ashtabula County Ohio where the project ends in North Kinsgsville.

The Wood Group claims that RH Energytrans owes it more than $35 million with $18946185 of that due on the work the Wood Group said it completed in Erie County. RH Energytrans is claiming it has paid the Wood Group everything due under the terms of the contract. The case is in federal court because the Wood Group and RH Energytrans are located in different states.

In a companion action to the federal suit the Wood Group in December filed the mechanic's liens at the Erie County Courthouse in an attempt to recoup the money that it claims RH Energytrans owes it. The Wood Group in December also filed similar mechanic's liens against hundreds of other property owners in Ashtabula County.

Lines of confusion:Erie County landowners gave access for pipeline. Now they're getting hit with liens

Though the total of all the liens are for nearly $19 million that amount is spread out across all the swaths of property all of which are the parcels where the pipeline runs underground. None of the properties with liens include houses or farms but the liens have still created confusion and left property owners with the possibility that a small part of their property could be encumbered with massive debt.

If the Wood Group were able to execute on the liens according to the court records it would be able to take over whatever leases or other interests RH Energytrans has in the pipeline. The Wood Group would be expected to remove the liens if it loses in federal court or ends the case by reaching a settlement with RH Energytrans.

No resolution

The prospects of a settlement diminished on April 26 when a neutral arbitrator reported that a court-mandated mediation session on April 22-23 failed to produce a resolution according to court records.

With the mediation over lawyers for the Wood Group and RH Energytrans went back to engaging in what is known as discovery the process by which plaintiffs and defendants gather evidence and exchange evidence as they get ready for trial.

U.S. District Judge Susan Paradise Baxter who is assigned the case had set the discovery deadline for Sept. 30. But the lawyers for the Wood Group and RH Energytrans filed a joint motion on Monday asking Baxter to grant a 45-day extension ""due to the magnitude"" of the information according to the filing.

Moving along:Federal OK given for Erie-to-Ohio gas pipeline

If Baxter grants the request as expected it will extend the other deadlines she had set for the case including the deposition of experts now set for March 11. Baxter has not scheduled a trial date.

2019:Erie-to-Ohio pipeline nears completion

A lawyer for the Wood Group Neal Devlin of Erie was out of the office and unavailable for comment though he said previously that the Wood Group does not comment on ongoing litigation.

Dennis Holbrook a spokesman for RH Energytrans had expressed hope in January that RH Energytrans and the Wood Group could resolve the case through mediation.

""We did the mediation but it didn't really get us anywhere"" Holbrook said Friday. ""We had a good mediator and I think we made a good-faith effort. I was disappointed with Wood's efforts. It takes two sides to reach a successful conclusion and we just didn't have that.""

Holbrook said he is more hopeful that there might be a speedy resolution to the companion legal case unfolding in Ashtabula County Ohio.

""We are trying to get the mechanic's liens lifted in Ohio"" Holbrook said adding that his company believes there is a state statute that could allow for a quicker resolution because ""we think they did not timely file their case in Ohio.""

Chances for a quick resolution in Pennsylvania don't seem as good he said.

""It's going to take a while"" Holbrook said adding that depositions in the case are being scheduled into the fall and possibly into next year as Baxter's March 2022 deadline for experts' deposition shows.

Holbrook who has described it as unfortunate that liens were placed against property owners thanked them again Friday for their patience and cooperation.

""If there is a way to resolve this sooner we are going to make every effort to do that"" Holbrook said. ""Our intent is to be a good neighbor for a long time.""

Need for natural gas

The Risberg Pipeline is part of a network. The Erie County end of the pipeline connects to an existing distribution line owned by EmKey Energy a sister company to RH Energytrans.

That pipeline connects near Meadville to the Tennessee Gas distribution system that originates on the Gulf Coast.

The natural gas started flowing through the new Risberg Pipeline in December 2019 providing Dominion Energy Ohio with up to 40 million cubic feet of natural gas a day — enough to meet the daily needs of about 150000 households.

The pipeline is also expected to provide the natural gas needs of a $474 million pig iron plant that has been proposed for Ashtabula Ohio.

Performing from a New Haven Connecticut’s Westville Music Bowl Susan Tedeschi Derek Trucks and company covered “Bell Bottom Blues” “Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?” and (in front of an audience) “Key to the Highway” from Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs; Tedeschi Trucks Band’s Layla Revisited is a full-album live performance of that classic LP — featuring Eric Clapton Duane Allman Bobby Whitlock and more — recorded live at the Lock’n Festival in August 2019 with guests like Trey Anastasio.

As Tedeschi and Trucks previously noted the pair have several connections to Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs: The album was released on Susan Tedeschi’s birthday in November 1970 and Trucks was both named after Derek and the Dominos and is a former member of the Allman Brothers Band.

Nobody will ever accuse Domino's Pizza Japan of playing things too safe with the toppings of their pies. Over the past few years the pizza chain has released a super spicy Tsundere pizza a tapioca pizza topped with boba pearls and a series of ""shameful"" pizzas that contain triple mayonnaise and double garlic.

So you'd figure Domino's Pizza Japan wouldn't feel the need to apologize for any of their ambitious pizza toppings. However that's exactly what they did when they caught wind the reaction of London Twitter user @marcooth (and many others) to their newly released Crispy Fish and Chips Pizza.

As shown above the Crispy Fish and Chips Pizza is topped by fried fish and potato slices basil tartar sauce tomato sauce and actual slices of lemon. For those not used to some of their more unusual toppings it's certainly a jarring dish to feast your eyes upon.

When Domino’s Pizza Japan noticed the surprise surrounding the situation however they offered up some quality customer service that included an apology for any offense as well as a free pizza.

@marcooth added to their friendly jab that they would probably enjoy the pie and were in fact ""now completely craving the fish and chips pizza."" While no pizza was exchanged due to international boundaries Domino's Pizza Japan has been making good on their word to try and convince doubters of the affinity between fish and chips and pizza including YouTuber Akidearest who says they have a video of it in the works.

The Crispy Fish and Chips Pizza is actually part of Domino's new Summer Favorite Quattro a 4-part pizza (although each can be ordered individually) that includes other bold toppings such as 5 Seafood Ajillo Butter Chicken Curry and Crispy Chicken Bites & Honey Mustard.

As Domino's Pizza Japan continues to reply to those in doubt many are commending them for taking things in good fun and showing some generous customer service.

For the record the writer of this article at Grape Japan sampled The Crispy Fish and Chips pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it without any national insult.

Domino’s Pizza Japan’s official Twitter account as you’d naturally assume writes its posts in Japanese. A notable exception occurred this week though when they responded to a tweet from Twitter user Mark Emlyn Evans regarding the chain’s new Crispy Fish and Chips Pizza.

We are sorry our fish and chip pizza has caused so much trouble. We think it’s quite delicious. If you are in Japan and would like to challenge let us know👍 We may be able to work out a plan internally that we can offer to you for free!🍕 — ドミノ・ピザ (@dominos_JP) July 12 2021

Unfortunately since he lives in London Evans hasn’t been able to take Domino’s Japan up on their free pizza offer. However we’ve got multiple branches within delivery distance of SoraNews24 headquarters in Tokyo and so our Japanese-language reporter Tasuku Egawa decided to order a Crispy Fish and Chips Pizza and see how the concept that’s sent shockwaves around the world tastes.

At 4200 yen (US$38) for a 33-centimeter (13-inch) large the Crispy Fish and Chips isn’t a budget-priced pizza but Tasuku decided to splurge. Despite the unusual toppings it didn’t take longer to arrive than any of the more orthodox pizzas we’ve had delivered to the office and soon enough he had the pie in front of him.

Visually it was impressive and actually looked even better than the somewhat drab-colored photo from Domino’s mobile order app. Leaning in for a closer inspection Tasuku saw that each slice has a piece of battered fish.

It’s also nice to see that the pizza’s chips/French fries are of a nice thickness and not just some haphazard spud shavings.

The reason Tasuku had drawn taste testing duties is because while pretty much everyone we have on staff likes pizza Tasuku is the biggest fish and chips fan in the office. Let’s take a look at his post-tasting notes:

“OK time to dig in! Hmmm I see. The pizza has both tomato sauce and tarter sauce on it but the tomato has the stronger flavor so the tartar sauce provides a subtler accent than I’d expected. The pieces of fried fish are a little on the small side but since you’re balancing them on a pizza slice this was probably the right call. It keeps the slice easy to eat but you can still really taste the delicious fish and so all of this works great together.”

The Crispy Fish and Chips Pizza isn’t perfect though. Tasuku’s notes continue:

“The lemon slice toppings are a problem. I like squeezing a lot of lemon juice on my fish and chips but I didn’t like having lemon slices including the peel on a pizza. I think this is what’s really going to make the Fish and Chips Pizza divisive like how pineapple on pizza is usually a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing without much middle ground.”

Because of that Tasukus’s actually got some suggestions as to how he’d make the pizza better.

“If you’re like me and don’t think you’d like having warm tart fruit on your pizza when you order you might want to ask Domino’s to hold the lemon slices. Aside from the citrus it’s a really well-balanced pizza in terms of flavor and if you’re wanting something with a bolder taste maybe you could add some extra tartar sauce or a splash of malt vinegar after they deliver it.”

So in the end Tasuku feels like fish and chips pizza really isn’t all that weird but lemon pizza definitely is. Still he ate the whole thing and didn’t leave a slice for me so overall that counts as a thumbs-up.

For one Chapman can’t throw strikes. Over his last 14.2 innings he was walked 18 batters (19:18 K:BB ratio). Compare that to the first 16 innings of the season when he walked just five batters (34:5 K:BB ratio) and it’s obvious that has been a major cause of his downturn. His current 6.8 BB/9 is the second worst rate of his career.

Additionally a new development this year is how hittable his fastball has been. Hitters have a .320 batting average and .580 slugging percentage against his four-seamer. Before this season .301 was the highest SLG against his fastball in his career. As a result Chapman has already allowed five home runs in 2021 (the second highest amount of his career). The velocity and spin rate are on par with previous seasons so it’s likely that his lack of command is to blame. Whatever it is it’s extremely concerning.

Overworking Other Pitchers

With Chapman becoming completely untrustworthy over the last few weeks the burden has been thrown on Jonathan Loaisiga and Chad Green to pick up the slack. As a result Loaisiga (47.0) and Green (46.2) both rank in the top seven of all relievers in innings pitched this season. While both of them have largely been outstanding this season they’ve also been overworked and the Yankees need to find a way to lighten their load in the second half.

Green has a 4.15 ERA with two or less days of rest this season (30.1 innings pitched) compared to a 0.55 ERA with three or more days (16.1 IP). Similarly Loaisiga owns a 4.80 ERA with a day or less of rest (15 IP) while his ERA drops to 0.84 with two or more days on the shelf (32 IP). Some of the team’s most crushing losses have come with one of those two pitching on limited rest (see the Astros game last week). Getting Zack Britton back from injury should help but they also need Chapman to return to form.

How Should the Yankees Handle it?

It’s important to remember this isn’t the first time Chapman has hit a rough patch with the Yankees. He temporarily lost the closer’s job after posting a 9.00 ERA in August of 2017. The move worked out great as Chapman finished the season with just one run allowed over 20 September and October innings.

If the Yankees decide to go down a similar path they could turn to Zack Britton. He has ample closing experience (153 career saves) and could move into that role in the short-term if healthy. Personally I’d like to see more of a committee or hot-hand approach with Chapman Britton Green and Loaisiga all being utilized. Whatever they opt to do the Yankees need Aroldis Chapman right if they’re going to turn their season around.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd2VhcnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3RzYS13YWl0LXRpbWVzLWNhdXNlLXByb2JsZW1zLWF0LXRoZS1wZW5zYWNvbGEtaW50bC1haXJwb3J00gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93ZWFydHYuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3RzYS13YWl0LXRpbWVzLWNhdXNlLXByb2JsZW1zLWF0LXRoZS1wZW5zYWNvbGEtaW50bC1haXJwb3J0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TSA wait-times cause travel delays at the Pensacola Int'l Airport,"Summer travel is triggering long lines at the Pensacola International Airport.

Parker and her husband told Channel 3 News at least 40 people near them missed their flights due to the TSA lines moving slowly.



We contacted the spokesperson for the airport. He told us this is the normal ebb and flow of the airport adding that people are showing up 25 minutes before their flight instead of two hours.

Channel 3 News did speak with at least one couple who said they arrived two hours early.



Parker disagrees. She claims a TSA worker mentioned flights double on Sunday's at the airport but the TSA staffing didn't change.

Parker has to be a work tomorrow so they rented a vehicle for $512 for one day to make the 11 drive back to the Dallas area.





We have reached out to TSA for comment as well.

The Dow dropped 725.81 points or 2.1% to 33962.04 in a broad-based rout that sent all 30 members lower. At one point during the session the Dow was down 946 points before recovering some ground into the close. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% to 4258.49. Energy financials and industrials were the worst-performing sectors. The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite slid 1.1% to 14274.98 posting its fifth-straight day of losses and worst losing streak since October. The 10-year Treasury yield reached a five-month low of 1.17% exacerbating fears about the slowing economy. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 1.5% and briefly dipped into correction territory on an intraday basis - down more than 10% from its March high. ""You have two concerns coming together ... concerns about market technicals and concerns about growth"" Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. ""That's what all the asset classes are telling you.""

Covid cases have rebounded in the U.S. this month with the delta variant spreading among the unvaccinated. The U.S. is averaging nearly 26000 new cases a day in the last seven days through Sunday up from a seven-day average of around 11000 cases a day a month ago according to CDC data. Cases were already flaring up around the world because of the delta variant. The Cboe Volatility Index surged as high as 25 amid the broad market sell-off its highest level since May. The so-called fear gauge looks at prices of options on the S&P 500 to track the level of fear on Wall Street.

Airlines got hit as investors reassessed whether travel among consumers would live up to high expectations with shares of Delta and American sinking about 4% each. United lost 5%. Key stocks linked to global economic growth also fell. Boeing shed 5% and General Motors and Caterpillar dropped about 2% each. ""The market appears ready to take on a more defensive character as we experience a meaningful deceleration in earnings and economic growth"" Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson said in a note Monday. ""Market breadth has been deteriorating for months and is just another confirmation of the mid-cycle transition in our view. It usually ends with a material (10-20%) index level correction."" Wilson advised clients to buy staples such as Mondelez International to weather the decline.

(AP) — Thai sisters Ariya and Moriya Jutanugarn won the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational on Saturday shooting their second 11-under 59 in best-ball play for a three-stroke victory over defending champions Cydney Clanton and Jasmine Suwannapura.

""But before we went to the tee I walked to my sister and told her like `You know what Mo today the goal is we're going to try to make birdie every hole. ... That's the goal today I told her.""

The 25-year-old Ariya won for the 12th time on the LPGA Tour and second this season and the 26-year-old Moriya took her second title. Ariya won the Honda LPGA Thailand in May 9 for her first victory since July 2018.

""I would say this is the best moment for me because we won together"" Ariya said. ""We helped each other to win the golf tournament.""

The Jutanugarns finished at 24-under 256 at windy Midland Country Club. They opened with a 67 in alternate shot had a 59 on Thursday in best ball and shot 71 in alternate shot Friday to enter the final round two strokes behind Clanton and Suwannapura.

""I would say it's really special"" Ariya said. ""Every tournament I won she always with me and when she won I with her. The way we played today I just told myself `This is going to be a great memory for us to win together.'""

Clanton and Suwannapura shot 64. They won the inaugural event by six shots in 2019. The tournament was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Jasmine and I just talked on the 18th green man we felt like we won this one"" Clanton said. ""It was tough conditions today it was windy. We didn't think anybody would go super low but Ariya and Moriya played great today so they deserved it.""

Lim Kim and Yealimi Noh (64) and Pajaree Anannarukarn and Aditi Ashok (66) tied for third at 19 under. U.S. Women's Open winner Yuka Saso and Minjee Lee were 18 under after a 62.

Nelly and Jessica Korda shot a 67 to tie for 17th at 13 under. Nelly Korda was making her first start since winning the Meijer LPGA Classic and the KPMG Women's PGA in consecutive weeks to take the No. 1 spot in the world.

The Jutanugarn sisters had experienced just about everything together in golf – except winning.

With her sister in the water on the final hole Ariya drained a 35-foot birdie putt from off the green to put a stamp on a three-stroke victory over defending champions Jasmine Suwannapura and Cydney Clanton. The players known as Mo and May finished at 24 under for the tournament.

“Of course we won this for Grace” said Ariya whose regular caddie Pete Godfrey was back in Dallas with 10-month-old daughter Grace who was hospitalized with seizures and brain swelling during the Volunteers of America Classic. Godfrey is married to LPGA player Jane Park.

“He always put a smile on his face to make us happy” said Ariya “and he’s always like give us the best support and he keep telling us ‘You got this go win for Gracie.’ And we did.”

The Jutanugarns birdied five consecutive holes from Nos. 9-13. Ariya birdied the last two holes to seal the tournament. This is Ariya’s 12th career LPGA title and second of the season. Her victory at the Honda LPGA Thailand on May 9 snapped a drought that dated back to July 2018 (1015 days).

This is Moriya’s second LPGA title and her first since April 2018.

Ariya said the win with her sister tops every other of her career.

“I just really enjoy every moment this week” said Moriya.

""Thank you for my team of course. Especially my sister who made a lot of birdies for me today."" 😂@jutanugarn | @MJutanugarn pic.twitter.com/G8F8r7AZXJ — LPGA (@LPGA) July 17 2021

After struggling in the third round of alternate shot Ariya told Moriya the strategy in the final round was to birdie every hole.

At the start of the season Ariya said the sisters arrange their schedule around the Dow to make sure they get to play together. While the support is evident there’s also a bit of inner-competition to see who can make the most birdies each round.

“Still me” said Ariya jabbing her older sister.

“No matter what like she probably hit a few trees out there” said Moriya “but she still make a lot of birdies for me so I forgive her. We very enjoy it.”

The winning team this week received the standard two-year winner’s exemption on the LPGA Priority List. CME points and prize money are official for the purposes of the current-year LPGA Official Money List and Race to the CME Globe Standings. Rolex Player of the Year points and Rolex Rankings points were not allocated.

When Clanton teamed up with Suwannapura two years ago she was bouncing back and forth between the LPGA and Symetra Tours. A victory at the Dow changed the course of her career. The pair closed with a 64 on Saturday to finish solo second.

“Jasmine and I just talked on the 18th green man we felt like we won this on” said Clanton. “It was tough conditions today it was windy we didn’t think anybody would go super low but Ariya and Moriya played great today so they deserved it.”

The index climbed to a new intraday record high after the announcement.

Other stocks that helped push the Dow Jones to a record high included those that benefit from the reopening of the economy like United Airlines and Carnival. Bank stocks like Wells Fargo Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase also pressed the index higher.

Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) surges led by Apple big tech

October 12 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) climbed more than 300 points out of the gate this morning as Apple advanced on hopes about this week’s iPhone event. The jump in U.S. stocks comes despite a statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who said that talks over the next round of coronavirus stimulus have officially stalled.

She wrote in a letter to House Democrats that the White House’s proposal is “wholly insufficient.” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in their own letter to lawmakers over the weekend that they will keep negotiating with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

The Dow Jones’ (INDEXDJX: .DJI)’s gain this morning follows a strong week last week. The index posted its largest weekly gain since August last week and the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 had their best weeks since July. Investors are also getting ready for the third-quarter earnings reports which are slated to start rolling out this week with a number of airlines and major banks scheduled to report.

Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) slips as presidential debate approaches

September 29 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) slipped today after rallying on Friday and Monday due to renewed hopes that there would be another stimulus package. Today the index is falling ahead of the presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

Globally more than 1 million people have now died from the coronavirus and that’s serving to shake up global stock market indices as well. When Trump and Biden take the stage for their debate tonight they are sure to discuss the handling of the pandemic and plans for the economic recovery. The U.S. has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world at 7.1 million and the highest death toll at more than 205000 of any country in the world.

The debate could set the tone for the markets leading up to the November presidential election.

Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) declines amid economic uncertainty

September 18 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) fell 150 points before cutting its losses in morning trading today. U.S. stocks have been pressured by signs of trouble in the economic recovery and a fresh surge in coronavirus infections.

Today is also a quadruple witching day which means both options and futures on indexes and stocks are expiring at the same time. The result is volatility on the stock market. The phenomenon often results in above-average volumes due to the way traders are moving out of hedges on their futures and options contracts.

Other pressure on the Dow Jones is coming from the presidential election and Congress’ lack of a deal on further coronavirus stimulus measures.

Survey puts Dow Jones Industrial Average at 52k in 5 years

August 17 2020 Update: A new survey suggests the average investor is excessively optimistic—so optimistic in fact that they see the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) at 52000 in only five years.

MarketWatch reported on the survey which was conducted by money-management firm Schroders. The firm surveyed 23450 private investors in 32 different countries including 1500 people in the U.S. U.S. investors are even more investors than those in other countries.

The average investor expects stock prices to continue skyrocketing putting the Dow Jones at around 52000 after accounting for dividends. The average investor predicted a return of 15.4% per year for the next five years.

How The Dow Jones Industrial Average Works

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) has fallen off a cliff the past few weeks. The index is up almost 5% in trading on March 13th 2020 but that is still several thousand points below the recent high. The DJI is currently trading at 22188.26. Previously the Dow climbed to a new record high at 29408 in early February before pulling back not long after the market opened. However as the day rolled on the index flipped back into the green.

The Dow Jones was up about 84 points amid further progress in the trade talks between China and the U.S. China plans to slash in half its tariffs on some $75 billion of imported U.S. goods starting on Feb. 14. It’s the first step in the nation’s phase-one trade resolution with Washington. Tariffs on many goods will be cut from 10% to 5% while other goods’ tariffs will be slashed from 5% to 2.5% according to China’s Ministry of Finance.

INDEXDJX: .DJI: Previously

Commenting on today’s trading which saw the Dow Jones INDEXDJX: .DJI near 29000 Gorilla Trades strategist Ken Berman said:

It seems that the resilience of domestic stocks continues to be impressive. Indeed it only took a few days to completely erase last week’s scary sell-off. It wasn’t that long time ago that we celebrated Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) 28000 and thanks to today’s broad rally the industrial average got very close to topping 29000 and bulls already have the historic 30000 level in their crosshairs.”

Q4 2019 hedge fund letters conferences and more

The major indices all finished in the green for the second day in a row and the large-cap benchmarks also closed at their highest levels ever. Equities were boosted by the de-escalation between the U.S. and Iran. The Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) was up 212 or 0.7% to 28957 the Nasdaq gained 74 or 0.8% to 9203 while the S&P 500 rose by 22 or 0.7% to 3275. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an almost 3-to-2 ratio on the NYSE where volume was slightly above average.

Even though the major indices finished below their intraday highs. This was due to a shallow afternoon dip. However all of the key sectors gained ground with even the defensive utilities edging higher. Tech stocks consumer goods and services were the strongest issues which is as healthy as it gets when it comes to bull market rallies. The relative weakness of small-caps was the only major red flag today. This was despite the fact that large-caps continue to hit record highs the Russell 2000 remains much weak from a technical perspective.

Dow 29000 I ndexdjx:.DJI this week?

The Volatility Index (VIX) hit its lowest level since last week’s airstrike. Additionally short interest continues to decline on Wall Street. Analysts agree that there is no lack of risk appetite among equity investors. That said we did have several short-lived pullbacks in recent weeks. These downturns ensure that the positive sentiment hasn't turned into exuberance. In fact the positive shift in global economic trends provided another boost for stocks just after the trade agreement between the U.S. and China. The lofty gains will eventually lead to a deeper correction until the bullish catalysts keep on coming. In the meantime the foundation of the rally remains solid.

Iran in focus

The traditional safe-haven assets such as Treasuries Silver and gold all declined today and the price of oil also continued to fall in the face of the improving economic outlook as the odds of a new military conflict in the Middle East declined. President Trump unexpectedly called for the resumption of the talks with Iran. While the hardliners in the Persian state called for revenge downplaying the effects of yesterday’s missile attacks. However the two sides seem to be steering away from a major conflict.

The government jobs report will likely steal the show tomorrow. Volatility could already spike higher in pre-market trading because of the release. All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls figure following last month’s blowout reading of 266000. This week’s bullish ADP payrolls number also indicates further gains. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 3.5% while hourly earnings are forecast to rise by 0.3%. As the global economy has been showing signs of life in recent weeks Treasuries yields could explode higher. Yields will follow if the U.S. labor market continue to show robust growth.

Dow (I ndexdjx:.DJI) 29000 next?

Technical Corner. Since the major indices all erased last Friday’s dip. It’s no surprise that technicals continue to be bullish across the board. Indeed not a single trend indicator flashing red. The major indices are still well above their rising 200-day moving averages of 8153 for the Nasdaq 2981 for the S&P 500 and 26817 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and now just shy of Dow 29000. Despite the late-day pullback the benchmarks are also north of their steeply rising 50-day moving averages of 3149 for the S&P 500 8682 for the Nasdaq and 28024 for the Dow.

Thanks to five consecutive bullish months Apple’s (AAPL) stock achieved yet another technical milestone passing the $300 per share level yesterday. Apple lost the title of the most valuable public company due to the IPO of the Saudi oil giant Aramco. However Apple took over Microsoft (MSFT) while crossing $1.3 trillion in total capitalization. The stock hit another record high today and it’s well above both its moving averages. However an orderly pullback of the INDEXDJX: .DJI could happen anytime. Apple is still likely to lead the way higher in 2020. Stay tuned!"

Guest columnists

My daughter who lives in Gulf Breeze proper sent me a rather disturbing video the other day.

The doorbell camera caught images of a large black bear ambling across her yard just a few feet from the front porch.

Seems it was garbage day in Gulf Breeze and as a result it also was breakfast time for an unknown number of wayward bears that roam freely about the city.

That same bear later was spotted a few houses down the street turning over a garbage can and feasting on the accessible and tempting contents.

Fun fact: black bears have the keenest sense of smell of any animal approximately 300 times stronger than a bloodhound’s and 2100 times more powerful than a human’s.

So if you think that box of fried chicken you had last night smelled good think how enticing the aroma is for a bear after the leftovers marinate in a trash can overnight.

Like any parent with children who like to play in the front yard my daughter was concerned about the safety of her two boys ages 4 and 8. What if they had been in the yard when the bear appeared?

Naturally her first reaction was to call City Hall and ask what could be done about bears cruising the city in search of food.

Bear spotted at UWF in 2020:Large bear spotted at UWF campus in Pensacola officials urge caution

2019 sighting:Black bear takes a dip in Holley by the Sea pool prompting alert to residents and swimmers

The city’s answer: Its hands are tied due to state laws and regulations.

As a result City Hall urges citizens concerned about bears to call the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s regional office in Panama City and report bear encounters.

(It should be noted that Florida’s black bears were declared an “Endangered and Threatened Species” in 1974 and as such it is illegal to kill or harm one unless it is to protect human life or livestock.)

To her credit Gulf Breeze Mayor Cherry Fitch acknowledges bears have become a problem and says she is eager to work with state and local officials to find a solution.

I called the Fish and Wildlife Commission office in Panama City and spoke with Shelby Burgess who said bears that become a chronic nuisance in urban settings on occasion will be captured and relocated to uninhabited areas. But the problem she adds is they will eventually follow their noses and return to the areas that offer easy food.

Burgess adds that Florida black bears are rather skittish and if given the opportunity will avoid humans. On the other hand bears are wild animals and wild animals by nature are unpredictable.

Tagging and tracking bears and alerting residents by phone or text when they enter a neighborhood is deemed too costly in terms of manpower and equipment.

The best — an apparently only — available strategy at present says Burgess is to implement an active program of “harassing” the bears to make it unpleasant for them to roam a particular neighborhood or community.

Keeping garbage cans securely out of reach is another preventative measure but also problematic on garbage days when cans must be on put out on the street — easy pickings for a hungry bear.

What to do if you find yourself staring at a 250-pound black bear in your front yard?

Here are a few suggestions:

Stand and face the bear directly and never ever run away or approach the bear.

Make yourself appear as large as possible; difficult to do if you’re a 40-pound six-year-old boy or girl.

Make as much noise as possible by yelling or banging on pots and pans assuming you keep some handy in the front and back yards.

The bottom line: a significant number of well-fed bears have taken up residence in Gulf Breeze and from the looks of it have no plans to vacate the city.

So keep the kids out of the front yard load up on bear spray and let’s hope this risky live-and-let-live policy continues to work ... and that no one including the bears gets hurt.

DTE,DTE Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW9ha2xhbmRwcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xOC91bmV4cGVjdGVkLWFic2VuY2Uv0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlb2FrbGFuZHByZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzE4L3VuZXhwZWN0ZWQtYWJzZW5jZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shows go on after the loss of much-beloved fixer at 313 Presents,"Many things will seem the same when the DTE Energy Music Theatre begins hosting concerts again after nearly 22 months of pandemic pause — the tailgate parties the entrance lines the blankets and rented chairs on the lawn.

But for those who work and perform at the venue something important will be missing.

Derek Boczkowski one of 313 Presents’ primary events production managers — since September 1989 when he joined the staff at The Palace of Auburn Hills — died unexpectedly of heart failure on March 5 at the age of 49. He was a genuinely beloved fixture primarily at DTE but also at the company’s other venues usually the first person performers would see when they arrived and the person charged with making sure things went smoothly — or at least as smoothly as possible — for any given event.

“He was a true heart” says 313 Presents President Howard Handler. “He was the essence of all of us who love putting on shows and on some levels he was every fan. He lived for the shows and for the artists. He was always the first guy to the meeting a big smile on his face. He loved what he did.”

Gina Lacy Talkington Boczkowski’s girlfriend of eight years adds that his drive was simply “the people.”

“He just loved meeting all the different people and he loved making people happy — even if it was people he didn’t know just putting on a show that made everybody happy and enjoy themselves. It really was just the people in general.”

Befitting his gregarious personality and bearlike physical presence Boczkowski left behind a treasure trove of memories with family friends co-workers and colleagues — as well as artists with whom he developed relationships. Eminem invited Boczkowski to play basketball at his house for instance and he would periodically journey south to be part of Hootie & the Blowfish’s annual Monday After the Masters charity golf tournament. Detroit-born comedian John Heffron became a friend and will perform at a celebration for Boczkowski on Nov. 12 at Mark Ridley’s Comedy Castle in Royal Oak.

Talkington says Jimmy Buffett’s visits to Detroit were special as well. “He was always really excited for those shows” she remembers adding he soldiered through one with a torn cornea. “He went in even though he could hardly see all day long because it was (Buffett).”

Common among all are stories of warmth dedication and dependability as well as gestures small and magnanimous and a perpetually cheerful demeanor despite grueling hours. Boczkowski got the job done in a seamless fashion and was there to do it again sometimes just hours later — often employing verbiage that co-workers dubbed “the Derektionary.”

When the circus hit town Boczkowski could sometimes be seen walking behind the elephants with a shovel when the situation required. He would help clear chairs from an arena floor or step in for an absent runner to help transport a performer on the ground. He made sure VIPs were taken care of even when unannounced and he could produce “magical” parking spots backstage when needed.

And during the pandemic Boczkowski was still out at DTE painting railings as well as overseeing shows such as Jurassic Quest and Magic of Lights.

“He was such an amazing human being” remembers Live Nation’s Ron Clause noting that Boczkowski always helped care for Clause’s dog Miss Bella who regularly came to shows. “After a long 20-plus hour day he would often say ‘It was a great day Ron but after all these hours with you I may have to go to church two times this week. Maybe three.'”

Few tales illustrate Boczkowski’s mettle better than the summer 2014 Masters of the Mic rap show at DTE headlined by DMX who also died this year. Brian Szlaga 313’s director of entertainment booking recalls that DMX was running late that night — in fact did not leave the hotel until 15 minutes after he was due on stage with a tight 11 p.m. curfew. Despite Boczkowski’s visible agitation DMX and his tour manager pulled him into his usual pre-show prayer circle.

“Derek took off his hat bowed his head and let DMX do his thing all the while internally freaking out because … he wasn’t on stage yet” Szlaga says. In the show summary Boczkowski — who attended services twice a week at Kensington Church in Troy — wrote that DMX “was so inspiring the Pope would have been impressed!” The rapper wound up playing a 20-minute set and spent another 10 minutes taking photos with fans before leaving the stage.

“Derek never wanted to upset anyone” notes Jim Reid who worked with Boczkowski at Palace Sports & Entertainment and is now a senior director of festival operations for Live Nation. “He always wanted to fix it massage it make it right.”

Boczkowski’s interest in live entertainment production started at an early age according to his younger brother Brian. Raised mostly in Sterling Heights a steady diet of events including sports stoked a desire for the elder Boczkowski to be part of that world. “Our parents weren’t musicians or anything but we always grew up listening to music. That was his love” Brian says.

Boczkowski graduated from Central Michigan University with a degree in commercial recreational facility management. But he really exercised his passion attending Disney University in Florida and interning at The Palace before being hired full-time.

“He loved The Mouse and believed wholly in the Disney Way” Reid says. “I don’t know if Disney taught him to care or if his care drew him to Disney but Derek had an incredible level of care.”

Connie Marshall Rautenberg who trained Boczkowski at The Palace and remained friends with him after she left in 2002 remembers him as “eager really gung-ho super-passionate very excitable at times but in a good way.” Time off she says often found Boczkowski back at Disney. “He always came back with ideas which was great.”

Boczkowski was also a fan — “but in a cool way” Reid says — often taking pictures with the performers but also those around them. “It was more about Derek wanting to have some fun and share things with his staff” says Gary Meyer a production director for Live Nation who worked scores of shows with Boczkowski. “Accounts event staff interns — he would post some pictures with as many people as he could.”

Dave Clark Live Nation’s Great Lakes Region president adds that there was always a sense of comfort and confidence when Boczkowski was working a show. “The job is Smokey the Bear; I don’t want to be the firefighter I want to be the guy who prevents forest fires” he explains. “I always knew it was going to be a lot easier when Derek was on the case.”

Away from the venues he worked at Boczkowski could often be found being entertained. Anything related to the British bands Joy Division and New Order in particular were must-sees. He was in fact buried in a New Order T-shirt. Boczkowski could often be found at the Comedy Castle and produced Laughapalooza concerts for Mark Ridley at the Meadow Brook Amphitheatre.

“He and I just loved to exchange comedy stories” Ridley says. “He always had had numerous suggestions for me about which comedians to bring in. I jokingly said at one time ‘Derek I’m gonna throw my position as booking agent over to you.’ Sure enough he’d have one or two (ideas) that were spot-on.”

Even at the Comedy Castle Ridley adds Boczkowski was always up to take a photo with the headliner.

313’s Handler says plans are being made for “a proper memorial” for Boczkowski backstage at DTE while Live Nation’s Clark reports that a veteran production manager asked about Boczkowski during a recent Jimmy Buffett concert in Indiana. “He goes ‘Who is gonna replace Derek?'” Clark says. “I said ‘Well I can answer your question two ways: Yes there’s another body that can fill that role but that doesn’t mean anybody can replace Derek.”

Adds Mark Hogue Bob Seger’s most recent production manager “Derek was a fine man and upheld the tradition of great production guys at (DTE). I knew them all. He was always one that put a smile on my face each time I saw him. I have the Seger banner from The Palace hanging in my living room and think of (Boczkowski) each time I see it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Last week it was news of journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones turning down an offer to teach at UNC Chapel Hill for a job at Howard University. This week it’s even more local and has kept WFAE’s education reporter Ann Doss Helms busy.

First U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona visited Johnson C. Smith University and a Charlotte-Mecklenburg summer schoolMonday to talk about reopening schools stronger than they were before the pandemic.

And then at a Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board meeting Tuesday – the first in-person meeting since the pandemic began – talk turned to how schools deal with racism. Namely the topic of critical race theory which has been a hot-button issue for months. Many argued that they weren’t really discussing critical race theory but an honest accounting of history.

""Fear has no place in education"" West Mecklenburg High educator Derrick Moore said. ""How can we effectively teach our children history if you want that history to be selective? You can’t exclude history because it makes you feel uncomfortable.""

Sarah Delia / WFAE Sisters Madison and Sophie Bertorelli came to support students who attend Myers Park and are calling for school officials to be held accountable.

As that board meeting went on others were trying to draw attention to something else: the handling of sexual assault allegations at Myers Park High. Many at that protest called for the resignation of principal Mark Bosco.

As WFAE’s Sarah Delia reported Bosco didn’t resign but his contract also was not renewed at the school board meeting. CMS called it an administrative oversight because while Bosco is still employed he is on leave.

Two officials with the CMS communication department told Delia they did not know the type of leave Bosco is on when it started or if there is an end date. An out-of-office email from Bosco said he will be out of office until Aug. 5.

If you haven’t checked out Helms’ education newsletter reflecting on all this news be sure to sign up here.

In non-education news WFAE's Catherine Welch reported on how South Carolina is preparing to reinstate a firing squad as a death penalty method and what exactly that entails.

David Boraks / WFAE Gypsum (foreground) and coal stored at Duke Energy's Marshall Steam Station on Lake Norman.

And WFAE’s David Boraks hit the ground running on his new climate beat reporting on how the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission voted to begin rulemaking that would set limits on carbon emissions from energy plants to address climate change – and then on a Republican-backed energy reform bill that passed the North Carolina House of Representatives early Thursday and is facing opposition from the governor environmentalists and some businesses. They say the bill doesn’t do enough to address climate change issues.

Finally race and equity reporter Maria Ramirez Uribe hadthe story of one Guatemalan woman who is seeking asylum in Charlotte – one of the toughest immigration courts in the nation – and hopes she has a chance because of Biden administration changes to asylum seekers.

And don't forget coming up on Tuesday afternoon is a conversation with NPR foreign correspondents Sylvia Poggioli from Rome Eleanor Beardsley from Paris and Ruth Sherlock from Beirut. They'll talk about working overseas how the United States is viewed abroad and more. Sign up here.

Children at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital are running low on toys. Generous donations from the community make all the difference.

WILMINGTON Delaware (WPVI) -- ""Honestly we're out of toys right now"" said Melissa Nicely Child Life Manager at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children.

Nicely says donations overall have decreased in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially felt in the summer months which are half-a-year removed from the holidays.

""Typically the toys that we get in December will last the majority of the year"" she said. ""And we have a big pile but as the year goes on that pile starts to dwindle.""

That's where the Soul Riders Auto Club of Delaware zooms in to the rescue. Yesterday they held their Christmas in July car show and collected toy donations. A caravan of cars led by county police arrived at the hospital to make the delivery this morning.

""God doesn't bless you to keep it to yourself. He blesses you to pass it to someone else"" said James ""Sonny"" Knott President of the classic car club.

The Soul Riders were founded in 2002 and have spent more than a decade bridging the toy gap for the hospital in the month of July.

""We all have children at home grandchildren nieces and nephews but the majority of us are blessed to have them home with us"" said Knott. ""So it's a great thing for us to be able to collect just a few toys and bring here and be a help to someone.""

Those toys are especially needed this year as pandemic protocols continue inside the hospital. Kids are no longer allowed to share toys in a common area and must play by their bedside. In addition certain toys can not be sanitized and passed on to a new patient. So new toys are needed to replace those that cannot be recycled.

Officials from Houma-based A.M. Dupont Corp. are asking the Houma-Terrebonne Regional Planning Commission to approve its plan to create seven adjacent lots to sell to camp owners on the island. The company also plans to improve water and sewerage pipes and add fire hydrants that would serve the camps.

Company representative Keneth Rembert told the board Thursday that it is negotiating with the area's fire department on some of the improvements. The company is also considering deepening the bayou at the front of its property to accommodate new pipes.

Isle de Jean Charles has weathered decades of storms erosion and flooding that have reduced the tiny island at the southeastern tip of Terrebonne to a sliver of land occupied by a few dozen families mostly low-income Native Americans.

For years the state has used a $48 million federal grant to relocate those who voluntarily leave their homes on the island to a new community on higher ground in Schriever. In April some of the residents got their first look at their new homes in the New Isle community.

Chief Shirell Parfait-Dardar chief of the Grand Caillou-Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw was among 10 island residents and camp owners who attended Thursday's Planning Commission meeting to learn more about the plans.

She read a statement by Albert Naquin chief of the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe who was unable to attend.

“When the resettlement plan was approved and funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development we agreed to it based on our understanding that part of the agreement was that IDJC would be left to nature meaning no improvements or services would be provided to IDJC over time and it would ultimately be consumed by water. This includes our roads our homes and our historic burial sites” Naquin’s statement reads.

“However now that the resettlement has been funded we see improvements being made to our Island Road and fishing piers with parking were built. Our school was recently shut down – we were told it didn’t make sense to keep it open. … It seems IDJC is slated to become a recreational sporting island” Naquin says in the letter.

“I am here tonight because the Dupont land is being sold as campsites"" the statement continues. ""This is profoundly unsettling. Our tribe was strongly encouraged to leave our homes and we were told that if we stayed we’d have no help or services there. Now we’re finding out that the land is being repurposed and seemingly redeveloped for private recreational use.”

In an interview Friday Terrebonne Planning Director Chris Pulaski clarified that not all properties on Isle de Jean Charles are a part of the resettlement program.

“Not every piece of property on the island is owned by someone who would even be eligible to participate” Pulaski said. “It's all voluntary first of all and then there's some properties that wouldn't be eligible.”

Pulaski said residents on the island including those who relocate but keep property there are allowed to make limited improvements and renovations but they can amount to no more than half of the structure or property's assessed value.

“If they are being relocated the property that they own on the island it stays their property. It doesn't become property of the parish or anything” Pulaski said. “Now it will have restrictions on it as to what they can or can't build.”

Terrebonne Parish Councilman John Amedee whose district includes the new resettlement community in Schriever attended Thursday's meeting. He decried what he sees as a lack of communication among residents local government and the state about the whole process.

“Communication has been an issue all along and hasn't been a part of that whole process. I want to make sure I check on anything that I’m told to make sure that we’re getting the right information out” Amedee said.

Planning Commission member Dr. L.A. Cloutier noted that the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies might have to get involved with the company’s proposed changes to the property that involve dredging. Pulaski also pointed out during the meeting that the type of fire hydrant used was not finalized.

“Those variances were not listed on the application. So you need to have another call for another public hearing” he said.

The Planning Commission will hold at least one more public hearing next month before making a final decision officials said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pbnF1aXJlci9uYW1lL25pY2hvbGFzLXBhcHBhcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMzExNDI0MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NICHOLAS PAPPAS Obituary (2021) - Wilmington Del.

In Lamar that means sticking by its Savages nickname even if images and logos must be changed. And while the Lamar school board said at a community meeting Thursday that it won’t join or pitch in money for a lawsuit being prepared to try to overturn the new law it supports the effort by the Native American Guardians Association.

Demetrius Marez a 1993 Lamar High School graduate who claims 39% Navajo ancestry announced at the meeting that he is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit and 1990 grad Cade Spitz unfurled new Savages yard flags outside the meeting that he sold for $20 each to raise money for NAGA’s legal fight. Spitz said he’d sold 127 flags in the first 24 hours they were available and that he also will have stick-in-the-ground signs and would make banners to order.

“This is my heritage that some people are trying to erase” Marez said. “It is not derogatory in this context. This Savage means a lot to me because I am Native — don’t tell me what I’m offended by.”

While North Dakota-based NAGA has battled against – and in some cases defeated – local school boards in other states that have pushed for name changes this lawsuit will be the first against a state law said Scott Cousins a Delaware lawyer who represents the nonprofit. He said he expects to file the lawsuit which could be precedent setting this summer.

The mascot issue has long raised emotional and defiant responses but many districts and schools are using the decades-long discussions and the state mandate as an opportunity to reinvent their logos and images in a spirit of collaboration and inclusion.

“What was OK in the ‘60s wasn’t OK in the ‘80s and what was OK in the ‘80s is not OK in 2022” said Lanc Selldon principal at Central High School in Grand Junction as he explained the changes to his school’s Warrior symbols over the years. “We are working to keep traditions that are great but trying to move forward with the times.”

The law is a significant nudge from the state: Any public schools or colleges that violate the law by their use of an American Indian mascot or imagery as of June 1 2022 will be fined $25000 a month.

Sponsors and backers of Senate Bill 116 signed into law June 28 say no one should be surprised by the tough penalties. Native American tribes and activists have been asking school and professional teams for decades to lose their Indian mascots.

Some did. Others swapped out stereotypical cartoonish mascots for more dignified mascots and logos to convey respect but spectators at games often continued to wear Native costumes and perform such things as the tomahawk chop in the name of team spirit. Not all Native Americans find the mascots or actions offensive but many tribes associated with Colorado including the Southern Utes the Ute Mountain Utes and the Northern Arapahos supported Colorado’s legislative action as have tribes in other states.

Studies over the decades have supported the idea that Native American mascots are harmful contributing to low self-esteem among Indigenous students and the perpetuation of stereotypes among non-Natives among other things.

“I know people feel this is a mandate and it was forced on them and it is a mandate but this is something that people have been asking for for 30 years” said Rep. Adrienne Benavidez D-Commerce City a sponsor of the bill. “I don’t think this was a surprise to anybody and I am not open to giving them more time to do this. I think a year is enough time.”

Benavidez and other supporters of the law have little sympathy for the schools now complaining about the cost which can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars if gym floors must be refinished and uniforms replaced.

“I don’t know what funding is out there for them but the cost of how it’s hurt our children over the decades far outweighs their cost” said Danielle SeeWalker co-chair of the Denver American Indian Commission. “They could have financially relieved themselves little by little if they had started years ago.

“The emotional impact – you can’t put a cost on that” she said.

Who’s impacted

Just over a dozen districts – each with one or more schools affected – are likely required to make changes.

In 2016 a report from the Governor’s Commission to Study American Indian Representation in Public Schools identified 30 schools with Native mascots and urged them to change. A couple of schools on the list have since closed.

Four schools changed their mascots in the past year: Loveland High School (Indians to Red Wolves); Bill Reed Middle School in Loveland (Warriors to Wolves); Cheyenne Mountain High School (Indians to Red-tail Hawks) and La Veta Junior/Senior High School (Redskins to Redhawks).

A new list of those not in compliance with the law will be posted by July 28 at the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs website along with criteria for compliance said Elizabeth Kosar deputy press secretary for the governor.

Several districts said they are awaiting that guidance fearing it may impact decisions they’ve already made.

Eaton Superintendent Jay Tapia said he met Tuesday with the commission’s Executive Director Kathryn Redhorse and other state officials to discuss his district’s Fightin’ Reds nickname.

Eaton School District Re-2 began a rebranding campaign a year ago in conjunction with plans for a new high school and remodeling at all its schools and several new mascots and logos were proposed by students.

The new logo for La Veta Junior/Senior High incorporates the school’s new Redhawk mascot.

Likewise the La Veta School District acted proactively when after weeks of discussion and surveys it chose its new Redhawks mascot last year so it could be incorporated into its new school set to open in January after COVID-related construction delays according to Superintendent Bree Jones.

Ultimately the Eaton district board in November decided to drop all American Indian imagery and symbols but retain its Fightin’ Reds nickname which was adopted in 1901 based on the uniform color (much like the Cincinnati Reds). According to district history there was no association of the Reds nickname with Native American culture until the 1960s when the high school consolidated with Galeton High School which had an Indian mascot.

The district redesigned its red E logo and it has been incorporated throughout the schools and on the website.

According to the minutes of an April board meeting the district believes it has complied with the state law.

But after meeting with Redhorse Tapia said he’s not sure if the Fightin’ part of Fightin’ Reds will be OK.

“Now we’re getting stuck on that word which I didn’t expect” he said noting that Redhorse told him the district had used Native American imagery for more years than they had not and that would be a consideration in whether Fightin’ Reds might be too closely associated with that imagery.

Regardless of the extent of change it will take a few years for the culture to shift Tapia said and he can’t ban alumni and parents from wearing old school T-shirts with Native American symbols on them.

“We’re trying to get back to our roots and back to where we came from” he said. “And I’m trying to wrap my head around where this is going to end.”

Warrior schools

If a school’s nickname is required to change because of past association with Native American symbols the four schools that have decided to retain Warrior nicknames might not be able to do so.

Two – West Complex in Colorado Springs and Central High School in Grand Junction – are disassociating any Native symbolism from the name.

Central High School Principal Selldon said the law community conversations and some research led him to focus on how they could make the school mascot more inclusive.

In 1946 Fruitvale High School was consolidated with Central – and Fruitvale had used the Vikings. So he thought maybe a Viking warrior. Or not.

“How does a 6-foot-5 Viking male symbol relate to our girls’ soccer team?” he said. “It doesn’t.”

Keeping the Warrior nickname helped cool opposition to change and he’s received about 30 mascot concept designs as well as plenty of written suggestions.

In fact local businesses are offering help with in-kind donations of goods and services when it comes time to make physical changes. Selldon isn’t sure of the total cost – or even how they’ll get native symbols that are etched into granite removed.

He estimated changes will run at least $150000 with refinishing two gym floors the biggest cost.

Meanwhile he wants to have three mascot options ready to present to the school community by mid-fall.

The small Weldon Valley School District near Fort Morgan uses a W with a spear through it for its logo but has no specific American Indian imagery or mascot said

Superintendent Ben Bauman. At one time the district had an Indian head symbol but it has been gone for several years he said.

“We are waiting to have a conversation with someone about what we need to change if anything” said Bauman who has been with the district for three years and took over July 1 as the superintendent.

He said he doesn’t believe the word “warrior” must be associated with American Indians as it is used in many cultures and in fiction.

Others planning to retain the name agreed and noted that younger students associate it with video games and movie characters.

Frederick High School in the St. Vrain Valley School District also used the Warrior nickname and associated Native American imagery. Outgoing Principal Brian Young told the school community in April that it would likely need to make changes.

The new principal Russell Fox has convened a “task force that includes students teachers staff community members and municipal leaders to guide the mascot identification process” district spokeswoman Kerri McDermid said.

Rep. Barbara McLachlan D-Durango said she believes that schools that get rid of Indigenous imagery especially anything stereotypical and ensure that bleacher rituals such as headdresses and war whoops are not allowed at games can probably keep such nicknames as the Warriors or Reds and be within the spirit of the law.

SeeWalker was more skeptical saying that she hopes schools are genuine in their efforts to refocus mascots and nicknames away from Native culture.

“They might change the visual of it but the connotation of how you’ve used it over the years remains” she said. “I would like to see them start fresh.”

Lamar Savages

Lamar school board members at Thursday’s meeting put the issue squarely at the feet of those who wrote and adopted the new law calling it an unfunded mandate that oversteps local control and the First Amendment.

It plans to continue using the Savages nickname this school year and wait to see what happens with the NAGA lawsuit. If the law is not overturned by Jan. 19 the district will proceed to change what is required so it will not incur fines.

But the board wants to keep the Savages nickname.

About 150 people attended Thursday’s meeting and nearly all speakers also said they want the district to retain the Savages nickname even if imagery must be replaced. A few urged the board to join the NAGA lawsuit and former Lamar High School Principal Allan Medina suggested using the district contingency fund in the legal battle.

“I’m disappointed that this board is not willing to fight” he said.

Later in the evening a teacher reminded the group that this district has had to make cuts to educational programs and said she would be insulted if money was spent on the lawsuit when teachers are buying their own classroom supplies.

Board members agreed that the district could not afford the legal fight.

“We don’t know how long litigation would take said board member Jake Chamberlain. “The unknowns are too much for us to be playing with.”

A crowd of approximately 150 attended a community forum held at Lamar High School on July 15 2021. The Lamar School Board explained that potential legal costs forced them not to pursue a lawsuit to challenge Senate Bill 116 the law that will prohibit the use of American Indian mascots by public schools. (Mike Sweeney Special to The Colorado Sun)

Several speakers urged others to dip into their own pockets to support NAGA’s lawsuit – through fundraising efforts by the Noble Savages (which has a private Facebook group with 1300 members) or with contributions directly to NAGA.

NAGA has been a controversial player in the mascot fight nationwide with many people saying the organization is not representative of most tribes. Its most recent victory was in Neshaminy Pennsylvania where in conjunction with the school district it won on appeal for the school to keep its Redskins moniker.

The district spent about $500000 in the eight-year legal battle according to LevittownNow.com.

One member of LamarProud an alumni group that supports the new state law said at Thursday’s meeting that when he was a student he didn’t believe the mascot was derogatory but has come to change his mind. Brent Bates said he recognized that it was an emotional issue for many and asked for people to “show each other compassion.”

He also suggested Dust Devil as a new mascot the only suggestion toward change during the evening although the board had asked for ideas on moving forward.

Several current underclass students also spoke saying they were saddened at the thought that they might not be able to graduate as Savages.

A potential change of the school’s nickname and imagery also raises issues for the city of Lamar which owns the Community Center with the school gym and maintains Savage Avenue (the road to the high school) and several class sculptures depicting Native Americans in the median.

Mayor Kirk Crespin said in recent years he has reached out unsuccessfully to the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes in an effort to build a bridge for cultural education and communication.

The city has remained neutral on the issue but estimates that it would cost $225000 to refinish the gym floor and replace logos throughout the community building.

“There is currently no obligation for the city to make these investments and we simply do not have the funding for those changes at this time” he said in an email.

“We have various locations throughout our community that showcases local artists” he continued. “We have made great investments in our Bi-Centennial Park our downtown pocket park and our Lamar Loop to help showcase different pieces of art. The center median on Savage Avenue has also been a great location for our young local student artists to showcase their artwork and we will continue to support our communities youth and their artwork on the center median of Savage Avenue now and in the future.”

Exemptions

There are a few exemptions in the law including for schools on Indian lands and under tribal control.

Arapahoe High School in Littleton will retain its Warrior nickname and Indian mascot which the new law allows because the school has a long-standing agreement with the Arapaho Nation.

“The Arapaho Nation from the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming and the Arapahoe High School community formed a relationship nearly 30 years ago that set a precedent and provided a positive solution in the midst of mascot controversy” Diane Leiker spokeswoman for Littleton Public Schools said in an email. “Tribal elders worked with Arapahoe High School administration and student council to create a wonderful unique relationship between the Arapaho Tribal Nation and our high school. The Arapahoe Warrior logo — which was designed by a Northern Arapaho artist — demonstrates the decades-long relationship between the two communities that runs far deeper than the creation of the Arapahoe Warrior logo.”

The new law allows exemptions for schools with existing tribal associations.

The Strasburg School District too has an agreement with the Northern Arapaho Tribe and plans to retain its Indians mascot Strasburg High School Principal Jeff Rasp said in an email.

The district and the tribe signed an agreement in the 2015-16 school year and a tribal member designed a new mascot for the school. Rasp said he hopes to sign an updated agreement this year.

Work underway

At least five districts are working on making changes; five others (Pueblo County Kiowa Yuma Mountain Valley in Saguache and Campo) did not respond to email or voicemail messages and have no obvious notices on their websites about changes.

Montrose County School District Superintendent Carrie Stephenson said early estimates show it could cost $500000 to $750000 to replace everything carrying Native symbols including two gym floors gym mats and uniforms.

“We are ready to comply” she said “but it’s going to be a financial burden.”

She has directed the middle and high school principals to do a detailed assessment of everything that must be changed so they can have a solid cost estimate. Centennial Middle School uses the Braves nickname and Montrose High School uses the Indians.

This fall the district will begin a collaborative process involving students staff and the community to decide on new mascots and logos.

The high school uses an M with feathers attached which might work as a logo if the school opts for a bird mascot she said.

In recent years the schools made some changes as they ordered new uniforms and mats leaving logos off. But those were incremental purchases she said.

Other districts also are concerned about the cost but estimates are generally lower.

Sanford School District Superintendent Kevin Edgar said in an email that the southern San Luis Valley district estimates it will cost $150000 for physical changes including: removal of a ceramic Indian inlaid in the brick of the main entrance; removal of Indians stained into two gym floors; removal of an Indian mural rendered in stained glass; removal and replacement of cafeteria flooring that contains the mascot in the center; removal of the large painted mascot on the main gym wall; replacing safety and wrestling mats; removal of the mascot from scoreboards and marquee; removal of the mascot from athletic banners and uniforms; removal of the word “Indians” from buses and transportation vehicles; and the cost to put the new mascot image in all the places were the old mascot was removed.

Edgar said the board has begun a process to select a new mascot and a committee will be formed in August. The community and students will be involved in suggesting mascots and the committee will narrow the choices to three. Then after more community input it will make a recommendation to the board.

The tiny Arickaree School District in northeast Colorado uses the Indian nickname and is exploring its options under the law said Superintendent Lisa Weigel who started with the district this month. She is planning community conversations and hopes to have a recommendation to the board by November.

“You want to appreciate the traditions and culture of the community and the history that goes along with it but if we are required to make a change we are” she said. “But we want to do that collaboratively.”

She noted that she moved from a district in Wyoming where the same conversations are taking place.

Several of those interviewed noted that it’s not a mascot that holds a community together and they are stressing that in their conversations.

“It is our sense of community in supporting our students that brings us all together and keeps our school spirit alive” Edgar said in a letter to the community posted this month on the Sanford website. “Whatever is chosen as our new mascot our school spirit and community support will no doubt continue to be strong and live up to the wonderful history of our school and community.”

Which schools are -or are not – tackling the issue

Senate Bill 116 was signed into law on June 28 which set the clock running to a June 1 2022 deadline for Colorado public schools and colleges to stop the use of American Indian mascot or imagery. Violators could face a $25000 per month fine. Some schools have already rebranded or are in the process. Others did not return The Sun’s call to find out where they stand.

A drink-driver jumped a red light and entered a one-way street in the wrong direction in an attempt to lose police during a chase.

Jordan Binder accelerated away from a patrol car after it indicated for him to pull over. Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court heard.

But instead the 26-year-old fled into Long Eaton town centre before abandoning the vehicle and running over gardens Derbyshire Live reports.

Now he faces a nervy few weeks wait to find out if he will be jailed or not.

Peter Bettany prosecuting said the offence began when police in a marked car spotted a Ford being driven by the defendant in Nottingham Road Long Eaton at around 12.15am on February 28.

He said a check showed it did not have any insurance so the patrol decided to follow it with a view to stopping the vehicle.

Mr Bettany said: ""They followed it as it turned into Devonshire Avenue and then it took a sharp right into The Hollows which is a dead end.

""At that point the car went on to a raised bank area which has just enough space to allow one car over at a time.

""It went on to Station Road where it became clear the defendant was clearly trying to avoid being stopped.

""It headed towards Long Eaton picking up speed to the point where it went off into the distance in the 30mph limit and the police following it were travelling at 60mph.""

Mr Bettany said as the Ford got to the junction of Main Street Binder of Gibb Street Long Eaton jumped a red light and ignored a no entry sign travelling into Chapel Street and finally to Lower Brook Street.

He said there the defendant got out of the car and ran off through gardens in the direction of Main Street.

Mr Bettany said Binder then fell over and was arrested blowing a reading of 54 when he was tested for drink-driving.

The legal limit is 35 (micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath).

He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving drink-driving and driving without insurance.

Theo Addae his solicitor asked the magistrates to sentence him there and then saying his defendant has been out of trouble for four years.

He said: ""He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity there were no other people involved there was no damage caused and it was not a busy road.""

Theo Addae his solicitor asked the magistrates to sentence him there and then saying his defendant has been out of trouble for four years.

He said: ""He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity there were no other people involved there was no damage caused and it was not a busy road.""

But Paul McCaffrey chair of the bench committed the sentence to Derby Crown Court saying he felt the lower court's powers were not sufficient to deal with it.

Binder who was handed bail will appear at the higher court for sentence on August 11.

A scenic “tabletop” mountain in Switzerland is on the market for a rock-bottom price on eBay.

The Zirkelstein the smallest table hill of Saxon Switzerland a renowned hiking and climbing area near the Elbe Valley was originally listed for $1.2 million in 2006 but is now down to $235000.

The eBay offer is online under the title: “Unique/ Your own mountain in Saxon Switzerland” according to CBS News.

The property is about 20 acres and the ad states “despite its small size and scope its characteristic shape makes it one of the most striking rock formations in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains.”

The mountain is famed for being painted into the background of Caspar David Friedrich’s 1818 masterpiece “Wanderer above the Sea of Fog.”

“Due to age-related reasons the owners can no longer manage the forest and are therefore selling the property. For me it is the first time to see a mountain being sold” sales manager Andre Marschner told CBS.

However the owner will have to be lenient with others as the mountain is crisscrossed with public pathways.

Renke Coordes from the state forest management enterprise Sachsenforst told the news organization that according to law “putting a fence is not an option. However the owner is the only one allowed to drive a car in the area.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3RhbmduZXQuY29tL211c3RhbmctZm9ydW1zL3RocmVhZHMvdHJhbnMtYW9kZS00cjcwdy1jb29sZXItbGluZS1sZWFrLWZpeC45MjE0NTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trans (AODE-4r70W) cooler line leak fix? | Mustang Forums at StangNet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://stangnet.com/mustang-forums/threads/trans-aode-4r70w-cooler-line-leak-fix.921452/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3RhbmduZXQuY29tL211c3RhbmctZm9ydW1zL3RocmVhZHMvdHJhbnMtYW9kZS00cjcwdy1jb29sZXItbGluZS1sZWFrLWZpeC45MjE0NTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2NvbGxlY3RvcnNkYWlseS5jb20vYmVzdC1sYW1lbG8tYmFsbC1yb29raWUtY2FyZHMtZWJheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LaMelo Ball Rookie Card Picks Hottest eBay Auctions,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/best-lamelo-ball-rookie-cards-ebay/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2NvbGxlY3RvcnNkYWlseS5jb20vYmVzdC1sYW1lbG8tYmFsbC1yb29raWUtY2FyZHMtZWJheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvc3RlYW0tZGVjay1zY2FscGVycy1hcmUtdHJ5aW5nLWl0LW9uLWRlc3BpdGUtdmFsdmVzLWFudGktc2NhbHBpbmctZWZmb3J0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steam Deck scalpers are trying it on - despite Valve's anti-scalping efforts,"Scalpers have taken to eBay with their Steam Deck reservations marking up the PC handheld despite Valve's anti-scalping efforts.

There are multiple listings of the Steam Deck on eBay all charging more than Valve's asking price. Some listings have the hardware up for sale for over £1000.

Valve made the Steam Deck available to reserve last night with some smart restrictions aimed at combating scalpers (although some of these restrictions ran into technical issues as Valve was inundated with high demand).

To combat scalpers Valve charges a £4 ""reserve now"" fee and only people who bought something on Steam prior to June 2021 are able to pre-order the console during its first 48 hours of availability.

As we've reported Valve has now adjusted the availability of the Steam Deck. Try to pay for a reservation today and you'll be faced with a Q1 2022 expected order availability for the £349 64GB model a Q2 2022 expected order availability for the £459 256GB version and a Q3 2022 expected order availability for the £569 512GB model.

So why go to eBay for a Steam Deck at all? The interest appears to be in buying reservations secured for this December which would theoretically at least mean you'd get your hardware months ahead of someone who reserved a Steam Deck via Valve today.

The truth is even a reservation made last night for December doesn't guarantee the Steam Deck will arrive in December. As Valve states in its FAQ all the expected order availability windows relate to when Valve is ""aiming"" to start sending order invitations. That is this is when Valve reckons it will convert reservations to orders and let you buy the thing. This isn't necessarily when the Steam Deck will ship.

Here's Valve's official line:

""We are aiming to start sending order invitations by December 2021. We will make every effort to convert all reservations to orders but we are not able to guarantee availability.""

That sounds worryingly non-committal for anyone who has a Steam Deck reservation down for December. In truth all the expected order availability release windows sound like they could quite easily slip. All the release windows are just what Valve currently expects to hit and we all know how open to delay release dates are in the current climate.

The upshot of all this is you really shouldn't buy a Steam Deck from eBay right now - even those listings with ""ships in December"" in the title. Those listings are misleading. There's no way of knowing if the Steam Deck will actually ship in December. It may well do. It may not.

The Steam Deck scalping shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Scalpers have been having a field day with video game hardware for the last couple of years - just look what happened with the PlayStation 5. And scalpers are trying it on with the Nintendo Switch OLED model too which was only just made available to pre-order.

Redecorating bedrooms can easily cost a small fortune but the savvy mum managed to complete four makeovers for under £1500 for herself and her children.

Emily Watson a 29-year-old housekeeper from Harrogate North Yorkshire is a mum to Lewis 11 Maisie nine and Hugo one. She decided to embark on four projects - a bedroom revamp for herself a new space for Lewis and a conversion of one room into two smaller ones for Maisie and Hugo.

READ MORE:Mum called 'selfish' for not telling family she was pregnant until after baby was born

Speaking to money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk Emily said: ""I got my ideas by collecting inspiration off home budget Instagram pages. They showed me where to buy cheap furniture and how to upcycle old items with Frenchic paint. I was able to put my own stamp on my home using bits and bobs I had collected over time.

""We moved into a three bedroom house so we halved the third bedroom in the back to give my one and nine year old children their own space. Our youngest accesses his bedroom from ours so they both have privacy.""

(Image: Press handout)

After her design research Emily came up with her themes. Her room would become a chic grey and white space while eldest son Lewis would be getting a gamer-themed bedroom. The third and final bedroom in the house would have two designs - Maisie getting a floral polka dot colour scheme and Hugo being treated to jungle decor.

Emily was mindful she didn’t want to spend too much on the projects.

She said: ""For my bedroom I wanted to model it using some Instagram homes as inspiration. However they weren’t in the budget for me if I was to buy everything as listed. Instead I tried to recreate the look by purchasing supplies from Facebook Marketplace B&M and Home Bargains.

""With my two eldest children I wanted to try and keep their bedrooms grown-up so the makeovers would last. I used ideas from Instagram homes for these as well. As for my youngest he has always loved the jungle so I wanted to give him a space where his imagination could run wild.

""Most of our supplies and furniture have been purchased second hand from budget shops or sales where possible. We also had help from a friend in the building trade to put up some stud walls and fit the electrics.

""We were lucky to pick up several items on the cheap. For example I got wall stickers from eBay for between £3 and £5 a sheet and while I was there I picked up a roll of wallpaper for just £10. Overall the walls of stickers in each room were just £30 each to create and I also got some gamer cushions from this site for just £2 each.

(Image: Press handout)

""By going to the local builders merchants we saved on the timber and plasterboard paying £60 in total. When we got the paint we got two tubs for £20 each from Dulux and two Valspar tubs for £30 each.

""The best bargain was both of my eldest children's beds as we actually got those for free off Facebook Marketplace. The third bed was just £50 off Marketplace. I’ve had a lot of people asking where it’s from - I got lucky with that find.

""Marketplace turned out to be a great place for items on the cheap. I picked up a large stuffed giraffe for £45 and a pink chandelier for £20. There was a lovely hanging shelf with tassels that I got for just £5 and the grey lamps in my room cost just £25 for both. I also got my two mirrored bedside tables from Marketplace - £50 for both.

(Image: Press handout)

""Overall I paid very little for the furniture in each of the rooms. I got the Malmo Bedside Cabinet for £15 from B&M for Lewis’ room and my mirrors and furniture were all second hand. For the whole set in my bedroom I only paid £150 - and that includes two bedside tables a set of drawers and a dressing table.""

Emily added: ""All of the smaller accessories are from either Home Bargains B&M or The Range. In these stores I didn’t spend over £30 for any of the items. The most popular decorative piece among family and friends has been my Naomi Tripod Lamp which cost just £20 from B&M.

""The most expensive purchases were the jungle wallpaper which cost £70 from eBay and our bed - it was from a company called Bedz Bedzz & Bedrooms and cost £500.

(Image: Press handout)

""When we began renovating the rooms the job which took the longest was preparing the walls. We hadn’t replastered anywhere except one wall so it took a long time to sand everything and white mist the walls before getting the paint on.

""The biggest challenge was moving into the house while it was a bare shell as it wasn’t in very good condition so we had to redo everything while we were living in the house. It took five long months but the process was made easier because I’d been planning it for over six months before we moved in.

""I had started buying budget items before we even had a house to move in so this helped us to save money once we were in our new home. I knew we wouldn’t be able to afford a professional so we sourced everything ourselves and got the job done successfully on the cheap.""

Tom Church co-founder of LatestDeals.co.uk said: ""Completing just one bedroom makeover is an extensive task so Emily’s achievement is truly impressive. Each of these bedrooms has been given a total overhaul and will no doubt be fantastic spaces for years to come.""

HQ,"Irvine-based real estate investor and developer J+R Group has bought the creative office building that holds the headquarters of dental-practice manager Pacific Dental Services Inc. in what’s the largest reported single-building office transaction in Irvine so far this year.



The company paid $34 million for 17000 Red Hill Ave. a 118000-square-foot building across the street from the headquarters of Edwards Lifesciences Corp.



The deal works out to a price of about $288 per square foot and marks a nearly 30% premium over the $26.5 million that Palo Alto-based Menlo Equities LLC paid for the complex in 2014 shortly after a major renovation project that converted the former industrial site into its current use.



The Newport Beach office of Eastdil Secured represented Menlo Equites in the sale according to CoStar Group Inc. records.

Dental Work



A holding company with ties to the ownership group of Pacific Dental paid about $13.6 million for the Red Hill building in 2012 then a 40-year-old warehouse last occupied by an electronics and communication unit of defense and aerospace manufacturer Rockwell Collins.



It subsequently spent nearly another $11 million to renovate the building.



Pacific Dental is one of the largest dental support organizations in the country with over 800 affiliated offices across 24 states. The company builds and manages office practices for dentists taking care of just about everything except the actual dentistry.



With $1.6 billion in 2020 revenue the company ranked No. 11 among OC’s largest private companies on this year’s list.



In addition to holding the dental management company’s headquarters the site also includes a dental office among other tenants.

J+R Portfolio



The acquisition is the first reported local buy in a few years for J+R Group an investor with ties to China that over the past decade has amassed an extensive portfolio of commercial properties and development sites along the West Coast primarily in and around the airport area of Irvine and in Portland Ore.



It has been a buyer and seller over that time. Notable sales include 2581 Alton Parkway a project J+R Group bought in 2013 and sold three years later to PLC Land Group which then converted the warehouse site into a 170-unit apartment project dubbed The Murphy. The complex is near the intersection of Jamboree and Alton; construction wrapped in 2019.



Menlo Equities and J+R Group have been involved in other local transactions. J+R paid Menlo about $36 million in 2014 for a 143700-square-foot office and data center project at 2525 Main St.



J+R has since sold the two buildings for about $27 million to an affiliate of World Financial Group though the property still serves as the company’s headquarters. Apartments are expected on another part of the Main Street property.

SCP Development



In other notable area projects J+R Group is developing a new two-story food hall within the Bloomingdale’s wing of South Coast Plaza.



J+R founder and CEO Morgan Zhang told the Business Journal earlier this year that he carefully selected the brands going into the 16000-square-foot Collage project which he said will “raise the bar in terms of cohesive luxury design.”



Collage which is located where the Charlie Palmer restaurant previously operated is expected to include about nine concepts. The first tenant there had a soft opening a few weeks ago and more are coming online this summer.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Reuters) -China's Tencent will buy British videogame developer Sumo in a $1.27 billion deal it said on Monday adding new titles to its growing portfolio of chart-topping videogames.

The purchase which will boost the Chinese internet giant's presence globally brings together Sumo's racing and snooker games with Tencent's more high-profile range of games that includes Call of Duty's mobile version.

Shareholders in Sheffield-based Sumo will get 513 pence in cash per share a 43% premium to the last price and valuing the company at 919 million pounds Tencent said sending Sumo's shares surging 42% to a record high.

The deal comes days after China's market regulator decided to block Tencent's plans to merge videogame streaming sites Huya and DouYu on antitrust grounds.

It is the second major deal involving a British video game company over the past year following U.S. video game maker Electronic Arts' deal to buy Britain-based Codemasters.

Tencent with stakes in companies that make Fortnite and League of Legends is the world's second-largest videogame group by revenue after Sony.

""Chinese deals may imply a higher regulatory risk but we see no likely resistance or counterbid"" Jefferies analysts said.

EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES

Sumo which counts Microsoft's Xbox Amazon Game Studios Apple Google and BBC as its clients and partners has seen its value soar since a 2017 listing on LSE's junior market AIM at 100 pence.

""The Board of Sumo firmly believes the business will benefit from Tencent's broad videogaming eco-system proven industry expertise and its strategic resources"" non-executive chairman Ian Livingstone said.

Tencent owns 8.75% and is the second-biggest shareholder in Sumo which has 14 studios in five countries and released the video games including Hotshot Racing Sackboy: A Big Adventure and WST Snooker last year.

Sumo's boss Carl Cavers said he and co-founders Paul Porter and Darren Mills would reprise their roles.

""The opportunity to work with Tencent is one we just couldn't miss"" said Cavers who founded the company 18 years ago.

The company has reportedly hired a former Electronic Arts and Facebook executive to lead the effort. Mike Verdu will join Netflix as Vice President of Game Development the company said on Wednesday (14 July). Previously Verdu was Facebook’s vice president in charge of working with developers to bring games and other content to Oculus virtual-reality headsets. He had a hand in popular EA mobile games including The Sims Plants vs. Zombies and Star Wars franchises.

As reported by Bloomberg the company is planning to offer video games on its streaming platform within the next year. Said games will simply appear alongside Netflix’s current fare as a new programming genre similar to its with documentaries or stand-up specials. The company isn’t currently planing on charging extra for the content said Bloomberg’s source who has asked not to be named due to the private nature of the ongoing deliberations.

The first rumours of Netflix’s gaming ambitions started back in May when the company began recruiting the position that’s currently filled by Verdu. At the time Netflix simply said it was “excited to do more with interactive entertainment”.

This move shouldn’t come as a surprise considering the rise in game streaming services via Stadia Xbox Cloud Streaming and PlayStation Now and in particular the success of the Xbox Game Pass subscription which is often compared by fans to Netflix.

To some extent Netflix has already dipped its toes in gaming waters. In 2019 the company worked together with developer BonusXP on creating a video game based on its hit show Stranger Things. As well as that Netflix launched a number of interactive “choose-your-own-adventure” shows such as Black Mirror: Bandersnatch You vs Wild and Carmen Sandiego: To Steal or Not to Steal.

More information around the types of games that would be available and details such as control mechanics are yet to be revealed.

The first time was in the 80s during the presidency of Raúl Alfonsín. At that time Lilly’s withdrawal left the market with a lack of insulin. This time the company’s signed an agreement for representation with the Argentine drugmaker Raffo which will continue to market Lilly’s portfolio of products in the country. All of Lilly’s staff will be laid off.

Eli Lilly the US drugmaker that specialises in diabetes and in highly complex segments has decided to bail out. Although the case has its own nuances it’s joining the list of foreign drugmakers that have departed from the local market such as France’s Pierre Fabre which took the decision to leave Argentina a year ago. See article «Pierre Fabre exits Argentina».

However it’s not the first time that Lilly has taken a step in this direction. The multi also upped camp in the 1980s when it took issue with Argentina’s price controls and left insulin users in a fix. At that time the company now headed by David Ricks globally ruled the market. Insulins from Denmark’s Novo Nordisk and France’s Sanofi had not yet emerged so the dimensions of Lilly’s decision had a major impact at the political-health level.

It’s not only an exit from Argentina. The multi is replicating the same strategy in Chile Peru Ecuador and Central America where its portfolio will be taken up by the Tecnofarma group a regional structure of which Argentina’s Raffo forms part.

Now 30 years later there’s a licensing agreement in place ahead of the new withdrawal. The Argentine drugmaker Raffo will represent all of Lilly’s portfolio in the country. However Lilly’s entire workforce of around 160 employees will be dismissed. The staff includes positions in marketing and sales administration and quality control as well as the management team. The latter with Leonardo Romero as Human Resources Manager and Juan Sánchez de Bock as Finance Director has been in the know about the withdrawal for half a year when negotiations with three local drugmakers began.

The political context has always been decisive for Lilly’s decisions. The key factor that led the company to return to Argentina in the 1990s was the country’s convertibility exchange policy which pegged the Argentine peso to the US dollar during the presidency of Carlos Saúl Menem. Now the financial equations don’t add up with prices falling behind inflation limits on transferring profits and other issues such as the restrictions imposed by PAMI Argentina’s social security system for pensioners.

Everyone preferred to line up with the parent company and not let slip any information inside the company. Having been highly successful with that mission most of the top brass will retain a position at Lilly for the region. It’s also expected that general manager Felipe Borges dos Reis who was appointed during the Covid-19 pandemic and had little interest in travelling down to Argentina will also receive the corporate reward of continued promotion in the corporation. Of course the team also includes Martin Skubic Alliance & Business Development Manager who followed the negotiations with potential local partners inch by inch.

In this shuffle and redeal the products that will fall under the wings of Argentina’s Raffo are the insulins Humalog Humulin and Basaglar; the hypoglycemic agent Trulicity: Glucagon for diabetes; Cialis for erectile dysfunction; the antidepressants Prozac and Cymbalta; the oncological treatments Cyramza Verzenio Alimta and Gemtro; Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis; and Zyprexa for schizophrenia. The list is completed with Taltz for psoriasis; Strattera for attention deficit; and Evista for osteoporosis. The group as a whole had been generating turnover of about AR$ 2.6 billion (US$ 25 million) annually according to market audits.

Lilly’s withdrawal from Argentina means the multi will bid farewell to the offices that it rented at Tronador 4890 in the Panamericana Plaza a building adjoining the Dot Baires shopping mall on the Buenos Aires city limits. Other pharmaceutical companies such as Germany’s Merck and Japan’s Takeda were also based here until they moved. Although in practice since the Covid-19 pandemic hit Argentina in March 2020 no one has been attending the offices which has facilitated a quiet «operation exit«.

This weekend Lilly’s employees who have a relationship with the company until July 31 still didn’t have details about the exit package that the company would offer them. Everything is under the control of the law firm Brons & Salas which has always handled the multi’s legal matters in the country. In fact today the firm does not even have its own local legal director.

The company had actually already given the first signal of its plans when it pulled out from PAMI. Pharmabiz revealed this week that the multi had put an end to its participation in the agreement with the state social security provider. In a letter signed by Fernando Miranda Lilly’s local Price Reimbursement and Market Access manager the company explained that the progressive increase in the costs of imports and marketing generated by the inflation and devaluation in Argentina prevented it from maintaining the current conditions for our products to remain in the agreement. See article «Lilly leaves PAMI insulins! in Spanish.

The national newspaper Infobae has also already reflected this news in its edition today. See Infobae.

Check Out These 3 Alzheimer's Therapy Stocks,"Treating Alzheimer's is extremely difficult but these innovative companies are taking a stab at it.

Neurodegenerative disorders extract a terrible human toll. In particular dementia affects more than 44 million people globally with Azheimer's being the most common cause accounting for 60% to 80% of all cases of dementia. Moreover dementia is the fifth most common cause of death worldwide. Thankfully there are a handful of companies working on treatments for Alzheimer's.

With the recent commercialization of Biogen's drug Aduhelm investors everywhere can take heart that the disease might finally be treatable. So the floodgates for Alzheimer's drug development are open and there's money to be made by investing in the most promising candidates. While there's no guarantee that any of the companies I discuss below will actually succeed in making an effective Alzheimer's therapy of their own they'll all have an edge over Biogen's Aduhelm if they do.

1. Annovis Bio

Annovis Bio (ANVS 25.10%) is a small biotech that's working on ANVS401 a drug which it hopes will be able to treat Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in people with Down syndrome. ANVS401 is currently in phase 2a of clinical trials and on June 1 the company reported that the drug appeared to help patients with Alzheimer's score significantly higher on a standardized test that measures the speed and accuracy of their cognition. Impressively the drug also helped patients with Parkinson's as well. That's a bombshell of a finding to say the least and Annovis' stock shot toward the moon as a result.

The secret to ANVS401's efficacy is its triple-pronged approach. Rather than attacking only one of the proteins associated with Alzheimer's as Biogen's Aduhelm does the drug targets three: beta amyloid tau and alpha synuclein. So there's a chance that it could blow Aduhelm out of the water if it ends up getting approved.

Investors will need to act quickly if they want to purchase the stock before what could be another major catalyst. Annovis will report the full results of the ANVS401 trial in August. Before that it'll present a lengthy update at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference which starts on July 26. If the previously disclosed results hold up it's hard to see the stock going anywhere but skyward.

2. Eli Lilly

The pharma giant Eli Lilly (LLY -0.45%) has a slew of different Alzheimer's therapies in development including a pair of candidates in phase 3 of clinical testing: Donanemab and Solanezumab. Both drugs target the beta-amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's but Solanezumab aims to remove circulating beta-amyloid whereas Donanemab is focused on dissolving immobile beta-amyloid plaques.

Eli Lilly's advantage is that it has developed several different diagnostic tools that it can use to identify characteristics of Alzheimer's patients which these drugs are the most likely to help. After using these tools to screen for patients in the second phase of its clinical trial of Donanemab it reported positive results.

In short patients treated with Donanemab experienced a slower progression of their disease as measured by a handful of different cognitive-functioning tests than patients treated with placebo. But cognitive functioning still declined over time so the therapy isn't a panacea. Still if these findings hold up Eli Lilly will probably be the next Alzheimer's drug developer to make it to the market after Biogen and based on the data as it stands right now its candidate is superior. But as Eli Lilly is a massive pharma stock with a plethora of other drugs on the market it remains to be seen whether the potential new revenue could make a major impact on its top line.

The company expects to report efficacy data sometime in the first half of 2023 so keep an eye out.

3. Prothena

Prothena's (PRTA -4.47%) selection of Alzheimer's projects is significantly earlier-stage than Eli Lilly's or Annovis Bio's. It has two programs in the tail end of preclinical testing and two others in the discovery phase. One of the candidates being investigated in the discovery phase is a vaccine aimed at recruiting the immune system to fight against two different proteins associated with Alzheimer's which could be extremely lucrative if it can be used preventatively.

The company's crown jewel PRX005 which Prothena is developing in conjunction with Bristol-Myers Squibb just started its phase 1 clinical trials on June 24. The drug targets the tau protein associated with Alzheimer's and studies in model animals have been quite positive. Bristol Myers Squibb will pay Prothena $80 million in exchange for the license to PRX005 should it be commercialized with the option to pay more to advance development after each phase of trials.

Given how early-stage Prothena's projects are the biggest thing for investors to watch for is safety reporting. Serious side effects could nip its promising therapies in the bud and the risk of investing right now is very high. Nonetheless if the company can show that its candidates are safe that will be a major boon to shareholders. And it'll pave the way for further investigations that would have a shot at demonstrating the drug's efficacy which is where the biggest returns lie.",,,

And by magic I mean biological miracles where the simple act of sleep can help repair damaged DNA rewire immune cells detox your body of toxic waste and rebuild healthier suppler skin. This forms the basis of ‘beauty sleep’ for the science of sleep proves that some of the most important recovery processes take place during shut-eye.

Many understand the concept of our body’s biological clock also known as the circadian rhythm where our internal regenerative processes respond to light and dark—or states of being awake and asleep. It is a lesser known fact however that some skin functions march to their own beat. “Some skin functions have their ultradian rhythms which are regular but shorter than circadian rhythms. They operate independently and in most cases are autonomous” says Dr SK Tan founder of IDS. Overnight such ultradian rhythms have been observed in physiological functions like cellular processes circulation and hormonal release all of which are observable and quantifiable patterns that can be tapped to maximise productivity. That said many external aggressors—from stress to temperature and UV rays—have the power to reset or disrupt these clocks which is why a good night’s sleep and skincare regime to optimise this is key.

Open 24 hours

During the day skin cells are in defence mode working hard to ward off environmental aggressors like UV rays free radicals and pollution as well as the mental and emotional stress of work and daily tasks that can take its toll on your regenerative cycle as a whole. When the sun goes down your systems can let their guard down only to naturally switch to an active regeneration mode on an internal and epidermal level. “Night-time is prime time for repairing damage and for rebuilding cells and tissues. It’s for this reason that I spent a great deal of time researching the best way to take advantage of skin’s night-time repair system to improve its overall health and appearance” says renowned dermatologist Dr Dennis Gross. “Sleep is critical to every organ of the body including the skin because skin never sleeps.”

The skin’s temperature drops to its lowest point during the active REM sleep stage allowing muscles to relax and experience its deepest recovery

During this 24/7 cycle there are several key processes and stages that take place after dark. For starters there is a peak time for skin cell renewal according to Gross. “Between 11pm and midnight the process of cell mitosis of the skin is at its peak. Cell mitosis is the cell division that occurs in order to renew and repair skin whether you’re asleep or not.”

Night mode

The skin’s metabolic rate also increases at night—versus the body’s which decreases—leading to enhanced cellular turnover and production of new cells. “This I found is a perfect time to enhance cell turnover and optimise this process with alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and retinol which can result in smoother more even-toned and radiant skin” adds Gross. Besides his namesake brand’s skin-renewing—and cult favourite—Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel the Dr. Dennis Gross Ferulic + Retinol Wrinkle Recovery Overnight Serum features a synergistic trifecta of age-defying retinol free radical-fighting ferulic acid and skin-retexturising niacinamide to support skin’s natural repair process and recover firmness fight wrinkles and reduce imperfections while you get your beauty sleep.

This time of boosted repair and regeneration also makes way for the production of new collagen as part of the process which prevents sagging dullness and fine lines. So on top of AHAs beta-hydroxy acids and retinoids you should supplement your evening skincare ritual with collagen growth-increasing ingredients like hyaluronic acid antioxidant-rich vitamin C and ginseng as well as red light therapy a proven non-invasive method that stimulates the production of collagen and elastin to increase elasticity and firmness in skin. Powered by a proprietary ‘wound healer’ called Neulastin IDS Skincare’s Rejuvenating Complex is a potent anti-ageing moisturiser designed to counter the tolls of time and the environment harnessing the mineral powers of zinc and magnesium chloride as well as hydrolysed elastin and hydrolysed sodium hyaluronate to visibly reduce fine lines and maintain skin bounce and fullness.

Nocturnal behaviour

During non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep which is estimated to be the first three hours of an eight-hour sleep regime the body experiences a natural surge in a ‘fountain of youth’ hormone better known as the human growth hormone. This plays a key role in the body’s regeneration cycle cellular repair muscle growth and recovery working in tandem with anti-inflammatory cytokines that aid in healing and reducing the impact of the daytime damage. Further reason to cease the opportunity of maximising rejuvenation at night is that the skin’s temperature drops to its lowest point during the active REM sleep stage allowing muscles to relax and experience its deepest recovery.

Transepidermal water loss is another phenomenon that exhibits circadian rhythmicity. While the body temperature lowers the skin temperature rises thus leading to moisture evaporation that can weaken the skin barrier. This is why hydration and moisturisation within the layers of your dermis and the surface are particularly crucial for your internal systems to be functioning at their highest capacity. Nourishing overnight masks will do the trick to seal in all that skincare goodness. Dr.Jart+’s Cicapair Sleepair Ampoule-in Mask is targeted at sensitive and sensitised skin types suffering from slow recovery and fatigue while Sulwhasoo’s Overnight Vitalizing Mask is a rich but souffle-like hydrator that combines innovative Organic Respiration Layer technology with an Asian medicinal herb blend to energise and envelope skin.

“Night-time is when the skin’s natural repair process is at its peak and the moisture barrier is at its thinnest causing the most moisture loss. That is why hydration is so critical before bed. Dehydration can also accelerate skin damage” says Dr Nadine Pernodet vice president of skin biology and bioactives global research & development at The Estée Lauder Companies. “With skin-plumping hyaluronic acid Estée Lauder’s Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex was formulated to absorb quickly providing skin with 72-hour hydration and significantly boosting its moisture levels. At night this hydration is critical to creating the optimal environment for skin to maximise its natural nightly repair of visible skin damage” she adds. The latest reiteration of this iconic serum also arms the skin against daytime environmental aggressors boosting hydration to significantly reduce the look of every key sign of ageing from lines and sagginess to dull uneven skin tone with unique youth-generating power that supports the creation and renewal of fresh skin cells and collagen production.

Beauty sleep

But what happens when you can’t get a good night’s rest? Similar to when sleep deprivation or insomnia strikes the beauty world reaches for a hormone responsible for regulating your circadian rhythm: melatonin. Commonly ingested as a supplement to improve sound sleep the topical use of melatonin in skincare won’t increase your bedtime but will optimise it by triggering the skin’s antioxidant behavior for peak regeneration which would otherwise require a regulated sleep-wake cycle to achieve. Also functioning as an antioxidant that boosts skin’s natural defences against free radicals and UV radiation melatonin-induced antioxidants are said to be even more effective than those from bestselling sources like vitamins C and E according to a study published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology.

“Melatonin is a known antioxidant and free radical scavenger and may be useful as an anti-ageing ingredient” affirms Tan. This buzzy ingredient can be found in a plethora of overnight anti-ageing elixirs like Zelens’ Melatonin B12 Advanced Repair Serum which also comes supercharged with biomimetic peptides hyaluronic acid and aloe vera that work overnight to bolster skin’s natural barrier and repair surface cells. Interestingly Dr. Dennis Gross has included melatonin in its Instant Radiance Sun Defense Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF40 as well to harness its free radical-fighting antioxidant prowess for daytime routines while Milk Makeup has a Melatonin Overnight Lip Mask—which also has hyaluronic acid and a vitamin-rich berry blend—to help you kiss chapped and dry lips goodnight. “The bottom line: support your skin at night and you’ll see a dramatic difference in your complexion by day” Gross confirms.",,,,,,,,,

Planning Board 6:30 p.m. Tuesday. The 14-acre Volpe redevelopment in the heart of Kendall Square is back before the board. Things are getting real – members have a staff memo to consume before the meeting that includes regulation of MIT’s development plan if the board decides to grant its special permits. There’s also an application for a recreational cannabis shop and delivery service to consider as Sankofa bids to go in at the 4575-square-foot space at 95 First St. East Cambridge replacing the Loyal Companion pet supply store that signed its lease in May 2019 after Petco departed.

Finally the board may look at the plan to move an aging Eversource gas transfer station off Kendall Square’s showpiece Third Street to a rear space a couple of blocks away at 21 Athenaeum St. It’s part of BioMed Realty’s lab tower and public arts space project and the Board of Zoning Appeal will rule on the move of the station. Televised and watchable by Zoom video conferencing.

The importance of cannabis cooperatives

Public Safety Committee and the Economic Development & University Relations Committee 2 to 4 p.m. Wednesday. These committees run by city councillor Quinton Zondervan and vice mayor Alanna Mallon respectively will hear from Saskia VannJames president of the Massachusetts Recreational Consumer Council on the importance of cannabis cooperatives and how they might shape the city’s emerging recreational cannabis industry. Televised and watchable by Zoom video conferencing.

Yet another License Commission mystery agenda

License Commission 9 to 11 a.m. Friday. No agenda has been posted yet the fourth time this has happened since mid-April. This is the only city body that semi-regularly can’t present its expected business the week before a meeting and its legally mandated posting period though legal notices for the meeting have been posted – maybe the next city manager will find a way to rein it in?

Once you exceed that limit you need to sign up for a Google One storage plan and they start at $1.99 per month for 100 GB of space.

Provided you're smart about how you use your free storage and you don't have masses of files that need storing in the cloud you can stay inside that free 15 GB of allotted room. The steps to take and the tricks to use vary slightly between Gmail Google Drive and Google Photos and we've outlined them below. To see how much space you're using across each Google product visit this page and sign into your account.

It's worth mentioning that should you exceed your storage limit of 15 GB your files won't suddenly disappear—you just won't be able to add new ones. (Google says you ""may not"" be able to receive emails in Gmail either.) You'll need to free up some space or pay for a Google One plan to start adding files again.

Gmail

Gmail can help you decide which emails aren't important. Gmail via David Nield

Email messages don't take up much room but if you've had your Gmail account for years they might be starting to add up. One way of clearing the decks can be to look for and wipe older emails. Type ""older_than:1y"" into the search box at the top of Gmail to look for messages older than a year. You can change the number of years or switch to months if you want—""older_than:3m"" or ""older_than:6m"" for example.

When your “older than” emails appear click the selection box above the list on the left to select all of them then click the Select all conversations that match this search option (this might not appear if your search hasn't returned many results). Click the Delete button (the trash can icon) and the selected emails are erased—or rather they're sent to the Trash folder for 30 days and then they're erased.

Emails with large attachments can also take up a lot of room in your Gmail inbox. In the search box type ""has:attachment larger:10m"" to find messages with attachments bigger than 10 megabytes for example. As before click the selection box to the top left to select all the emails you've found then click Delete to get rid of them.

Labels are another way to get rid of messages you don't need any more—assuming that you've been labeling your emails as they come in to indicate their importance. If you want to rely on Google's algorithms to decide what isn't important in your inbox search for ""label:unimportant"" to see newsletters emails from contacts you don't interact with very often marketing messages and so on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9jaWVyYXZlbGFyZGUvc3RvcmFnZS1wcm9kdWN0cy1mb3ItYmF0aHJvb23SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,27 Storage Products For Small Bathrooms,"7.

It was a crossover with SUV styling designed to drive on the road not off it. The body is raised higher which is to give drivers a commanding view of the road and taller imposing looks rather than clearing rocks and tree trunks underneath. The 2016 makeover freshened the design adding some of the typical Ford family features including a deep front grille and badge creased tailgate and flared headlights.

While there have always been high-end versions of the Kuga Ford has tried to create the impression the Vignale is almost a separate brand. Expect prominent Vignale badges to remind you of its rank.

Underneath the Vignale Kuga is the same as the normal Kuga - just more lavishly appointed. Car-spotters might notice a different ‘Vignale’ pattern to the front grille inserts and bigger special alloy wheels. This Ford model also offers a selection of special paint options.",,,

Sure you know McKinsey Bain and BCG are there and so is Amazon and Google. But who else? And what percentage of the graduating class at top MBA programs are actually hired by these firms?

In a rare and exclusive look at elite MBA employment we present the top ten employers of MBA graduates at 24 of the leading business schools over the past three years. Only a few business schools disclose a ranked listing of top employers and when they do the schools limit those lists to a single graduating class. Now for the first time an extensive analysis of MBA recruits by Menlo Coaching the premium MBA admissions consulting firm has pulled the curtain back on exactly which firms are hiring in a big way from these schools. Menlo Coaching’s research team analyzed 51991 student profiles on LinkedIn to get to the bottom of it. To access the full report on all 24 schools from Menlo Coaching you can click here.

This latest analysis follows the look at top employers of Harvard Stanford and Wharton MBAs (see Who Really Hires Harvard Stanford & Wharton MBAs These Days) a report on where McKinsey Bain & BCG hire the most MBAs and a look at the MBA hires by Goldman Sachs JPMorganChase & Morgan Stanley.

THE MOST FREQUENT TOP FIVE EMPLOYER ACROSS 24 SCHOOLS? AMAZON

The data reveals some big surprises. For one thing notes David White a founding partner of Menlo Coaching the top employers are not the same as the top feeders.”In unpublished research we identified Deloitte as the #1 largest feeder company to the 24 U.S. MBA programs we analyzed sending around twice as many students as the runner up BCG” he says. “However Deloitte is only the fifth largest post-MBA recruiter across these same 24 programs.”

So which company is the most frequent Top Five employer? Amazon. “It made the list of the top five employers at every M7 school.” says White. “In total it was a top five employer at 22 of the 24 MBA programs we examined. Beyond Amazon Google was the other big tech company to appear frequently in the top five employer lists.”

Not surprisingly perhaps some schools are local favorites of companies. “Although the top five employers at most MBA programs are national recruiters who appear in the lists for many different MBA programs there are a few major employers with a regional recruiting footprint” explains White. “For example Dell was a top five employer at UT Austin McCombs and UNC Kenan-Flagler but not at other MBA programs and Microsoft was a top five recruiter only at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business.”

GEOGRAPHY MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME MBA EMPLOYERS

For prospective MBA students the real takeaway might well be this: ""Graduates can join McKinsey Bain or BCG even if they are not at a top-ranked school"" adds White. ""We examined 14 MBA programs outside of (M7 + Haas Tuck Yale). In those 14 programs all but two include one of McKinsey Bain and BCG as one of their Top 10 employers. For example UCLA Anderson and NYU Stern both have all three firms among their top 10 employers.""

Once you expand to looking at the top 10 employers instead of the top five Facebook pops up frequently as another tech recruiter alongside Amazon and Google. In Menlo Coaching's top 10 employers report you can see a larger number of employers who recruit disproportionately at MBA programs near their headquarters with pairs like USC Marshall and Amgen Emory Goizueta and UPS Rice Jones and ExxonMobil and Chevron) as well as Washington Foster and Starbucks.

The company taking the largest percentage of MBAs out of any one school among the top 24 is the Boston Consulting Group at Kellogg: BCG has hired 11.5% of Kellogg graduates in the past three years. The only other double-digit employer from a single school is Amazon which has hired 10.3% of the MBA grads out of Washington Foster in three years.

AT STANFORD GOOGLE TIES BCG AS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR EMPLOYER

Overall at the 24 leading schools McKinsey and BCG are the #1 and #2 employers respectively. Bain follows in fourth place. Amazon ranks #3 at 4.1% and represents the only non-consulting firm in the top five (see table below). ""The high placement rate at Amazon reflects its position as a highly desirable company for MBAs targeting tech"" says White. ""It also reflects Amazon's own interest in hiring MBA graduates especially outside the M7: Amazon is the top employer for UNC Kenan-Flagler UCLA Anderson Texas McCombs Michigan Ross UW Foster NYU Stern and Duke Fuqua (tied).""

Only one financial services company makes the top ten: JPMorgan Chase employing just under 1% of the graduates in tenth place.

McKinsey Bain and BCG maintain their attraction for MBA graduates from M7 programs. Indeed for all M7 programs MBB ranks at the top (though Google ties BCG at Stanford's #3 according to Menlo's analysis. ""In addition to the clear relationship between M7 attendance and placement at an MBB firm listings for programs outside the M7 reveal strong placement rates at the Big Four strategy consulting firms or Deloitte PwC KPMG and EY-Parthenon"" adds White. ""Placements at Deloitte and EY-Parthenon are especially high across the board.""

2020 was a year to remember for Suriname oil and gas industry following the country’s first discovery of hydrocarbons in offshore Block 58 held in a JV between Apache and Total. A game-changing opportunity for the country’s economic recovery and development. Suriname finished the year on a positive note with the fourth offshore discovery by Petronas in a JV with ExxonMobil.

With an estimated resource potential of 13.6 billion barrels (P50) the United States Geological Survey (USGS 2012) ranks the Guiana Basin 2nd in the world for prospectivity among the world’s unexplored basins and 12th for oil among all the world’s basins – explored and unexplored.

In an interview with our correspondent Annand Jagesar Acting Managing Director/CEO of Staatsolie has said that the Suriname Energy Oil Gas industry is Open for Business noting that the country has had five significant discoveries over the years.

According to him the finds are huge and the exploration success rates are unheard of. Total and Apache are already in the appraisal phase with the target to have the first production in 2025.

He said: “We have three areas of possible interest. Firstly we have been producing crude oil from our onshore (wetland) fields for around 40 years now.

“Secondly we are busy in the shallow offshore where we just closed the bidding round for the western part. This is also going to generate activities from the PSCs that are pending.

“And then lastly our current crown jewels in the deeper offshore. The operators are very active and especially Total and Apache in Block 58 are executing a 2-rig exploration/appraisal program with a total budget of around USD 800 million. Suriname will be brimming with activities.

“Staatsolie has a professional relationship with the IOCs operating in Suriname. We have often been told by the contractor parties that our professionalism including transparency is a huge difference for them compared to other developing countries.

“We will make sure that we present a program which suits the interest of all (potential) stakeholders interested to do business in Suriname and as such contribute to their expansion as well as the development of Suriname’s oil & gas and energy sectors.

“Suriname is open for business. We invite you to team up with us to take advantage of the opportunities as partners and with a strong focus on sustainable development.”

Recently Staatsolie hosted the official and inaugural Suriname Energy Oil and Gas virtual under the patronage of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs International Business and International Cooperation Government of the Republic of Suriname and the Ministry of Natural Resources Government of the Republic of Suriname.

SEOGS 2021 brings together an international assembly of government officials public sector stakeholders and policymakers with IOC’s NOC‘s independents service companies technology providers and the entire oil gas and energy value chain.

Staatsolie plays a fundamental role in the development of Suriname’s hydrocarbon potential. The NOC intends to develop renewable and sustainable energy resources as well as contributing to the local economic development through local content strategies.

Staatsolie is involved in exploration drilling production refining marketing sales and transport of crude and refined products and the generation of electricity. The company’s core activities are grouped in an Upstream and a Downstream asset strongly supported by a variety of corporate services.

Staatsolie’s Vision 2030 is geared towards a sustainable energy future for Suriname and making a strong contribution to the advancement of our society. This Vision represents the spirit and energy of Staatsolie’s successful history of development growth and its distinctive value-based performance culture.",,,,,,,,,

(WBAY) - Sunday marks an important day for one Wisconsin village after a F5 tornado formed in a storm system that traveled through the region.

On July 18 1996 weather officials say the costliest tornado in state history happened in the village of Oakfield Wisconsin with total damage amounts of $39.5 million in public/private property and $900000 in crop losses..

25 years later weather experts are sounding off on that day and how everyone in the village survived the storm. However officials say 12 people were injured with some of them being hospitalized.

The tornado hit Oakfield in the early evening hours with meteorologists saying it intensified to a F3 rating as it approached the village.

Although it then grew to a F4 tornado while it went through the village it then moved up to a F5 - the highest intensity - as it moved along a path 1-4 miles east of the village. At that point winds were estimated to reach 265 miles an hour.

According to the National Weather Service (NWS) the core width of the most intense damage was about 150-200 yards however they add some secondary damage was found in a 400 yard wide path.

The NWS adds corn field just east of Oakfield were lowered to 1-4 inches high and burn marks were also visible.

Residents had less than 10 minutes of warning before the tornado hit Oakfield with the warning issued at 7:09 p.m. and then hit the village at 7:15 p.m. The NWS says it ended at 7:35 p.m.

As the tornado traveled through the village more than 100 homes and businesses were damaged and dozens of homes were destroyed as well as six businesses according to the NWS.

The storm eventually roped out one mile northwest of Eden and debris was found on the Lake Michigan shoreline and there were also cancelled checks found near Muskegon Michigan more than 120 miles to east and southeast.

That day the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) had nearly all of Wisconsin under a Moderate risk for severe weather as well as parts of Minnesota Iowa Illinois Michigan Indiana and Ohio. Early that morning the SPC said it appeared parameters would come together for a significant severe weather episode across the Great Lakes region.

Later that morning the SPC continued to say it appeared the weather pattern was favorable for a concentrated area of severe thunderstorm development with the possibility for a few supercells and possible tornados in addition to likely bow echoes.

Officials then continued that discussion into the early afternoon saying storms were expected to develop rapidly and conditions would likely support supercell development with the activity possibly evolving into a derecho/serial bow echo into the overnight hours.

A tornado watch was first issued for much of Wisconsin at 3:33 p.m. and a second tornado watch was issued at 6:47 p.m. to cover areas which weren’t covered under the first watch.

Radar records show the storm which caused the tornado started in eastern Adams County and produced its first tornado in Green Lake County. However the storm moved through southern Fond du Lac County where the Oakfield tornado was formed. The storm also moved through Ozaukee County where two additional tornadoes were produced near Port Washington according to the NWS.

Weather experts say those tornadoes were a part of a grand total of 12 tornadoes which formed in Wisconsin that day.

As previously reported the Village of Oakfield will have several events happening Sunday to commemorate the anniversary.

After a one-year fan hiatus because of COVID-19 restrictions spectators are back in Blaine this week. And so is the Tour.

What: The 44th tournament on the PGA Tour's 2020-21 ""super schedule"" — 50 events in 51 weeks. The slate includes 14 events that were canceled or postponed in 2020.

Winning FedEx Cup points: 500.

Course details: Par 71 played at 7431 yards.

Cut: Low 65 and ties after 36 holes.

Schedule: Gates open at 6:30 a.m. each day. There are practice rounds and pro-ams Tuesday and Wednesday. The 72-hole tournament begins Thursday morning.

Last year: Michael Thompson then the 218th-ranked player in the world let a four-shot lead wilt away on Sunday but held off hard-charging Adam Long to win by two strokes at 19 under par. Thompson sank a 14-foot birdie putt on the final hole to seal the victory and held back tears after accepting the winner's trophy and check which accounted for nearly 12% of his career earnings.

Players to watch

Despite hosting a stateside event days after the British Open and during the Olympic Games in Tokyo the 3M Open pulled together a better field than some might have expected. The 156 players competing include 11 former major champions and 31 players from the British Open field.

Dustin Johnson: The world's No. 1-ranked player is back in Blaine destined for a do-over. Last summer Johnson signed for a first-round 78 and withdrew 30 minutes later citing a back injury. It was a far from memorable tournament debut but perhaps he found a little something along the way? Johnson tied for 12th the next week at the WGC St. Jude Invitational then finished no worse than a tie for second the rest of the season in winning the FedEx Cup playoffs.

Louis Oosthuizen: Mr. Consistency is set to make his 3M Open debut fresh off what has been — surprise! — another spectacular showing in a major. Oostuizen began Sunday with a one-shot lead at Royal St. George's. Winner of the 2010 British Open and five times a runner-up in the other three majors the smooth-swinging South African has made 16 cuts in 17 events on the PGA Tour this season banking nearly $5 million.

Matthew Wolff: He won the 3M Open as a 20-year-old sponsor exemption fresh out of Oklahoma State in 2019. But it's been a roller coaster since. Wolff was runner-up at the U.S. Open in September and posted another second-place finish at the Shriners Open three weeks later. He didn't post a top-25 finish in the next 10 events (including a DQ at the Masters) and took a two-month break to restore his mental health. Wolff withdrew from the British Open before the start of the tournament.

Rickie Fowler: The last time we saw Fowler in Minnesota he was the lone single man without a partner to smooch in a 2016 Ryder Cup celebratory photo that went viral. Fowler is now married but looking for a career rebound eager to find those golfing skills that earned Team USA two points in a dominating victory over Europe at Hazeltine National. Fowler is in the midst of a down season with just one top-10 finish although it came two months ago at the PGA Championship.

Steve Stricker: Speaking of the Ryder Cup the 54-year-old Wisconsin native is set to captain the United States this fall at his home-state Whistling Straits. But first a few more events as a competitor. Stricker has three PGA Tour Champions majors since turning 50 and has remained competitive on the PGA Tour. He has made seven cuts in 10 events this season. At 152nd in the FedEx Cup standings he is in shouting distance of a spot in the playoffs. Stricker has a positive history at TPC Twin Cities; he finished tied for third (18 under) in his lone 3M Championship appearance in 2017.

John Pak: Last year's winner of the college big three (Haskins Award Hogan Award Nicklaus Award) turned in low amateur honors at the U.S. Open in September. He is now a pro and ready to go but Pak has struggled thus far in his PGA Tour career. At the Barbasol Championship on Friday he played the final six holes in 3 over and missed the cut by two. He is one of five college stars with sponsor entries into the 3M Open joining Quade Cummins (Oklahoma) Austin Eckroat (Oklahoma State) Ryan Hall (South Carolina) and Angus Flanagan of the Gophers.

Local connections

Fargo's Tom Hoge a former two-time Minnesota State Amateur champion was the only player with Minnesota ties to make the cut last summer (he finished tied for 46th). He's back along with former Gophers golfer Erik van Rooyen and Spring Lake Park graduate Troy Merritt. They both missed the cut at the British Open and will aim to improve on last summer's disappointments in Blaine.

Sharing the spotlight

Before the top-tier talent of golf tees off for the tournament some players with ahem slightly lesser abilities will show their stuff. There is a three-hole celebrity challenge Wednesday evening featuring eight participants raising money for Minnesota charities. TNT analyst and noted golf aficionado Charles Barkley will team with NFL star Larry Fitzgerald Jr.; Former Twins batting champion Joe Mauer is with Vikings receiver Adam Thielen; Hollywood star Josh Duhamel is with former Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph; and 10-time LPGA major champion Annika Sorenstam is with CBS reporter Amanda Balionis.

Nightclubs are among the first venues to take advantage of the easing of Covid restrictions in England from Monday.

With doors opening a minute past midnight the BBC was at a nightclub in Leeds where revellers aren't being asked to wear masks or socially distance.

Some people there said that this was the first time they'd ever been to a nightclub as they had not turned 18 when the pandemic began.

(July 17 2021) – Atlanta United 2 fell 2-0 to Louisville City FC Saturday night at Lynn Family Stadium. Amadou Macky Diop recorded his first start of the season while Atlanta United Academy player Noah Cobb started in his first professional game at the age of 15.

After splitting possession and trading shots both clubs pushed forward to jump on the scoreboard in the closing minutes of the first half. Louisville’s strongest opportunity came in the 41st minute when Cameron Lancaster headed a ball on frame just a yard away from the goal line but Rocco Ríos Novo made the reaction save. A few minutes later in stoppage time Atlanta’s best look came when Caleb Wiley drove in a cross to Macky Diop in the six-yard box where the forward was able to make contact with his left foot but his shot was too high.

Louisville opened the second half with a goal in the 54th minute when Kyle Grieg threaded a pass to Napo Matsoso in the box and the forward buried a one-time shot into the far side netting of the goal. James McLaughlin doubled Louisville’s lead in the 63rd minute when he fired a shot from the top of the 18-yard box and it ricocheted off the crossbar and into goal.

ATL UTD 2 (3-6-5 14 points) will return to action against FC Tulsa on July 28 at Fifth Third Bank Stadium (ESPN+ 7:30 p.m. ET).

Preservation Hall Jazz Band performed alongside theGrand Rapids Symphony.

According to organizers roughly 1300 tickets were sold.

“Lots of smiles very very happy lots of joy” said Mary Tuuk Kuras the symphony’s president and CEO. “It’s our hope that all of that joy that we feel will immediately spread through the audience tonight too.”

This year the symphony is partnering with Meijer Gardens and playing at three concerts over the next two weeks. Tuuk Kuras described it as a way for the symphony to find a new audience in new locations while the organization recovers from the pandemic.

Running through September the 28-performance series came together cautiously and was ready to go once pandemic restrictions lifted.

“Anytime that you have a difficult situation when you get teams of people - you get the artist you get our team you get the symphony’s team - working on a common goal it’s fun even though there’s a little bit of stress going on” said David Hooker Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park president and CEO. 16:59:03 “My favorite part is when you look out to the crowd and you see so many people experiencing joy. These concerts are a fantastic way for us to connect with people from all walks of life.”

People in attendance said Sunday’s performance allowed them to reconnect with acts and loved ones they missed spending time with during the pandemic.

“I like it especially when they play the second line song like the Bourbon Street Parade Take Me to the Glory Land” said Bill Paulson who lives in Muskegon and is an avid jazz fan. “It’s been a pretty dull 18 months lately you know. Gives you a chance to go out.”

“We all love music and it’s just a way to spend time together with friends” said Grand Rapids Resident Jill Miller who came with her husband and close friends.

Physician mortgage loans have been around since before I started writing this blog in 2011. All of the doctor mortgage lenders on our recommended list will lend to physicians and most will lend to dentists. Other professionals such as CRNAs attorneys veterinarians pharmacists podiatrists optometrists and even accountants often qualify as well.

What Is a Physician Mortgage Loan?

While some definitions differ my definition of a doctor mortgage loan is one that:

Does not charge PMI despite having a down payment of less than 20%

Will close with a signed employment contract rather than pay stubs

Only considers the payments of student loans (not the entire loan burden)

Is not an FHA or VA loan

Often these loans are “portfolio loans” (i.e. are kept in house at the bank that issued them). These lenders will also have experience working with self-employed (1099/independent contractor) doctors—which adds a level of complexity to getting a mortgage.

As a general rule the rates and fees on these loans can be slightly higher than what you can get with a 20% down conventional mortgage. That's the price you pay for the convenience of not having to meet conventional mortgage rules and for being able to use your down payment money to pay off student loans max out retirement accounts or something else.

The terms are highly variable and include 30-year fixed 15-year fixed 5/1 ARMs 7/1 ARMs and 10/1 ARMs. As a general rule I'm a big fan of a 15-year fixed mortgage but there are certainly other circumstances that merit using other types of mortgages. For example if you know you will sell in 7 years a 7/1 ARM is a fixed mortgage for you. Others prefer a 30-year amortization so paying it off in 10 or 15 is optional not mandatory.

Physician Mortgage Lenders

Available lenders in your state can be easily found in the map below:

AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY DC

In today's post I wanted to discuss the real-life experiences of doctors who have shopped for a doctor mortgage in the last year or so. So I sent out an email to thousands of my readers and received a couple of hundred responses. Don't worry not all will be included in this post but it will be enough to provide a good sample of what I received.

Bear in mind that a lot of the variation in interest rates you will see below is explained by the fact that we are looking at people who took out mortgages between 2017-2019. These are not the same rates available to you today.

This can be an input to help you understand if a physician mortgage would be a good idea for you.

Doctor Mortgage Experiences from WCI Readers

Read Up and Shop Around

Lance went to Fulton Bank for his physician mortgage loan because he didn't have a down payment and a friend had a good experience there. He put 0% down and ended up with a rate of 3.75%. He advises “read up and shop around.”

10% Down Payment

Richard checked out US Bank and Fairway Mortgage and ended up with US Bank because “They were very helpful throughout and offered the best interest rate by quite a bit.” He put 10% down for a rate of 4.375%. That was a lot better than he could get with any other mortgage given the lack of a 20% down payment.

Closing Four Months Before Contract Start Date

Luke took a look at Arvest and US Bank and chose Arvest “because they allow closing up to 4 months before contract start date and they offer 100% financing up to a certain house price. I have been very happy with my choice to go with Arvest. Previously used Suntrust for my current home 5 years ago and there was a bit more ‘red tape' in getting things finalized compared to Arvest.” 0% down 4.25%. He went with a physician loan because he is “just finishing residency and do not have enough liquid cash for a conventional down payment.”

Low Down Payment on an Expensive Home

Alexander bought in 2017 using a physician mortgage in order to only put 10% down on a $930K home a year out of fellowship in a high COLA. Rate was 3.99% with Suntrust the lowest rate he found.

“Pushed Off to Someone Else”

Michael got a doctor's loan because he wanted to use his saved money for home improvements. He went with BMO Harris but was disappointed because the rate (4.75% with 5% down) ended up being 0.75% higher than the original quote and the agent “pushed me off to someone else in a different state who was not good at communicating or coordinating with the title company so we did not meet our deadline.” He wishes he would have used a 10-year ARM instead of the 15-year fixed he got.

Used a Local Credit Union

Andy checked out many options in Michigan but ended up with a local credit union because he got better rates 0% down and a 3% checking account up to $30000. He ended up with a 4.24% 10/1 ARM because he plans to pay it off in less than 10 years.

Make the Lenders Compete for Your Business

Lindsey looked at Citizens One and SunTrust and ended up putting 11% down with Citizens One to get a 3.375% 15-year mortgage. She advises “Make the lenders compete for your business. My husband and I have credit scores in the 800s so all the banks wanted our business. Be creative and don’t just focus on interest rates. Ask for credits at closing too.”

Days of 0% Down Gone for Jumbos

Rishi put 10% down to get a 4.375% interest rate on a jumbo loan with Citizens Bank. He says “make sure you have enough money saved prior to looking. Sounds obvious but you need more than just an attending contract before you get approved. The days of 0% down are almost gone definitely unavailable for jumbo loans.”

Two Doctor Loans in Three Years

Benjamin has done this twice once in 2014 (Key Bank 10% down 30-year fixed 3.675%) and once in 2017 (Fifth Third Bank 10% down 30-year fixed 4.125%).

Locked It in Instead of Saving Up a Down Payment

Adam went with the physician mortgage because he found the rates to be very competitive with conventional mortgages but only had to put 5% down. He says “I could have saved up a bit more for a higher down payment but rates were rising at the time so I wanted to lock it in quickly. Overall it's been a good experience.” He looked at US Bank and PNC Bank before going with Huntington Bank with a 3.325% 7/1 ARM.

A 5/1 ARM

Anton chose the physician loan because he didn't have a down payment. He chose Simmons Bank over Bank of America put down 5% and got a 5/1 ARM at 4.25%. He recommends looking for the best interest rate and locking it in.

Just Rent a Cautionary Tale

Ashmi closed on her doctor loan (5% down 3.75%) with Bank of America after checking out Wells Fargo and Union Bank. She says “I was in the middle of finishing fellowship moving preparing for my new job and also studying for my specialty boards. In retrospect I don’t think I was in the right mindset to make all these decisions. Waiting 3-6 months until we had the 10% down payment (and interest rates relatively low still) would have been a much better deal. Or waiting 1-2 years to have the full 20% down.

We underestimated the costs of buying closing and the amount of repairs/renovations buying a 40-year-old home in Los Angeles (which actually is “newer” for our neighborhood) would cost. Now that I have read WCI I would definitely recommend waiting. Renting what you need (i.e. we would have been fine in 2 bed/2 bath townhome or apartment) and then deciding the next step based on 1) finances 2) children/family 3) choosing the best neighborhood after exploring for a year or two.”

Mortgage Broker Instead of a Bank

Aaron a self-employed periodontist ended up working with a mortgage broker because the banks would not even look at him without two years of tax returns. 0% down 5.25%. He recommends “explore the options of “buying down” the interest rate by paying points. My broker gave me that choice and if you’re financing that large a number ($330K) it’s advisable to pay the thousand or so up front to buy a lower interest rate.”

Rates a Little Higher Than Before

This doc closed in November 2018 with 0% down and a rate of 5.4% on a $225K loan with Sun Trust. He is pleased but hated all the paperwork.

A Serious Mortgage Loan Shopper

Ryan bought early in attendinghood and so didn't have a down payment but doesn't regret it given other job options he had in the area if the first didn't work out. He emailed 8-10 lenders off this site and 3 local banks and credit unions but only had 3-4 email back. He simply chose the best rate he could get which was a local bank who gave him a 90/10 loan instead of a doctor loan. The 90% loan had a 30-year term 10% loan had a 5-year term but both were fixed at 4.25%.

He says “Everyone seemed helpful I'm sure they will be because they are about to make a lot of money off of you. I seemed to get the best responsiveness from the local folks and actually the best rate as well. I highly suggest shopping around—I had rates range from 4.375% to 5.75% that can really change payment structures. Overall this was a bit more stressful and difficult than refinancing my student loans.”

Ask Who Will Service the Loan Post-Closing

Sara used First Citizens Bank and then refinanced from 4.75% to 3.99% with Suntrust 6 months later after her credit score improved and she had an improved loan to value ratio after doing some renovations. Both were 30-year mortgages. Sara found SunTrust to have a lower rate but higher credit standards. She was surprised to find rates to be similar to conventional mortgages.

She and her husband really liked the “portfolio loan” aspect of the physician loans. “For us it seems like physician mortgages are serviced by the actual bank who loans the money. This has been a much better experience than previous conventional mortgages that were sold to a third-party servicer. For example I had a house before meeting my husband (he's the physician in our relationship) and it's serviced by Rushmore Lending Group after being sold from the original bank I financed through. Horrible horrible experience with Rushmore in attempting to obtain information early pay-off escrow etc.

In contrast both First Citizens and Suntrust kept our loan in their portfolio. It's been super easy to set-up extra principal-only payments as well as obtain information anytime about the loan. That can be a real win time-wise. And if needed I could go into my local branch and talk to the bank about the loan at any time.”

Did as Much by Email as Possible

Jimmy is now coming out of fellowship and recently got preliminary quotes from 13 lenders (Suntrust Synovus First Tennessee BB&T BBVA Citizens Physician Loans US Bank FNB IBeria Simmons UMB and Willow Bend) and went with First Tennessee because they had the best terms (0% down to $1M 5% down to $1.5M) rates were as good as anyone else's and the agent was easy to work with. 5% down 4.25%. He says “I sent a form email to everyone on your website and got some information on basic terms and conditions and then circled back with those who had agreeable basic terms to get final rate quotes before proceeding with the “winner.” I tried to do as much as possible via email so as to have minimal impact on my day-to-day work. If people weren't willing to work via email they were cut. At the end of the day I figure that they are competing for my business and that I'm not required to bend to their needs in order for them to get my business.

Used the WCI Recommended Mortgage Lenders

Nabil looked at Regions Bank BBVA and Fairway before going with Cadence Bank with 5% down and a 4.375% 30-year fixed mortgage. He says “All the lenders I reached out to were recommended by WCI for physician loans in Texas. They all provided good service and an overall good experience. I mentioned I found them through WCI. Went with the one that gave me the best rate. No issues with the process and closed on time and everything went smoothly.”

Careful with Construction Loans

Elizabeth looked at Bank of America and then settled on SunTrust for a 4.49% loan with 5% down. She warns “I found not all banks were willing to do physician mortgages for new construction so that's something to ask about up front if that's what you're planning. ”

Expect Some Inconvenience

Tyler just closed on a house last month with a physician mortgage to avoid PMI and put less down. He put 10% down and got 4% with US Bank. He notes “Working with someone in another state was a little inconvenient since there were no person to person meetings. There were lots of emails and scanned documents with some things getting lost.”

Rate Was Most Important But Service Matters Too

Steven's wife is coming out of residency and they wanted a mortgage that didn't count her student loans and would accept her signed contract. They were quoted 5% down 4.99% by Fairway but are looking at a local bank offering 0% down 4.25%. They were willing to put more down but there wasn't much benefit. He said “Fairway was great to work with. They went back and forth with me on the various options (fixed vs. variable 30 vs 15 buy down options etc.) updating the presentation with each of my requests. They answered all my questions. Honestly Fairway was so helpful I feel kinda bad going with the local bank especially since Fairway doesn't charge an application fee (so we got all their help for free). But the rate difference is significant and it gets us established with a local bank which could be helpful down the line especially since I'll likely be self-employed (in a non-medical field).”

Flexibility Matters

Aubrene looked at Fifth Third Bank and some local banks and chose Fifth Third because “they were more willing to be flexible with closing dates and paperwork.” She put 5% down and got a 4% rate.

Closing This Month

Jessica is closing this month with Fulton Mortgage after looking at SunTrust. 4.25% on a 15/1 ARM with 6% down on an $850K home. She is looking forward to using her cash to pay off student loans instead of a down payment.

I don't dare make this post any longer but after looking through more than 100 emails the story is mostly the same. Mostly great experiences with minor inconveniences and the occasional major hassle. Rates mostly in the 4-5% range—again be mindful that these experiences were sent to us in 2019 and rates are sure to change. Down payments mostly in the 0%-5% range. People mostly doing it because they don't have down payment money or have a better use for it but still expect to be in the home for many years. The amazing thing is just how many different lenders people are using. There really was no one lender that stood out over the others. You just need to take a look at the ones in your state and shop around to get the best rate terms and service for your personal situation.

What do you think? Have you taken out a physician mortgage loan in the last year? Why did you choose it? What rate and terms did you get? What companies did you look at and how was your experience with each? Comment below!",,,

No it’s a solar car built by UC Berkeley students,"UC Berkeley’s solar car club CalSol will depart in a week for the midwest solar vehicle in tow to compete in the American Solar Challenge — the team’s first return to competition after more than a year sidelined by the pandemic.

The team would forgive you for gawking at Zephyr the solar car in question a two-and-a-half foot tall creation that resembles a cross between a Tesla and something out of Star Wars.

“It looks like a flying saucer because we’re optimizing for efficiency” said Alexander Zerkle a recent Berkeley graduate who will be handling the team’s logistics during the competition. “It’s a handmade unique one-of-a-kind car.”

The team will first compete in a three-day track event in Kansas for the Formula Sun Grand Prix component of the challenge. Then they’ll travel to Independence Mo. to compete in the road event a 1000 mile five-day course ending in Las Vegas N.M. with the option for teams to complete additional miles to show off the capabilities of their cars.

To gear up the students are putting in the hours at the Richmond Field Station a UC Berkeley-owned 170-acre parcel that’s home to various student clubs and research. The University closed the station for the duration of the pandemic with student access being restored only a month ago — a challenge for the hands-on team.

Michael Jia a rising sophomore who saw the station for the first time last month said there’s a world of difference between looking at a car on design software and seeing it in person. “The images don’t do it justice” he said.

Erik Francis a rising senior on the team who accompanied Jia and other pandemic recruits to the field station still remembers the feeling of testing the car to see how it held up after a year and a half of rest.

“It started right up” he said with pride while the other two students imitated the cheering and celebration that took place afterward.

Though the club has always prioritized their members gaining engineering skills over podium finishes the socially-distanced year has put learning at the forefront of this summer’s competition according to Zerkle. “We’re still aiming to do well” he said but the primary goal will be getting the new recruits familiar with how solar car racing works.

If the past is any indication CalSol will have a good shot at making it to the podium. Zephyr took first and second place in the 2017 and 2018 Formula Sun Grand Prix races. By solar car standards Zephyr is a relatively long-lived car having first raced in 2014.

Learning is also the goal of these competitions at large. The first solar car race took place in the 1980s and the challenge has yet to yield a car that can be used by consumers.

“This vehicle weighs 500 pounds and has no air conditioner” Zerkle said. “I don’t know of anybody who would want to buy this for their normal commute.”

But the solar cars that teams build for the competition are road-ready and Zephyr is complete with a California license plate and DMV registration. It can reach up to 80 mph but during races the team targets a speed closer to 40 mph — the race is one more of endurance than speed.

The same applies to the drivers: Without air conditioning the inside of the car can heat up quickly so drivers need to pay attention to how they’re feeling and swap out at least every two hours. A CamelBak hydration pack is tucked behind the driver’s seat allowing them to sip water from a tube.

“We have a mandatory hydration policy” Zerkle said. The policy? “Hydrate a lot.”

In addition to no AC the solar car also lacks crash features such as airbags. To protect the driver Zephyr will be flanked by lead and chase vehicles and preceded by a scout car five minutes down the road checking for hazards. The team communicates by amateur radio on the road.

Here’s what that means “Block the car protect the driver” Jia said modeling swerving around the solar car in a van as Zephyr made a right turn at the field station. “If I block like that the oncoming traffic will run into this van before the car gets hit.”

Luckily no one has gotten hurt in the club’s history. Instead the club’s 30 years of operation have been filled with fun memories and teamwork. That included figuring out the logistics of getting a car to Australia for the World Solar Challenge — hint: it involved shipping containers and large boats — and plenty of camaraderie when things didn’t go according to plan.

Zerkle recalled how during the 2018 American Solar Challenge CalSol had a teammate who was enthralled by ducks — plush ducks rubber ducks etc. The team then ordered a package of plush ducks and hid them around the racecourse for him to find.

“It took him a week to figure out what was going on it was an excellent memory” Zerkle said. “The atmosphere is a great one to learn in.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZW5lcmd5Y2FwaXRhbHBvd2VyLmNvbS90b3AtMTAtc29sYXItcG93ZXItcGxhbnRzLWluLWFmcmljYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Solar Power Plants in Africa,"Africa is at the forefront of renewable energy production. An abundance of renewable energy resources such as solar photovoltaic (PVs) and concentrated solar power (CSP) have given the resource-rich continent an opportunity to provide utility-scale electricity to the approximately 600 million people who lack access to reliable electricity.

However pressured by high costs and technical difficulties most n-type products from the major Chinese manufacturers have remained at the laboratory or pilot line stage.

N-type time

In 2021 however most major PV panel manufacturers launched n-type products – and this was clearly evident at the trade show. Longi for example introduced its Hi-Mo N panel based on N-TOPCon technology. Jinko launched its Tiger Pro N panel – also based on TOPCon.

Not all developments were TOPCon though. Sunport introduced its C10 Pro based on HJT while Canadian Solar and Risen also launched new HJT products. Trina Solar Tongwei and JA Solar revealed new high-powered panels based on both TOPCon and HJT cells. Other Tier-2 manufacturers like Haitai Akcome Jolywood and Jinneng all launched new PV panels based on either TOPCon or HJT.

There are now more than a dozen top Chinese PV module manufacturers making a real move into the next generation of n-type PV products. And the sentiment at SNEC was that more companies will soon be making the shift. The only difference in terms of technology strategy is that some of them are sticking to a single track either TOPCon or HJT while others are hedging their bets.

Higher power

At SNEC 2021 most module makers presented products based on either 182 mm or 210 mm wafers. This means both larger modules and much higher power ratings. The typical 182 mm PERC module comes with an output of 520 W to 600 W in 72- and 78-piece formats. For those based on 210 mm typical power outputs lie between 540 W and 620 W – a small difference from 182 mm types. Only one giant large-format module from JA Solar provides power up to 800 W. Panels based on n-type TOPCon or HJT technology and 182/210 mm wafer did offer even higher base power up to 700 W with the same size as PERC type.

In terms of module formats and cell configurations most leading module makers utilized multiple technologies. They included various approaches to reduce the gaps between cells laser cell separation to reduce crack risks high-density encapsulation innovative connecting ribbons and more to increase the module efficiency while reducing total weight of the panel.

182 vs. 210

The major manufacturers have now formed into two groups when it comes to cell size – either 182 mm or 210 mm. Both camps are easy to identify due to supply chain cooperation and partnerships. At SNEC it appeared as if the 210 mm may be gaining an advantage over 182 mm.

From pv magazine’s review of the cell and module producer booths in Shanghai only Longi Jinko and ZNshine were seen to stick to 182 mm solely without any 210 mm products. On the other hand Trina Solar Risen Tongwei Chint Maxeon Eging Suntech Solargiga GCL and Jolywood were all offering 210 mm products only. Other major panel makers – including JA Solar Canadian Solar Seraphim and Haitai – have chosen to provide both options.

During the expo Trina Solar released its new standard white paper for 210 mm wafer-based PV modules. The company intends to reduce supply chain costs by promoting the 210 mm type as the new standard.

BIPV development

More companies presented building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) products for what is described as a “blue sea” market segment. Jinko introduced BIPV color walls and BIPV roof products. Trina Solar released a systematic BIPV solution the Trina Tile for rooftops. Yingli launched a new generation of BIPV products including its “Glass-Overflow” series and external wall heat preservation + PV board. Chint presented its Telogy C&I rooftop BIPV solution. And Maxeon introduced the frameless Maxeon “Air” module which can be easily attached onto roofs – doing away with the need for conventional mounting structures.

Bigger inverters

Along with the jump in module power ratings inverter makers launched more high-power string inverters for 1500 V systems. The typical power level rose to 320 kW or more. MPPT currents rose to 45A or more to adopt the higher current from panels. GoodWe’s MPPT current rose further to 60A for its new inverter product GW225KN-HT.

Meanwhile to fulfill the requirement of incorporating storage in future PV plants most inverter producers attached technologies to their inverter to ensure they will be compatible with the coming PV+storage integration. Even module makers like Trina Solar and Jinko released their own solar+storage inverters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLWF1c3RyYWxpYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xOC9zdW5kYXktcmVhZC1zb2xhci1pbi1nYXphLXB2LXJlc2lsaWVuY2UtdW5kZXItZmlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunday read: Solar in Gaza PV resilience under fire,"From pv magazine 07/2021

A chronic electricity deficit within Gaza continues to have a negative impact on health water and sanitation services. Local communities as well as international organisations are reaching for solar power in the hope of building a more resilient future but the challenges are immense: closed borders damage to existing solar limited supplies and limited space. Nevertheless the need is undeniable.

“Electricity is critical to all our lives and we don’t realise it until we don’t have it. It is particularly the case in Gaza as households get as low as four to five hours of electricity per day” said Chitose Noguchi who currently works for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as the deputy special representative to the Palestinian people and the head of its office in Gaza. She describes the situation as representing an energy crisis.

“Basic services related to schools hospitals and water desalination and treatment all rely on electricity. Not having a stable supply makes it extremely difficult for people in Gaza to have a normal life and get access to the very basic needs” added Noguchi.

Solar in Gaza

The energy situation in the small coastal enclave populated mostly by Palestinian refugees drastically deteriorated after the recent escalation between the ruling Hamas organisation and the Israeli military. The deficit between energy supply and demand has grown further reaching a 75% shortfall and prompting Gaza Electricity Distribution Corp. to deliver only four hours of electricity at a time followed by 16 hours without power.

The company said that the ban on the entry of fuel triggered a decline in electricity produced by the only power plant in Gaza. This power plant has a current working capacity of 45 MW down from its original capacity of 140 MW as it has been bombed in the recent rounds of violence. Electricity shortages have been common for Gaza in the last decade although the situation had improved slightly over the past few years.

In light of the dysfunctional nature of the grid diesel generators have become the primary source of electricity leading to greater dependency on limited fuel supplies. However the aggregated supply from all sources remains far from meeting Gaza’s electricity needs.

In parallel solar energy is transforming Gaza’s energy system. The simplicity and modality of disturbed-generation PV systems allow for them to become the favourable solution to overcome power outages. Additionally the region has excellent solar resources with 320 days of sunshine per year on average making solar projects a worthy investment.

As early as 2013 hospitals in Gaza started to employ solar PV systems to secure their electricity supply. Solar systems are often coupled with hybrid battery storage or diesel generators in a hybrid way to provide electricity during the night. Systems connected to the grid under a net-metering scheme are in principle allowed by the Palestinian authorities. However further regulation is needed to ensure technical compatibility with utility networks.

In terms of numbers around 10 MW of solar PV systems are installed by aid agencies and another 10 MW are in the pipeline. A 7 MW project is also under implementation to install 21000 solar panels on the rooftops of factories and warehouses in Gaza’s industrial zone. Although many factors encourage the development of solar PV projects in Gaza political instability and the limited availability of uninhabited areas can hinder large-scale solar PV developments.

Educational struggles

Solar systems have thus far focused on delivering power for the critical services of health education and sanitation. Here the UNDP is engaged explained Noguchi. “In Gaza we have been focusing on providing support whether it’s standalone solar projects or whether it is incorporated into existing facilities” she said. “We have provided several solar systems to schools health facilities and wastewater treatment plants. In total UNDP has installed 2.5 MW of solar projects investing around $6 million.”

In particular the education system in Gaza is suffering from the electricity shortages. As schools often have to operate multiple shifts to accommodate all students many classes are being held in the early morning or in the evening hours when lighting is needed. Electricity is also needed to operate computers and labs.

Unfortunately some of the solar systems that UNDP has installed on schools have sustained damages in the recent Israeli attacks on Gaza. For instance in one newly installed solar system in a private school that serves 950 students 130 modules from a total of 170 were damaged. Six other systems installed on governmental schools went offline and require repair.

The borders of Gaza remain closed after the recent escalation but Noguchi hopes that soon it will again be possible to bring solar equipment into the region. The UNDP alone has many active solar projects in Gaza as well as in the West Bank of the occupied Palestinian territories cooperating with various donors and partners. Officials at the organisation highlight the need for more donor support and are seeking cooperation opportunities with suppliers and manufacturers of solar equipment.

Water issues

The water situation is no better. Scarce groundwater and supplies from Israel are the only sources of fresh water. Often households have to go for days without running water. Wastewater ends up in the ground or the sea as the treatment facilities are not sufficient. In recent weeks untreated water was pumped into the sea around Gaza during the escalation creating an environmental crisis.

It is hoped that a recently commissioned treatment plant will improve the situation. Funded by the German government the Gaza Central Treatment Plant was put into operation on April 28. The plant will allow the wastewater for around 1 million inhabitants to be reliably treated. Remarkably the plant is energy self-sufficient with its own solar system and biogas generator. The plant will probably also supply neighbouring communities with electricity thanks to excess generation. The UNDP is leading similar efforts to install solar panels at Khan Younis Waste Water Treatment Plant with the aim of reducing operational costs by 50%.

Health benefits

Solar electrification of the health system in Gaza has been found to have great potential as per a technical assessment conducted in 2019 by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in cooperation with international organisations. Hospitals and health facilities can achieve annual savings in electricity costs of $2.6 million by introducing solar PV systems combined with energy efficiency measures. The study notes that the daily energy demand projected to be met by the proposed solar systems will vary depending on the availability of physical space for array deployment. Such projects will make hospitals more resilient against power outages. This is currently critical given the increasing demand for cooling amid Covid-19 vaccination efforts.

Farmers are also benefiting from solar applications to protect agricultural production and improve their livelihoods. PV technology is an excellent alternative to operate irrigation wells and pumping systems. In one project supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation 16 irrigation wells and 51 water harvesting ponds were equipped with solar-powered pumping systems. The project succeeded in increasing the quantity of water extracted and thus the agricultural output by reducing the operating costs for farmers by 70%.

Female empowerment

Beyond the direct benefit of solar energy in providing affordable and clean electricity it is also creating new growth and employment opportunities in Gaza. With the 70% youth unemployment rate and the nearly 14-year blockade Gaza’s economy is in desperate need of revival.

UNRWA the Palestinian refugee agency is offering vocational training on solar that includes the installation and maintenance of PV systems. Trainees get their first hands-on experience in a solar energy laboratory and workshop equipped with sample equipment and measurement tools. The graduates are then granted apprenticeship employment opportunities at local companies.

This initiative funded by the German development agency GIZ aims to boost community awareness and adaptability while also promoting sustainable energy sources. Women are remarkably participating in this empowerment opportunity breaking barriers in a field dominated globally by men.

UNRWA reports one such success story Ghada Zaki who completed one of the training courses. The 20-year-old woman described her first days in the training program before she became one of the first female technicians to install operate and repair solar photovoltaic systems for a local company.

“At first our colleagues who were men were astonished that there were women in the program. They would question our ability to hold the drill and weld steel beams but we paid no mind” Zaki said. “The women supported each other until the camaraderie became infectious and our male colleagues evolved and began to support us as well.”

Some of those victories have been thrilling and downright heroic.

Here are Jackson's ""Top Five Wins"" as a starter:

5. Nov. 18 2018 M&T Bank Stadium Baltimore

Ravens 24 Cincinnati Bengals 21

Summary: The Jackson era officially began in Baltimore with an impressive performance against the Bengals in Week 11. The then-rookie quarterback produced 269 yards of total offense (150 passing 119 rushing) in the Ravens victory. Jackson then led the Ravens to wins in five of the next six games en route to a 10-6 finish and the AFC North championship.

4. Monday Dec. 14 2020 FirstEnergy Stadium Cleveland

Ravens 47 Cleveland Browns 42

Summary: The Ravens were facing a fourth-and-5 and trailing by one point with under two minutes left in a critical game against the Browns in Week 14. Jackson was already in the locker room with cramps and now his backup Trace McSorley was sprawled on the turf with a knee injury. Seconds later Jackson emerged and threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to Marquise Brown for a 42-35 lead with 1:51 left in the game. Jackson then set up Tucker's 55-yard field goal with seven seconds left for a 47-42 victory. It was voted as the Game of the Year by the NFL Network.

3. Oct. 20 2019 Seattle Seahawks CenturyLink Field Seattle

Ravens 30 Seattle Seahawks 17

Summary: Jackson ran for 116 yards and a touchdown and even inspired a play call in a hard-fought impressive win at Seattle. With 1:24 left in the third quarter and the game tied at 13 the Ravens faced a fourth-and-2 at the Seahawks’ 8-yard line. coach John Harbaugh then sent the field goal unit from the sideline. As he came off the field Jackson told the coach “Let’s go for it.” Harbaugh called a timeout and Jackson rewarded the decision to “go for it” with an 8-yard touchdown run through the right side of the line for a 20-13 lead. Jackson then directed a 13-play 86-yard 9-minute drive that ended with a K Justin Tucker 22-yard field goal.

2. Sunday Dec. 30 2018 M&T Bank Stadium Baltimore

Ravens 26 Cleveland Browns 24

Summary: The Ravens won the AFC North and ended a three-year playoff drought with a dramatic victory over the Browns in a game that wasn’t decided until 1:02 was left in the contest. That’s when Pro Bowl LB C.J. Mosley intercepted quarterback Baker Mayfield on a fourth-and-10 at the Baltimore 39-yard line. Jackson carried the ball 20 times for 90 yards with two touchdowns.

1. Jan. 10 2021 Nissan Stadium Nashville

Ravens 20 Tennessee Titans 13

Summary: Jackson quieted his small circle of critics running for 136 yards with a long touchdown to lead Baltimore past the Titans in the wild-card round of the AFC playoffs. It was the first postseason victory of Jackson's young career and earned him the game ball from Harbaugh. Jackson ran for 136 yards. He also completed 17 of 24 pass attempts for 179 yards with an interception. After the Ravens fell behind 10-0 in the first quarter Jackson tied the game with an electrifying 48-yard touchdown run.

Bars on Old World Third Street near the Milwaukee Bucks’ home at Fiserv Forum have been packed with customers even on days with no game set to take place.

Take Mader’s Restaurant. Fourth-generation owner Kristin Mader said the crowds have been strong on game nights. She said she expects that to continue into Game 6 and if it happens Game 7 of the series.

“I can’t even imagine how overwhelmed with joy the city is going to be” said Mader. “After COVID everything downtown has been coming raging back with great optimism and lots of attendance in the restaurants and bar scene.”

The economic impact however stretches far beyond the Deer District.

Claire Koenig the communications director for the city’s visitor bureau Visit Milwaukee said each Bucks home game during the playoffs has brought at least $3 million into the city’s economy not including the impact of events in the Deer District around the stadium.

“To go from fully closed to you know raking in the cash because there’s thousands of people trying to go to your business that is really good for them” said Koenig. “It is badly needed.”

Koenig said sports fans “are generally very good tourists.”

“They do not just come for one thing and then pack up and leave” said Koenig. “They’ll come they go to museums obviously they’re going to restaurants and bars but they’ll take the brewery tours too … It really does trickle down and that is great for a lot of people.”

Koenig said the morale boost the games have provided the city has also been much needed.

“I think you see a lot of people coming together just you know united with some Milwaukee pride but united by this incredible team as well and just their passion for the team” said Koenig. “It has just been amazing.”

Koenig said the Finals have even brought the city some international attention. She said it’s the kind of exposure money can’t buy. Travel Wisconsin has also taken advantage of the attention the NBA Finals have brought to the area with TV ads in other Midwest markets during each game.

As for the future Koenig said more events could be anchored in the Fiserv Forum’s plaza after the Bucks’ success.

“They just figured out how to activate this area probably better than anyone ever imagined they could” said Koenig. “What else could they bring down here to keep it lively and full of people year round?”

The Bucks bounced back from an early deficit and then survived a tight finish against the Phoenix Suns to earn a 123-119 victory in a pivotal Game 5 on Saturday night becoming the first road team to win in these NBA Finals.

Milwaukee will have a chance to claim its first NBA championship in 50 years in Game 6 of the best-of-seven series at Fiserv Forum at 8 p.m. Tuesday.

""I can't get too carried away"" Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo said. ""I have to stay in the present. I can't worry about the outcome.

""Obviously we know what the deal is. It's one game away from being an NBA champ being in the history of this game being always there. You know nobody can take that away from you. Doing it in front of our families and our fans it's big. It's going to be big.""

Antetokounmpo had 32 points on 14-for-23 shooting with nine rebounds and six assists. He was so dehydrated after the game that he left his media session to get treatment before he could answer questions. But Antetokounmpo wasn't going to get ahead of himself when asked about the magnitude of Game 6 at home.

""We've got to watch the clips and see what we did well what we didn't do well what can we do better"" he said. ""There's steps to it before the game.

""If we do all these things right and we are disciplined once the game starts and we play good basketball and we have the energy of the fans because we know they are going to be loud and we have an opportunity to win the NBA championship it's going to be amazing to do it in front of our fans. But there's more steps until we get there.""

The Bucks got a strong unified effort from all of their ""Big Three"" — Antetokounmpo Khris Middleton (29 points) and Jrue Holiday (27). Along with trusted role player Pat Connaughton they helped get the Bucks back into the game and then had answers every time Phoenix drew close and got the newly named Footprint Center rocking again.

""Makes everything more balanced and makes life easier for everybody"" Middleton said. ""Knowing that we play together and we have everybody clicking on all cylinders we're tough to guard.

""Obviously on defense we can click. We can switch and we know how to have each other's back. But when we are all playing well we're one of the best teams for sure.""

Box score:Bucks 123 Suns 119

It looked like the game could spiral out of control for the Bucks early. The Suns came out red hot making 12 of their first 15 shots. Holiday got into quick foul trouble.

Suns guard Devin Booker who has been a threat to the Bucks all series had his shooting stroke going early and had 10 points in the first quarter as Phoenix led 37-21. He finished with a game-high 40 points.

The Bucks kept chipping away putting together a 9-0 run early in the second quarter to get within 40-37. Milwaukee finally got back to even at 42-42 when Connaughton drained a three.

Milwaukee then grabbed the lead at 50-49 after Bobby Portis converted a three-point play and then sank a triple in the corner at the 5:46 mark.

Connaughton has been big for the Bucks as they've won three straight in the series. He had 11 points on Saturday giving him 33 over the three games. He's shot 8 for 17 on threes over that span.

""He doesn't need much"" Holiday said of Connaughton. ""He doesn't need the ball all the time. He knocks down open shots. He's gritty. He gets there into the paint and offensive rebounds big defensive rebounds and he's one of those role players that honestly is reliable one of the most reliable that we have on our team. Pat has been huge for us all year and he'll continue to do that.""

The Bucks went into halftime with a 64-61 advantage. Per ESPN Stats and Info the Bucks' 43 points in the second quarter are the most in a quarter of the Finals since the Cleveland Cavaliers scored 49 against the Warriors in 2017. The Bucks' total is also tied for the most in a Finals quarter for a road team.

Holiday shook off a 4-for-20 shooting in Game 4. Despite the early foul trouble he shot 8 for 11 in the first half and scored 17 points while handing out eight assists.

Much like Game 4 Middleton and Booker put on quite a midrange shooting exhibition especially early in the third quarter. Middleton had 11 points in the first five minutes of the quarter and Booker had 12.

The Bucks kept trying to pull away going up 108-94 in the fourth quarter when Holiday sank a left-handed layup with 9:08 to play.

But the Suns found some life after Mikal Bridges and Chris Paul knocked down back-to-back three-pointers to make it 108-100 at the 7:48 mark.

The Bucks always had answers.

After that foray from the Suns Antetokounmpo had a tough runner that bounced in off the glass.

When Booker scored on a fastbreak layup Antetokounmpo had another answer with a three-point play.

A three by Bridges and a fallaway jumper from Paul pushed the Suns back to within 113-107 with just over five minutes remaining. Middleton seemed to have quelled the run with a three-point play for a 117-110 lead.

The Suns still wouldn't go away getting a three from Paul and two free throws from Deandre Ayton.

A tough triple from Booker closed the Bucks' lead to 120-117 with 1:24 left getting the home crowd back to ear-splitting decibel levels. Antetokounmpo then missed two free throws and Paul knocked down a shot to close the gap to 120-119.

Then came the biggest sequence of the game.

Holiday missed a jumper but made up for it by stripping Booker and getting out on the fast break to feed Antetokounmpo for a dunk as he was fouled by Paul with 13.5 seconds left. Antetokounmpo missed the free throw but tapped the ball out to Middleton who was fouled.

Middleton made 1 of 2 free throws for the final margin after Booker and Paul missed shots in the closing seconds.

Bucks fans have adopted a mantra of ""Bucks in six."" Now the team can win a championship in six games in front of its home fans.

""We don't really care if it's Bucks in whatever we just want it to be Bucks right?"" Connaughton said. ""I think it's been great to rally the fan base. I think they have actually had it for a few years so it's been a cool thing to hear and see. But at the end of the day we go out there every single night trying to win trying to represent the city of Milwaukee to the best of our ability.

""We've got to do it again. The job's not done. It was a great win tonight. We had each other's backs and there was ebbs and flows to the game that I think really brought us together and showed us that we can fight through adversity. But we've still got one more.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtajQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9mYW5zLXdlbGNvbWUtaG9tZS10aGUtbWlsd2F1a2VlLWJ1Y2tzLWFzLXRoZXktZmx5LWludG8tbWl0Y2hlbGwtYWlycG9ydNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fans welcome the Milwaukee Bucks home one win away from championship,"MILWAUKEE — The Milwaukee Bucks are one game away from winning the NBA championship after a thrilling game Saturday night.

There were touring cars and roadsters a vintage police car and even a truck with a still in the back on exhibit for a car show that marked the start of the tour

Among those exhibiting vehicles was James Rogers of Asheville N.C. who displayed a 1921 Model T roadster that he had modified into a pickup truck.

""You couldn't get a pickup truck back in those days so if you wanted one you had to build your own truck bed"" he explained. ""This is how the common man got his pickup truck back in the day.""

Rogers built every part of the pickup bed at his shop.

The Fords are fun to drive he said and he has taken his vehicle to all parts of the United States.

Top speed for the vehicle is about 40 mph or 45 mph.

""I don't want to go much faster than that"" Rogers said. ""Sooner or later you've got to stop and it ain't got a lot of stop.""

Owning a Model T is a great way to meet people.

""You can't be bashful and shy with these cars because you're going to have somebody want to talk to you"" Rogers said. ""So that's what you do. You just stand and talk to people.""

Members of the Model T Ford Club International will be in the area through Friday. This week they will be traveling to many attractions in the area including the Dennison Railroad Depot Museum Midvale Speedway Roscoe Village in Coshocton Lehman's Hardware in Kidron Keim Lumber in Charm and the Hudson car collection in Beach City.

Tom Strickling of New Philadelphia who is serving as host for the event along with his wife Patti was pleased that the heavy rains of the past few days have ended and sunny weather is predicted for the coming days.

""I asked the radio station to stop saying it was going to rain and so it stopped raining"" he joked. ""That worked out good.""

Many of the cars are stored during the evenings at the Tuscarawas County Fairgrounds in Dover. The cars and their owners many traveling in recreational vehicles began arriving in the area on Friday.

Bruce Stauffer bought in a crew from Ragersville to park vehicles. They showed up with some Gators to transport people and the Ragersville Historical Society loaned a golf cart to haul people from the parking area to the grandstand Strickling said.

Dee Grossman executive director of the Tuscarawas County Convention & Visitors Bureau said the tour will have a big economic impact on the area.

""It's estimated that $500000 is being spent. I think that's low actually"" she said. ""Every single person out there is buying food.""

Some members of the club displayed early Ford vehicles.

Bruce Balough of North Canton brought a 1908 Model S and 1906 Model N. Both were built before the Model T rolled off the assembly line.

Balough has a close connection to the Model T. His grandfather Charles Balough was one of three men who helped design it.

Charles was a native of Austria-Hungary and became an engineer at age 19. In 1903 he and two friends came to America to visit the St. Louis World's Fair.

""By the time they got here they decided why should we go back? So they stayed in the U.S."" his grandson said.

After working for the Ford Motor Co. Charles moved to Canton where he started Hercules Motors.

Bruce Balough said he only drives his vehicles to special events.

""It's not really a road-worthy vehicle because there's too many people out on the road who don't pay attention"" he said.

One of his friends was driving a Model S Ford in Michigan. A teenager in another vehicle dropped his cellphone. He leaned down to retrieve his phone and hit the Model S head-on. It took awhile to rebuild the vintage car because parts are so hard to find Bruce said.

Tom Strickling said he is hopeful that everything will go well this week during the tour.

He offered his thanks to all who have helped things go smoothly including New Philadelphia Mayor Joel Day.

Area law enforcement officials have also been cooperative.

The Holmes County Sheriff's Office will be stopping traffic at one intersection for the tour as will the Tuscarawas County Sheriff's Office he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2NoaWNhZ28tYXV0by1zaG93LTIwMjEtZGF0ZXMtbWNjb3JtaWNrLXBsYWNlLXBhcmtpbmcvMTA4OTU0MzIv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3Y2hpY2Fnby5jb20vYW1wL2NoaWNhZ28tYXV0by1zaG93LTIwMjEtZGF0ZXMtbWNjb3JtaWNrLXBsYWNlLXBhcmtpbmcvMTA4OTU0MzIv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago Auto Show 2021 continues Sunday at McCormick Place with tickets available online,"Day two of the July auto show and we are blasting off into the weekend.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- It's day four of the Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place Sunday.

If you're in the market for a new car test-driving vehicles at the Chicago Auto Show is a great way to compare with no pressure to buy.

""They can come start here on Indiana Avenue go out to Michigan Ave and around but get a feel for the vehicles"" said Chicago Auto Show PR Manager Jennifer Morand. ""There's a product specialist that will be sitting next to you and they can help explain the technologies safety features and all of the benefits of the brand new vehicles.""

Dozens of vehicles are available to drive including the Ford Bronco Sport. And it's super simple to sign up!

""They can register inside at McCormick Place at the west building with the manufacturer so if they want to jump in an all-new Chevy for example the visit the Chevrolet display indoors they can. make a reservation and then when they're ready head outside and take that test drive"" Morand said.

David Sloan general manager of the Chicago Auto Show broke down how summer allowed the event to be both indoors and outdoors.

Keep in mind the test drive is not the same as the test track where professional drivers were in charge of the Bronco Wild Experience!

Built specifically for the show it takes you through water and side angle demonstrations to Bronco Mountain nearly 20 feet high with a 38-degree angle on the way down. Definitely one of the more popular attractions at the show!

You can feel first-hand the torque and acceleration of the brand new all electric Mustang Mach-E.

""We have taken our most important name plate ever and converted it into an electric vehicle. So people can get behind the wheel feel the instant torque zero to 60 in three and a half seconds and you get to do that right here in Chicago"" said Kristin Tassi with the Ford Motor Company.

Same goes for nearly every car on the floor. It's your chance to see and feel first-hand the next vehicle you want amid an unprecedented shortage of computer chips for cars and low dealer inventory.

""If you drive past a dealership right now you'll see that there lots aren't quite so filled. And so as a buyer not only are you not maybe able to find the exact car you want but you might have to pay a little bit more or closer to retail for the vehicle because of the shortage"" said Mark Bilek director of communications for the Chicago Auto Show.

That's why manufacturers said this show is an opportunity if you're looking for a new ride.

""Honestly car shopping is such a tactile experience. You want to get in the car you want to feel the seats you want to see the technology. You want to see if the seat adjusts if your family fits. That kind of thing"" said Becky Skiver a Nissan product specialist.

That's why Gaby Guillen came to the show for Friday.

""Now it's time to look for a car. What kind of car do I want to look at? Let me sit in it let me get a feel for it"" she said.

One highlight is a Ford truck that leaped out of a popular video game and into real life the F150 Rocket League truck.

Sunday and Monday are the last two days of the 2021 Chicago Auto Show said Kevin Keefe chairman of Chicago Automobile Trade Association.

""We have been partnering with Rocket League for awhile and we first brought the truck the F150 the F150 designers worked with the designers at Psyonix which is the publisher of Rocket League and we brought that into the game back in February and we have brought it from the game back into real life"" said Sarah Brewer Grand and Content Alliances.

There are also plenty of family-friendly vehicles on display including the 2022 Kia Carnival.

""What's really great about the inside of this minivan is that you have large captain's chairs"" Jennifer Newman of Cars.com. ""Lots of comfort really cushy head restraints.""

Automakers are experiencing a nationwide shortage in computer chips and dealers may be a little sparse on inventory so seeing your next new car *here* may be your only option.

Monster drifter as seen in Block’s Climbkhana and Gymkhana videos

LBI Limited a US-based car auction company is now listing a 1977 Ford F-150 with a price of $1.1 million. This isn’t just an ordinary old truck but a monster machine that was built by the famous rally driver Ken Block.

Ken Block’s Ford F-150 “Hoonitruck”

The F-150 Hoonitruck was built for Ken Block’s “Climbkhana Two” video which was viewed over 75 million times. In the video Block drove this Hoonitruck to climb the hills of “Heaven’s Gate” in China. Also the car won the “Best Dressed” award at Tokyo Auto Salon 2019.

Although the exterior retains the overall shape of a 1977 F-150 inside the hood stores a 3.5-liter V6 twin-turbo EcoBoost engine that comes straight from a Le Mans-spec Ford GT. The engine boasts 914 hp with 702 lb-ft of torque.

Not just the outstanding engine specs but also the gigantic intake manifolds and turbocharger sticking out from the hood is also something spectacular to see.

The body itself was turned into a tubular frame after the car was stripped down to get some repairs. It also comes with loads of one-off parts such as suspensions and forged wheels. Overall Block spent more than $1.5 million to build this monster.

LBI Limited offers this car as part of “The Ken Block Collection” on its website along with other Block’s Gymkhana machines such as the Ford Fiesta and Ford RS200.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2h5dW5kYWkvaW9uaXEtNS8zNTU1ODMvaW9uaXEtNS12cy12b2xrc3dhZ2VuLWlkNC12cy1mb3JkLW11c3RhbmctbWFjaC1l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ioniq 5 vs Volkswagen ID.4 vs Ford Mustang Mach-E,"What you see here is the future for three of the biggest car brands in Britain. Each of these all-electric models sits on a platform specifically designed for electrification and marks a significant step on the road to zero-emissions driving.

We’ve already spent time in the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4 but this our first go in a production version of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 – and our first chance to compare all three.

The Ioniq name will be familiar but the tech-packed 5 is a world away from the plain-looking hatchback that shares its tag. It’s a crossover through and through because it blends elements of hatchback and SUV styling – a lot like the Mustang.

We’ve already rated the Mach-E highly so it’s the model to beat here. It’s similar in some ways to the sports car of the same name but is wildly different in many others.

The VW ID.4 takes the formula of the ID.3 hatch and transfers it to an SUV layout and it wraps some very forward-thinking tech into a familiar VW style making it ideal for newcomers to the world of electric cars.

Here we’ll find out which of the three all-important new electric cars is the most convincing look into the future of motoring in the UK.

Ioniq 5

Model: Hyundai Ioniq 5 Price: £48145 Powertrain: 77kWh battery/twin motor 302bhp 0-62mph: 5.2 seconds Test economy: 3.4mi/kWh Annual road tax: £0

This is the top-spec Ioniq 5 Ultimate with the largest battery and four-wheel drive. It costs £48145 but in this test we’re putting list price to one side to some extent. All three cars are available in some form from £40000-£50000 and since we were limited on which cars were available for us to test our verdict will take that into account. The only option on this test car was ‘Gravity Gold’ paint at £685."

So I understand the desire to apply the same tech solutions that have made work and home more convenient more connected and safer to dog ownership. I’ve tried connected dog trackers with great enthusiasm. But after some testing I found them all lacking. Let me save you time and money by explaining where they went wrong and point you toward the products and training approaches that actually work.

What Are These Gadgets?

Whistle Fi and Halo all fall into a new category of product known as connected dog collars. Each one offers some degree of location or activity tracking—or in the case of Halo training and geofencing—while connecting to your smartphone through Bluetooth cellphone signal or WiFi. These aren’t the only connected dog collars on-sale right now but these three products are the most well known and together represent all technologies currently available in the space.

Whistle

Whistle currently offers two devices: an $80 motion-based fitness tracker and a $150 unit that adds live GPS tracking. Both are small unobtrusive and clip to your dog’s existing collar. Using the Whistle app you can define a perimeter around your yard and receive an alert if your dog leaves that area. In addition to tracking exercise intensity and duration Whistle’s motion sensors are equipped with algorithms designed to identify and alert you of problem behaviors like licking and scratching. Fitness tracking plans start at $5 per month; location tracking starts at $8.25. Battery life for the GPS tracker is said to be three days if the dog is away from your WiFi connection.

Fi

The $150 Fi Series 2 collar offers a very similar feature set to Whistle. It provides GPS location tracking and alerts if your dog leaves a designated area as well as activity tracking. Its main advantage appears to be battery life with up to three weeks of run time if your dog is away from WiFi signal (which I assume it will be on any walk). Fi’s monthly subscription starts at $7.50 per month.

Halo

By offering a shock-based training and geo-fence aid Halo promises substantially more function than Whistle or Fi. And for $1000-per-collar with a $2.70 monthly subscription fee it better. But Halo’s unique selling point is clear: with the tagline “The go-anywhere wireless fence” the brand says its product will contain your dog within custom areas you can define anywhere at home or away. Halo works with celebrity dog trainer Cesar Millan and runs owners through a mandatory 21-day training school on the app that teaches them how to humanely and productively apply shock training to their dogs. You need to recharge your Halo collar every night.

The First Problem: Cell Phone Reception

Take your dog for a walk around town and you’ll probably notice that the number of signal bars on your phone varies as you walk past tall buildings through heavily wooded areas or up and down hills. That’s because the UHF radio frequencies that your phone uses to communicate with a cell tower must travel in a straight line between source and receiver. In other words cell phone signal is line-of-sight—physical obstructions between your phone and a tower can block it.

The problem likely gets worse if you take your dog on a hike outside of town. While all of these devices are capable of receiving location information from GPS satellites they transmit that location to your phone using cellular phone networks. The potential for problems double because we’re talking about two devices here: the collar on your dog and the phone in your hand. The second either one of those loses its cell signal you lose the ability to track your dog.

This problem was evident testing Whistle back in Los Angeles where I used to live. My favorite spot to hike the dogs there was Runyon Canyon a mega-popular city park in the Hollywood Hills. There we found cellphone blackout areas at the bottom of the park’s canyons and the crowded trailhead on the park’s south side. Whistle wasn’t able to track dogs or communicate with my cell phone through parts of the most popular dog park in LA.

Bluetooth Is Patchy Too

Borrowed or rented a car lately? Shared a wireless speaker with your partner? We all know how challenging it can be to pair your phone with another device using Bluetooth maintain that connection as you leave and return to an area and share a device with multiple users.

Bluetooth-enabled devices transmit radio signals on the same frequency as other wireless gadgets like baby monitors and cordless phones—the same frequency emitted by microwaves and fluorescent lights. All of our homes and public spaces are packed full of devices that compete for that frequency or interfere with it. Smart collars also use Bluetooth to communicate with your phone when they’re in close proximity for functions like setting changes or in the case of Halo training inputs.

The first step to using any shock collar is to put it on your dog and begin testing to see what degree of shock is needed to elicit a response. As I’ve explored at length the humane use of shock in dog training relies on finding the minimum effective dose that works on your dog. The goal isn’t to hurt them; it’s to establish a clear and immediate communication cue. So new Halo in hand I fitted it to our middle dog Bowie used my paired phone to set the shock function to its lowest setting and began pushing the test button in the app to transmit shocks.

Or at least I thought I did. An athletic 75-pound husky-German shepherd mix Bowie is a tough little guy so I wasn’t surprised when I’d moved through the first half of shock intensity without seeing any sort of reaction. I kept turning the level up and pushing the button to fire the shock until I’d reached the maximum level. The app’s interface kept telling me it was working but Bowie was just sniffing around like usual unbothered. So I pushed the shock button a few more times. All of a sudden Bowie did a giant backflip while letting out an awful yelp. Turns out my phone hadn’t been communicating with the collar so the first shock he received was at one of the highest levels. I took his collar off and didn’t try it again until a couple weeks had passed.

Aside from trouble reliably transmitting training cues Bluetooth also suffers from a limited range (typically 30 feet or so not enough to cross my backyard) and generally unreliable connection. The technology throws a wrench in the ability of any of these products’ ability to provide consistent training cues or assured safety.

GPS Locations Can Be Imprecise

The Global Positioning System is a series of 24 satellites launched and controlled by the Department of Defense. Each of those satellites constantly transmits its location and the exact time. To determine its location the GPS receiver on your device looks at the signals transmitted by at least four of those satellites and compares the time it took those signals to arrive to calculate its position on earth in three dimensions.

Buildings trees terrain and other obstructions can block satellite transmissions. So while the best-case scenario accuracy level for any of these devices is seven feet or less that number can rapidly grow depending on your surroundings.

While simply tracking a dog temporary variances in location accuracy shouldn’t be a major problem. If your dog is 100 yards ahead of you on the trail it doesn’t really matter if your display is saying 99 or 110 yards. But variances in accuracy can cause issues when it comes to geo fencing.

Testing Whistle and Fi’s escape alert functions by having a friend leash up one of the dogs and walk them away from the house neither product proved able to reliably provide an alert of the dog’s “escape” until they were well away from the house. In some cases that alert came after they’d moved a couple blocks away across a couple of major roads.

In the case of Halo location accuracy problems proved more fundamental. I wanted to use it to contain the dogs within the yard of our cabin. Since it’s located near Glacier National Park there are large predators like grizzly bears and wolves in the immediate vicinity but the lake it’s located on also freezes over in the winter and that ice is often of dubious thickness. Keeping the dogs in the yard is a matter of life or death.

I tested Halo’s accuracy by holding two collars in my hand and moving around and off my cabin’s property. I was sometimes able to walk out onto the ice with no feedback from the collars whatsoever and up into the wooded hills on the other side again with no reaction from the collars. In other cases the collars would skip the audible warnings and move straight to applying shocks. Sometimes the shocks would come at the precise border I’d defined and other times those shocks would occur ten yards or more past that point.

Fitting the collar to Wiley our oldest and most strong-headed dog I noticed him receive a correction at the border of the property then continue his adventure onwards unchecked.

Given that the purpose of a shock collar is to provide consistent immediate clear training cues this is incredibly problematic. By failing to reliably alert my dogs of the border of the property they weren’t able to receive effective training to stay within it. And by applying shock unpredictably Halo created the risk of frightening the dogs and causing them to run further into danger.

I have since given the collars to friends who live on a ranch outside of town here in Montana. Their property is all grassland with an unobstructed view of the sky and covered in strong consistent cellphone signal. It’s not near any roads or other major dangers. In that best-case environment they have found that Halo is able to keep their small dogs from visiting the nearest neighbors several hundred yards away.

So What Works?

Despite the frustrations I ran into testing these collars I am successfully able to keep my dogs contained at home at the cabin or in camp and can even track them when they’re off-leash. Heck I even know how much exercise they get. Here’s how.

Dog Containment

To keep our dogs in the yard and off the busy street we live on here at home in Bozeman Montana I built a six-foot tall fence. The total cost? $5000. Or only $2000 more than the cost of three Halo collars. And that fence is 100 percent reliable—as long as my friends remember to shut the gate.

At the cabin I’ve installed a sort of aerial dog run by tensioning a strong rope at head height between two trees. Clipping the dogs’ leashes to that allows some small degree of outside activity and bathroom breaks. No matter how I hang it the dogs always find a way to get tangled but it is safe. No dog has gotten out on the ice or chased a moose yet.

In camp I just rely on the recall I’ve built into each dog with years of consistent positive reinforcement training. They’re a ways from being absolutely reliable with a simple call but I also choose to camp a long ways from other people so it’s not a huge issue.

Dog Tracking

I use a Garmin Astro 430 and T5 collars. The system isn’t cheap starting at $650 for the handheld device and a collar and $250 for each additional collar. And it’s not without its own problems: the interface isn’t very user friendly the handheld receiver runs on expensive lithium batteries that have to be fed every few hours of use and the collars use a proprietary charger that you have to buy a new collar to replace. But man this thing is reliable.

Unlike the collars mentioned above Garmin employs a radio transmitter (the big antennae you can see the my dogs wearing in the photo on top of this article) to transmit the location of each device back to the handheld receiver. That gives the Astro a nine-mile range between human and dog even in heavily wooded mountains. The collars are also made from the kind of robust materials—nickel-plated steel hardware polyurethane-coated nylon straps—that have stood up to all of the abuse our dogs can throw at them for two years with no signs of wear. While the big antennae might seem awkward our dogs have never gotten them stuck on anything and so far as I can tell don’t even notice they’re there.

Fitness Tracking

Each of the dogs got about ten miles of moderately-paced hiking in last Saturday. How do I know that? I clipped on their leashes put on my boots and took them on a ten-mile hike. I can tell how far we went by looking at a map and watching the terrain we cross. I can gauge how they’re doing by observing their body language. And I can determine if it was enough exercise by whether or not they fall asleep when we get home. I don’t need an app to tell me that stuff and neither do you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY2tldC1saW50LmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLXRyYWNrZXJzL3Jldmlld3Mvd2Fob28vMTU3NDA5LXdhaG9vLWVsZW1udC1yb2FtLXJldmlldy1jeWNsaW5nLWNvbXB1dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wahoo Elemnt Roam review: Marvellous mapping?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY2tldC1saW50LmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLXRyYWNrZXJzL3Jldmlld3Mvd2Fob28vMTU3NDA5LXdhaG9vLWVsZW1udC1yb2FtLXJldmlldy1jeWNsaW5nLWNvbXB1dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL29seW1waWMtZ2FtZXMtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS13cmVja2VkLW15LXRvdXItZGUtZnJhbmNlLXNheXMtZnVnbHNhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Olympic Games: Fuglsang believes his Tour de France was wrecked by Covid vaccine,"Olympic Games contender Jakob Fuglsang believes that his Tour de France was affected by his second COVID-19 vaccine and that he felt ‘limited’ during the three-week Grand Tour as a result of the inoculation.

The Dane came into the Tour leading Astana-Premier Tech and hoping to target stage wins and prepare for the Tokyo Olympic Games. In Japan he's aiming to go one better than he did five years ago in Rio where he won silver behind Greg Van Avermaet.

Speaking to Cyclingnews during the Tour the 36-year-old said that his Tour legs were badly affected by the side effects of his second COVID jab and that his pre-Tour form was quickly wiped out.

“My general feeling is okay. I don’t feel that bad but I can’t push myself to my limit” Fuglsang told Cyclingnews.

“I feel limited that I’m not able to push my body like I normally I can. That’s meant that I’ve not destroyed myself and I don’t feel as tired.”

Fuglsang finished third overall at the Tour de Suisse behind Richard Carapaz and Rigoberto Urán. Despite not aiming for the overall standings he was still expected to leave a mark on the Tour but heading into Paris for the final sprint stage he has yet to finish inside the top 20 on any stage with his best result coming on stage 1 when he was 21st behind Julian Alaphilippe. Since then he has worked for teammate Alexey Lutsenko but he rarely threatened in the mountain stages and should finish in 38th overall.

“The only explanation that we can find is that I had my second COVID vaccination after the Tour de Suisse and that it’s limiting me and my body is still working on it. I got my first shot after the Classics and I did tests at a Tenerife training camp and I had high lactate for my power and in Switzerland I was good"" he said.

""Then I got the second shot and a second test in the race showed the same results that I had in Tenerife that my numbers are basically where they are in December or even worse. That’s just how it is but at some point it will go away and that’s what we’re waiting for.

“In Suisse I was good so I’m just counting the days because hopefully I’m good for the Olympics. I just have to be patient and give my best. It’s been frustrating because things looked to be perfect before the race. In Suisse if you take away the time trials I was up there with Carapaz and Urán so I think without this problem I would be able to have gone for stages in the Tour. That’s just part of the game and I have to wait for everything to go back to normal.”

With the Tokyo road race a week away Fuglsang will be hoping to rediscover his best legs before it’s too late. He went to recon the route back in 2019 and with wins in Il Lombardia and Liège-Bastogne-Liège he certainly has the pedigree to challenge. He was also second in Rio five years ago and the tough course in Tokyo looks ideally suited to his nature as an aggressive rider.

“I went in October 2019 and I went to look at the parcours after I did the Saitama Criterium. I have an idea of what to expect and I think it’s harder than Rio. The climb that we have with about 35km to the finish that’s a proper climb and super steep. It’s for climbers. At Rio you could maybe survive a little better so Tokyo will be a harder race” he told Cyclingews.

“It would be a huge achievement and for sure the biggest one day win of my career. I know it’s going to be difficult and a huge fight but I hope that the right path is that I’m not 100 per cent for the Tour and then it turns around for the Olympics. Winning would be huge even if it’s a title that only lasts three years. Three years is still a lot better than no years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY2tldC1saW50LmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLXRyYWNrZXJzL3Jldmlld3MvMTU3NjMzLXNjb3NjaGUtcmh5dGhtLXBsdXMtMi1yZXZpZXctaGVhcnQtcmF0ZS1hcm1iYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scosche Rhythm+2.0 review: On the beat,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY2tldC1saW50LmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLXRyYWNrZXJzL3Jldmlld3MvMTU3NjMzLXNjb3NjaGUtcmh5dGhtLXBsdXMtMi1yZXZpZXctaGVhcnQtcmF0ZS1hcm1iYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWVzZ2FtZXNhbmR0ZWNoLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzE4L3Jldmlldy1nYXJtaW4tZGFzaC1jYW0tNjd3L9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWVzZ2FtZXNhbmR0ZWNoLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzE4L3Jldmlldy1nYXJtaW4tZGFzaC1jYW0tNjd3Lz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Garmin Dash Cam 67W,"- Advertisement -

The Garmin Drive App can make all the changes you want to your dash cam including uploading firmware updates viewing live footage checking your vault and more.







Final Thoughts

The first thing you notice is just how small the dash cam actually is. This isn’t a problem because the camera has a really great 180 degree field of view and can record up to 1440P at 60 fps – although you can reduce the quality if you want although given the cost of memory cards it seems odd to lower the quality when you really want the best you can get!

Setting up the dash cam was very simple – download the Garmin Drive app connect to the dash cam and follow the instructions. You can then make all the settings changes you wish update the firmware (which only took a few minutes) and even look at subscriptions for the vault.

Sticking the dash cam to your windscreen is fairly easy however once it’s stuck on it’s really stuck on! There is a magnetic stick on disc included in the box that I assume it supposed to stick to the windscreen then you clip the dash cam onto it for easy removal however every time I tried to use it the magnets actually pushed the dash cam out of position and it fell off. Either I was doing something wrong or it’s just not that great an option! Either way for a £200 dash cam Garmin could have included a suction mount in the box. You can buy one but thats another £11.99 plus postage!

The dash cam is powered using the extra long USB cable provided in the box along with cigarette lighter adaptor. This adaptor actually has two USB ports so you can also charge your phone at the same time instead of trying to decide between operating the dash cam and charging your phone.

The great thing about the 67W is you can just forget it’s there until you need it. It starts when you start the engine and turns itself off when you shut your engine down. It also can record if your car gets bumped when its parked – so no more instances of not knowing who hit your car!

The footage is stored on the SD card so you can put it into your computer and review it or you can review and upload any content you want via the Garmin Drive App. If you want to store footage in the online Garmin Vault then you will need to take out a subscription. This is the easiest option if you dont want to keep taking the card out of the 67W and then putting it back in.

One of the features of the 67W is the ability to control it with your voice. Just say “OK Garmin” or “OK Dash Cam” and tell it what you want.

The 67W will also warn you if it detects speed cameras not that you will be speeding of course but its a useful feature to have.

Using the 67W itself is fairly simple and basic – just use the app for everything and you can’t go wrong.

The new Garmin Dash Cam 67W is available now priced around £199.99 and for quality and features the 67W is a must have in your car – I know I won’t be going anywhere without it firmly in place.

It’s the first proper next-gen focused expansion so it comes with an updated engine and it’s confirmed for release this year. Even better a few fan favourite characters will be playable for the first time during the main story quest.

Warframe: The New War has been teased as far back as TennoCon 2018 with hints and cinematics building out of the series’ Old War. In the new story as revealed in the trailer below Earth’s Cetus fortress and the Corpus fleet lie in ruins after an attack by the Sentients – which players will have to fight together to defeat.

Exciting stuff for sure but while a lot of the story is under wraps Digital Extremes has confirmed that Corpus Engineer Veso Grineer Soldier Kahl-175 and Conclave master Teshin – who has personally been teasing the Sentients’ arrival for a while now – will all be playable during The New War’s main story quests.

Beyond the story the developer also confirmed numerous updates on the technical side. Alongside a graphical update to go with the PS5/Xbox Series X release Warframe will also add cross-progression across all platforms when The New War launches – even on mobile which is currently being developed. “Community is incredibly important to us and opening up cross-play and cross-save is just one of many more efforts we’ll take on to bring more players together” confirms chief operating officer Sheldon Carter.

Apart from the trailer above fans can also check out the full 30-minute demo of The New War right here. Apart from the expansion Nidus Prime was confirmed as the next Warframe coming this Summer and the part-Warframe part-Sentient Caliban is coming alongside The New War. Another piece of good news – the Epic exclusive Unreal Tournament weapon bundle is available again.

There’s no word yet on an exact release date for the expansion this year but expect it to be locked down in the next couple of months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIxL2p1bC8xNy9jb3ZpZC1taXNpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1jb25zcGlyYWN5LXRoZW9yaWVzLWNjZGgtcmVwb3J00gFiaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjEvanVsLzE3L2NvdmlkLW1pc2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLWNvbnNwaXJhY3ktdGhlb3JpZXMtY2NkaC1yZXBvcnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Majority of Covid misinformation came from 12 people report finds,"The vast majority of Covid-19 anti-vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories originated from just 12 people a report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) cited by the White House this week found.

CCDH a UK/US non-profit and non-governmental organization found in March that these 12 online personalities they dubbed the “disinformation dozen” have a combined following of 59 million people across multiple social media platforms with Facebook having the largest impact. CCDH analyzed 812000 Facebook posts and tweets and found 65% came from the disinformation dozen. Vivek Murthy US surgeon general and Joe Biden focused on misinformation around vaccines this week as a driving force of the virus spreading.

On Facebook alone the dozen are responsible for 73% of all anti-vaccine content though the vaccines have been deemed safe and effective by the US government and its regulatory agencies. And 95% of the Covid misinformation reported on these platforms were not removed.

Among the dozen are physicians that have embraced pseudoscience a bodybuilder a wellness blogger a religious zealot and most notably Robert F Kennedy Jr the nephew of John F Kennedy who has also linked vaccines to autism and 5G broadband cellular networks to the coronavirus pandemic.

Kennedy was since removed from Instagram which Facebook owns but not from Facebook itself.

“Facebook Google and Twitter have put policies into place to prevent the spread of vaccine misinformation; yet to date all have failed to satisfactorily enforce those policies” wrote CCDH’s CEO Imran Ahmed in the report. “All have been particularly ineffective at removing harmful and dangerous misinformation about coronavirus vaccines.”

Although platforms have since taken measures to remove many posts and even remove three of the 12 from one platform the CCDH is calling on Facebook and Instagram Twitter and YouTube to completely deplatform the disinformation dozen they believe are dangerous and instrumental in creating vaccine hesitancy at a crucial moment in the pandemic.

“Updated policies and statements hold little value unless they are strongly and consistently enforced” the report said. “With the vast majority of harmful content being spread by a select number of accounts removing those few most dangerous individuals and groups can significantly reduce the amount of disinformation being spread across platforms.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15cHVuZXB1bHNlLmNvbS9taWxsZW5uaWFsLW1vbXMtYW5kLWdlbi16LWNoaWxkcmVuLWFyZS1zdHJpa2luZy10aGUtYmFsYW5jZS1vZi1saWZlLWluLWEtcmlnaHQtd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millennial Moms and Gen Z children are striking the right balance of life,"Share This News

In the growing digital era kids are born with technology and great curiosity. Predominant dilemmas about the allowed screen time access to social media the replacement of language by new “Instagram” lingo  fueled by the unavailability of a guide on how to parent your child in the fast-paced digital era has made this subject quite a topic of debate.

Akanksha Dharmani for Pune Pulse interviewed two moms with their GenZ kids Adaah Somji and Ayat Gabrani. Read to know what they have to share.

We bet you will love how smart Gen Z is and how cool our Millennial Moms are by the end of the article.

Who are Millennial Mothers?

Women who were born between 1980 to 1993. Mothers to gen Z With the median age of 33 -year-old in 2021.

Millennials are popularly known as smart adaptive and revolutionary. Born with no technology to baby boomers or the helicopter mothers where the verb ‘Parenting’ barely existed to being full swing ‘Millennial mothers’ who practice Educated parenting like Holistic Living Gender-Neutral Parenting Learning Child Psychology Conscious Living and more.

Millennial motherhood is largely influenced by the internet. There are numerous books articles and social media influencers demonstrating Millennial parenting.

1) How is Millennial motherhood different from Baby Boomer motherhood ?

– “I believe the millennial generation is exactly like McDonald’s patty which is in the middle of normal flour bread (our parents ) and now vegan bread!! (Gen z) We are so stuck between parents of a traditional/ conservative background vs parenting Gen Z! It’s challenging and difficult to understand the perspective of Gen Z and to accept that it’s ok to have an opinion today which we as millennials were quietly denied to have. Being an Indian background of course.” said Dinaaz Gabrani.

2) What is your opinion on Screen Time?

– More often than not screen time is the biggest taboo and most mothers agree it should be Limited Screen Time and one must not make a big deal about it. A balance is always good.

Hear it from our MM “I believe in Green time more than Screen time. But in this lockdown we have been steered towards the screen as a natural way of life. Screen time is something you can’t live with and can’t live without. It’s tricky to say the least. But it’s important to maintain a healthy balance. An open conversation and reasoning with the child always help. I am all for nature and sunsets and getting down and dirty in the rains. And fortunately so is Adaah. She has learnt to balance it out and I have learnt to accept screen time as a part of living without making it a big deal” shared Dimple Somji.

“Moderation is the key screen time should be limited” agreed Dinaaz Gabrani.

3) Lingos as New language? / Five lingos you learnt from your Gen Z child? – We asked the mother to tell us 5 lingos they use most while having a conversation. ” Bae Fomo  Ootd and maybe once in a while I say You slay girl! to my daughter” shared Dinaaz Gabrani

” Woke Lit Gram Lol and Bro.” are 5 lingos added to my speech added Dimple Somji.

4) Is Gen Z more attention-seeking?

– In our former article ‘It’s Okay to not be Okay’ we covered the millennials and therapy. A need for Instant gratification was posed as a common issue in the current generation we asked the mothers if they feel the same and do the kids need more attention?

Both mother’s said that Gen Z gets the attention they deserve. Once they are heard they don’t see Gen Z asking for unnecessary attention! “Gen Z is more sorted as a generation more advanced and ready with a lot of life tools and skills.” also as Millennial mother’s we practice ‘Woke modern and aware parenting methods” leaving the kids feeling fulfilled.

The mothers commonly agree that “they didn’t get the attention they deserved while growing up.”

So clearly Gen Z is not attention-seeking because they are well heard by their Millennial Mommies.

5) Would you call your parenting Modern or Traditional or Modern Holistic?

– “Undoubtedly it is completely Holistic. I wouldn’t have it any other way. I have always believed that I am only here to provide guidance to Adaah. Not mother her. She is her own person and must bloom into her own self. She doesn’t have to become another me. She will follow her own path and dreams. She mediates and sends healing to the world at large chooses compassion over sympathy and appreciates little things with more value. I wouldn’t have it any other way ” shared Mommy Somji.

Dinaaz Gabrani said she likes to keep it the modern way but with appropriate balance.

While the moms shared their bit we also interviewed the Gen Z kids and got some insights on how do they feel about their Millennial Mothers.

– “I enjoy showing her the latest trends and pet videos. She is enthusiastic also joins me in creating Instagram reels ” shared our li’ll Youtuber and Yogi Adaah Somji 8-year-old.

“I feel like adults and kids think differently and maybe sometimes when I get a really good idea I’ll share it with my mom. If something had to go on her page I would let her decide. When I have a good idea and want it to go on my page I share everything and tell her to perfect it “shared little perfectionist Ayat Gabrani a 12-year-old.

Ayat has a separate Instagram ID that she operates the handle with her mother from her mom’s phone.

3) How many apps do you use? Which is your favourite? –

Adaah Somji uses 6 to 7 apps. “Instagram is my favourite. I operate from my mom’s account. I enjoy lillyketman IG handle on Instagram and on YouTube Alexa Rivera.”

“I use many gaming and editing apps. My most favourite app is Video Star.” taking up on her mother Ayat Gabrani likes to explore her creative side by editing on multiple apps

4) Screen time or playground time?- Both Gen Z kids instantly replied ‘Playground time’.

5) Do you like keeping up with trends/filters?

– Adaah Somji loves to keep up with the trends while Ayat Gabrani enjoys them mostly because of her best friend and her mom.

Ayat helps her mommy designer to keep up with trends by creating a lot of content for her.

To sum it up we see Millennial continue to be the revolutionary even as mothers and Gen Z feels totally well taken care of striking a perfect balance. Adapting and intelligently navigating the change only benefits all of us. True education is only uplifting and our internet MM’s are killing it!",,,,,,

Fleet replenishment oiler USNS John Lewis (T-AO 205) the Military Sealift Command’s newest ship was christened during a ceremony at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard in San Diego Calif. today.



The event was attended by the family of the ship’s namesake as well a bipartisan congressional delegation made up of 30 members including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Rep Maxine Waters Rep. Hakeem Jeffries Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee Rep. Jackie Speier and Rep. Nikema Williams Lewis’ successor. Other dignitaries included James Geurts – Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of the Navy; former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus; Vice Adm. Ross Myers Commander Fleet Cyber Command and Commander TENTH Fleet; Vice Adm. Roy Kitchener Commander Naval Surface Forces; Commander Naval Surface Force U.S. Pacific Fleet; Rear Adm. Michael Wettlaufer Commander Military Sealift Command; and actress and social activist Alfre Woodard Spencer the ship’s sponsor.



The ship honors Rep. John Lewis a long-serving member of the United States House of Representatives and civil rights activist. Lewis was known for his work as the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and as one of the organizers of the 1963 March on Washington. In 1965 Lewis led the first of three Selma to Montgomery marches across the Edmund Pettus Bridge known as Bloody Sunday state troopers and police attacked the marchers including Lewis.



Lewis served 17 terms as a Congressman as the dean of the Georgia congressional delegation Chief Deputy Whip Senior Chief Deputy Whip and on countless committees. Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his long service in government by then President Barack Obama in 2011.



“How perfect the motto of this ship; Unbreakable Perseverance” said Pelosi in her key note address. “Everyone who sees this ship will be reminded of John’s perseverance.” She went on to say “God truly blessed America with the dedication and leadership of John Lewis.”



The 746 foot Lewis is the first of the new John Lewis-class previously known as the TAO(X). This class of oilers has the ability to carry 162000 barrels of diesel ship fuel aviation fuel and dry stores cargo. The upgraded oiler is built with double hulls to protect against oil spills and strengthened cargo and ballast tanks and will be equipped with a basic self-defense capability including crew served weapons degaussing and Nixie Torpedo decoys and has space weight and power reservations for Close In Weapon Systems such as SeaRAMs and an Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System. The Lewis-class of oilers will replace the current Kaiser Class fleet replenishment oilers and they age out of the MSC fleet.



“As the global maritime environment is increasingly crowded and contested John Lewis will continue to support our National Security Strategy in building partnerships with our friends and allies and enable Naval forces to rapidly respond to crises deter adversaries and maintain forward presence to protect the homeland” said Wettlaufer. “USNS John Lewis with current and future ships that makeup our combat logistics force are absolutely fundamental to that mission as they provide fuel parts provisions and mail for Naval Forces around the globe.”



Six more Lewis-class oilers are on order for the Navy. In July 2016 US Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus that he would name the Lewis-class oilers after prominent civil rights activists and leaders including Harvey Milk Earl Warren Sojourner Truth Lucy Stone and Robert F. Kennedy.



Today’s ceremony marked the one year anniversary of Lewis’ death from pancreatic cancer.



“We miss John on this platform but we will never be without him” said Woodard Spencer. “May this ship inspire and free the spirit of those who serve on her and those of us on land!”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdnkubWlsL1ByZXNzLU9mZmljZS9OZXdzLVN0b3JpZXMvQXJ0aWNsZS8yNjk4MTkzL25hdnktY2hyaXN0ZW5zLXRoZS1maXJzdC1zaGlwLWluLXRoZS10LWFvLWZsZWV0LW9pbGVyLXByb2dyYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Navy Christens the First Ship in the T-AO Fleet Oiler Program,"Here's how you know

A key Fleet Marine Force modernization initiative the ARV Command Control Communications and Computers/Unmanned Aerial Systems will host a suite of C4 equipment sensors and operate both tethered and untethered UAS.

The ARV C4/UAS will employ an effective mix of reconnaissance surveillance target acquisition and C4 systems to sense and communicate. These systems will enable ARV to serve as the manned hub of a manned/unmanned team and deliver next-generation multi-domain mobile reconnaissance capabilities.

Program Manager Light Armored Vehicles located at the Detroit Arsenal Michigan manages the ARV effort. PM LAV falls within the portfolio of programs managed by the USMC Program Executive Officer Land Systems Quantico Virginia.

The period of performance for the agreements is 22 months with prototype delivery expected in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2023 and six months of government evaluation that will complete in the third quarter.

The Marine Corps is working to validate the ARV requirement to serve as a mobile-protected hub of manned capability with the C4 to effectively operate robotic autonomous systems-enabled teams through a competitive prototyping effort with multiple industry partners.

The effort gained momentum following an industry engagement held in

December 2020. PM LAV solicited proposals for prototypes through the consortium on March 30 2021. The Marine Corps received responses on May 3 and promptly began evaluations.

In parallel to competitive prototyping the Marine Corps is also pursuing an effort to define the trade space of a government off-the-shelf solution using the Amphibious Combat Vehicle. The data from the ARV competitive prototyping efforts and the ACV study will jointly inform a Marine Corps decision point in the fiscal year 2023.

In a ceremony in San Diego Calif. the Navy christened the future USNS John Lewis (T-AO-205) the first ship in the service’s new class of oilers.

“Leaders like Representative Lewis taught us that diversity of backgrounds and experiences help contribute to the strength of our nation. There is no doubt that the future Sailors aboard this ship will be galvanized by Lewis’ legacy” Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Harker said in a Pentagon news release.

Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) died last July after serving in Congress for more than 30 years. Today’s christening ceremony took place on the anniversary of his passing the Pentagon noted.

General Dynamics-National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) builds the oilers in its San Diego yard. The ships will fall under Military Sealift Command.

“The John Lewis-class ships are based on commercial design standards and will recapitalize the current T-AO 187-class fleet replenishment oilers to provide underway replenishment of fuel to U.S. Navy ships at sea. These ships are part of the Navy’s Combat Logistics Force” the Pentagon news release reads.

House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was the ceremony’s main speaker while several Navy officials – including U.S. 10th Fleet commander Vice Adm. Ross Myers Military Sealift Command chief Rear Adm. Michael Wettlaufer and James Geurts who is currently performing the duties of the undersecretary of the Navy and previously was the service’s acquisition chief – also spoke at the event according to the Defense Department release.

The USNS John Lewis first ship in a new class of Navy fleet oilers named for civil rights leaders was christened Saturday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and over two dozen members of Congress on hand.

Speakers at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard lauded the late John Lewis the son of sharecroppers who grew up in segregated rural Georgia went on to become a Freedom Rider fighting for voting rights and ultimately was elected to represent the Atlanta area in Congress.

Lewis died a year ago Saturday but was in San Diego in May 2019 to weld his initials into the keel plate as the vessel took shape at the shipyard in Barrio Logan.

“It’s fitting that we honor John Lewis with this formidable ship because John Lewis was a warrior” said Pelosi. “John’s great courage made him revered in the halls of Congress.”

She also praised former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus’ symbolism in naming the new ships after civil rights leaders including Harvey Milk Earl Warren Sojourner Truth Lucy Stone and Robert F. Kennedy because of their fundamental supporting role in the military.

Fleet oilers carry fuel parts and provisions to keep Navy warships operating far from bases for months in the Pacific Atlantic and Indian oceans.

The new class of 742-foot-long vessels displace 50000 tons. They’re nearly 100 feet longer and displace 20000 tons more than the previous Henry J. Kaiser class of oilers.

Alfre Woodard Spencer after the christening.

The ship’s sponsor actress and political activist Alfre Woodard Spencer said Lewis remains a powerful presence in America and in the embodiment of a vessel that is essential to the Navy.

“John Lewis stood for his country. He took blows for his country” she said. “We miss him on this platform but we will never be without him.”

Accompanied by Pelosi Spencer broke the bottle of Champaign on the ship’s hull proclaiming “For the United States of America I christen thee USNS John Lewis. May God bless this ship and all who sail in her.”

The ship’s motto is “unbreakable perseverance” a phrase from President Obama’s eulogy that Lewis was “a man of pure joy and unbreakable perseverance.”

Meeting with reporters after the christening Pelosi said she is fighting for passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act which would stop Republican-led efforts to restrict voting based on former President Trump’s false claims of election fraud.

“We’re not going to stop until we get the job done” she said adding that it would be appropriate to exempt this legislation from the filibuster and pass it with a simple majority in the Senate."

But a joint investigation published this week by the Guardian and Food and Water Watch showed how this choice is largely an illusion. In fact a handful of mega firms dominate every link of the food supply chain: from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to cereals and beers.

And that is not good news for consumers in terms of choice and real competition on prices or for small and medium-sized farmers given little choice on what they grow or which animals they raise while food industry workers face low pay and high risks.

The planet also loses out when industrial agriculture is focused on extracting maximum profits for minimum costs – an exploitative model with grave consequences for animal welfare water land and global heating.

“It’s a system designed to funnel money into the hands of corporate shareholders and executives while exploiting farmers and workers and deceiving consumers about choice abundance and efficiency” said Amanda Starbuck a policy analyst at Food & Water Watch.

Here are some of the key figures and charts from our deep analysis of sales data from thousands of supermarkets across the US:

1. Almost 80% of dozens of everyday grocery items are supplied by just a handful of companies

Our research started by identifying dozens of different key grocery types that Americans buy every day including different kinds of veggies fruits and grains prepared foods beverages and animal products.

We then studied the scanner sales data from thousands of US stores that is compiled by market research firms for these products.

And our analysis revealed that a shocking 79% of the groceries in a basket of 61 everyday types of food and drink are being sold by a small amount of the top companies which we defined to mean four firms or fewer.

It’s widely agreed that consumers farmers small food companies and the planet lose out if the top four firms control 40% or more of total sales.

2. PepsiCo has a huge grip on the market for dips with 88% of market share

Our analysis showed that the consolidation of the food system runs deep: four firms or fewer controlled at least 50% of the market for 79% of our 61 types of groceries. For almost a third of shopping items the top firms controlled at least 75% of the market share.

The market for dips is a good example.

PepsiCo controls 88% of the dip market as it owns five of the most popular brands including Tostitos Lay’s and Fritos.

Snacks and condiments – market share for top three or four companies

3. Ninety-three per cent of the sodas we drink are owned by just three companies

In the carbonated soft drinks category of our research the power of just three firms was overwhelming accounting for 92.9% of sales in our analysis.

Coca-Cola has 42.4% PepsiCo has 27.4% and Keurig Dr Pepper has 23.1%.

This kind of dominance is not good news if you are a smaller operator of a drinks company trying to get a toehold in the market.

Across all types of food and drink the big firms are helped by so-called category captains in stores who represent leading brands or manufacturers and work with major retailers to decide which products get prominent spots on our supermarket shelves. This makes it very hard for new independent brands to get a break.

When they do get a tiny foothold it rarely lasts. Take craft beers a booming market thanks to hipsters and old-school beer enthusiasts which is why new brands are quickly acquired by mega breweries. It’s not clear from the labels but the Belgian beer giant Anheuser-Busch owns more than 600 brands including mainstream favorites like Budweiser and Beck’s.

Beverages – market share for top three or four companies

4. Just three firms dominate sales of 73% of the breakfast cereals we eat – despite shelves stacked with different boxes

We have all stood in front of a wall of cereal boxes in a supermarket and felt dizzy at the options. But really there is far less choice than you might think when you are deciding what cereal to have for breakfast.

Our research showed three firms dominate: General Mills with 27.9% market share Kellogg Company with 26.8% and Post Holdings with 18.1%.

5. More than 80% of beef processing and 70% of pork processing is controlled by four multinational giants

A spate of mega-mergers means that meatpacking plants are now controlled by just a handful of multinationals including Tyson JBS Cargill and Smithfield (now owned by the Chinese multinational WH Group).

Forty years ago only a third of the beef and pork processing industry was controlled by the top four firms.

But after a spate of mega mergers 80% of beef processing and 70% of pork processing is controlled by four multinational giants. In 2017 these top firms had a combined revenue of $207bn.

Portion of meat market controlled by the Top 4 companies

Meanwhile farmers and consumers lost out. In the last 40 years these huge corporations have been paying farmers less and less for beef and selling it to consumers at increasing prices.

How much farmers are paid for beef and how much distributors sell it for

Pork prices have stayed steady for consumers but farmers have been getting paid less and less.

How much farmers are paid for pork and how much distributors sell it for

So what can be done?

Last week Joe Biden signed an executive order to tackle the rampant concentration across the US economy – including food and farming. Biden called on government agencies to enforce existing anti-trust laws and consider rolling back recent mega-mergers which boosted profits and power for a handful of corporations while hurting the rest of us. The order specifically directs the USDA to take swift action to protect farmers including by making it easier for them to sue meat processors for alleged abuses.

But the problems in the current system run deep.

“From farm to fork America’s food system has been rooted in the exploitation of women Native Americans and people of color. This is at the heart of capitalist food politics – big corporations taking as much as they can and paying as little as possible for it” said Raj Patel an academic and the author of Stuffed and Starved: Markets Power and the Hidden Battle for the World’s Food System.

In addition to executive actions which could be overturned by the next president such deep-rooted injustices need sweeping reforms by Congress. But bills banning new mega-mergers and factory farms currently lack bipartisan support despite public opinion supporting them.

It’s time to support small-scale regenerative farmers regional food hubs and grocery co-ops according to Starbuck the policy analyst at Food & Water Watch. “Alternatives already exist. We just need to boost public funding and resources to help sustainable affordable more equitable food systems take root.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc3RydWN0b2lkLmNvbS9ieS10aGUtd2F5c2lkZS1jaGV4LXF1ZXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chex Quest is the best thing to ever be put into a cereal box,"Chex Quest is a nutritious part of this balanced breakfast

Recommended Videos

Breakfast cereal marketing is a brutal battleground. At least it was in the ‘90s when I’d wake up to watch my Saturday Morning ads briefly interrupted by cartoons. The commercials themselves often depicted violent acts of robbery and betrayal as well as straight-up prejudice against adults leprechauns and lagomorphs. We watched heartbreak televised every morning.

It was a lot of childhood seduction. This competition to try and lure children to a particular concoction of fortified grains and sugar. The most entertaining characters the slogans that burrowed the furthest into our grey matter the concept of having fun at breakfast. Cookies for breakfast? Reese for Breakfast!?

Then there were prizes and while they were normally very lame during my childhood that all changed in 1996 when someone at Ralston got a genius idea: video games in cereal.

Imagine it: mom or dad comes home with the groceries you check what cereal she got and there it is: Chex Quest. This wasn’t some box-top that you had to mail in it was a CD! In the box of Chex!

I never ate Chex. To this day I’m not sure if I have ever tried Chex but when those commercials for Chex Quest hit I needed a box. My mom didn’t fall for it though. That’s fair I guess because I really only wanted the game so she might have been throwing out a perfectly good box of cereal.

The point is it worked. I was obsessed with Doom in my pre-adolescent days and this game looked sort of like it. There’s no wonder; it was a total conversion featuring five levels. The whole thing was dressed up to be family-friendly. None of the weapons resembled actual guns though their usage was directly pulled from Doom. You didn’t kill enemies you “zorched” them back to their own dimension. It largely still plays like Doom just with the difficulty dialed back a bit.

The story involves a race of snack-eating monsters called Flemoids invading some sort of space laboratory. You’re the Chex Warrior who must use their zorchers and a well-balanced breakfast to send the Flemoids back to their own dimension.

I feel like Chex Quest is a bit of a breath of fresh air compared to Doom. Don’t get me wrong I love that ray-casted demon-busting FPS with all my heart but I was never a fan of its aesthetic. The levels were very abstract just a bunch of corridors and open spaces with grimy wallpaper. Sure you were in a lab built on Phobos but it didn’t look that way at all. You could have told me it was the stockroom of a 7-Eleven and I’d have said “yeah that makes sense.”

Chex Quest not only delivers a blast of color it also has context for its levels. A spaceport a lab an arboretum. Despite the fact that the premise of fighting snack fiends on a distant planet is ridiculous it added a level of believability to it that wasn’t present in Doom. Whether or not the level design is comparable is a bit more debatable but for the purpose of appearance I’m not complaining.

Five levels don’t last very long even if you crank up the difficulty. But it was free! In 1997 the same marketing company Digital Café put out a second episode free to download from the Chex website. This one takes place in Chextropolis which allows for some interesting city levels that once again aren’t as abstract as what you’d find in Doom II (that was supposed to be Earth?) Apparently when it was first released the second episode’s level design was butt but it was revised when the third episode was released.

Yep there was a third episode it just arrived a bit late. The Chex Quest promotion technically ended not long after the release of the second episode which I presume had something to do with General Mills buying up the product line in ‘97. Nonetheless the developer reunited and released a third episode in 2008 as a gift to the passionate fanbase.

This one was set 10 years after the second episode. Planet Ralston gets invaded by the Flemoids and its up to Chex Warrior to save the day yet again. It feels pretty true to the previous episodes but seems a bit more spiffy. This is probably because it was built in the ZDoom sourceport.

Don’t let me oversell Chex Quest’s gameplay. It’s a shadow of Doom but it’s still weird fun. It’s not as ambitious as something like Strife but it was also made as a cereal box prize. With that in mind it’s a lot better than it has any right to be. It’s obvious the people developing it had aimed higher than “good enough for cereal” and made something that’s actually fun.

This was also only the beginning of a trend of putting PC games on cereal boxes. Out of curiosity I hauled my old CD wallet out and found a trove of the Cereal Box games. Clue Scrabble Life; maybe not very exciting but it progressed to games like Monopoly Tycoon and I’m pretty sure you could get Roller Coaster Tycoon and Age of Empires for a time. It faded out but around the turn of the millennium you couldn’t walk down the cereal aisle without seeing these things plastered to the front of boxes.

I didn’t actually play Chex Quest until my Doom-obsessed college days. I was cramming WADs onto my USB drive to play in between classes and if it wasn’t The Battle for Helms Deep or Ghostbusters Doom II it was Chex Quest.

While the third episode was considered “unofficial” originally General Mills relaunched it in an official capacity. It’s the easiest way to play it now but you can also take the WAD files and load them into GZDoom or as the community likes to do Brutal Doom. However you play it it’s worth the afternoon it takes to blaze through the episodes.

An HD remake was released in 2020 with the permission of General Mills called predictably Chex Quest HD. Like the original this one is free and consists of five levels. Built on Unreal Engine 4 it certainly looks the part but it’s maybe a bit less exciting than its 1996 counterpart. It still gets updated and now there’s a co-op multiplayer mode so that’s nice. Still you can’t argue with free and it’s a nice homage if nothing else. Something’s missing though. It feels like it needs to be printed on a DVD and stuffed into a box of cereal.

Now GM Authority has learned that the 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Limited LT Trail Boss will also offer an optional diesel engine.

Previously the 2021 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT Trail Boss was equipped with either the naturally aspirated 5.3L V8 L84 as standard or the naturally aspirated 6.2L V8 L87 as optional. Now the 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Limited LT Trail Boss adds the 3.0L I6 LM2 turbodiesel Duramax to the trim’s engine lineup.

Under the hood of the 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Limited LT Trail Boss the 3.0L I6 LM2 turbodiesel Duramax will mate to a 10-speed automatic transmission.

As a reminder the 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Limited carries over several aspects of the 2021 Chevy Silverado into the 2022 model year ushering in the new model year prior to the arrival of the refreshed 2022 Chevy Silverado the latter of which has been delayed due to issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The fully refreshed 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 will introduce new exterior styling and a completely overhauled cabin space as well as the inclusion of the new Global B electronic architecture which will enable the Silverado to offer the very latest tech features including GM’s Super Cruise semi-autonomous driver assist system.

However prior to the arrival of the 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 the 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Limited will bridge the gap from the 2021 model year offering the same trim levels exterior colors and interior colors. Order books open July 15th while production of the 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Limited will kick off at the GM Silao plant in Mexico on September 20th 2021 and the GM Fort Wayne Assembly plant in Indiana on September 27th 2021.

The debut marks another step forward in the money-losing startup’s ambitions in the sector of urban air mobility (UAM) a fairly new concept for short-distance transport.

The background: The sector though fledgling has become increasingly competitive attracting hefty investments from carmakers around the world including the U.S.’ General Motors Co. Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. Germany’s Daimler AG as well as China’s Geely Auto and EHang Holdings Ltd.

Morgan Stanley expects the global UAM market to grow to $1 trillion by 2040. However a host of regulatory factors may impede its development the investment bank said in a May 6 research report.

The core of UAM lies in making a profitable business out of flying cars which are actually just aircraft that employ electric vertical takeoff and landing a technology also known as eVTOL.

The details: The latest version of XPeng’s flying car the Kiwigogo X2 is a two-seater that can fly for up to 35 minutes according to a press release by its developer XPeng Heitech a company majority-owned by XPeng and its chairman He Xiaopeng.

The aircraft is designed to fly between 300 meters and 500 meters high in the air with a top speed of 130 kph according to the release which gave no timetable for when the vehicle might go into mass production or make it to market.

XPeng went public in the U.S. in August 2020 and completed a dual-primary listing in Hong Kong earlier this month. One of its major shareholders is billionaire Jack Ma’s e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The carmaker reported a net loss of $419 million last year narrowing from $535 million in 2019.

Now GM Authority is imagining what a 2021 Chevy Tahoe SS four-door model could look like with the following exclusive rendering.

As some fans may remember we’ve already rendered a 2021 Chevy Tahoe SS two-door model unveiling our creation in January of 2020. Now we’re back at it with this exclusive four-door model variant.

For the moment rumor has it a high-performance Tahoe a.k.a. Tahoe SS has been under consideration. Evidence comes by way of the potential prototype model spotted in June which was so quick we could only grab a single photo of it. What’s more the prototype was abnormally loud suggesting it’s got more than a few extra ponies corralled under the hood.

If GM does end up giving the Chevy Tahoe SS a green light we expect it to come to the party with roughly 650 horsepower courtesy of the supercharged 6.2L V8 LT4 gasoline engine. For those that don’t know the LT4 is the same high-powered motor found in the Chevy Camaro ZL1 third-generation Cadillac CTS-V C7 Corvette Z06 and Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing.

Additionally the Chevy Tahoe SS model would likely feature a lowered stance with high-performance Magnetic Ride Control and Adaptive Air Ride suspension complemented by wider aluminum wheels and sticky performance rubber.

Four-wheel drive would be standard while a selection of exterior styling enhancements would help onlookers identify the Tahoe SS as the go-faster performer of the SUV nameplate’s lineup. We would also expect some additional aero and cooling to round it out.

Of course none of this matters if no one wants to buy it. So we want to know – should General Motors build a new Chevy Tahoe SS model?

In the study lenacapavir was taken as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection in the belly.

Background

Lenacapavir being developed by Gilead Sciences is a capsid inhibitor. The capsid is the ‘container’ for HIV’s RNA (genetic material) that is a distinguishing mark of the virus appearing in microphotographs as a dark cone-shaped core. Lenacapavir both inhibits the virus from unsheathing its capsid to release its genetic material (now transcribed into DNA) into the cell’s nucleus and from assembling new capsids as it tries to reproduce.

Professor Jean-Michel Molina talks about the study on lenacapavir for multidrug-resistant HIV at IAS 2021.

Its remarkable longevity in the body was first presented to conferences in 2019 when it still only had the investigatory name of GS-6207. At this year's Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in March the first results were announced from the CAPELLA study which is investigating the safety and efficacy of lenacapavir in a group of highly treatment-experienced people with extensively drug-resistant HIV whose current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens were failing. This found that during the initial two weeks of the study 88% of participants receiving lenacapavir experienced at least a 0.5 log (more than threefold) drop in their viral load compared with just 17% of those given a placebo.

The CAPELLA study – six-month results

This week Professor Jean-Michel Molina of Hôpital Saint-Louis in Paris presented results from the first six months of CAPELLA – of efficacy in the group of participants randomised initially to receive either lenacapavir or a placebo and of safety in all study participants.

Glossary efficacy How well something works (in a research study). See also ‘effectiveness’. placebo A pill or liquid which looks and tastes exactly like a real drug but contains no active substance. open-label A clinical trial where both the researcher and participants know who is taking the experimental treatment. integrase inhibitors (INI INSTI) A class of antiretroviral drugs. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) block integrase which is an HIV enzyme that the virus uses to insert its genetic material into a cell that it has infected. Blocking integrase prevents HIV from replicating. monotherapy Taking a drug on its own rather than in combination with other drugs.

CAPELLA is not a placebo-controlled study in which some people never receive the investigatory drug; because it involves people who have few other treatment options everyone ends up receiving subcutaneous lenacapavir for a year (i.e. three doses at beginning middle and end) although some wait longer to receive it.

To join the study at the time of screening people had to have a viral load over 400 copies/ml while on ART HIV resistant to at least two drugs from three out of the four commonly used drug classes (nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors protease inhibitors and integrase inhibitors – NRTIs NNRTIs PIs and INSTIs) and no more than two fully active agents from any of those four classes.

Altogether 72 people were enrolled in the study. After they were enrolled they were screened a second time. If their viral load had declined to below 400 or by more than 0.5 logs since their first screen then they were put straight into a non-randomised group in which they received open-label lenacapavir plus the best combination of other drugs including other investigatory ones that could be devised given their resistance profile (a so-called optimised background regimen or OBR). There were 36 people in this group.

If their viral load had not declined since screening then they went into a randomised group. In this people received either oral lenacapavir or a placebo for two weeks – in other words they were receiving “functional monotherapy” as all other drugs in their regimen were failing. This was in order the gauge the separate contribution of lenacapavir to reducing their viral load – as was reported in March. After this two-week period of oral lenacapavir (a pill each on days one and two and one more on day eight) this group of 24 had their first lenacapavir injection as well as an OBR.

The other 12 randomised participants had placebo pills for two weeks then lenacapavir pills for two more weeks plus an OBR then the injections.

In the study as a whole the participants’ average age was 52 and 25% were women. More Black people (46% versus 31%) and Hispanic people (28% versus 14%) were in the randomised part than in the open-label group.

Participants had on average had HIV for 24 years. At screening half had a viral load over 32000 and half had a CD4 count below 150 (lowest: 3). Resistance to at least two drugs in the NRTI and NNRTI classes was almost universal and 81% and 69% respectively had resistance to at least two drugs in the PI and INSTI classes.

Efficacy results

The efficacy results presented by Professor Molina cover the first 26 weeks of the study – the halfway point just after people had received their second lenacapavir injection. Efficacy results from the open-label arm were not presented as some people had not yet reached this point.

In this randomised group by week 26 81% had viral loads below 50 and 89% below 400. This is despite the fact that in more than half of these 36 participants researchers were unable to construct an OBR that had more than one active drug in it. Six people had no active drug in their OBR but nonetheless four of them achieved an undetectable viral load (i.e. 67% efficacy in participants on what was essentially lenacapavir monotherapy).

The eleven participants who did not have a viral load below 400 by week 26 were given resistance tests. Four had developed resistance mutations to lenacapavir but three of those whose viral load had initially been suppressed but then rebounded achieved viral suppression again two without any change in their OBR (all remained on lenacapavir). One participant who had no active drugs in their OBR never achieved viral suppression though their viral load did fall fiftyfold.

The average CD4 count in this randomised group rose from 143 at baseline to 224 six months later and the proportion with CD4 counts below 50 fell from 22% to zero.

There were no serious drug-related adverse events seen. A number of participants had injection site reactions such as redness swelling and pain but most of these had resolved within two weeks. However 18% of participants had longer-lasting nodules or small lumps under the skin at the injection site and 11% had induration or hardening of the tissue there. These lasted 22 weeks and 10 weeks on average respectively.

Lenacapavir is also being studied for use in patients new to treatment: early results from this study will be reported to IAS later this week.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1/ @Wise Q2 Mission Update is here. Our team is 2600 people now. How much progress did we make towards money without borders with Wise Transfer Wise Account Wise Business and Wise Platform? The ups downs and sideways moves in the last three months 👇 pic.twitter.com/ho5hRqb8WO — Kristo Käärmann (@kaarmann) July 16 2021

Kristo recently shared Wise‘s Q2 Mission Update.

He reveals that the Fintech which recently completed a direct listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on its Main Market has grown to 2600 professionals now.

Kristo also revealed how much progress they actually made towards money without borders with Wise Transfer Wise Account Wise Business and Wise Platform. He shared the ups downs and “sideways moves” during the past 3 months.

Kristo also mentioned that they managed to “push the fees down.” He confirmed that 830000 customers and 19 currencies saw “transfer fees go down on Wise – bringing the overall average to 0.67%.” He added that the “light at the end of the Mission Zero tunnel is shining a tiny bit brighter.”

He further noted that this drop came down to three main things:

Reducing the cost of local integrations in 🇸🇪🇳🇴🇺🇸

Building new partnerships in 🇮🇳🇧🇷

Improving how we manage money all over the world

For instance transfers to Japan got significantly more affordable as global Fintech Wise created a cheaper setup in Japan in order to hold Japanese Yen (JPY). Sending 5000 Euros to Japan “used to cost €32.06 and we brought it down to €26.43” he revealed.

Kristo added:

“Same level of instant yet slow transfers got faster. Every transfer should be instant. But in Q2 the share of payments reaching your recipient in under 20 seconds stayed at the same level as in Q1 – at 38%.”

He continued:

“While we enabled instant transfers in Malaysia and for instant banks in Australia we also faced some challenges. We weren’t prepared enough for bank closures during Ramadan which led to transfer delays.”

Kristo further noted that the speed of support is improving as well however they are not quite there yet. He also shared that 69% of queries were answered “on time” which means “15 sec for phone calls 60 sec for chats [and] 15 hrs for emails.” He confirmed that during the previous quarter they “only got to 63% on time.”

He also mentioned that the Wise account is now “smoother for good guys and harder for baddies.”

He revealed:

“We’re twice as fast at catching the bad guys trying to use Wise and 40% more accurate in identifying them. We now also identify when you’re balance is low and remind you to top it up.”

Kristo further noted that account numbers experience “got an upgrade with 10% more customers receiving into their new account within 7 days.” He added that they introduced “some sweet new features too: direct debits on Canadian accounts and over 1000000 of you opted in to receive money with just an email.”

He also mentioned that Indian residents can “finally send money to 40+ countries at the real exchange rate and with even lower and transparent fees.” And until July 31st they are donating the fees from INR transfers “to Covid-19 relief efforts in India.”

He further revealed:

“We launched transfers to Fiji! (i’ve never been) Increased transfer limits for sending to China. More banks keep bringing Wise to their own customers in their apps. We launched in Shinhan Bank in South Korea Fortu in United States YAPEAL in Switzerland as well as Temenos and Thought Machine; and expanded integrations with EQ Bank in Canada and Deskera.”

He also noted that it’s now just banks Wise is in Google Pay now as well.

He pointed out that £150 billion is the amount people all over the world “still pay unknowingly in hidden fees (every year).” Kristo also mentioned they need assistance. They are looking for another 198 people – makers designers operators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzE4OTYwMjEvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saudi largest fintech firm appoints Nick Ogden to its board,"RIYADH: Geidea the largest financial technology (fintech) company in Saudi Arabia by market share said that industry heavyweight Nick Ogden had joined its board of directors.

A Somerville woman was remembered by loved ones Sunday for her devotion to dance and dedication to family just a day after she was killed while aboard a boat that crashed and sank in Boston Harbor.

Jeanica Julce 27-year-old woman from Somerville was killed early Saturday morning in Boston Harbor after the boat she and seven others were aboard struck a navigational marker and sank in the waters off Castle Island.

“She was full of life” Ceus said. “She’s going to be missed by her entire family in Boston and Georgia and across the country. We’re in shock nobody can really take this right now.”

Julce was also working to open a dance school to help give back to her community said her friend Tyrone Kevin Perry. Friends are planning a vigil for Julce to be held Thursday at the Unknown Hype Dance Company on Morton Street in Mattapan he said.

“There was something about bettering somebody and enhancing somebody that fulfilled her” Perry said.

Officials continued their investigation Sunday into Julce’s death which occurred after the boat carrying her and seven others struck a navigational marker off Castle Island around 3 a.m. Saturday.

The other seven boaters were rescued and five of them were sent to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries investigators have said.

Julce’s death is under investigation by the Suffolk district attorney’s office and Boston police’s homicide unit according to standard procedure Boston Police Sergeant Detective John Boyle said Saturday.

Suffolk district attorney spokeswoman Renee Algarin asked in a statement Sunday that people with information about the case contact Boston police homicide detectives at 617-343-4470.

“Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the woman who has died as they begin the first steps of their journey toward healing” Algarin said.

Algarin and Boyle declined to release further details about the investigation Sunday.

Saturday’s crash has shaken Julce’s loved ones who are grappling with losing her. According to a fund-raiser set up to cover the cost of her funeral Julce was “loved by so many people.”

Julce was majoring in finance at the University of Massachusetts Boston according to the GoFundMe page.

“Her happy vibrant loving energy was hard to miss. Jeanica loved to love others and made [it] her mission to put a smile on everyone’s face. Jeanica loved to dance she [danced] her way into everyone’s heart” according to the website. “Her smile lit up the room.”

Ceus 41 a cousin from Snellville Ga. said Julce was close with her proud father who would often post photos of his daughter on Facebook.

“He was always showing her off” Ceus said. “She was definitely daddy’s little girl. She had four older siblings and she was the baby.

“Of course he loved his other kids but he loved that little girl” Ceus said.

Ceus said the family will hold a service possibly in a couple of weeks to allow family members to travel.

And he said they’re hoping for more answers about the boat crash.

“She was out there with her friends doing this after-party they were just trying to enjoy themselves” he said. “I heard the boat flipped over and she hit her head but we don’t really know what’s going on.”

He did not elaborate on what kind of “after party” she might have been at.

Perry and Julce met in 2019 while performing together at the Strand Theatre. After the performing arts was disrupted by the pandemic Julce asked Perry to help her train in private dance lessons.

“She felt successful each and every time she was able to progress beyond something that was difficult for her” Perry said. “But there was also something that she loved about it: the movement the connection to music and the connection to people you feel when you start dancing.”

They worked together weekly in private lessons and last trained Wednesday in Cambridge. They had planned to get together again Monday night he said.

On Wednesday she had been sore from dancing the previous night. Perry offered to postpone but she wouldn’t hear of it.

“Thank God she said — and this is just like her — ‘No I really want to do this because I’m so adamant about working on myself’ "" Perry said.

Saturday’s crash triggered a frantic search to rescue the people thrown into the water and then an hours-long recovery effort to locate Julce who was missing.

The boat crash Saturday morning was reported to the Coast Guard shortly after 3 a.m. by the tugboat Steven Leman according to Petty Officer 1st Class Amanda Wyrick spokeswoman for the Coast Guard Sunday.

Within minutes that report resulted in a massive rescue effort which included the Coast Guard crews from Boston police fire and EMS State Police Environmental Police and the Massport Fire Department.

Recordings of radio calls from that early morning search revealed how quickly rescuers worked in the darkness to save the boaters. Three of them were discovered clinging to the structure of the navigational marker while others were hanging onto the wreck of the capsized vessel.

“I can only hear one person who’s yelling screaming for help and we can see a person... laid out on the overturned wreck” one first responder said in a recording.

About four minutes later rescue crews asked for help from the Coast Guard.

“We have several people in the water can we get some assistance from the Coast Guard? We have four in the water right now and we need an ambulance” a rescuer said over the radio.

Victims were transported to the dock at Black Falcon Avenue where they were loaded onto waiting ambulances. One person had a head injury another had been hurt in the leg.

Rescuers spent a great deal of time trying to determine how many people had been on board the boat when it sank.

A second boat — apparently unconnected with the rescue effort — was on scene but left according to the recording.

“We still don’t know what’s going on. They came here and just did circles” a rescuer said on the radio about nine minutes after the radio calls began. “They [saw] the people and they just left them there.”

“The guys tried swimming towards them and they just did a circle and went back” the rescuer added. “We didn’t see if they took anyone out of the water.”

At one point early in the search rescuers reported that there had been eight passengers — and one woman was still missing.

“One of the men on the boat reported that there were eight total passengers souls on board. Eight total souls on board” the first responder said over the radio. “And they are reporting that there is another female who is in the water who we do not have.”

Another 11 plates are scheduled to be delivered next week also from W&W/AFCO Steel according to Amy Rogers the company's vice president for bridge sales.

In all the company will provide 100 tons of steel for the Phase 2 and Phase 3 repairs on the bridge also known as the Hernando de Soto Bridge. It has been closed since May 11 when inspectors discovered a fracture that affected the structural integrity of the bridge.

A hundred tons is a tiny amount for the privately held W&W/AFCO the largest bridge steel fabricator in the United States. By comparison the company will provide 22940 tons of fabricated steel for 30 Crossing the $1 billion project to improve a 6.7-mile section of Interstate 30 in downtown Little Rock and North Little Rock. That project includes replacing the I-30 bridge over the Arkansas River.

In fact the steel used to repair the Memphis bridge was steel W&W/AFCO had ordered for the 30 Crossing Rogers said.

Company officials were offering their insight almost from the beginning speaking with officials from Arkansas and Tennessee and with the governor's office she said.

""We were saying 'hey nobody panic. Here's the solution'"" Rogers said. ""'The state of Arkansas owns the plates. We have it on the ground. It's Grade 70. It's what needs to go.' We have a lot of very experienced engineers on staff that said 'here's what needs to happen to get the bridge open quickly and safely.'""

Helping repair the I-40 bridge was personal for W&W/AFCO employees. Just 140 miles from Little Rock the bridge is practically in their backyard. They and their relatives and friends regularly use the crossing be it to visit Memphis or on their way to the beach or other points east.

""We fabricate bridges from Maine New York Florida Colorado all over the country"" Rogers said. ""But this project you know is home.

""I hand-delivered a drill out there when [the contractor] first started before we had a contract out of our shop in Van Buren on a Sunday night because it felt like our crisis our problem as an Arkansas company.""

The company has used both of its Arkansas operations to fabricate the steel.

They include W&W/AFCO's operations in Little Rock which feature two facilities totaling 609000 square feet of shop space under a roof on a 50-acre site off East Sixth Street. They are equipped with what the company says is ""a full range"" of computer numerical control routers advanced machines that automatically cut steel.

The other Arkansas operation is in Van Buren where a 30-acre site has 282000 square feet of shop space under a roof.

Both operations are near major interstates Union Pacific and have access to barge shipments on the Arkansas River. Together they employ 200 people.

""Because of how quick they needed to be done and how long it takes for them to get the drawings and what exactly needs to be done figured out as soon as we get the drawings we're putting both our shops on it immediately to get them out the door and turned around immediately"" Rogers said.

In Little Rock the company was known as AFCO for its first 93 years. Founded in 1909 the company can safely boast fabricating the steel for what is much of modern Little Rock: The Regions Bank building Simmons Bank Arena the Simmons Bank Tower the Stephens Building the Clinton Center ... ""all the major high-rises ... except old Worthen Bank which is concrete"" Rogers said.

The company was owned by four generations of the Fred Brown family until it was sold in 2002 to another family-owned fabrication company W&W of Oklahoma City.

The company has participated in major construction projects across the country including the home of the Dallas Cowboys AT&T Stadium; Globe Life Park home of the Texas Rangers; Tesla's truck factory in Austin and its battery factory in Sparks Nev.; Amazon distribution centers in New York Las Vegas El Paso and Canada; and the 9/11 Memorial Building in New York City.

Rogers' division has 16 bridge steel fabrication facilities across the nation. In addition to the I-40 repair and 30 Crossing bridge jobs have included another Mississippi River crossing -- the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis which carries Interstate 70 traffic -- and the Christopher S. Bond Bridge in Kansas City Mo.

The latest steel that AFCO is providing is for 16 locations on the I-40 bridge that need to be repaired before the bridge reopens. They are considered part of what is called Phase 3 repairs. The locations were identified after an ultrasonic inspection of 500 welds undertaken after the bridge was closed. None of the locations had cracks.

Closing the 48-year-old bridge has forced traffic to be rerouted to the Memphis and Arkansas Bridge which is 3 miles to the south on Interstate 55.

The crack on the Hernando de Soto Bridge a tied-arch span was found on a steel beam that connected cords to the arch. When the beam cracked the load that was once carried by the beam shifted to other parts of the bridge.

The way the bridge is designed means the Arkansas Department of Transportation classifies it as ""fracture critical"" meaning parts of the bridge are ""subject to tension whose failure would probably cause a portion of or the entire bridge to collapse."" Fracture critical bridges require frequent inspections but aren't inherently unsafe.

The Tennessee Transportation Department oversees repairs on the shared bridge while the Arkansas department is responsible for bridge inspections. Kiewit Infrastructure Group was contracted for the repairs.

The crack was discovered May 11 but a photo from 2019 confirmed by transportation officials to be authentic shows the crack has potentially been there for years. Another photo appears to show a crack as far back as 2016 but the authenticity of that image remains under investigation.

The discovery led the Arkansas Department of Transportation to fire the inspection team leader for missing the crack during at least two previous inspections which are conducted annually.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvbWlkZGxlLWVhc3RfaGFqai1tZWNjYS1wYXJlZC1iYWNrLWR1ZS1jb3ZpZC0ybmQteWVhci82MjA4NDEzLmh0bWzSAV1odHRwczovL3d3dy52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbWlkZGxlLWVhc3RfaGFqai1tZWNjYS1wYXJlZC1iYWNrLWR1ZS1jb3ZpZC0ybmQteWVhci82MjA4NDEzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hajj in Mecca Pared Back Due to COVID for 2nd Year,"Tens of thousands of vaccinated Muslim pilgrims circled Islam's holiest site in Mecca on Sunday but remained socially distanced and wore masks as the coronavirus takes its toll on the hajj for a second year running.

The hajj pilgrimage which once drew about 2.5 million Muslims from all walks of life around the globe is now almost unrecognizable. It is being scaled back for the second year in a row because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The pared-down hajj prevents Muslims from outside Saudi Arabia from fulfilling an Islamic obligation and causes financial losses to Saudi Arabia which in pre-pandemic years took in billions of dollars as the custodian of the holy sites.

The Islamic pilgrimage lasts about five days but traditionally Muslims begin arriving in Mecca weeks ahead of time. The hajj concludes with the Eid al-Adha celebration marked by the distribution of meat to the poor around the world.

This year 60000 vaccinated citizens or residents of Saudi Arabia have been allowed to perform the hajj because of continued concerns around the spread of the coronavirus. Last year's largely symbolic hajj saw fewer than 1000 people from within the kingdom taking part.

It's unclear when Saudi Arabia will play host again to millions of Muslims. The kingdom has no clear standard for a vaccine passport vaccination rates are uneven in different countries and new variants of the virus are threatening the progress made in some nations.

The kingdom's Al Saud rulers have staked their legitimacy in large part on their custodianship of hajj sites giving them a unique and powerful platform among Muslims around the world. The kingdom has gone to great lengths to ensure the annual hajj continues uninterrupted despite changes caused by the pandemic.

Robots have been deployed to spray disinfectant around the cube-shaped Kaaba's busiest walkways. The Kaaba is where the hajj pilgrimage begins and ends for most.

Saudi Arabia is also testing a smart bracelet this year in collaboration with the government's artificial intelligence authority. The touchscreen bracelet resembles the Apple Watch and includes information on the hajj a pilgrim's oxygen levels and vaccine data and has an emergency feature to call for help.

International media outlets already present in the kingdom were permitted to cover the hajj from Mecca this year but others were not granted permission to fly in as had been customary before the pandemic.

Cleaners are sanitizing the vast white marble spaces of the Grand Mosque that houses the Kaaba several times a day.

""We are sanitizing the floor and using disinfection liquids while cleaning it two or three times during (each) shift"" said Olis Gul a cleaner who said he has been working in Mecca for 20 years.

The hajj is one of Islam's most important requirements to be performed once in a lifetime. It follows a route the Prophet Muhammad walked nearly 1400 years ago and is believed to ultimately trace the footsteps of the prophets Ibrahim and Ismail or Abraham and Ishmael as they are named in the Bible.

The hajj is seen as a chance to wipe clean past sins and bring about greater unity among Muslims. The communal feeling of more than 2 million people from around the world — Shiite Sunni and other Muslim sects — praying together eating together and repenting together has long been part of what makes hajj both a challenging and a transformative experience.

There are questions around whether the hajj will be able to again draw such large numbers of faithful with male pilgrims forming a sea of white in white terrycloth garments worn to symbolize the equality of mankind before God and women forgoing makeup and perfume to focus inwardly.

Like last year pilgrims will be drinking water from the holy Zamzam well in plastic bottles. They were given umbrellas to shield them from the sun. They have to carry their own prayer rugs and follow a strict schedule via a mobile app that informs them when they can be in certain areas to avoid crowding.

""I hope this is a successful hajj season"" said Egyptian pilgrim Aly Aboulnaga a university lecturer in Saudi Arabia. ""We ask God to accept everyone's hajj and for the area to be open to greater numbers of pilgrims and for a return to an even better situation than before.""

The kingdom with a population of more than 30 million has reported over half a million cases of the coronavirus including more than 8000 deaths. It has administered nearly 20 million doses of coronavirus vaccines according to the World Health Organization.

The 27-year-old combines power at the plate and speed on the bases that make him a threat for the 20-20 club every year. And his powerful arm already is responsible for throwing out 25 baserunners in just 291 career games in the outfield through Friday.

When Oakland was in town to face the Yankees last month Laureano told Newsday that becoming the player he is today was only a hope while growing up in the Dominican Republic. It wasn’t until he got to Long Island that he came to believe.

Baseball fans on Long Island are studious however they might not realize that beginning in 2009 Laureano spent three seasons playing high school baseball here at tony Upper Room Christian Academy in Dix Hills as an outfielder and pitcher. The Royals didn’t play against Catholic or public schools on Long Island except for the occasional scrimmage; most of their games were in the city upstate or at out-of-state tournaments.

""They said the school was hoping to find someone who could pitch and play outfield and I guess I was the chosen one"" Laureano said. ""My game developed a lot when I was in Long Island and I see today I was lucky to be able to come here.""

The Island might be where his ascent began but he still hasn’t reach an apex.

""You don't find too many guys with as many tools as he has"" A's manager Bob Melvin said. ""He’s a true five-tool player and I think he will be an All-Star in a short period of time. Ultimately I could see him being a perennial All-Star.""

Major League Baseball has an outreach program that promotes interest and participation in underserved communities called RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities). His participation in RBI got him noticed in the United States and ultimately led to Upper Room offering him a place as a sophomore. It wasn’t easy to leave home at 15 or live with seven different families — in Huntington Freeport and Wyandanch — during his three years here. As Laureano said: ""There were moments I wanted to go back home but I am glad I didn’t.""

Both then-Upper Room coach Anthony Passalacqua and Lou Maietta who coached Laureano during summers with the Long Island/Max Bat Titans described him as having a voracious appetite to keep learning and improving.

The road to a major-league baseball roster is long with many stages of development. Few players might single out one moment when they realized they could make it. Laureano can.

He was a 16-year-old playing with the Titans against the nationally known Bayside Yankees in a Connecticut tournament. On one swing of his wooden bat Laureano launched a home run that cleared the centerfield fence at the college stadium by more than 30 feet.

""It was the kind of home run that had everyone on our team and everyone on the other team looking at each other like ‘What the hell just happened?’"" Maietta said. ""He did it in a wood-bat tournament against a future Division I pitcher. It was one of the longest home runs I’ve seen by a player at that level and we had and played against a lot of good players.""

Said Laureano: ""That home run is when I understood something. I was like ‘Wow if I keep working I can make it.’""

The progress continued and sped up after that. Passalacqua said that when he next suited up for Upper Room Laureano was applying the instruction at the plate that he and Maietta had been giving.

""He was naturally developing physically but his mental approach at the plate was changing"" Passalacqua said. ""He just wasn't going out there to see it and hit it trying to guess at pitches. He started putting himself in good hitting [situations] good hitting counts. He started to know what look for and know what to attack.""

""He developed great plate discipline and stopped chasing balls out of the zone"" Maietta said.

Laureano doesn’t consider himself a late bloomer but understood the lack of recognition for his play at Upper Room. ""I wasn’t the best prospect on Long Island I wasn’t playing against the best Long Island teams and I wasn’t scouted or recruited the same because of that"" he said.

He didn’t get a Division I scholarship offer out of Upper Room and went the junior college route playing at Northeast Oklahoma A&M College. There he got noticed by Astros scout Jim Stevenson who was in to see a pair of highly touted pitchers. Houston took Laureano in the 16th round of the 2014 draft. The Astros dealt him to Oakland in a 2017 trade because they weren’t going to be able to protect him in the Rule V draft.

From there it’s been nothing but up. With that effort and abandon he is known for and what Melvin described as a ""good baseball mind"" Laureano became the starting centerfielder by the end of the 2018 season. A hip injury limited him to 123 games in 2019 but he still hit 24 home runs and batted .288. He might have been on his way to the first of those All-Star games this season before he lost three weeks to a hip injury; he had an .834 OPS with 11 home runs and eight stolen bases through the first 48 games.

""Ramon is in tune with everything"" Melvin said. ""He understands the analytics. He’s receptive to instruction. He's matured pretty quickly at the big-league level and a lot of it is just because of hard work and his understanding of what he needs to do to get better.""

""I know I deserve to be here and I have to keep proving it"" Laureano said. ""I need to keep working and get the experience to get better.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9qYXNvbi1zdWRlaWtpcy1wcmFpc2VkLXJlYWwtbGlmZS0yMDM2MTIzMzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jason Sudeikis praised as 'real-life Ted Lasso' after compassionate email,"It seems that Jason Sudeikis is just as big-hearted and compassionate as his on-screen alter-ego Ted Lasso after a 2017 email exchange with a reporter was made public.

Sudeikis’ role as the titular football coach in hit comedy series Ted Lasso which returns for its second season this month has won the actor both acclaim and a Golden Globe.

The similarities between the character and his creator were highlighted in an editorial for Uproxx by entertainment writer Mike Ryan titled: “Yeah Jason Sudeikis Is Actually Kind Of Like Ted Lasso In Real Life.”

In the piece Ryan explains that his father died from a heart attack in 2017. A few months later he interviewed Sudeikis about his film Kodachrome in which his character attempts to find closure with his dying father played by Ed Harris.

After Ryan mentioned his personal connection to the film he received an email later that day from Sudeikis which he described as “inspirational”. He asked Sudeikis for permission to reproduce his touching email in full which he agreed to.

“Just wanted to shoot ya a quick note and let ya know that I’m so sorry for your loss. And I thank you for feeling comfortable enough with me to share. Please please please feel ZERO regret in doing so” Sudeikis writes.

“It’s important and f***ing necessary for us human beings to do that. To connect. To share. And to not concern ourselves too much with the outcome of such bravery. Especially the men of the world. Our generation is the first to ‘understand’ that notion but darn it I’d love to try and be the first generation of fellas to ‘live’ the notion as well. So let’s both continue to attempt to be on that ‘side of history’ shall we?”

The letter continues: “I wish you all the luck and openness in the universe on finding the ‘four rolls of Kodachrome’ your own father left you. Because he did. It’s out there. I know it is.

A few years ago after my dad died I was in a pretty bad place. Out of nowhere Jason Sudeikis sent me an email I REALLY needed . I’ve never shared it before (he said it was okay to do) but I just want people to know he did this. He really is Ted Lasso https://t.co/Q9OVKaDes0 — Mike Ryan (@mikeryan) July 15 2021

“The one thing I want you to consider though is that it might not be physically “out there” because it might actually be living inside of you. And through you. And merely accepting that possibility might be where and when the “finding” happens. You see deeply into things for a living. Allow yourself the experience of doing that to yourself for yourself” writes Sudeikis.

He signs off: “Okay man. Be well. Always good to see and speak with you. Yours Jason”

Sudeikis won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for his starring role as the eponymous Ted Lasso in the Apple TV+ distributed comedy.

Ted Lasso is the story of a folksy small-time American football coach hired to coach a professional English Premier League football team despite having no experience with the British game. He loves to coach and cares more about people than winning.

The Mahtomedi native served as captain of the University of North Carolina's national champion soccer teams in 1999 and 2000 and played professionally before going into financial services with Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.

She believes that Bell Bank — family- and employee-owned and one of the country's largest privately held banks with more than $10 billion in assets — can compete with big publicly traded banks.

She takes over as the Fargo-based Bell pursues further growth in the Twin Cities and Phoenix areas.

Cogswell got her start as a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs then was responsible for marketing strategy for J.P. Morgan's asset management business before heading up product marketing at Providence Equity Partners.

Cogswell most recently was managing director head of product marketing and global insights at Principal Global Investors the asset management division of Principal Financial group.

Cogswell moved back to Minnesota four years ago with her husband.

She has a bachelor's degree in communication studies from the University of North Carolina and after college she played on the U.S. Women's National Soccer team from 1998 to 2003 and for the Boston Breakers of the Women's United Soccer Association.

Cogswell is ""a respected and transformative leader who will help us connect with customers in core and new markets and continue to build our brand in regions across the country"" Michael Solberg Bell's president and CEO said in a release.

Q: What brought you to Bell Bank?

A: I spent 17 years a large part of that in New York City working at larger banks and asset managers. I had always hoped that I would land someplace smaller and take the knowledge and apply it to an organization that was a little earlier in its growth trajectory. Bell's strategy is that they've always put their customers and employees first and that if they do the right things they'll grow the right way and that's what's happened.

Q: How will your work support growth in new markets?

A: One thing from the top down is building greater awareness of our brand. We have a great opportunity especially in these newer markets because when you look at the landscape competitively we have a good story to tell. From a bottom-up perspective it gets back to the customers and understanding those touch points. When you're in an industry that's highly commoditized it's really important that every single touch point is good.

Q: How has your athletic experience influenced your career in business?

A: You learn how to operate on a team; you learn how to compete and have high expectations but without being a jerk. You learn about accountability and time management. All these have served me well whatever I'm doing. I realized early on that if you work really hard at something and differentiate yourself there will be opportunity and your world becomes a little bit wider than it was every time you do that.

Sure you know McKinsey Bain and BCG are there and so is Amazon and Google. But who else? And what percentage of the graduating class at top MBA programs are actually hired by these firms?

In a rare and exclusive look at elite MBA employment we present the top ten employers of MBA graduates at 24 of the leading business schools over the past three years. Only a few business schools disclose a ranked listing of top employers and when they do the schools limit those lists to a single graduating class. Now for the first time an extensive analysis of MBA recruits by Menlo Coaching the premium MBA admissions consulting firm has pulled the curtain back on exactly which firms are hiring in a big way from these schools. Menlo Coaching’s research team analyzed 51991 student profiles on LinkedIn to get to the bottom of it. To access the full report on all 24 schools from Menlo Coaching you can click here.

This latest analysis follows the look at top employers of Harvard Stanford and Wharton MBAs (see Who Really Hires Harvard Stanford & Wharton MBAs These Days) a report on where McKinsey Bain & BCG hire the most MBAs and a look at the MBA hires by Goldman Sachs JPMorganChase & Morgan Stanley.

THE MOST FREQUENT TOP FIVE EMPLOYER ACROSS 24 SCHOOLS? AMAZON

The data reveals some big surprises. For one thing notes David White a founding partner of Menlo Coaching the top employers are not the same as the top feeders.”In unpublished research we identified Deloitte as the #1 largest feeder company to the 24 U.S. MBA programs we analyzed sending around twice as many students as the runner up BCG” he says. “However Deloitte is only the fifth largest post-MBA recruiter across these same 24 programs.”

So which company is the most frequent Top Five employer? Amazon. “It made the list of the top five employers at every M7 school.” says White. “In total it was a top five employer at 22 of the 24 MBA programs we examined. Beyond Amazon Google was the other big tech company to appear frequently in the top five employer lists.”

Not surprisingly perhaps some schools are local favorites of companies. “Although the top five employers at most MBA programs are national recruiters who appear in the lists for many different MBA programs there are a few major employers with a regional recruiting footprint” explains White. “For example Dell was a top five employer at UT Austin McCombs and UNC Kenan-Flagler but not at other MBA programs and Microsoft was a top five recruiter only at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business.”

GEOGRAPHY MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME MBA EMPLOYERS

For prospective MBA students the real takeaway might well be this: ""Graduates can join McKinsey Bain or BCG even if they are not at a top-ranked school"" adds White. ""We examined 14 MBA programs outside of (M7 + Haas Tuck Yale). In those 14 programs all but two include one of McKinsey Bain and BCG as one of their Top 10 employers. For example UCLA Anderson and NYU Stern both have all three firms among their top 10 employers.""

Once you expand to looking at the top 10 employers instead of the top five Facebook pops up frequently as another tech recruiter alongside Amazon and Google. In Menlo Coaching's top 10 employers report you can see a larger number of employers who recruit disproportionately at MBA programs near their headquarters with pairs like USC Marshall and Amgen Emory Goizueta and UPS Rice Jones and ExxonMobil and Chevron) as well as Washington Foster and Starbucks.

The company taking the largest percentage of MBAs out of any one school among the top 24 is the Boston Consulting Group at Kellogg: BCG has hired 11.5% of Kellogg graduates in the past three years. The only other double-digit employer from a single school is Amazon which has hired 10.3% of the MBA grads out of Washington Foster in three years.

AT STANFORD GOOGLE TIES BCG AS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR EMPLOYER

Overall at the 24 leading schools McKinsey and BCG are the #1 and #2 employers respectively. Bain follows in fourth place. Amazon ranks #3 at 4.1% and represents the only non-consulting firm in the top five (see table below). ""The high placement rate at Amazon reflects its position as a highly desirable company for MBAs targeting tech"" says White. ""It also reflects Amazon's own interest in hiring MBA graduates especially outside the M7: Amazon is the top employer for UNC Kenan-Flagler UCLA Anderson Texas McCombs Michigan Ross UW Foster NYU Stern and Duke Fuqua (tied).""

Only one financial services company makes the top ten: JPMorgan Chase employing just under 1% of the graduates in tenth place.

McKinsey Bain and BCG maintain their attraction for MBA graduates from M7 programs. Indeed for all M7 programs MBB ranks at the top (though Google ties BCG at Stanford's #3 according to Menlo's analysis. ""In addition to the clear relationship between M7 attendance and placement at an MBB firm listings for programs outside the M7 reveal strong placement rates at the Big Four strategy consulting firms or Deloitte PwC KPMG and EY-Parthenon"" adds White. ""Placements at Deloitte and EY-Parthenon are especially high across the board.""

The donation has been arranged through the Goldman Sachs (GS) Gives Fund. The fund can be used by partners at their discretion to support charities and projects which meet key criteria including social mobility – a key priority for the school.

The boys selected will have their fees paid in full by the Adam Crook/Goldman Sachs Gives Bursary grant.

Adam said: “Looking back at my own family history it’s only really in the last couple of generations that there has been genuine potential for social mobility through access to education and a broader more meritocratic society.

“Education is transformational and for my grandparents growing up in Bolton today’s opportunities were just not available. Every child should have the opportunity to fulfil their academic potential and that shouldn’t just be a function of where you grow up or whether your parents can afford it.’ He added: “I do think the school offers something unique and truly opens children’s eyes to opportunities in the community and beyond. I would love to be able to support some of those children who can’t take advantage of these opportunities because of family circumstances.

“Being at a US firm the ethos of donating to a former school or college is quite ingrained. It made sense to me along with some other things I am doing with Veterans’ charities to give something back to my old school and community.

""The school Bursary Scheme does an excellent job broadening access to education across the community and I would encourage any former pupil who finds him- or herself in a position where they are able to help to consider contributing to this effort.”

Headmaster Philip Britton added: “These bursaries will make a difference not just to the young people who receive them but also to those in the communities they will be part of in later life as they live out the values that we promote here and use their talents for the greater good. There could be no better example of that than Adam’s own personal success leading to him giving these bursaries.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN3Zmluc3RpdHV0ZS5vcmcvbmV3cy84NzU0MS9hcGctYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1hbmQtc2NhcGUtbGl2aW5nLXRvLWJ1eS1nY3Atc3R1ZGVudC1saXZpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,APG Blackstone and Scape Living to Buy GCP Student Living - SWFI,"APG Blackstone and Scape Living to Buy GCP Student Living

When she goes home each day to her house in the West End of Hartford she becomes the Disheveled Diva. The Diva is a chef who bakes and sells “purposefully imperfect” custom cakes and treats: jar cakes push pops cookie cakes cake bites.

Day is one of 545 people statewide getting a start in the food industry with the use of cottage permits which allow them to run micro businesses out of their homes.

“A cottage food license is really good for people who want to dip their toe in the water safely with low investment” said Day who started her business in September 2020. Cottage work is done in home kitchens so permittees don’t have to spend a lot to rent or build out commercial kitchens.

Cottage permittees are the smallest of small businesses. Their food work is often a side gig from their regular job. Anyone whose cottage business earns more than $25000 a year must move on to a commercial license. That is a goal for many permittees: to see if their products sell then move upward.

Day who donates a portion of her profits to charity wants to move upward with Disheveled Diva eventually becoming a consumer packaged goods company. But she’s taking her time. “I have big plans but it does not involve retiring from corporate America” she said. “I love my job.”

Kevin Masse isn’t retiring either. He still works for a publisher producing a baking magazine. On the side he runs Small State Provisions which started as a cottage business in 2019.

“West Hartford passed cottage legislation in 2019 because there is not a lot of incubator kitchens in our area” said Masse. “The failure rate for a new food business is extremely high and a big out-of-pocket expense. Cottage operators can build that audience following before moving onto the next phase.”

Masse is a success story. “I quickly outgrew my kitchen’s capacity and the revenue limit” he said. In June Masse moved into a small commercial kitchen inside West Hartford’s food truck hub GastroPark. Thursday to Sunday he makes sourdough bread granola scones cookies and chocolate babkas.

The clientele he built followed him to GastroPark. That following is especially large on Sundays when babkas are sold. “When I open at 9 a.m. there’s a line out the door and into the parking lot” he said.

Requirements

Kaitlyn Krasselt of the state Department of Consumer Protection said cottage applicants must fulfill several requirements before license approval.

“They have to get permission from their town. If they are on a well they need a water test from within three months or a copy of their water bill. They must complete food safety handler courses” she said.

“Then they can fill out an application and pay the fee. They will be contacted by a member of our team who will ask what kind of products they sell and how they will make them. They must show a sample label” she said. “After they get a license they have to get a business ID and register their business.”

State cottage permits which are renewed each February costs $50 a year Krasselt said. She said Norwalk and Waterbury are the state’s only two municipalities that do not allow cottage businesses.

Cottage-made foods must be shelf-stable; nothing requiring refrigeration is allowed Krasselt said. For that reason the cottage industry is dominated by bakers.

Zoning concerns

Some municipalities also may charge fees Krasselt said. West Hartford is one of them. Masse learned that when customers wanted to be able to pick up goods at his home rather than have them delivered.

Brittany Bermingham a zoning enforcement officer in West Hartford said a home occupation permit at $135 allows a cottage business to proceed without home pickup signs or additional employees. A special exception permit at $430 allows a sign up to two outside employees and on-site pickup.

“It’s about being in a residential zone and having people coming to that home” Bermingham said.

Waterbury City Planner Bob Nerney said that city’s decision not to allow cottage businesses is rooted in zoning concerns “the potential for people to come onto a property on a potentially unregulated basis.”

Access to child care

Stefanie Robles facilitates the Food Incubator program at reSET a Hartford-based mentorship program for emerging small businesses. Many clients in the Food Incubator start with cottage permits. Robles said in addition to the financial advantages cottagers can juggle child care and building their business.

“When working from home it allows for a different level of flexibility and access to care” Robles said. “If you only can get child care on certain hours you can build your business around those hours.”

Stephanie Thomacos of Enfield started cottaging to make some money while staying home with her kids. Thomacos bakes macaroons and dacquoise cakes under the name Mama’s Macs. She sells at farmers markets in Ellington and Coventry and at Brignole Vineyards in East Granby.

Thomacos’ creations have become so popular that now she needs to move up to a commercial kitchen. “I can only make 1000 cookies every weekend. I usually sell out in the first hour at both markets and then people are disappointed” she said. “I’m sort of being forced to try to expand.”

Joe Figure Of Cobra Commander,"Hasbro Reportedly Orders “No Hoods Allowed” For G.I. Joe Figure Of Cobra Commander

Source: G.I. Joe the Real American Hero Vol. 2 #4 ""Reinstated"" (2002) Devil's Due Publishing. Art by David Michael Beck.

A recent Instagram interaction between a fan and boutique pop-culture design house Super 7 founder Brian Flynn has seemingly revealed that Hasbro has issued a “no hoods allowed” order to manufacturers and designers in regards to merchandise bearing the series’ iconic villain Cobra Commander.

This insight into Hasbro’s apparent mandates first came to light on July 16th after a G.I. Joe fan on Instagram tagged both Super 7 and Flynn in a post requesting that the company include an alternative mask-clad head sculpt to the villain’s silver-face-shield-helmet appearance as an extra accessory for their recently announced Cobra Commander G.I. JOE ULTIMATES! figure.

Produced in collaboration with Hasbro the first wave of Super 7’s G.I. JOE ULTIMATES! line will feature G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero-accurate figures of Cobra Commander the Cobra Battle Android Trooper (B.A.T.) Duke and Snake Eyes.

In their post alongside three different reference photos of Cobra Commander’s appearance in question Instagram user and toy collector paintapps politely asked Flynn and Super 7 “Please add a hooded head to make it a true Ultimates! Figure”.

However as reported by Toy News International paintapps’ hopes were soon dashed by Flynn himself who responded to the Instagram request by informing the hopeful fan that presumably due to a direct Hasbro mandate “no hoods [are] allowed at this time”.

As of writing neither Hasbro nor Super 7 have publicly addressed Flynn’s comment which has since been deleted from underneath paintapps’ Instagram post. As such no concrete reason has yet been provided for this apparent ban on Cobra Commander’s hooded appearance.

Razor Crest Fiasco Hasbro Takes Money For New 'Star Wars' Project - Inside the Magic,"Hasbro — the officially licensed toy purveyor for both Star Wars and Marvel Studios — launched its HasLab crowdfunding website several years ago. In 2018 the company received enough funding to create Jabba the Hutt’s Khetanna sail barge with approximately 10000 backers.

Then last year HasLab received enough money to create Din Djarin’s (Pedro Pascal) Razor Crest ship from The Mandalorian in a single day.

Unfortunately the project launched right before the actual Razor Crest in Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni’s hit Star Wars series was destroyed with a single strike from Moff Gideon’s (Giancarlo Esposito) Imperial cruiser in The Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 6 (“Chapter 14: The Tragedy”).

Djarin Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) and Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) looked on helplessly from the surface of planet Tython while Gideon not only destroyed the pre-Imperial ship but absconded with tiny Grogu (AKA “Baby Yoda”).

The situation garnered a great deal of online backlash with Star Wars fans angry that Hasbro took over $10 million to create a Razor Crest model when their team was almost certainly aware of the ship’s upcoming destruction the very week that preorders ended.

Now for the first time since the Razor Crest fiasco HasLab is accepting money from crowdfunders for a new Star Wars project — Malakili the rancor from Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983) the final film in George Lucas’s original trilogy.

StarWars.com shared details about this new HasLab Star Wars The Black Series project:

The towering hulk of muscle who greeted Luke Skywalker in the shadowy pit beneath Jabba the Hutt’s throne room is poised to make a comeback. Although bested by the Jedi in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi this morning Hasbro announced plans to bring the sharp-toothed beast into the 6-inch scale Star Wars: The Black Series line if the brand’s next HasLab crowd-funded campaign reaches its target for production. “Following the success of the previous two HasLab campaigns for Star Wars: The Vintage Collection our team is so thrilled to offer fans the first-ever HasLab project from The Black Series – the Rancor!” says Michael Ballog Hasbro’s vice president for the Star Wars brand. “We hope fans of The Black Series line are prepared for this iconic creature to join their 6-inch-scale collections.” Related: Gina Carano Convinces Fans She’s Returning to ‘Star Wars’ Related: ‘Star Wars’ Fans Are OBSESSED With Filoni’s Newest Character

The HasLab Hasbro Pulse website is currently accepting funding for a Marvel Legends Galactus action figure [above]. Although the start date for the rancor project has not been released it will presumably be after the Galactus funding run ends on August 30 2021.

Star Wars The Black Series and Star Wars The Vintage Collection are the two most popular lines of Hasbro Star Wars toys. The Black Series — which features poseable figures of iconic characters like Ahsoka Tano bounty hunter Cad Bane Millennium Falcon pilot Han Solo Princess Leia Organa X-Wing ace Wedge Antilles Darth Revan Obi-Wan Kenobi Din Djarin Lando Calrissian Rey and more — is officially described as:

While fans fantasise about his big screen debut Hasbro has unveiled the ultimate Galactus action figure. Marvel Legends Galactus stands nearly three feet tall and costs a cosmic-sized $US400 ($539).

Marvel Legends Galactus is the latest project from Hasbro’s Haslab where the toy maker develops toys it could never sell at retail via fan funding. It’s the same program that brought us the $US575 ($775) Transformers Unicron figure which robot fans around the world are having trouble finding the shelf space for as we speak. Basically Hasbro presents us with over-the-top toys at exorbitant prices sets a funding goal and once enough toy collectors sign up the toys go into production. That way the toys wind up in the hands of folks with enough spare change to drop $US400 ($539) on a big plastic doll and none of the toys wind up warming toy store shelves.

There aren’t many characters in the Marvel universe larger than Galactus. At his most modest he stands around 9.14 m tall dwarfing the heroes who’ve battled him since his debut in Fantastic Four #48 back in 1966. He’s an ancient cosmic being with a hunger for entire worlds and he possesses the ability to adjust his size based on the planet he wants to munch on. What I am saying is that smaller action figures just won’t do. We need a magnificent plastic beast that towers over the likes of six-inch Reed Richards.

No no Galactus. YOU step on HIM. (Photo: Hasbro)

Yeah that’ll do nicely.

Marvel Legends Galactus isn’t just a massive solid piece of plastic. He’s made up of more than 300 pieces assembled into an enormous berry-flavored giant with all sorts of light-up electronic features.

Over half the size of my spouse. (Photo: Hasbro)

When you make an action figure of this scale there are some important features to include. The figure needs to be covered from head to toe in little details to impart the illusion of size. Check out the ribbing and armour accents on Galactus’ outfit. Behold the glowing blue orbs embedded in his helmet. Is that Iron Man’s arc reactor in his chest? No of course not that would be dumb but it is some sort of cool unknowable tech thing we probably shouldn’t question.

Another important feature for a giant action figure is the ability to grasp smaller ones. Those 70 points of articulation? Each of Galactus’ hands sports 20 of them. He can grab Reed Richards. Hell he could grab your cat. Don’t worry he only eats worlds.

Big hands I know you’re the one? (Photo: Hasbro)

As for accessories Galactus comes with three swappable faceplates two for changing his expression and one for scaring the children.

As if he weren’t intimidating enough. (Photo: Hasbro)

Hasbro is looking for 14000 fans to back this project within 45 days. The project launched today and it already has over 3000 backers. Should that goal be met Hasbro has stretch awards waiting in the wings hopefully including some of Galactus’ heralds like the Silver Surfer or Nova.

As much as I hunger for Galactus I won’t be backing the project. There’s just no room in my collection for a 32-inch piece of sculpted plastic. But damn if it isn’t a gorgeous 32-inch piece of sculpted plastic. I’ll just live vicariously through the folks who do when they’re struggling to find a place to put him come spring of 2022."

William P. Prescott JD EMBA



The broker's role

If the selling dentist hasn’t found or can’t find a purchaser for the sale of the dental practice engaging a broker is important and well worth the cost. Brokers typically charge 10% of the selling price including any real estate as a finder's fee for matching the purchaser with the seller. The broker does not need to attempt to prepare legal agreements to justify the brokerage fee which can delay the transition and increase legal fees.

The broker generally prepares the practice valuation as well as a confidentiality letter to be signed by the purchasing candidates prior to release of confidential practice information. In addition the broker secures financing for the sale and purchase of the practice and any real estate which is more important than ever given the lending environment due to COVID‑19. Fortunately the selling dentist can still be fully paid for the sale of the practice in cash but it takes effort on the part of the broker to secure the financing subject to approval by the selling dentist's CPA. The broker may also delineate the business terms of the sale and purchase of the practice and any real estate. If the broker prepares the letter of intent for the sale and purchase of the practice and any real estate it should be carefully reviewed by the selling dentist's attorney prior to the letter being sent to the selling dentist.

The broker prepares a listing agreement which is signed by the selling dentist to enlist the broker's services. The listing agreement provided to the selling dentist by the broker is a contract that provides that the broker will locate a purchaser for the selling dentist's practice based on the broker's practice valuation in exchange for a specified brokerage fee.

The lawyer's role

The lawyer reviews the listing agreement that the broker provides to the dentist. The listing agreement may contain exclusions of a brokerage fee paid by the selling dentist for candidates who have already been identified. In addition the terms of the listing agreement should be for a specified period of time and contain termination provisions for non-performance by the broker subject to the selling dentist providing the practice information requested by the broker in order for the broker to effectively sell the practice.

The lawyer will either prepare or review and comment on or rewrite the letter of intent if prepared by the broker. The letter of intent should not be a “one size fits all’ agreement; this can take more time to rewrite than to prepare. For example disagreement over some key terms have been failure to agree on the selling and purchase price the restrictive covenant radius and duration completion of unfinished orthodontic or other specialty cases incorrect allocations to either tangible assets or goodwill and continued full-time employment of the seller and possibly certain staff members e.g. spouse. The lawyer should prepare the sale and purchase agreements from a thorough and complete letter of intent. The lawyer in conjunction with the CPA and broker deals with the tax issues and allocations for the sale and purchase.

Successfully working together

The broker prepared the practice valuation letter of understanding and confidentiality letter to be signed by the purchasing dentist prior to receiving confidential practice information. The lawyer for the selling dentist reviewed the letter of intent and revised it. The lawyer then prepared the sale and purchase agreements from the letter of intent. The sale and purchase went smoothly.

Unsuccessful relationships

Problems can occur when the broker prepares a letter of intent that is signed before the lawyers review it. In one case the letter of intent stated that closing would take place in several months and that the practice would be taken off the market. However the sum of the earnest money deposit which was in a check was insufficient for the selling dentist to do so. Had the earnest money been in the form of a promissory note the sum could have been much larger. The letter of intent also did not state when the staff would be informed of the sale. It also stated that the selling dentist would work for six months following closing but did not delineate the post-sale schedule clinical and/or administrative or compensation. Thus negotiations were necessary for the doctors to agree on what should have been previously agreed upon and contained in the letter of intent.

In another case of a sale to a corporate buyer the letter of intent did not consider default on the payment of two hold-back amounts due at the end of the first and second 12‑month periods following closing. The hold-backs were based on practice performance. As well the selling dentist was required to work for three years following closing for the corporate buyer with limited ability to leave irrespective of management quality or non or incorrect payment of doctor compensation and bonuses. Further the broker prepared the sale and purchase agreements that were inconsistent with the deficient letter of intent. The lawyers had much to talk about!

Conclusion

It is important for both the broker and lawyer to work on behalf of the selling dentist's best interest bearing in mind that if the sale and purchase is unfair to either the selling or purchasing dentist sooner or later there will be a dispute. And remember the broker's fee is worth the cost if the selling dentist cannot otherwise locate a purchaser.

Thomas L. Snyder DMD MBA

Since a broker is retained by the seller to find a suitable purchaser he or she should have firsthand knowledge of all aspects of the practice. So it makes sense to have the broker take responsibility for negotiating and developing consensus on all business points of the transaction. The broker should be skilled and able to communicate to both parties the best way to handle accounts receivable patient credit balances work in progress and any corrective dentistry (e.g. remakes).

The broker should also be able to help the parties arrive at a fair price and address the practical items that need to be completed for a smooth closing and post-closing experience: for example getting the buyer up and running with a credit card machine and payroll service. Brokers should be able to map out the benchmarks that need to happen to reach the closing date such as satisfying lender closing conditions in a timely manner as well as coordinating the actual closing.The best brokers also can provide contract template agreements which will help guide the parties through best practices for all business points.

The lawyer’s role should be directed at advising the parties of their rights risks liabilities and responsibilities under the sale agreements which may be drafted by the attorney at the discretion of the parties. A seller’s attorney will generally want to ensure that the seller can walk away from the transaction with as few strings attached is possible. Conversely a buyer’s attorney will want to try to attach strings so if things don't go well or there have been misrepresentations the buyer can have some recourse against the seller. A large portion of the attorney’s involvement should be developing terms for fair indemnification or the contractual right of one party to have their costs covered by the other party should the party which is indemnified suffer any losses. Indemnification is the primary means lawyers have to try to ensure that liabilities which arise after closing are the responsibility of the buyer and liabilities which result from the seller’s operation of the practice remain the responsibility of the seller. It is also possible for an attorney to engage in negotiating business terms especially if the broker wishes not to be as engaged as mentioned above.

In the end it's important that both broker and attorney communicate at the outset so they both understand their respective roles and avoid any duplication of effort.

According to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Freidman the Toronto Maple Leafs named former head coach of the AHL’s Hershey Bears Spencer Carbery an assistant coach after Dave Hakstol left to become the Seattle Kraken’s head coach.

Also today: hearing TOR is hiring AHL Hershey’s Spencer Carbery as an assistant coach. Carbery was AHL Coach of the Year in 2021. — Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) July 17 2021

Carbery signed a three-year extension with the Washington Capitals to remain the Bears’ head coach on April 22.

The 39-year-old spent three seasons with the Bears. He was named the 26th head coach in franchise history on June 26 2018 and at the time of his hire he was the second-youngest coach in the American Hockey League.

Under Carbery’s guidance the Bears finished atop the AHL standings this past season with a record of 24-7-2-0 a .758 points percentage that ranks as the second-highest mark in the franchise’s 83-year history. Hershey which lost in regulation just once on home ice all season (14-1-2-0) allowed a league-low 2.33 goals per game in 2020-21 and ranked eighth in scoring (3.33) and Carbery sent several players to the National Hockey League to compete with the Washington Capitals this season while continuing to oversee the development of Caps prospects such as Alex Alexeyev Garrett Pilon Axel Jonsson-Fjallby Brett Leason Martin Fehervary Kody Clark Riley Sutter and 2020-21 AHL All-Rookie forward Connor McMichael.

Named head coach of the Bears on June 26 2018 Carbery has led the club to a three-year record of 104-50-9-8 good for a .658 points percentage including a 53-18-3-2 mark (111 points .730) in their last 76 regular-season games. The 39-year-old native of Victoria B.C. spent the 2017-18 season as an assistant coach with the AHL’s Providence Bruins helping the club to an impressive 45-26-3-2 record and served as head coach of Hershey’s ECHL affiliate in South Carolina from 2011 to 2016 winning that league’s Coach of the Year honors in 2013-14. Carbery is the first Hershey head coach to win the Pieri Award since John Paddock in 1988.

Carbery replaces Dave Hakstol who left to become the inaugural head coach of the Seattle Kraken.

Even as a minor league coach Carbery should be a recognizable name for many. The 39-year-old is the reigning AHL Coach of the Year named the recipient of the Louis A.R. Pieri Memorial Award after leading Hershey to a 24-7-2-0 record. Carbery only just completed his third season as an AHL head coach but in that time the Bears went 104-50-9-8 for a .658 points percentage that was among the AHL’s best in that span. Carbery previously won the ECHL Coach of the Year Award as well taking home the honor in his third of five seasons spent as the head coach and Director of Hockey Operations for the South Carolina Stingrays. He is no stranger to Ontario either spending one season as the head coach of the OHL’s Saginaw Spirit.

Carbery is a well-regarded head coach and should be a natural fit with a Toronto staff that is young and innovative much like the culture of the team. There could be an adjustment period seeing as Carbery has no NHL experience to this point but having fellow young coaches around who went through the same transition not long ago will help the process. Meanwhile Carbery’s loss will be felt in a major way in Hershey and the Washington Capitals must now work quickly to find a new bench boss for their AHL affiliate."

The telecoms company has previously warned that its business in China could fall afoul of Sweden’s move to ban Chinese equipment giant Huawei and in the second quarter its sales there fell by 2.5 billion Swedish crowns the first drop in three years. .

Asked on an analyst call if Ericsson expected to recoup that money Chief Executive Borje Ekholm replied: “No it’s not coming back.”

Ericsson currently generates just under 10% of its revenues in China and despite the country preparing for the next round of a massive 5G build-out Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander told Reuters that it was “prudent to forecast materially lower market share” in the future.

A Radical Commitment to Non-Auto Transportation

The developer’s new stated vision: “Put the residential piece into a sophisticated urban fabric that makes a radical commitment to non-automobile transportation.”

Springwoods Village a 2000-acre development that has attracted the global headquarters of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the 3 million-SF Exxon Mobil corporate campus has been largely focused on commercial development in its first years of existence.

But now CDC Houston a subsidiary of Coventry Development Corporation of New York is ready to move forward with the residential development of its 450 acres on the western side of Springwoods Village. It will have more of an urban feel than the typical residential community in Texas.

The first big sign that something very different is coming down: a name change. CDC Houston just announced that “Springwoods Village” is out. Henceforth the entire project shall be called “City Place.”

“It’s really becoming a city” said Warren W. Wilson Executive Vice President of CDC Houston when announcing the name change at a recent press conference. “As we went through the planning process over the last 18 months the name Springwoods Village became increasingly outdated.”

Enter DMB Development

DMB Development a community developer based in Scottsdale Ariz. was brought in as a joint venture partner for the residential development of City Place.

The land which is south of The Woodlands near the intersection of Interstate 45 and the Grand Parkway has the advantage of not being on the outer edge of suburbia’s northern creep said Brent Herrington President and CEO of DMB Development.

Note: The City Place development is 25 miles north of downtown Houston and full-scale new home construction is occurring in Willis which is 50 miles from Houston. So a strong case can be made that City Place can be suited as an urban infill project with a brand that includes the word “City.”

The City Place residential development will feature a “mid-density” blend of housing an unusual menu of homes for Houston. Look for town homes garden homes patio homes detached town homes and various types of condominium product. “We will have some normal single-family – not very much but we will have it” Herrington said. Phase one of the project with lot deliveries due in 2023 will have about 600 dwellings.

Turning New Urbanism Inside Out

The residential acres in City Place will have a dense network of sidewalks for pedestrians and separate “alternative mobility pathways” for bicycles and or electric scooters.

“We put in this very audacious goal” Herrington said. “If we get it right you’ll be able to go anywhere without crossing a street busier than the one you live on.”

The developer’s goal of fostering non-automobile transportation includes the ability to walk or ride an electric cycle to work. The City Place work force is already close to 20000 people with other existing buildings for Southwestern Energy St. Luke’s Health and the American Bureau of Shipping.

The extensive non-automobile transportation network with the green “alternative mobility pathways” was created with DMB making a major twist to one of the most highly-exalted land planning movements of the last 40 years – The New Urbanism. Advocated by a host of progressive planners including Miami architects Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and Peter Calthorpe of California The New Urbanism envisions walkable neighborhoods narrow tree-lined streets typically in a grid pattern and a central community plaza with housing and front porches that encourage interaction with neighbors on the sidewalk in a small-town fashion.

“I love New Urbanism and I’ve done a lot of it in the past. The problem is it’s very street centric. It’s all about the street – eyes on the street” Herrington said.

But what if the homes face a common greenbelt pathways and open space leaving auto access in the rear?

With its plan for City Place DMB Development is replacing much of the urban street pavement with green space and functional pathways and bicycle lanes.

“We took The New Urbanism that I love so much and just turned it inside out” Herrington said. The result is City Place’s plan for a massive network of green space and pathways forming an intricate community framework with many homes facing shared green space.

Walking and cycling will be a high priority in City Place’s final plan. “What we want to do here is this radical commitment to non-automobile transportation” Herrington said.

The Team

DMB is working with the Espiritu Loci planning firm in Arizona in conjunction with local architect Jim Wendt who was on-staff at The Woodlands for many years.

Alex Sutton who recently retired as co-president of The Woodlands Development Co. has been hired on as general manager of the CDC Houston/DMB Development residential joint venture.

Sutton commented that Houston builders have expressed interest in the new housing types planned for City Place and being part of something that feels like DMB’s denser projects out west.

Executives at the Patrinely Group which developed a number of the office properties in the project and a 60-acre commercial core of the development says this new residential is a natural fit.

“CityPlace was conceived as a dynamic 18-hour community” said Robert Fields President and CEO of Patrinely Group which has developed a number of the commercial properties in the project. “The addition of this residential program adds to the character of what we’ve set out to create.”

Another Phoenix Developer Comes to Space City

The last time a major Phoenix developer came to town – it was Del Webb – the creator of Sun City developments for mature adults. In the early 1960s Del Webb partnered with Exxon to develop the 10000-acre Clear Lake City adjacent to NASA’s Johnson Space Center. Clear Lake City set the tone for large-scale residential development in the Houston area for decades to come. The Del Webb/Exxon partnership led to the founding of the Friendswood Development Company which developed Kingwood Fairfield and a number of other Houston projects.

Del Webb or at least the wake of its entry into the market left a huge mark on Houston. Large-scale master planned communities such as 10000-acre projects that took 20 years to complete followed Clear Lake City.

But what Arizona-based DMB is doing with City Place may have even more of an impact on Houston.

The developers intend to popularize mid-density housing with its blend of patio homes townhomes and the like. For this project DMB’s Herrington rejects the notion of carving up the City Place land into a subdivision where 50-foot and 60-foot lots are divvied up among national builders for mass production. Herrington would consider that a failure.

This land presents opportunity.

“The real burden we have is to not screw this up” Herrington said. With tens of thousands of jobs already in place in the City Place this residential land creates the opportunity to develop a community where homes can be built near existing jobs and the tiny commute to work won’t require a car.

Herrington says DMB’s ambitions are high. City Place should be a development that is “important” – not just a money-maker. The hope is to make the project a place that is imitated by other developers. Herrington talks of sociology and the total human cost of commuting behind the wheel of a car for two hours a day.

Why can’t Elon Musk surround his next electric-car factory with a master planned community that allows Tesla workers to commute to work in a couple of minutes he asks.

This is Herrington’s moonshot. City Place could be the place that advances The New Urbanism. City Place could change the way master planned communities are conceived in Texas. And people wait to see the highest goal take shape: a community built with “a radical commitment to non-automobile transportation.”

With the last two nights spent at the Garden Inn Milan I have officially become a Diamond customer in the Hilton Honors Program. This was one of my goals for 2021 and I could not miss the opportunity to take advantage of the promotions put in place by Hilton to facilitate renewal or obtaining status in this difficult year of uncertainty.

In this article:

In fact the chain's loyalty program which has more than 4000 hotels worldwide has made life so much easier for loyal customers. There are 3 ways to become a Diamond: stay 60 nights in a year make at least 30 stays or accumulate 120k Honors points. Throughout 2021 these levels have been halved: 30 nights 15 stays or 60k points.

Approval of the Cards is at the discretion of American Express. The annual free Gold Card and Green Card fees are subject to reaching specific annual spending thresholds.

To this we must add that the program automatically reported 2020 nights as 2021 nights this means that we were not starting from zero but from the number of nights spent throughout 2020 another important help.

The stay I just completed is the 14th of the year but there are 15 nights which combined with the 16 in 2020 allowed me to cross the finish line and immediately see my level raised from Gold to Diamond which I will hold as a minimum until January 2023.

What changes from Gold to Diamond

Given that in Italy there is not as there is in other nations the possibility of having Diamond status through credit cards or similar products is absolutely a field-earned achievement. The difference between the two levels is enormous in so many ways.

The main benefit for Gold customers Level you get for free thanks to the American Express Platinum is free breakfast in (almost) all Hilton hotels worldwide alternatively you can receive a bonus in terms of HHonors points ranging from 500 to 1000 points per stay depending on the brand. With Diamond status you are spoiled for choice you get both.

The second benefit you get is the certainty (or near certainty) that you will receive room upgrades every time you book-not simple one-level upgrades but the ability to upgrade from a basic room to a suite.

The third benefit is the opportunity to accumulate 20% more bonus points per stay than the Gold level bonus points.

Then there are small benefits that enhance the stay for example a premium wi-fi connection compared to what is given to all customers reserved parking spaces in the parking lots and the guarantee that you can find a free room within 48h in all hotels a perk that does not make much sense at this time but will surely come in handy when the hotels are crowded again.

Last but not least guaranteed access to the Executive Lounges. at all hotels that offer this service. Executive lounges at Hilton hotels are lounges reserved for guests who book rooms that include lounge access or for Diamond members. Generally operating from early morning for breakfast to late afternoon it is always possible to find food and drink relax and work meet people in a setting that is normally located in one of the hotel's prime areas.

What is the value of the Diamond level

Of course it is impossible to put an exact value on Diamond status because it depends so much on how long you stay and especially where you stay. Being Diamond and going to the Maldives means being able to save so much in food & beverage during your vacation as well as the possibility of being promoted from an entry level room to a room that costs hundreds more each night.

On average I spend from 20 to 30 nights a year in a Hilton hotel so I can say that on balance between extra points (no less than 25k/30k) room upgrades and money saved for breakfasts lunches and business drinks in a nutshell I expect to save no less than 2000/2500 € until January 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8wNy8xOC9oaWx0b24tdG8tYWRkLXRocmVlLWFsbC1pbmNsdXNpdmUtYW5kLWx1eHVyeS1wcm9wZXJ0aWVzLWluLW1leGljby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton to add three all-inclusive and luxury properties in Mexico – Business Traveller,"Meanwhile in Tulum Hilton will open the new-build Conrad Tulum in the fourth quarter of 2021 featuring 349 rooms seven restaurants and bars and five swimming pools.

He talks goals plans for city. - Port Arthur News,"Port Arthur Fire Chief Greg Benson starts today. He talks goals plans for city. Published 12:51 am Saturday July 17 2021

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Greg Benson’s first day as the new Port Arthur fire chief is Monday but he’s coming in ready to put boots on the ground.

“One of the immediate (goals) is to get to know members of the department and members of the city” Benson told Port Arthur Newsmedia Friday. “A second goal is to know members of the community.”

During a panel interview June 2 Benson stressed the need for communication inside and outside of the department. The then-Chicago resident was one of three finalists following the January retirement of longtime chief Larry Richard.

Deputy Fire Chief Robert Havens served as acting chief in the interim.

Benson was officially hired Tuesday during a city council meeting when City Manager Ron Burton recommended him to council members. He was approved with a unanimous vote.

The incoming official last worked in Victorville California where he served as fire chief and emergency management director.

Ten years prior to his appointment the department had been dismantled and absorbed by a neighboring department. When the decision to recreate the department was made Benson was recruited to lead it.

And recruitment was something he stressed Friday as he spoke on his new role.

“I think Port Arthur is a central point for critical infrastructure and making sure the communities’ safety needs are met but also reaching out to the community and trying to foster community members to be in the safety field” he said stressing the need to foster interest in future firefighters and emergency service employees.

Emergency services was also something he touched on elaborating on a Stop The Bleed program he first spoke of during last month.

The national non-profit organization is focused on preventing unnecessary deaths by educating students public officials and the community.

“I’d like to present that all city employees have the opportunity to participate in Stop The Bleed training” he said. “To work with the high schools and college and also make it available to the greater community members as well.”

According to Stop The Bleed approximately 40 percent of trauma-related deaths are due to the consequences of bleeding. Although Benson said it doesn’t just apply to mass incidents.

“In one case a guy in Home Depot was pulling a mirror off the shelf” he said. “It fell and broke.”

The customer suffered from a traumatic cut but a store patron had been through Stop The Bleed training and was able to control the injury until emergency services arrived.

Benson has a Master of Public Administration and a Bachelor of Science and is currently enrolled as a candidate for Doctor of Education.

He is certified in cyber-security homeland security risk assessments in communities and hazardous materials.

“I looked at his qualifications as well as a long discussion I had with him and I think it will blend well with the institution of knowledge in the department” Burton said of his decision to hire Benson. “He has a very broad knowledge base as well that will help greatly and continue to nurture what we have in the department.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9ob21lL3JldGlyZW1lbnQtZGVzdGluYXRpb25zLWdlb3JnaWEtZmxvcmlkYS0yMDIxMDcxNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Georgia is rivaling Florida as a retirement destination,"With low home prices low taxes and a low cost of living Georgia is an increasingly attractive draw for retirees.

Home prices are another big selling point. The median home price in the Atlanta metro area was just $279300 during the first quarter of 2021 compared with $319200 nationally and $325000 in the Orlando metro area according to the National Association of Realtors.

“You’re able to get so much for your money” says Oliver Radvin senior consulting manager at John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

Georgia’s low cost of living and light tax burden mean the state ranks No. 3 in affordability nationally according to Bankrate’s latest Best States to Retire ranking. By comparison Pennsylvania ranks 35th in affordability and New Jersey 43rd.

Georgia’s appeal as a retirement destination is reflected by a new wave of active-adult communities in the state. Kolter Pulte and others are constructing communities marketed to retirees.

“Big builders are doing 55-and-older communities all over the state and they wouldn’t be doing that if there weren’t demand” Love says.

Homebuilder Kolter has developed its Cresswind communities for active adults in Peachtree City and other parts of the state. John Manrique Kolter’s senior vice president of marketing says many of Georgia’s active-adult buyers come not from out of state but from the Atlanta area.

That trend makes sense — the booming metro area is home to six million people. Atlanta and its suburbs are known for a strong job market that’s home to corporate headquarters such as those of Home Depot UPS and Coca-Cola.

Atlanta also is notorious for traffic. Kolter’s active-adult communities are far enough from the bustle of the Atlanta suburbs to feel slower but close enough that residents don’t feel as if they’ve abandoned their old lives.

“You’ve got the folks who have lived in the city or the suburbs for 10 20 or 30 years” Manrique says. “They’re raised their kids. They need an option for that next chapter in their lives.”

Georgia also is attracting new arrivals from the North and from Florida. While the Sunshine State has grown into the nation’s third-largest state it’s not for everyone — hence the trend of “halfbacks” the moniker for retirees who leave the Northeast for Florida then move to Georgia or the Carolinas.

“We do see quite a lot of people coming from the South” Manrique says.

In contrast to Florida and Tennessee which impose no state income taxes Georgia collects a state income tax. Its rate is as much as 5.75%. However Georgia exempts Social Security retirement benefits and other pension payments for residents 62 and older.

The tax break appeals to retirees relocating to Georgia from higher-tax states and to those retiring from jobs in Atlanta and weighing a move to Tennessee or Florida says Radvin of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

“These buyers are somewhat affluent” he says “but they are looking for a deal.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxtdG9ubGluZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2FydGljbGUvQWxkby1CdWVuZGlhLWNvbmNsdWRlcy1jb2xsZWdlLWNhcmVlci0xNjMyMzE2Mi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aldo Buendia concludes college career,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.lmtonline.com/sports/article/Aldo-Buendia-concludes-college-career-16323162.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxtdG9ubGluZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2FydGljbGUvQWxkby1CdWVuZGlhLWNvbmNsdWRlcy1jb2xsZWdlLWNhcmVlci0xNjMyMzE2Mi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS8yNS1nYW1lLWNoYW5naW5nLXByb2R1Y3RzLWhvbWUtb3JnYW5pemVyLTE2MTAxMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 Game-Changing Products for the Home Organizer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/25-game-changing-products-home-organizer-1610109 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS8yNS1nYW1lLWNoYW5naW5nLXByb2R1Y3RzLWhvbWUtb3JnYW5pemVyLTE2MTAxMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen
HON,Honeywell,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbmV5d2VsbC5jb20vdXMvZW4vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3L3F1YW50dW0tbWlsZXN0b25lLXdlLWNhbi1ub3ctZGV0ZWN0LWFuZC1jb3JyZWN0LXF1YW50dW0tZXJyb3JzLWluLXJlYWwtdGltZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quantum Milestone: We Can Now Detect and Correct Quantum Errors in Real Time,"Researchers at Honeywell Quantum Solutions have taken a significant step toward demonstrating the viability of large-scale quantum computing on its trapped-ion quantum computing technology.

The Honeywell team can now perform quantum error correction (QEC) which are protocols necessary to detect and correct errors in real time on a quantum computer. They demonstrated the ability to “protect” quantum information (prevent a quantum computation from being quickly corrupted by imperfections and noise) on the System Model H1. This is an important first in the quantum computing industry. Currently most demonstrations of quantum error correction involve correcting errors or “noise” after the procedure has finished running a technique known as post-processing.

In a paper published this week on arXiv researchers detailed how they created a single logical qubit (a series of entangled physical qubits) and applied multiple rounds of quantum error correction. This logical qubit is protected from two main types of errors that occur in a quantum computer: bit flips and phase flips.

Previously groups have looked at codes that only are capable of correcting a single type of error (bit or phase but not both) {Google IBM/Raytheon IBM/Basel}. Others have looked at quantum error detecting codes which can detect both types of errors but not correct them {ETH Google Delft}. Further still groups have demonstrated pieces of the quantum error correcting process {Blatt Monroe}.

“All of today’s quantum technologies are at an early stage where they must combat errors that accumulate during computations” said Tony Uttley president of Honeywell Quantum Solutions. “What the Honeywell team accomplished is groundbreaking. It proves what was once only theoretical that quantum computers will be able to correct errors in real time paving the way for precise quantum computations.”

Though the achievement represents progress toward large-scale quantum computing Honeywell researchers are still working to cross the break-even point at which the logical error rate is less than the physical error rate.

The need for logical qubits

To appreciate this achievement it is important to understand how difficult it is to detect and then correct a quantum error.

Quantum bits or qubits are fragile and finicky. They pick up interference or “noise” from their environment. This noise causes errors to accumulate and corrupts information stored in and between physical qubits. (Scientists call this decoherence.)

Attempts to directly detect and correct errors on a physical qubit also corrupts its “quantumness.” And cloning this data a method used in classical computing that involves making multiple exact copies of the information does not work in quantum (as prohibited by “The No Cloning Theorem.”)

To overcome these concerns several scientists most notably Peter Shor Robert Calberbank and Andrew Steane found a way around this at least in theory after studying how quickly qubits experience decoherence.

They demonstrated that by storing information in a collection of entangled qubits it was possible to detect and correct errors without disrupting quantum information. They called this assortment of entangled qubits a logical qubit.

Scientists have spent years developing codes and methods that could be applied to logical qubits to protect quantum information from errors.

What’s next

The next step is to break even crossing the point at which the logical qubit error rate is lower than the error rate for physical qubits. (Creating logical qubits and applying quantum error correction codes also can inject noise into a system).

The Honeywell team is closing in on that mark. To definitively demonstrate passing the break-even point the error rate per QEC cycle needs to be lower than the largest physical error rate associated with the QEC protocol.

“In the technical paper we point to key improvements we need to make to reach the break-even point” said Dr. Ciaran Ryan-Anderson an advanced physicist and lead author of the paper. “We believe these improvements are feasible and are pushing to accomplish this next step.”

From there the goal is to create multiple logical qubits which depending on the quantum technology requires better fidelities more physical qubits better connectivity between qubits and other factors.

An increase in logical qubits will usher in a new era of fault-tolerant quantum computers that can continue to function even when some operations fail. (Fault tolerance is a design principle that prevents errors from cascading throughout a system and corrupting circuits.)

“The big enterprise-level problems we want to solve with quantum computers require precision and we need error-corrected logical qubits to scale successfully” Uttley said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90ZWNobmV3cy5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzA3LzE4L2VuZ2luZWVycy13b3JrLXRvLWltcHJvdmUtYS0xMC1hcHUtaW5zdWxhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Engineers work to improve A-10 APU insulation,"The Ogden Air Logistics Center in Utah partnered with the Hill Center Test Authority in a component improvement project to identify material more suitable for the A-10’s Auxiliary Power Unit insulation.

The project is the result of the 419th Supply Chain Management Squadron’s continuing efforts in evaluating depot maintenance data and feedback from aircraft maintainers and using the information to modernize Air Force aircraft.

“Aircraft continually go through modifications to incorporate improved technologies. This project was identified as a venture that would offer significant cost savings and improve ease of maintenance” said Eric Collins an aerospace engineer with the 419th SCMS.

The APU a small gas turbine engine that starts the main engines and provides hydraulic and electrical power during aircraft maintenance can become very hot requiring thermal insulation to protect other aircraft components from heat damage. Insulation material is molded around the hottest section of the APU to reduce the surrounding temperatures.

As a result of the high temperatures this insulation material can fatigue crack and degrade causing many overhauled APUs to need to be reworked for insulation repair.

“This costs the government around $250000 per year and results in reduced time of APUs on aircraft” said Bobby Yen an aerospace engineer with the 419th SCMS.

“Finding material with improved durability and integrity will keep fully operational APUs on aircraft longer saving money and enhancing the A-10 mission.”

The SCMS team finished the first phase of the project which was a baseline test to gather an insulation temperature profile of the existing APU to determine if modern insulation materials would improve performance.

The first phase wasn’t without challenges. According to Yen in order to ensure accurate results performance requirements for component testing should be equal to or even more strenuous than what the aircraft experiences. Mimicking an actual aircraft environment proved to be not only difficult but also cost prohibitive.

“We really needed to simulate actual conditions surrounding the APU environment but we do not have a test facility that measures the heat that the APU radiates onto nearby surfaces” Yen said.

To solve the problem the team planned to travel to Davis-Monthan AFB Arizona to perform tests on an A-10 there. However that became unnecessary when the Center Test Authority which led the test planning and safety review for the project was able to secure an actual A-10 aircraft that was coming to Hill for regular maintenance.

The CTA coordinated with the A-10 aircraft depot scheduling team from the 571st Aircraft Maintenance Squadron and the A-10 System Program Office to schedule the A-10 to arrive several days early and allowing engineers to perform Hill’s first-ever pre-depot induction ground test.

“The outstanding collaborative support from many functions and organizations – such as the A-10 engineering test and logistics team the 309th Aircraft Maintenance Group’s security and ground support team and the 571st AMXG depot scheduling team – enabled effective test planning and execution to include early aircraft arrival for testing” said Roger Beal test engineer for the CTA.

The savings for performing the tests at Hill was estimated to be about $70000 according to Beal.

Teams are now in phase 2 of the project which includes designing and ordering prototype insulation materials. Phase 3 will be to perform insulation qualification testing at the APU depot test facility and then perform a comparison test in the same manner as the baseline test in phase 1 but with the new thermal insulation material installed to ensure temperatures are at or below the operational thresholds from the baseline test.

A date for when the project will be completed is to be determined. In addition to this project the 419th SCMS is currently involved in more than 20 improvement projects for secondary power systems across multiple aircraft platforms including B-1B B-2 F-15 A-10 F-16 KC-135 C-130 and E-3.

Former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Former Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker talks trade and the 2020 elections

Penny Pritzker on China Trade:

PENNY PRITZKER: But we've been through a lot of pain to get where we're at today. And so the question ‘Is it all worth it?’ We didn't make any structural change and it cost us about 10% of Wisconsin farmers are gone.

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: So you think it was not worth it? You think that this is hype?

PENNY PRITZKER: Well I think we're not as far along as we were told we are.

Penny Pritzker on Democratic Party:

What's going on in the Democratic party is recognition that while wages are rising they’re still not rising enough. That we have a lot of people that are struggling. We have a manufacturing recession going on. We still have challenges to deal with in terms of people being laid off because technology is you know supplanting their jobs.

Penny Pritzker on Warren Wealth Tax:

I don’t believe in a wealth tax. I don’t believe that will achieve the outcomes that are being promised. You know should someone like me pay more in taxes? Yes. We pay a lot in taxes. But should we pay more to address inequality? Probably. But I don’t think the wealth tax is the way to get there. I don’t think blowing up our health care system is the way to get there. So I struggle with the policies.

Honeywell CEO Darius Adamcyzk Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Watch CNBC’s full Davos interview with Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk

Darius Adamcyzk on CapEx Spending:

I'm a little bit worried about second half in terms of how people are going to act are they going to wait after election is that going to have some impact? I see this year a little bit different. I see this year as a little bit of weaker first half but better second half based on trade fiscal policies etcetera.

Darius Adamcyzk on Trade Deal:

I like the fact that the Phase One deal was done. And you know I think people are picking at the faults. But I think anytime two parties negotiating and you can some make progress it builds momentum. So I'm thrilled that that happened.

Darius Adamcyzk on Boeing Crisis:

I think Boeing is going to solve these issues. I mean they're a great American company. They're a great brand. I mean I know 737 Max obviously is getting a lot of attention. And you know there's been some wrong steps perhaps. But I’m very confident that A) that plane is going to fly again.

Workday Co-Founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri in Davos on his vision for company growth and more

Aneel Bhusri on Workday Future:

A big part is transitioning from being just really an HR software leader to now finance and planning and procurement. And that part of our business is now 20% of our business the non-HR piece and it's growing you know in the 40 to 50% range.

Aneel Bhusri on Machine Learning:

Machine learning is this great technology that lets you sift through massive amounts of data and make predictions.

These algorithms will actually predict the next right move for you and your career. It will automate audits so do intelligent auditing on the finance side where if it's been through enough audit cycles they'll just highlight the exceptions instead of having to go through every transaction.

Aneel Bhusri on Blockchain Credentials:

I think blockchain technology is looking for problems to solve. We actually found one to solve which is credentials. And the idea is that an employee should be able to go from company to company and carry their credentials with them.

Bain Capital Co-Chairman Stephen Pagliuca Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Bain Capital co-chair Stephen Pagliuca on the state of private equity

Stephen Pagliuca on Private Equity Misnomer:

There's a misnomer out there with all the politics: private equity is not about cost cutting it's about growth. No one wants to buy a company that is shrinking. And so we spend all of our time thinking how do we grow companies? How do we do more R&D? How do we invest in new products?

Stephen Pagliuca on Canada Goose Selling Like Hotcakes:

It's gone from like a $300 million company to a $3 billion company. And it has a wide product line. When you go into stores today fantastic sweaters. And what we found is millennials in today's market they want something that's going to last they want something that's functional. And so Canada Goose has built beautiful lasting products that are functional and they're selling like hotcakes.

Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries on 5G and the push for broadband

Mike Fries on Industry Moving Efficiently:

Yeah I think the industry is moving very efficiently into OTT apps. So if you think about our business we're just now aggregating Netflix and Amazon Prime and YouTube. And consumers are happy about that. We're not losing as many customers in Europe. The streaming wars have come but they're not as viral or problematic.

Mike Fries on Losing Customers:

We're losing you know in the Europe maybe 1 to 2% of our customers a year. I think in the U.S. it’s 4 to 5% if you include satellite. So we're you know we're declining more slowly. But there are certainly frictional costs to that. It's a revenue stream we want to protect. And the way we're protecting it we do the same thing Comcast is doing. Launching a really advanced version of our box that you can speak into and go to Netflix and go to Amazon or go to BBC or wherever you want to go.

Mike Fries on Liberty Cash Hoard:

Last year we bought about 3.2 billion worth of our stock. We did a tender offer at 27. Stocks at 20. So I'm feeling very good about that. We think it's worth 27. But we've had some issues obviously with our investors which we are addressing.

Mike Fries on Netflix Great Business:

He's going to have some challenges with Disney Plus and Peacock and others getting into the game and holding back content. But Netflix he's very specific about his strategy. And he's not going into sports he's not doing advertising. He's spending 15 billion a year on original content. And that you know that'll work for a period of time I think. So it's a great business.

Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman on new partnership with Airbus

Adena Friedman on Airbus Partnership:

What they've done is they've done a partnership with a company that tracks every ticket price every pre-trade and post-trade right? So before the purchase and after of every of every ticket price. And they're able to look at certain routes certain regions in the world. And they can say ‘Well how much is that price change?’ They create an index on that. And they therefore are now creating a derivative that they can be traded.

Adena Friedman on 2020 IPO Market:

The pipeline of prospects IPO prospects is very strong. Very interesting. I would say that both in terms of private equity companies--private equity health companies as well as technology companies the biotech industry continues to be very strong.

NYSE President Stacey Cunningham Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

NYSE president: We can’t underestimate the value of the public markets

Stacey Cunningham on Changing IPO Markets:

We shouldn't categorize it as a bad year. It certainly was a good year. I think what we saw at the end of the year is investors start to ask questions that they hadn't really been asking before as we saw the difference between companies performing well when they had strong profits or a path to profitability and those that had more explaining to do as to how they were going to get there.

Stacey Cunningham on 2020 IPO Market:

We have you know roughly 30 or so companies that have already filed with the SEC. Many more that are talking to us and looking to list in 2020. And you see a lot of interest in coming out to market tapping into what's there. But you see a slight shift in how they tell their stories.

Stacey Cunningham on Dual Class Shares:

If we were to say they can't be listed or they must have a Sunset provision they're likely to stay private. And then investors don't get access at all. And that balance is what I'm focused on.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp Speaks with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Watch CNBC’s Full Interview with Palantir CEO Alex Karp at Davos

Alex Karp on ICE:

We started this contract under Obama. And obviously there's a lot of concern legitimate concern about what happens on our border how it happens and what does the enforcement look like? Certainly it's a de minimis part of our work finding people in our country who are undocumented. But it's a legitimate complex issue. My personal position is we acknowledge the complexity. The people who are protesting whom I respect should also acknowledge that complexity.

Alex Karp on Trump:

I've been a card carrying progressive my whole life. My family is progressive. I have a degree in what amounts to progressive thought. Obviously there are many things I would do differently. And I've never stopped being critical this administration. I'm not planning to vote for this administration. So there are things I would do differently. The core issue though is who decides? And let me--to the people who want to reduce the complexity: it's commonly known that our software is used in operational context at work. Do you really think the warfighter is going to trust a software company that pulls the plug because something becomes controversial with their life? Currently when you're a Warfighter your life depends on your software. They will never trust you if you pull the plug just because you're unpopular.

Alex Karp on Apple Privacy:

I believe that the government should decide things and with the checks and balances involved in a court. The government needs to provide clear rules. Tech companies need to obey those rules. If there's a problem with those rules we should go to court. And I think all companies should should basically part of the problem is we need a clear codex of what you're allowed to do under what context. When data can be encrypted and when it shouldn't.

Alex Karp on Bezos:

Andrew Ross Sorkin: So Saudi Arabia clearly considered an ally of this country. The administration's made that very very clear. And yet just over the past 48 hours there's been a huge question about whether the leader of that country was using malware in Jeff Bezos’ telephone?

Alex Karp: Well first of all we've always made the decision not to be involved in intrusive software. So offensive attacks inside the cybercrime is precisely this context. Because in the cyber context intrusive infiltrations are questionable often and done almost ubiquitously. But if we were involved in that country and those things this would be a very serious discussion. It happens we're not involved and so it's not a serious discussion. But we do we do talk very seriously and with consequences with our non-Western allies.

Andrew Ross Sorkin: Do you think it's plausible that he sent malware to hack Jeff Bezos?

Alex Karp: I don't know the details. I do know that it's plausible that a nation state can hack your phone in a -- fairly quickly.

Alex Karp on Project Maven:

I can't discuss the specifics of a classified program but I can say if this were true I'd be very proud. And I have to say you know it's like now many people have criticized Google. My version of it is AI military AI I will determine our lives the lives of your kid. This is a zero-sum thing. The country with the most important AI most powerful AI will determine the rules. That country should be either us or a Western country.

Alex Karp on IPO:

Alex Karp: We've told the company we are going to IPO and we are preparing internally IPO. I think we will we will do very well in that context.

Andrew Ross Sorkin: And when you look though at some of the other offerings taking place?

Alex Karp: Well this is the thing: you can basically look at this last 10 years as a -- the clippable way of looking at Tech is that it was a bull market. The way we look at it Palantir looked at it for the last 10 years is it's a bull market for monopolistic companies and a bear market for everyone else. And if you look at it that way you don't finance growth with the sweet vapors of foreign venture funds. You focus on growth with high quality revenue. That's what we've done for the last 10 years. We've told people internally that IPO will happen and you'll see the results.

Paypal CEO Dan Schulman Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Watch CNBC’s full Davos interview with PayPal CEO Dan Schulman

Dan Schulman on Stakeholders:

It's multi-stakeholder and if you invest in one area inevitably you serve customers better. When you serve customers better regulators are happier. And then obviously shareholders benefit from that. But I think you have got to start somewhere.

Dan Schulman on Cyber Attacks:

Security has to be one of the biggest concerns that any business has. The average American business gets attacked 4 million times a year. The average consumer around the world loses an identity or as identity theft every two seconds. So this is a major problem. Financial firms get attacked millions of times practically every day.

Chevron CEO Michael Wirth Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”

Watch CNBC’s full interview with Chevron CEO Michael Wirth

Michael Wirth on Fink Letter:

We engage with BlackRock and Larry all the time on a regular basis. There really wasn't anything in that letter that was a surprise.

Michael Wirth on Energy Industry:

The energy system is enormous and it's growing. And we need everything. And it's always in transition. It's always been in transition from the beginning. And it's always moved to a more reliable and affordable and cleaner state. And that will never end.

Michael Wirth on Markets:

We've moved from a period of time where there was a belief we were approaching peak oil. And now we've got we're in an era of abundance. And it's really the U.S. and it's the unconventional horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing which has changed. So you really have a market now that is less prone to these volatile excursions.

U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres Speaks with CNBC’s Sara Eisen on CNBC’s “Squawk on The Street”

CNBC’s full Davos interview with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres

Antonio Guterres on Tensions:

We live in a difficult period where geopolitical tensions are also having an impact on the economy. Because they generated as you know the trade tensions technology tensions are even bigger in my opinion than trade tensions. And I think that these have slowed down growth and has contributed to the difficulties that the global economy is facing.

Antonio Guterres on Iran U.S. Tensions:

It's also essential to create conditions for a platform allowing a discussion about the future. Because this tension cannot remain forever. Because if this tension remains forever we are at the mercy of an incident that then can trigger an escalation that will become extremely dangerous.

Antonio Guterres on U.S. China Phase One:

The problem is not solved. And on the other hand I think that especially the technology divides is creating the risk. And the risk is that at a certain moment the two biggest economies tend to polarize around them dividing the global economy into two.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Speaks with CNBC’s Sara Eisen on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street”

Watch CNBC’s full interview with Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff

Marc Benioff on New Capitalism:

We are introducing a new capitalism here. Stakeholder capitalism. Which is a more sustainable capitalism a more equitable capitalism a more fair and more just capitalism. And it's not like the old capitalism.

Marc Benioff on Change the World:

Everybody realizes that you know we're in a planetary emergency. And we need to make changes. And business is the greatest platform for change. And if you ask what the narrative has been here at Davos there has been a tremendous narrative around what can we do to improve the state of the world?

Marc Benioff on Making Money Is Easy:

making money is easy but doing the right thing is not. And eventually every company comes to that point. And we've seen that over and over again. We don't have to look at history to understand that leadership eventually is about what you do and who you are.

Marc Benioff on You Can Do Both:

If business is really the platform for change and you have this amazing tech company platform what are you doing with it? Are you using it to make the world better? Or are you just using it to make money? And I think that that really is you know the choice here in Davos and in some ways it's a false choice. You can do both.

Marc Benioff on Elon Musk / Edison of Our Time:

I think he's the Edison of our time. I don't know where he comes up with these ideas. It's an incredible. I mean one day he is drilling holes in the ground. The next day he's landing a rocket on Mars based on artificial intelligence. The next day he has the most incredible automobile going down the road by itself. And I mean is an impressive entrepreneur and an impressive innovator.

Marc Benioff on Salesforce Growth:

We think that we're going to get to about 21 billion in revenue that's very exciting from about 17 billion in the year that we're finishing. And I continue to see digital transformation as the number one thing on every CEOs mind.",,,,,,

The dapper Mr. Peanut mascot who dresses in a top hat monocle and a cane was born in 1916 and laid to rest in January 2020 weeks ahead of the Super Bowl in an advertising campaign that featured him sacrificing himself to save actors Wesley Snipes and Matt Walsh after an explosive crash involving the NUTmobile. He was resurrected a few weeks later as a well-dressed Baby Nut in a Super Bowl LIV commercial.

The 26-foot-long NUTmobile which tours the country promoting the Planters brand also made a showing at Como Park. As part of its promotional campaign Mr. Peanut is distributing $5 million nationally mostly in the form of $10000 “Little Acts of Substance” checks to nonprofits and individuals involved in charitable acts. A total of 10 checks will be distributed in Minnesota this summer to five nonprofits and “five Minnesotans who add substance to their community” reads a prepared statement from the company.

On Thursday Mr. Peanut awarded $10000 to the Thielen Foundation a youth sports initiative founded by Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Use the HP Laptop Battery Finder to find the exact battery type.

More intrusive method: Remove the bottom case of your laptop and look at the battery itself.

This article will explain how to find the battery model number for your HP laptop. Then we'll go through a couple of ways to determine which hardware will work with your specific model of computer.

How Do I Know Which Battery to Buy for My HP Laptop?

You'll need to know what kind of battery is in your HP laptop when you need to buy a replacement or spare. You won't necessarily buy the same type of battery that came with your HP laptop when you go to get a replacement. You can get one based on the computer model you have or by looking at the actual battery.

How to Find a Battery Model from the Laptop Model

If you don't know the exact model number of your HP laptop the easiest way to find it is to look at the computer itself. Some fine print or a sticker will contain the information you need.

If you can't read the model number or the sticker is missing follow these steps on the laptop:

Open the Start menu. Click Settings. Select System. Scroll down the left pane and click About. Your model number will appear under Device Specifications.

Once you've found your model number you can do a web search for it and ""battery."" Alternatively you can use a tool on HP's website to get the information you need.

Navigate to the HP Laptop Battery Finder page. At the top of the menu click the tab for the family of laptop you own. Find your specific type of laptop in the left column and note the corresponding item(s) in the Compatible Battery section next to it. Search for that type of battery in the online store of your choice.

How to Find an HP Laptop Battery Model on the Battery

If you're planning on replacing the battery yourself you can check the battery's model number. Of course the specifics of accessing your laptop's internal components will differ based on the model but here's a general description of how it works.

You can get complete instructions by downloading the product manual on HP's support website.

Because this method is more invasive and risky than the previous one only use it if you're comfortable with removing the battery.

Power down your computer and unplug both the charging cord and any connected devices if you have any. Turn the laptop over. If necessary carefully remove the rubber feet to reveal screws. If your laptop has strip-style rubber feet remove them slowly and carefully; they can tear easily. Remove all of the screws attaching the bottom plate to the laptop. This hardware usually requires a 00 Phillips screwdriver. Keep track of which screws you remove from which holes as they may be different lengths. You'll need to make sure you return them to the same spots when you reassemble your laptop. If necessary use a thin plastic tool to carefully pry the bottom plate off. Locate the battery which will be on the same side of the computer as the charging port. The battery should have the model and power information printed directly on it; note this info and find a battery online or in-store either of the same type or with identical specifications.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9ocC1lbGl0ZS1kcmFnb25mbHktbWF4LXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Elite Dragonfly Max Review: A phenomenal business convertible,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9ocC1lbGl0ZS1kcmFnb25mbHktbWF4LXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZXVyb3BlLmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9hdXRvbWFrZXJzL3Z3LXN0YXJ0cy10ZXN0aW5nLTNkLXByaW50ZWQtc3RydWN0dXJhbC1wYXJ0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VW starts testing 3D-printed structural parts,"Volkswagen has begun certifying prototype 3D-printed structural components with the aim of producing 100000 parts annually by 2025.

VW is teaming with Siemens and HP to industrialize 3D printing of structural parts which can be significantly lighter than equivalent components made of sheet steel.

The automaker will use an additive process known as binder jetting to make the components at its main plant in Wolfsburg Germany. HP is providing the printers and Siemens will supply the manufacturing software.

The automaker said in 2018 that it wanted to begin mass production of 3D-printed parts starting with nonstructural elements such as license frames.

In binder jetting a liquid binder is sprayed onto a bed of powder solidifying the cross section of the component building it up layer by layer.

The component is typically designed using computer-aided design or CAD software before being sent to the 3D printer.

3D-printed components for the windshield pillar in the Volkswagen T-Roc convertible are already being certified at the company's plant in Osnabrueck Germany.

Weight reduction is a key advantage of the process as the components weigh less than half as much as conventional parts made from sheet steel. While VW has done crash testing of 3D components in the past the process was not cost effective until now a company release said.

Through an optimization process called nesting VW says it has figured out how to double the number of parts per print session.

Volkswagen plans to use this venture to further develop expertise in 3D printing of components and see what additional elements can be produced through this process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy9tZXJjZWRlcy1lNjMtYW1nLXBvd2VyZWQtZm9yZC1tdXN0YW5nLXdpdGgtNzIxLWhwLWlzLXRoZS1kZWZpbml0aW9uLW9mLXZpb2xlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mercedes E63 AMG-Powered Ford Mustang With 721 HP Is The Definition Of Violent,"Despite being tested in the wet the extremely powerful Mustang put its power to the ground surprisingly well

This 1969 Ford Mustang is thought to be the only example in existence fitted with an AMG engine and it is just as insane as you’d imagine.

This Mustang has come to life thanks to a company by the name of Anarchy Garage in the UK and was once left to rot in a field for over 20 years. Fortunately the tuning shop decided they would save the car and set about making it unlike any other.

Found at the heart of the Mustang is the 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8 from a 2021 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG that has had its ECU tuned and now pumps out 721 hp. This power is sent exclusively to the rear wheels thanks to the E63’s original 7-speed automatic transmission and makes for a Mustang that could give some supercars a run for their money.

Featured in this video from Officially Gassed the car picks up speed incredibly well. It has side-exiting exhaust pipes sounds absolutely insane and according to the YouTuber is one of the most violent cars he has ever experienced. The car was tested on wet roads but despite that it puts all of its power to the ground surprisingly well.

Not only has the Mustang’s new powertrain been lifted from a E63 AMG but much of the interior also comes from the Merc including the dashboard steering wheel center console and transmission tunnel. What’s perhaps the most incredible thing about this build is that Anarchy Garage says it only spent £24000 (~$33000) bringing it to life and that includes the cost of both the Mustang and the E63 parts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8va3VydW1hLW5ld3MuanAvZW4vcG9zdC9mb3JkX2YxNTBfbW9uc3Rlcm1hY2hpbmVfMjEwNzE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ken Block's 914 hp F-150 Hoonitruck Available for $1.1M | Motor Vehicle News,"Now’s the chance to get your hands on Ken Block’s one-of-a-kind 1977 Ford F-150.

Monster drifter as seen in Block’s Climbkhana and Gymkhana videos

LBI Limited a US-based car auction company is now listing a 1977 Ford F-150 with a price of $1.1 million. This isn’t just an ordinary old truck but a monster machine that was built by the famous rally driver Ken Block.

Ken Block’s Ford F-150 “Hoonitruck”

The F-150 Hoonitruck was built for Ken Block’s “Climbkhana Two” video which was viewed over 75 million times. In the video Block drove this Hoonitruck to climb the hills of “Heaven’s Gate” in China. Also the car won the “Best Dressed” award at Tokyo Auto Salon 2019.

Although the exterior retains the overall shape of a 1977 F-150 inside the hood stores a 3.5-liter V6 twin-turbo EcoBoost engine that comes straight from a Le Mans-spec Ford GT. The engine boasts 914 hp with 702 lb-ft of torque.

Not just the outstanding engine specs but also the gigantic intake manifolds and turbocharger sticking out from the hood is also something spectacular to see.

The body itself was turned into a tubular frame after the car was stripped down to get some repairs. It also comes with loads of one-off parts such as suspensions and forged wheels. Overall Block spent more than $1.5 million to build this monster.

Her father Hernan Humana coached Canadians John Child and Mark Heese to bronze in Atlanta in 1996 when beach volleyball made its Olympic debut and coached the duo again in 2000 in Sydney Australia.

Melissa knew from an early age what the pursuit of athletic excellence demanded.

""I remember my dad was gone a lot travelling on the world tour and trying to qualify for the Olympics and then he was gone for the Olympics"" she said. ""He gave my brother and I a map and put pushpins in all the different countries that he was going to be in.

""Every week he would travel to a new country we would attach a string from each push pin so we could follow along on his journey to the Olympics.

""That's when it really hit me what travelling and chasing this Olympic dream meant.""

The 28-year-old from Toronto hopes to close the circle with an Olympic medal and perhaps of a more precious metal than the one she wore around her neck as a child.

'My dad will still always be my coach'

Humana-Paredes and Sarah Pavan of Kitchener Ont. the reigning women's world beach volleyball champions play their first match at the Tokyo Olympics on July 24 against Katja Stam and Raisa Schoon of the Netherlands.

""I didn't know how much all those experiences were going to impact her and influence her"" Hernan Humana said. ""It has been quite dramatic.""

Will Melissa Humana-Paredes & Sarah Pavan make Olympic history for Canada? Duration 7:57 On this week's episode of Team Canada Today we go behind the scenes at training while Andi Petrillo tells you all you need to know about Olympic beach volleyball.

Hernan who also coached York University's women's volleyball team for a decade was his daughter's first coach and oversaw her indoor and beach teams until she was 17.

""My dad will still always be my coach"" Melissa said. ""He knows what it takes to get to the Olympics. He's always been around and been super-helpful.""

Mechanically some things I spent hours and hours teaching other kids to do I would toss a ball to her and she would do it right away. — Hernan Humana on his daughter's intelligence and passion for volleyball at a young age

Hernan played for the Chilean men's indoor volleyball team and Melissa's mother Myriam was a dancer.

Despite that lineage Melissa didn't stand out in terms of physical gifts to play beach volleyball her father said.

But she showed both sport intelligence and passion for volleyball at an early age.

""She was not tall; she was not physically strong. In fact if anything she was skinny and short"" Hernan recalled.

""She did some things that were unusual. Mechanically some things I spent hours and hours teaching other kids to do I would toss a ball to her and she would do it right away.

""If there was one cue maybe that was the cue to tell me there was something special about her.""

WATCH | Humana-Paredes Pavan win bronze in Switzerland:

Beach Bronze: Pavan Humana-Paredes finish strong in Gstaad Duration 3:25 Canada's Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes reached the Beach Volleyball World Tour podium in Switzerland after a 2-1 victory over Tina Graudina and Anastasija Kravcenoka of Latvia.

Melissa said her father didn't pressure her or her brother Felipe who also played on the world beach tour into volleyball.

But the siblings spent a lot of time around beach courts shagging balls for Child and Heese and liked what Hernan was accomplishing there.

""I was involved in a lot of sports but beach volleyball was my calling"" Melissa said. ""I knew that at a very young age. I was always around the beach at his practices and seeing how he worked. It was very intriguing to me.

Wrote book about life volleyball experiences

""Because I grew up as my dad's daughter I was exposed to this Olympic journey. It was part of my upbringing and my childhood. Olympics was just part of our family discussions.

""I also knew the sacrifices that had to be made the sacrifices my dad made.""

Hernan emigrated to Canada in 1980. He joined his family who had fled brutal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet five years earlier.

""I stayed behind playing with the national team and trying to help to restore democracy"" Hernan said. ""It sounds very idealistic and unrealistic as well at the time but that's what I did.""

Hernan wrote a book about his experiences titled Playing Under the Gun.

""I was a national-team player representing that country and it was not easy"" he said.

""As [Melissa] has learned from the stories from her mom and from me she has said 'wow my parents sacrificed so much so I can have these opportunities I have to use them.' Not so much as a weight on her shoulders but as a lifting opportunity.

""She's such a thoughtful little one in that sense. She hasn't forgotten who has been instrumental in helping her get where she is.""

Sacrifice in pursuit of Olympic glory is worth it says his daughter.

""I don't take it lightly representing Canada and wearing the Maple Leaf"" she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Dahle WCI Founder

Physician mortgage loans have been around since before I started writing this blog in 2011. All of the doctor mortgage lenders on our recommended list will lend to physicians and most will lend to dentists. Other professionals such as CRNAs attorneys veterinarians pharmacists podiatrists optometrists and even accountants often qualify as well.

What Is a Physician Mortgage Loan?

While some definitions differ my definition of a doctor mortgage loan is one that:

Does not charge PMI despite having a down payment of less than 20%

Will close with a signed employment contract rather than pay stubs

Only considers the payments of student loans (not the entire loan burden)

Is not an FHA or VA loan

Often these loans are “portfolio loans” (i.e. are kept in house at the bank that issued them). These lenders will also have experience working with self-employed (1099/independent contractor) doctors—which adds a level of complexity to getting a mortgage.

As a general rule the rates and fees on these loans can be slightly higher than what you can get with a 20% down conventional mortgage. That's the price you pay for the convenience of not having to meet conventional mortgage rules and for being able to use your down payment money to pay off student loans max out retirement accounts or something else.

The terms are highly variable and include 30-year fixed 15-year fixed 5/1 ARMs 7/1 ARMs and 10/1 ARMs. As a general rule I'm a big fan of a 15-year fixed mortgage but there are certainly other circumstances that merit using other types of mortgages. For example if you know you will sell in 7 years a 7/1 ARM is a fixed mortgage for you. Others prefer a 30-year amortization so paying it off in 10 or 15 is optional not mandatory.

Available lenders in your state can be easily found in the map below:

AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY DC

In today's post I wanted to discuss the real-life experiences of doctors who have shopped for a doctor mortgage in the last year or so. So I sent out an email to thousands of my readers and received a couple of hundred responses. Don't worry not all will be included in this post but it will be enough to provide a good sample of what I received.

Bear in mind that a lot of the variation in interest rates you will see below is explained by the fact that we are looking at people who took out mortgages between 2017-2019. These are not the same rates available to you today.

This can be an input to help you understand if a physician mortgage would be a good idea for you.

Doctor Mortgage Experiences from WCI Readers

Read Up and Shop Around

Lance went to Fulton Bank for his physician mortgage loan because he didn't have a down payment and a friend had a good experience there. He put 0% down and ended up with a rate of 3.75%. He advises “read up and shop around.”

10% Down Payment

Richard checked out US Bank and Fairway Mortgage and ended up with US Bank because “They were very helpful throughout and offered the best interest rate by quite a bit.” He put 10% down for a rate of 4.375%. That was a lot better than he could get with any other mortgage given the lack of a 20% down payment.

Closing Four Months Before Contract Start Date

Luke took a look at Arvest and US Bank and chose Arvest “because they allow closing up to 4 months before contract start date and they offer 100% financing up to a certain house price. I have been very happy with my choice to go with Arvest. Previously used Suntrust for my current home 5 years ago and there was a bit more ‘red tape' in getting things finalized compared to Arvest.” 0% down 4.25%. He went with a physician loan because he is “just finishing residency and do not have enough liquid cash for a conventional down payment.”

Low Down Payment on an Expensive Home

Alexander bought in 2017 using a physician mortgage in order to only put 10% down on a $930K home a year out of fellowship in a high COLA. Rate was 3.99% with Suntrust the lowest rate he found.

“Pushed Off to Someone Else”

Michael got a doctor's loan because he wanted to use his saved money for home improvements. He went with BMO Harris but was disappointed because the rate (4.75% with 5% down) ended up being 0.75% higher than the original quote and the agent “pushed me off to someone else in a different state who was not good at communicating or coordinating with the title company so we did not meet our deadline.” He wishes he would have used a 10-year ARM instead of the 15-year fixed he got.

Used a Local Credit Union

Andy checked out many options in Michigan but ended up with a local credit union because he got better rates 0% down and a 3% checking account up to $30000. He ended up with a 4.24% 10/1 ARM because he plans to pay it off in less than 10 years.

Make the Lenders Compete for Your Business

Lindsey looked at Citizens One and SunTrust and ended up putting 11% down with Citizens One to get a 3.375% 15-year mortgage. She advises “Make the lenders compete for your business. My husband and I have credit scores in the 800s so all the banks wanted our business. Be creative and don’t just focus on interest rates. Ask for credits at closing too.”

Days of 0% Down Gone for Jumbos

Rishi put 10% down to get a 4.375% interest rate on a jumbo loan with Citizens Bank. He says “make sure you have enough money saved prior to looking. Sounds obvious but you need more than just an attending contract before you get approved. The days of 0% down are almost gone definitely unavailable for jumbo loans.”

Two Doctor Loans in Three Years

Benjamin has done this twice once in 2014 (Key Bank 10% down 30-year fixed 3.675%) and once in 2017 (Fifth Third Bank 10% down 30-year fixed 4.125%).

Locked It in Instead of Saving Up a Down Payment

Adam went with the physician mortgage because he found the rates to be very competitive with conventional mortgages but only had to put 5% down. He says “I could have saved up a bit more for a higher down payment but rates were rising at the time so I wanted to lock it in quickly. Overall it's been a good experience.” He looked at US Bank and PNC Bank before going with Huntington Bank with a 3.325% 7/1 ARM.

A 5/1 ARM

Anton chose the physician loan because he didn't have a down payment. He chose Simmons Bank over Bank of America put down 5% and got a 5/1 ARM at 4.25%. He recommends looking for the best interest rate and locking it in.

Just Rent a Cautionary Tale

Ashmi closed on her doctor loan (5% down 3.75%) with Bank of America after checking out Wells Fargo and Union Bank. She says “I was in the middle of finishing fellowship moving preparing for my new job and also studying for my specialty boards. In retrospect I don’t think I was in the right mindset to make all these decisions. Waiting 3-6 months until we had the 10% down payment (and interest rates relatively low still) would have been a much better deal. Or waiting 1-2 years to have the full 20% down.

We underestimated the costs of buying closing and the amount of repairs/renovations buying a 40-year-old home in Los Angeles (which actually is “newer” for our neighborhood) would cost. Now that I have read WCI I would definitely recommend waiting. Renting what you need (i.e. we would have been fine in 2 bed/2 bath townhome or apartment) and then deciding the next step based on 1) finances 2) children/family 3) choosing the best neighborhood after exploring for a year or two.”

Mortgage Broker Instead of a Bank

Aaron a self-employed periodontist ended up working with a mortgage broker because the banks would not even look at him without two years of tax returns. 0% down 5.25%. He recommends “explore the options of “buying down” the interest rate by paying points. My broker gave me that choice and if you’re financing that large a number ($330K) it’s advisable to pay the thousand or so up front to buy a lower interest rate.”

Rates a Little Higher Than Before

This doc closed in November 2018 with 0% down and a rate of 5.4% on a $225K loan with Sun Trust. He is pleased but hated all the paperwork.

A Serious Mortgage Loan Shopper

Ryan bought early in attendinghood and so didn't have a down payment but doesn't regret it given other job options he had in the area if the first didn't work out. He emailed 8-10 lenders off this site and 3 local banks and credit unions but only had 3-4 email back. He simply chose the best rate he could get which was a local bank who gave him a 90/10 loan instead of a doctor loan. The 90% loan had a 30-year term 10% loan had a 5-year term but both were fixed at 4.25%.

He says “Everyone seemed helpful I'm sure they will be because they are about to make a lot of money off of you. I seemed to get the best responsiveness from the local folks and actually the best rate as well. I highly suggest shopping around—I had rates range from 4.375% to 5.75% that can really change payment structures. Overall this was a bit more stressful and difficult than refinancing my student loans.”

Ask Who Will Service the Loan Post-Closing

Sara used First Citizens Bank and then refinanced from 4.75% to 3.99% with Suntrust 6 months later after her credit score improved and she had an improved loan to value ratio after doing some renovations. Both were 30-year mortgages. Sara found SunTrust to have a lower rate but higher credit standards. She was surprised to find rates to be similar to conventional mortgages.

She and her husband really liked the “portfolio loan” aspect of the physician loans. “For us it seems like physician mortgages are serviced by the actual bank who loans the money. This has been a much better experience than previous conventional mortgages that were sold to a third-party servicer. For example I had a house before meeting my husband (he's the physician in our relationship) and it's serviced by Rushmore Lending Group after being sold from the original bank I financed through. Horrible horrible experience with Rushmore in attempting to obtain information early pay-off escrow etc.

In contrast both First Citizens and Suntrust kept our loan in their portfolio. It's been super easy to set-up extra principal-only payments as well as obtain information anytime about the loan. That can be a real win time-wise. And if needed I could go into my local branch and talk to the bank about the loan at any time.”

Did as Much by Email as Possible

Jimmy is now coming out of fellowship and recently got preliminary quotes from 13 lenders (Suntrust Synovus First Tennessee BB&T BBVA Citizens Physician Loans US Bank FNB IBeria Simmons UMB and Willow Bend) and went with First Tennessee because they had the best terms (0% down to $1M 5% down to $1.5M) rates were as good as anyone else's and the agent was easy to work with. 5% down 4.25%. He says “I sent a form email to everyone on your website and got some information on basic terms and conditions and then circled back with those who had agreeable basic terms to get final rate quotes before proceeding with the “winner.” I tried to do as much as possible via email so as to have minimal impact on my day-to-day work. If people weren't willing to work via email they were cut. At the end of the day I figure that they are competing for my business and that I'm not required to bend to their needs in order for them to get my business.

Used the WCI Recommended Mortgage Lenders

Nabil looked at Regions Bank BBVA and Fairway before going with Cadence Bank with 5% down and a 4.375% 30-year fixed mortgage. He says “All the lenders I reached out to were recommended by WCI for physician loans in Texas. They all provided good service and an overall good experience. I mentioned I found them through WCI. Went with the one that gave me the best rate. No issues with the process and closed on time and everything went smoothly.”

Careful with Construction Loans

Elizabeth looked at Bank of America and then settled on SunTrust for a 4.49% loan with 5% down. She warns “I found not all banks were willing to do physician mortgages for new construction so that's something to ask about up front if that's what you're planning. ”

Expect Some Inconvenience

Tyler just closed on a house last month with a physician mortgage to avoid PMI and put less down. He put 10% down and got 4% with US Bank. He notes “Working with someone in another state was a little inconvenient since there were no person to person meetings. There were lots of emails and scanned documents with some things getting lost.”

Rate Was Most Important But Service Matters Too

Steven's wife is coming out of residency and they wanted a mortgage that didn't count her student loans and would accept her signed contract. They were quoted 5% down 4.99% by Fairway but are looking at a local bank offering 0% down 4.25%. They were willing to put more down but there wasn't much benefit. He said “Fairway was great to work with. They went back and forth with me on the various options (fixed vs. variable 30 vs 15 buy down options etc.) updating the presentation with each of my requests. They answered all my questions. Honestly Fairway was so helpful I feel kinda bad going with the local bank especially since Fairway doesn't charge an application fee (so we got all their help for free). But the rate difference is significant and it gets us established with a local bank which could be helpful down the line especially since I'll likely be self-employed (in a non-medical field).”

Flexibility Matters

Aubrene looked at Fifth Third Bank and some local banks and chose Fifth Third because “they were more willing to be flexible with closing dates and paperwork.” She put 5% down and got a 4% rate.

Closing This Month

Jessica is closing this month with Fulton Mortgage after looking at SunTrust. 4.25% on a 15/1 ARM with 6% down on an $850K home. She is looking forward to using her cash to pay off student loans instead of a down payment.

I don't dare make this post any longer but after looking through more than 100 emails the story is mostly the same. Mostly great experiences with minor inconveniences and the occasional major hassle. Rates mostly in the 4-5% range—again be mindful that these experiences were sent to us in 2019 and rates are sure to change. Down payments mostly in the 0%-5% range. People mostly doing it because they don't have down payment money or have a better use for it but still expect to be in the home for many years. The amazing thing is just how many different lenders people are using. There really was no one lender that stood out over the others. You just need to take a look at the ones in your state and shop around to get the best rate terms and service for your personal situation.

Its Watson supercomputer had just trounced Ken Jennings the best human “Jeopardy!” player ever showcasing the power of artificial intelligence. This was only the beginning of a technological revolution about to sweep through society the company pledged.

“Already” IBM declared in an advertisement the day after the Watson victory “we are exploring ways to apply Watson skills to the rich varied language of health care finance law and academia.”

But inside the company the star scientist behind Watson had a warning: Beware what you promise.

David Ferrucci the scientist explained that Watson was engineered to identify word patterns and predict correct answers for the trivia game. It was not an all-purpose answer box ready to take on the commercial world he said. It might well fail a second-grade reading comprehension test.

His explanation got a polite hearing from business colleagues but little more.

“It wasn’t the marketing message” recalled Mr. Ferrucci who left IBM the following year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wMDEyNTc5MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frank Adam Luba Jr. Obituary,"Frank Adam Luba Jr.

The computerized spreadsheet is likely the business world’s most important invention that came out of a homework assignment.

From class assignment to commercial product



Dan Bricklin was a young computer programmer attending Harvard Business School in Cambridge in 1978. He had an assignment for his advertising class that involved producing financial projections for various scenarios for a marketing budget. He and Bob Frankston a friend from his undergrad days at MIT wrote a computer program to do the calculations. Bricklin scored high on the assignment which astounded his professor and classmates. A year later the program called VisiCalc was released commercially for the Apple II computer.

VisiCalc was the “killer app” of its time and one of the programs that propelled the personal computer to become a critical tool in the business world. Before then it was considered more of a hobby for computer fanatics. For the first year of its existence VisiCalc was only available for the Apple II. Sales of that computer increased dramatically many of them to small businesses who wanted to use VisiCalc. Even if they had other computer systems people were willing to pay $2000 for an Apple II to run a program that cost $100.

Lack of patent made it harder to protect



Two years later the first IBM PC was released and a version of VisiCalc for that platform soon followed and sold 300000 copies. VisiCalc would go on to sell about one million copies in total during its history its price eventually rising to $250. One of the factors that reportedly led to VisiCalc’s demise was that it was not patented.

“In 1979 when VisiCalc was shown to the public for the first time” Bricklin explained on his personal website www.bricklin.com “patents for software inventions were infrequently granted. Programs were thought to be mere mathematical algorithms and mathematical algorithms as laws of nature were not patentable.”

But that doesn’t mean Bricklin and others at the company that sold VisiCalc commercially Personal Software later VisiCorp didn’t try to protect its most valuable asset. They engaged a patent attorney to explore the option of patenting the program.

“The patent attorney explained to us the difficulty of obtaining a patent on software” said Bricklin “and estimated a 10% chance of success even using various techniques for hiding the fact that it was really software (such as proposing it as a machine). Given such advice and the costs involved we decided not to pursue a patent. Copyright and trademark protection were used and vigorously pursued.”

A major competitor emerges



The likely fatal blow to VisiCalc came in 1983 with the introduction of a competing spreadsheet program from Lotus Development Corporation called Lotus 1-2-3. Mitch Kapor a former VisiCorp programmer made 1-2-3 take better advantage of the IBM PC’s memory display and performance capabilities. He also made it compatible with VisiCalc to allow users to easily switch to using 1-2-3 and use their existing spreadsheets. Sales of VisiCalc slowed and by 1985 VisiCorp was bankrupt. Lotus acquired VisiCalc and stopped selling it so 1-2-3 could continue its rise unimpeded.

In 1999 21 years after Bricklin presented VisiCalc to his class Harvard Business School renamed the room where it happened. It is now known as the Dan Bricklin Classroom in his honor with a plaque that says “Forever changed how people use computers in business.”

Earlier this month Intel VP Rebecca Weekly became president and chairperson of the board of the Open Compute Project an influential open source hardware organization started by Facebook Intel and other companies.

The OCP helps companies to share their designs and best practices for data center and hardware projects. Facebook laid the groundwork for the organization in 2009 when it was rapidly building data centers wanted them to handle its massive troves of data in a more energy and cost efficient way. The firm ultimately created a data center that was 38% more energy efficient to build and 24% less expensive to run than its previous data centers and in 2011 it shared these designs with the public and co-launched OCP in collaboration with Intel Rackspace Goldman Sachs and Sun Microsystems cofounder Andy Bechtolsheim.

Aside from Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake releases being shown the roadmap also shoes the releases of both hybrid Alder Lake-S desktop and Alder Lake-P mobile vPRO CPUs.

2 of 9

When talking about these two hybrid Alder Lake V PRO versions they are usually not created for normal consumer or gamers but for businesses. The two hybrids are to offer validity managing from a remote setting and higher levels of security for up to fifteen months until the launch of the following series.

The specifications for the Alder Lake-S desktop model shares the exact same core set which is 16 cores (8+8 cores) with 24 threads for model number i9-12900K which has already had information released previously. The Alder Lake-P mobile model is to offer fourteen cores however splitting the cores by 6+8 and to offer a higher user efficiency and productivity during workloads.

The Alder Lake series when first released was Intel's first foray into hybrid technology for their CPUs. Since then with the Tiger and Rocket Lake CPUs to continue with utilizing hybrid technology into the future including hardware-guided scheduling design optimizations and energy-aware core parking.

When it comes to I/O the Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake CPU lineup will feature both PCIe Gen 5 & PCIe Gen 4 support Intel WiFi 6E (Gig+) and Thunderbolt 4 support. For memory Alder Lake CPUs will come with a wide array of options ranging from DDR5/DDR4 for the desktop platform and LPDDR5 / LPDDR4 for the mobility platform. The Alder Lake Desktop platform is also expected to adopt the ATX12VO power connector standard. — Hassan Mujtaba Senior Hardware Editor of Wccftech

While the information leaked to VideoCardz shows that the vPRO models are to be Windows 10 supported especially through 2022 it is unknown whether support for Windows 11 will be maintained further after Windows 10 is replaced. With new information released about compatibility for Windows 11 we may end up seeing support once Microsoft releases their revamped Windows OS.

Intel Core i9-12900K QS is now available on the black market

According to Yuuki_AnS qualification samples of Intel Alder Lake-S processor are now available on the black market in China.

The leaker claims that samples of Core i9-12900K are now available for around 6900 to 7500 CNY (1064 to 1157 USD) on the Chinese black market. We have confirmed that Qualification Samples are indeed available for sale however the quantity of these samples is still limited greatly increasing the risk of the sample’s source being revealed. This is why the sellers and leakers are still reluctant to share photos of the Alder Lake-S processors.

It is quite a common theme to see engineering and qualifications samples showing up on the black market and even services like eBay. Those products are often offered with slightly different specifications than retail samples for example different clock speed or disabled functionality however by design they are often identical to the final product.

At this moment purchasing a qualification sample or signing the embargo with Intel are the only ways to get access to Alder Lake-S processors. Neither the series nor the LGA1700 platform has been released yet which means that the potential buyer is also required to obtain a next-gen motherboard which may be even harder than finding an i9-12900K sample for sale.

The specifications of the Core i9-12900K processors are already known. This SKU offers 8 high-performance Golden Cove cores and 8 high-efficiency Gracemont mini cores. In total the processors offer 16 cores but since Gracemont does not support HyperThreading the 12900K only offers 24 threads.

In terms of clock speeds leaks have revealed that the i9-12900K QS has a boost clock up to 5.3 GHz for big cores and 3.7 GHz for small cores. The power limits are 125W and 228W for PL1 and PL2 values respectively. Intel Alder Lake-S desktop series is now expected to debut in the fourth quarter of this year however Intel is also preparing mobile S series and vPro models both rumored to arrive next year.

Here’s how it works

Back in April an alleged Intel roadmap had leaked according to which the company appeared to be planning the upcoming 12th gen Alder Lake-S desktop launch for mid-Q3 or Q4 of this year. This may still be true but a new roadmap has leaked today that's dated back to January containing information on Alder Lake vPro parts. According to it Intel's Alder Lake platforms - both the desktop-based Alder Lake-S as well as the mobile Alder Lake-P - might not be arriving before Q1 of 2022.

Unfortunately we have no way of knowing which one of the leaked roadmaps is the latest. In general companies delay product launches and rarely expedite them. In this time of global chip shortage the former seems more likely. Then again Intel has been struggling against AMD's Ryzen offerings in the desktop segment and would want to get its processors out as early as possible.

There are hints that Alder Lake - at least on desktops - is probably not too far away considering we already have compatible DDR5 memory out as well as spares of socket LGA 1700 selling online. And vPro parts do normally tend to be launched close to the general SKUs.

Moving on from there we are also greeted today with purported new information regarding Alder Lake mobile platform. There is the mention of Alder Lake-M as well as all-new H55 parts that now raise the TDP level of the chips beyond 45W. We were already aware of Alder Lake going up to 14 cores and 20 threads (14C/20T) comprising six large Golden Cove cores and eight Gracemont cores for a (6+8) layout. However the apparent new H55 parts will rival that of desktop SKUs with a 16C/24T configuration.

The integrated graphics in these chips appear to be cut down significantly compared to the 14C/20T Alder Lake-P parts. It is alleged that there will only be 32 graphics Executions Units (EUs) in H55 SKUs compared to 96 EUs on Alder Lake-P.

Lastly there is a slide relating to the Windows support for Alder Lake platforms according to which the 12th gen Intel processors are supported by Windows 10 version 20H2 and newer.

Crypto is deflationary Credit/debit card transaction fees: new legal threat Credit/debit card transaction fees: new market threat Ethereum – bear market helps some use cases Ethereum blockchain-based Axie Infinity – Ethereum-based social game lets you play to earn

Bitcoin’s scarcity value and underlying hard-money ethos cemented the appeal of cryptocurrencies but the true technological innovation will always be the smart contract which lets anyone with an internet connection program instructions into their money cheaply. Thus in this analyst’s view the tech is deflationary like every other piece of software (automation tool) ever written. No wonder crypto is so politically polarizing! For an illustration of this trend in action let us ponder the chart below which shows that the S&P 500 is 70% less labor intensive than it was in the 1980s. And yet the pace of “deterioration” (“improvement”?) has stalled out in the last decade. Surely that goes against the media narrative and our own lived experiences at the self-checkout lane. What is going on? Could it be that if crypto were captured in the S&P 500 then the trend line would have continued to fall?

S&P 500: Total Number of Employees to Total Revenues Ratio

Well Bitcoin and Ethereum together have settled a cumulative value of over $8T earning $46B in revenues for miners along the way.

Neither has any real “employees” to speak of.

Meanwhile the smallest market cap in the S&P 500 is $5.6B but on July 7 2021 there were 22 cryptocurrencies with a market cap greater than $5.6B  according to Bloomberg data.

If we removed the 12 smallest companies by market cap (U.S. is approximately 55% of global market cap) in the S&P 500 and replaced them with just BTC and ETH the above chart would fall from 2.10 to 2.09 according to my calculations of Bloomberg’s data.

Here’s another way to think about it:

The largest Bitcoin miner in the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index is Marathon Digital (MARA mkt cap $2.8B).

The company has 3 full-time employees (Bloomberg data) vs. consensus of $250M 2021 revenues. That’s a 0.01 ratio of employees per $1M revenues.

Riot Blockchain (RIOT mkt cap $3B) another miner in the index reports 8 employees supporting 2021 estimated sales of $205M for an employees-per-$1M-revenues ratio of 0.039.

Coinbase the largest index constituent is expected to produce $6.3B in sales from its 1249 employees for a ratio of 0.2.

All told the average revenue of companies in the index which includes heavyweights like NVDA and TSM is $4.84B and the average number of employees is 3140 producing an average employees per $1M/revenue of 0.65. As a reminder the S&P is at 2.1.

Looks to me like America is enjoying its extra leisure time.

Add financial services to your list of inflation concerns? Well let’s see if regulators and courts get involved.

…the fees they charge merchants for the right to swipe have remained sticky according to the Fed’s biennial survey updated April 2021.

Thus merchants and consumers are shouldering an increasing proportion of the rising fraud losses associated with e-commerce (my son just got scammed for $1000 selling an item on eBay and zero recourse).

Source: Jefferies.

But now there is some hint of a backlash both in the courts and in the markets to these sticky fees.

In the courts:

In April a group of merchants in North Dakota sued the Fed in Federal Court claiming that “for a decade the [Federal Reserve] board has failed to properly follow Congress’ instructions to ensure that debit card processing fees are reasonable and proportional to the costs of debit card transactions. American consumers and merchants continue to suffer the same harms that prompted Congress to act in the first place. Enough is enough.”

For background in 2011 the Fed initially said interchange fees would be limited to 12 cents per transaction. After negotiations with the banks that cap was raised to 21 cents plus another cent for fraud prevention and 5bps for losses.

In the end the $24B in interchange revenue to banks from merchants (and consumers) may seem like a small number but since it covers such a wide swath of the U.S. economy this lawsuit bears watching.

Also worth watching on the legal front: the Fed’s looming clarification on card-not-present debit charges which is now in the public comment period and affects some ~16% of Visa’s revenue according to Bernstein analysis. Visa disclosed a DOJ civil investigation on this topic in March.

As for the market-based disruption in payments there is a $13B market cap payments company that just went public via direct listing in London the former TransferWise now just Wise.

Wise promises a 70bps take-rate on international transfers with 38% of transactions settling instantly.

According to its prospectus Wise “replaces traditional international banking for 10 million personal and business customers.”

Wise facilitated $74B in volumes earning $581M in topline for shareholders in FY2021 a 79bps “take-rate” (still nearly 2x Ethereum platform costs – see exhibit below).

Source: Wise prospectus.

And yet given the threat from even cheaper cryptocurrency payment alternatives…

… I confess I am somewhat surprised there was no mention of crypto or blockchain in the WISE prospectus as a risk factor as AirBnb famously included. Instead WISE referred generally to its mission to “reduce our fees to zero.”

Source: Wise prospectus.

It’s hard to reduce fees to zero unless you have a token-based ecosystem in which the unit of exchange is also used for transaction fees that are distributed to participants instead of run through a corporation that pays salaries (ETH!).

(I guess you can also get there if you get paid for order flow.)

Anyway the billionaire co-founder of WISE is 40-year-old Estonian Taavet Hinrikus.

He sold shares in the company to provide liquidity for the direct listing according to Bloomberg. He has invested in multiple blockchain projects such as Curve & Radix (which will launch its Mainnet on July 28). His partner in their new VC fund told TechCrunch in March: “On a high level you can think of DeFi as just a natural extension of our broader ‘future of money’ financial freedom thesis.”

WISE stock trades at 21x trailing sales per Bloomberg and the prospectus.

Much of crypto trades much cheaper:

When Ethereum hit $4300 in April it cost more than $40 to send an NFT on the network and that was clearly not sustainable.

But just as Google really took off during the recession and broadband rout of 2002-2004 the key question for ETH is whether enough latent demand materializes during now-weak pricing to soak up the new network capacity with Web 3.0 killer decentralized applications (DApps).

On that front it is encouraging to note the momentum of Axie Infinity an Ethereum blockchain-based trading and battling game that allows players to collect breed raise battle and trade token-based creatures known as “Axies.” Players can trade Axies with the AXS token stake their coins for weekly rewards and participate in governance voting. Max supply is capped at 270 million and importantly in contrast to NBA Top Shot the tokens can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. Axie Infinity protocol revenues have grown 405% in the last 30 days surpassing even the lending platforms like Aave Compound and Uniswap according to TokenTerminal. Axie is now the most liquid digital collectibles marketplace in the world; its $2.4B in annualized gross merchandise value exceeds OpenSea NBA Top Shot CryptoPunks and Rarible according to Dappradar.

Meanwhile AXS lets you make money while playing a social game collects a 4.25% marketplace fee on Axie transactions and trades on less than 10x sales according to TokenTerminal.

Clearly the market doubts the sustainability of the game and the business model.

Blockstream proposes digital blockchain bond for El Salvador.

Analysis: Some might say a USD bond defeats the purpose of El Salvador’s Bitcoin-as-legal-tender gambit but think of it another way: when was the last time you bought a single issue sovereign? I’m thinking El Salvador 4.25% 2030s (a guess) that trades on FTX could attract plenty of GME/AMC YOLO types.

Hong Kong’s shuttered newspaper Apple Daily will live on in blockchain form.

Analysis: the value of censorship resistance should rise commensurate with the rise of censorship.

This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Even the cornfields across from Nathan Saunders’ modest saltbox-style home and 5-acre lot added to the peaceful setting where he and his wife raised three boys.

Since January however the couple has questioned whether they’ve been poisoned for decades in their own sanctuary. Water collected from their well contained 850 times as much PFAS as new Maine health standards say is safe and 185 times more of the industrial chemicals than federal regulators say should be in drinking water.

The cause of the contamination is now clear: Sludge from paper mills or wastewater treatment plans that was applied as fertilizer. The sludge contained high levels of the “forever chemicals” unbeknownst to the farmers who spread it for years on those cornfields or homeowners all along Saunders’ road whose wells draw from underground water tables.

And the source of those chemicals? Well that’s just “a matter of deduction” Saunders said.

“These are man-made chemicals they shouldn’t be in our well water – and I have two paper plants within a few miles of my home” he said.

For well over a century the paper industry has been a core part of both Maine’s economy and the state’s environmental challenges. Today’s paper mills are dramatically cleaner than a few decades ago thanks to better technology and environmental laws shepherded through Congress by the late Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie who grew up along the heavily polluted banks of the Androscoggin River.

But growing health concerns about PFAS – per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances – are shining an intense spotlight on industries that utilized the substances for decades to produce everything from nonstick cookware to waterproof jackets and countless other products that are everywhere in modern culture. Dubbed forever chemicals because of their extreme durability some compounds within the PFAS family have been linked to cancer kidney disease low birthweight high cholesterol and immune system disruption among other problems.

Paper mills have used a lot of PFAS – and in some cases still do – in the coatings that keep grease or liquids from soaking through picnic plates takeout food containers pizza boxes microwave popcorn bags and fast-food wrappers.

“They have legacy use of PFAS almost certainly” said John Gardella an attorney at CBMG3 Law in Boston who specializes in environmental law and advises clients on PFAS issues. “The question is how long were you using it and what did you do with the (sludge) that came from the waste?”

According to records compiled by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection which licensed and regulated the land application of sludge eight paper companies spread more than 500000 cubic yards of paper mill waste in Maine between 1989 and 2016. That is a conservative and potentially incomplete figure nor does it include the hundreds of thousands of cubic yards spread by wastewater treatment plants some of which process paper mill sludge and wastewater.

Not all paper mills in Maine or nationwide have used PFAS. And while environmental and health advocates disagree chemical industry representatives say newer varieties of PFAS do not pose the health threat of earlier compounds no longer in use.

But DEP staff members now face the daunting task of determining which among more than 500 sites that received sludge from wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities should get top priority for testing based on the volume of waste and the source of that sludge. Sites that received waste from paper mills tanneries and electroplating facilities could get higher priority because of potential PFAS contamination.

“It is absolutely a huge undertaking” said DEP Commissioner Melanie Loyzim. “We are going to be sweeping across the state and keeping fingers crossed that we will find positive results rather than the heartrending results we have seen out of Fairfield.”

CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT

Gardella said as more states begin testing drinking water for PFAS – as Maine is set to require by the end of next year – their regulatory agencies will also try to track down the source of any contamination that turns up.

Manufacturers’ legal use and disposal of the chemicals decades before the current health concerns “doesn’t protect any company from legal liability down the line” said Gardella who has written about PFAS lawsuits for the National Law Review.

“And that is the issue that these companies particularly paper mills have to face” he said. “The fact that they didn’t know the dangers of PFAS because (chemical manufacturers) duPont or 3M didn’t tell them that doesn’t matter in these lawsuits.”

In fact Saunders filed one of the lawsuits that Gardella and other attorneys are closely tracking.

The Fairfield resident is the lead plaintiff in a class-action suit accusing paper companies of “willful wanton reckless and outrageous use emission discharge disposal distribution and spraying of PFAS throughout Somerset and Kennebec Counties.”

The lawsuit initially named only one paper mill as a defendant: The Sappi North America facility in Skowhegan although previous owners S.D. Warren Scott Paper and Kimberly-Clark were also named. But Saunders’ attorney expanded the list of defendants last month to include Huhtamaki’s paper mill in Waterville the Jay mill now operated by Pixelle Specialty Solutions (formerly Verso) and a half-dozen other companies currently or formerly involved in papermaking in Maine.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Determining which Maine paper mills have used PFAS in their manufacturing processes is extremely difficult because they were not required to report that data under either state or federal laws. Paper companies are also notoriously competitive and secretive about their processes.

That changes this year.

Industrial facilities nationwide were required to report discharges of more than 120 types of PFAS in reports due to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month. All of Maine’s paper mills as well as hundreds of other facilities both public and private are required to file reports to the Toxics Release Inventory.

Data from the closely watched TRI likely won’t be available until later this year. But the reports will provide the first-ever comprehensive assessment of PFAS releases into the air water and soils in Maine and across the country.

Unfortunately those reports will only reflect current not historic uses of PFAS.

Few representatives of paper companies responded to interview requests or questions from the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram about current or past use of PFAS.

One of the companies that did not respond to multiple requests is Huhtamaki the Finland-based company that manufactures the Chinet brand of paper dishware in Waterville. A California class-action lawsuit against Huhtamaki claims Chinet is made with PFAS. And the Waterville facility is the largest single contributor of wastewater to the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District plant that was licensed to spread treated sludge on farm fields in Fairfield Unity Benton and other towns.

Sappi has denied any responsibility for the PFAS contamination in Fairfield and other towns.

“Sappi strongly disputes the contention that Sappi’s Somerset mill is the source of the PFAS contamination in Fairfield” Olga Karagiannis spokeswoman for Sappi North America said in a statement. “Sappi is well known for its record of environmental stewardship at the Somerset mill and the rest of our manufacturing facilities. As Sappi has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit we won’t be providing any further comment.”

MADAWASKA PLANT

But a representative for one major papermaker in Maine Twin Rivers Paper Co. has spoken openly about both the use of PFAS at the company’s Madawaska plant as well as efforts to phase out the chemicals.

“Twin Rivers Paper has a large business – nearly half of its production in Maine – built on food packaging grades some of which use PFAS chemistry” Brian McAlary vice president of business development with Twin Rivers told state lawmakers in May. “Twin Rivers is committed to finding innovative solutions to replacing PFAS in its food packaging products over the next two years according to the EPA guidelines.”

At the time Maine lawmakers were considering a DEP-backed bill requiring that all manufacturers disclose to the agency any products sold in Maine containing “intentionally added” PFAS. The bill which became law last week also prohibits the sale of PFAS-treated carpets and rugs starting in 2023 and expands that prohibition to all products in 2030 unless the DEP deems PFAS an “unavoidable use.”

McAlary pointed out that PFAS manufacturers are phasing out the chemicals in coatings for paperboard food packaging and grease-resistant papers – such as clamshell takeout food containers disposable dinnerware and fast-food wrappers – under a July 2020 agreement with the Food and Drug Administration.

Twin Rivers is committed to ending its use of PFAS by the end of 2023 but McAlary added that it “will not be easy quick or an inexpensive process.” In a subsequent interview with the Press Herald/Sunday Telegram McAlary said the company already offers multiple PFAS-free varieties in the U.S. and Europe and that products containing the chemicals “are not a large portion of the business.”

“If you go back four or five years ago there was a real push for our company internally to move” McAlary said. “We saw this happening in Europe and there was an opportunity to differentiate with our competitors.”

Twin Rivers has its own on-site water treatment system and does not spread biosolids instead either reusing or landfilling waste. But McAlary declined to provide specific information about what varieties of PFAS are still used in Twin Rivers products.

One concern raised by health and environmental groups seeking to rein in the use of PFAS is that chemical manufacturers release new varieties of the chemicals so often that regulators are unable to keep pace.

“We are finding that some of these alternatives can have problematic chemistries so that’s why it is also important to evaluate these alternatives” said Mark Rossi executive director of Clean Production Action a Massachusetts-based firm that works with chemical companies and product manufacturers.

Clean Production Action is currently working on a certification program for PFAS-free food packaging to meet the intense demand within the industry. Rossi said he hopes the certification program will launch later this year.

But “innovation is on an S-curve” Rossi said where so-called early adopters within an industry lead the way followed not long after by the majority of other manufacturers partly in response to new PFAS regulations enacted in Maine and other states.

“The complete transition in the paper industry away from PFAS really will require federal regulation because there are going to be these laggards that hold out” Rossi said.

MILK SAMPLES

It was random sampling of milk taken from grocery store shelves that led state regulators to detect startling levels of PFAS in milk from a Fairfield dairy farm. That discovery sparked additional testing which to date has discovered 164 PFAS-contaminated wells in Fairfield Unity Benton and Oakland – with more expected as the investigation’s circle expands outward.

All of these localized hot spots have a common denominator: Nearby crop fields fertilized with sludge. Much of that sludge appears to have come from the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District which processes wastewater from Waterville Fairfield Winslow Benton Oakland and Vassalboro.

Between 1981 and 2003 the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District spread more than 285000 cubic yards of biosolids – the industry name for treated sludge – at sites in more than a dozen towns according to DEP documents.

There is no wrongdoing suggested on the sanitary district’s part or among the dozens of other wastewater treatment facilities statewide that operated biosolids programs some of which are still active today. The application sites were fully licensed and approved by the DEP under a state-promoted “beneficial reuse” program that provided farmers with free nutrients for their crops and helped municipalities and sewer districts avoid paying landfill costs – costs ultimately borne by ratepayers.

“That’s the way it was – it was a hot commodity for farmers to be able to have compost for their farms” said Nicholas Champagne superintendent of the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District.

Since spring 2019 treatment plants that plan to land-apply sludge are required to periodically test their biosolids for PFAS. Land applications of the materials have declined significantly as a result because test results showing elevated PFAS levels would trigger additional testing at the fertilization site.

Champagne who only took over as superintendent at the Kennebec district in January 2020 said all of the facility’s sludge is now landfilled. Sludge testing results from May 2019 showed concentrations of the two most heavily scrutinized compounds PFOS and PFOA above the state’s screening levels but nowhere near the levels found in drinking water in Fairfield and neighboring towns.

“We are seeing these astronomical test results come out of Fairfield and the thing that is puzzling is we are testing our sludge today but it could have been something from 20 or 30 years ago” Champagne said.

The state’s recently enacted budget contains $30 million for PFAS-related initiatives at the DEP and the Maine Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry. The DEP share includes 11 permanent full-time positions and six temporary positions to help test more than 500 sludge application sites and to pay for installation of activated carbon filtration systems on contaminated wells. A separate fund aims to help impacted farmers recover financially.

Loyzim the DEP’s commissioner said it was unclear whether those tests will reveal additional large hot spots similar to that of Fairfield tied to any industries in Maine. She noted that Maine Vermont and New Hampshire have been more aggressive than most other states in testing for PFAS contamination.

“I can’t help but suspect that we may appear to have a bigger problem in part because we have been proactive in looking for it” Loyzim said.

PAPER MILL WASTE

No one knows how much PFAS was in sludge or paper mill waste spread across Maine 30 20 or even five years ago because industries were not required to report usage or discharge of the chemicals until this year.

But paper companies spread a lot of waste across the landscape according to a DEP compilation of licensed application sites.

Great Northern Paper which operated mills in the Millinocket region applied more than 100000 cubic yards of waste in the 1980s and 1990s in towns or unorganized territories in Penobscot and Aroostook counties according to an analysis of the DEP data.

Advertisement

Likewise the International Paper (later Verso) mill in Jay disposed of another 100000-plus cubic yards of waste through either land application or conversion to compost from the late 1980s to late 1990s. Fields that received “bio-ash” from the facility were located throughout western and southern Maine from Richmond and Bowdoinham to West Paris.

DEP records indicate that the mills operated by S.D. Warren and Scott Paper in Westbrook and Skowhegan applied several hundred thousand cubic yards of sludge and bio-ash to dozens of locations in farm fields and land owned by paper or timberland companies between 1988 and 1998. Some was also landfilled.

One of S.D. Warren’s more than 25 application sites was Stoneridge Farm in the York County town of Arundel.

In late 2016 farm owner Fred Stone was notified by the local water district that a well located on his property contained elevated levels of types of PFAS. That discovery cracked open the first case in Maine of PFAS contamination linked to application of sludge and/or paper mill waste.

In the years since Stone has lost all his livelihood because he is no longer able to sell milk from his century-old dairy farm commercially. He has disposed of much of his herd – “The 35 left are animals I just can’t kill” he said – and been the subject of international media coverage about the unfortunate intersection of PFAS and farming.

While testifying on a bill to create a special PFAS testing program for farm fields Stone presented lawmakers with a copy of a 1986 licensing letter from the DEP stating that biosolids “will not pollute any water of the state” and “will not constitute a hazard to health or welfare.”

“They were pushing this to beat holy hell” Stone said in an interview. “DEP was out here telling us how great this material was as a soil amendment. … We were trying to bring in money wherever we could bring in money and we were trying to cut down on the cost of production and that’s why we did what we did.”

Stone said he knows that farmers in Gorham Westbrook Steep Falls and other towns also spread waste from the paper mill on their farms. Some of those are still farms Stone said while others grew housing developments.

‘RACING TO FIND ALTERNATIVES’

Patrick Strauch executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council said paper mills in Maine have diversified in recent years to replace paper products that are no longer in high demand – such as newsprint – and expanded to packaging boxboard and other products some of which use PFAS.

“It’s a very competitive situation but the industry is racing to find alternatives” he said.

Strauch who represents paper and forest industry companies in regulatory and legislative matters in Augusta has urged state lawmakers not to treat all PFAS the same as PFOS and PFOA two well-studied compounds that are no longer produced or used in manufacturing in the U.S.

Asked about the paper industry’s liability concerns regarding PFAS Strauch said companies and society as a whole need to figure out how best to respond to contamination concerns.

“The sites that were contaminated by PFAS in the past were all sites that were permitted by the DEP and biosolids were tested so everyone has to take some ownership in this new information” Strauch said.

He added however that market demand is already driving companies to seek out “more natural solutions.”

“Everybody is working at it” Strauch said of the transition to PFAS-free products. “It is certainly where consumers want to go.”

Gardella the Boston-based attorney with CMBG3 Law who counsels clients on PFAS legal and regulatory issues agreed that paper companies switching to alternative chemistries is “a good step and one they absolutely need to take.”

Nonetheless companies in every industry – not just papermaking – that used PFAS in the past are still “at incredibly great risk right now” as public pressure builds on state and federal regulators to respond to existing contamination.

“The regulatory agencies don’t care truthfully that you had a permit to discharge this effluent or waste” Gardella said. “It doesn’t matter. Now there is a problem with PFAS contamination and they want that contamination cleaned up.”

AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE

Back in Fairfield Saunders is unsure what the future holds for his home and others in this rural neighborhood where he has lived for more than three decades.

“The view from here is wonderful for me” Saunders said. “There are no houses. … We are very close to town. We just love being here.”

A few minutes later however he added: “I picked the worst place to live as far as high levels” of PFAS.

Within two months of his well water testing at 12910 parts per trillion for PFAS – compared to a federal health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion – the DEP had installed a water filtration system in his basement at no cost to him. Other homes on his road had PFAS levels in excess of 20000 and 30000 parts per trillion compared to the state’s new health level of 20 parts per trillion.

Saunders’ water now reads “non-detect” for the roughly two dozen PFAS compounds analyzed by the monthly follow-up tests. Even so Saunders’ wife won’t drink the water because of concerns that PFAS may be related to health problems she’s had in the past.

Like many homeowners Saunders had hoped the years of sweat equity his family spent expanding their home and landscaped grounds would help pad his retirement savings if and when the couple decides to sell. But who is going to want to buy a house with a contaminated well and potentially contaminated soils? he asks.

The class-action lawsuit Saunders filed wants the paper companies to pay for ongoing medical monitoring for anyone in Somerset and Kennebec counties who may have been exposed to PFAS.

Personal injury lawsuits have not yet been filed but they are likely coming.

Standing in his kitchen Saunders dipped into a packed folder to pull out a federal chart showing the range of PFAS levels in blood samples from workers at the duPont and 3M factories where the chemicals were produced and utilized.

On the highest end factory workers averaged roughly 1000 and 700 parts per trillion for the two most problematic compounds PFOS and PFOA. Saunders’ blood levels were 1100 and 1400 parts per trillion.

“And I got that sitting in my living room” Saunders said. “That’s enough to make someone upset.”

Mariana Leky

Mariana Leky’s magical-realist bestseller What You Can See from Here is full of innocent animals standing in for something more sinister. There’s the okapi: a cloven-hoofed beast endemic to Congolese forests which makes ominous appearances in the dreams of protagonist Luise’s grandmother foreshadowing imminent deaths in their village. There’s also a huge Irish wolfhound called Alaska “the colour of slush” who was acquired by Luise’s father on the advice of his psychoanalyst to help him “externalise his pain”. The treatment is effective: the father embarks on a never-ending voyage around the world leaving behind both his pain and his family in their home on the edge of the Westerwald a mountainous region on the banks of the Rhine.

Neither of the two beasts turns out to be quite as terrifying as they sound. Wolfhound Alaska the metaphorical pain is miraculously immortal but also barely capable of a growl. And while Selma’s death-by-okapi dream is the Chekhovian gun that lends Leky’s eccentric tale constant tension – and a sudden and tragic twist – the big sleep harbingered by the giraffe-like animal can also be soft and agreeable.

“I have always been fascinated with okapis because they look like made-up animals or creatures assembled in a drunken stupor” says 48-year-old Leky speaking from her flat in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg. “This novel was similar: I wanted to bring together parts that didn’t necessarily feel like they belonged together.”

Leky’s coming-of-age novel told in three sections set a decade apart is populated by oddball characters with outlandish superstitions and peculiar verbal tics – “people who have been fitted into this world askew” she says. Her taste for eccentrics was fashioned by her upbringing: her father is a psychoanalyst her mother a psychotherapist and while her parents weren’t allowed to talk about their patients in public they discussed cases in bed at night. “I stood behind their bedroom door and listened” Leky recalls.

What You Can See from Here has sold more than 600000 copies in Germany and been translated into 14 languages. Some readers have found the novel’s optimistic portrait of community living grating a Pollyannaish flight from the challenges of globalisation. There may be infidelity and alcoholism in Leky’s nameless village but even the philanderers and drunkards are good at heart. The only character who isn’t given a chance to shine is Luisa’s father forever calling in from some far-flung location on a bad line.“The book’s success has shown an enormous yearning among readers for withdrawal for a reduction in complexity and for spirituality” said one reviewer on Deutschlandfunk radio who summed up its appeal as “cocooning in Westerwald”.

“Do stories set in a village automatically amount to escapism?” Leky responds. “I see village-like behaviour where I live in Berlin too – precisely because it’s a big city people form together in little village communities. I don’t think it’s escapism I think it’s more like a counter-movement against something that is perceived as too sprawling.”

“I wanted to write a book about such big and vague issues that I felt I needed to locate them in a place that could be contained” she adds. “I write about love and death and how they are connected – it doesn’t get more diffuse than that.” Philip Oltermann

British readers might think they know what to expect from Nordic noir: a tortured detective a bleak setting a brutal crime that shakes a small community. Finnish crime novelist Tuomainen turns all of this on its head. His new novel The Rabbit Factor which is being adapted by Amazon Studios and Mandeville Films starring Steve Carrell kicks off with a joyous chase scene through a theme park after hours. “I dive inside Caper Castle. I overcome the first section – the wobbly stairs – and hear the man behind me” Tuomainen writes. The ear of a giant plastic rabbit becomes a key weapon. It only gets darker and funnier.

Henri Koskinen is an actuarial mathematician a deeply rational man who calculates everything in life to the nth degree. When his brother Juhani dies Henri inherits his theme park YouMeFun just outside Helsinki. Unfortunately he inherits all his brother’s problems as well with financial issues including the loans that Juhani took out with some dangerous men.. As he struggles with his new life – “an unbearable lack of organisation staggering maintenance bills unproductive use of man hours economical recklessness promises nobody could keep” – he finds himself falling for an employee Laura (who is “approximately twenty-five centimetres shorter than me about average height for a Finnish woman”).

Tuomainen’s first five novels were more traditional Nordic noir. But around 2015 he started to introduce comedy starting with The Man Who Died in which a Finnish mushroom entrepreneur sets out to find out who has been slowly poisoning him. To date he has been nominated for 12 awards including the CWA International Dagger. His previous novel Little Siberia in which a priest fends off attempts to steal a valuable meteorite from a museum won him Best Scandinavian crime novel of the year at the Petrona awards.

“I just realised that I have to be able to use all I’ve got the whole palette and I brought in humour – dark humour” Tuomainen says. “I came up with Henri after watching the news two years ago – it was nothing compared to today but I thought back then that the world was a pretty crazy chaotic place. What if there was one person who insisted that everything should and has to make sense? I thought that permanent conflict with the world would make a really fun book.”

The Rabbit Factor out in English in October was a hit in Finland when it was published as Jäniskerroin last year. Shortly afterwards Tuomainen got a call from his agent to let him know that Amazon and Carrell were interested in adapting the novel. “I was quiet and my agent asked ‘Are you OK? Or don’t you know who Steve Carrell is?’” laughs the author. “I was pretty aware of who he is. It was just one of those moments. You can’t prepare yourself for anything like that.” Alison Flood

Shiori Ito

In the early hours of 4 April 2015 Shiori Ito awoke in a Tokyo hotel room to find a man on top of her. The last thing she could remember was sharing a meal and drinks with him. When it the alleged sexual assault was over and she had returned from the bathroom distressed and in pain the man asked if he could keep her underwear as a “souvenir”. Ito crumpled to the floor. Staring down at her the man said: “Before you seemed like a strong capable woman but now you’re like a troubled child. It’s adorable.”

The attacker’s need to “dominate and subjugate” as Ito puts it in her book Black Box has rarely been so lucidly or chillingly conveyed. Written in 2017 Black Box was both a startling j’accuse (she outed the person she accuses of assaulting her as Noriyuki Yamaguchi a prominent journalist and biographer of then prime minister Shinzo Abe) and a searing account of post-traumatic stress. “I thought I had control over my own body” Ito writes “but someone else had been able to take over.”

Four years later Ito says she still can’t bring herself to reread the memoir a bestseller in Japan that has been translated into Chinese Korean Italian French Swedish and now English. “I have only read it once since writing it” she says in Tokyo where she returned in 2020 having moved to London for several years to escape the backlash after her book’s publication. “It’s hard to describe because I don’t want to revisit it even though I have to talk about it.”

Black Box is billed as the memoir that sparked Japan’s #MeToo movement though few other women have trudged Ito’s lonely path. She pushed the police to investigate her assault enduring humiliating treatment at the police station. She was crushed by her first press conference in June 2017 in a room filled with mostly indifferent male reporters. A flood of hate mail followed. These days an assistant opens her inbox first shielding Ito from the worst of its contents.

“I’m trying to find a way to cope with it. I was worried that I would burn out but I think it’s important to talk about this – not just rape but the harassment that follows anyone who speaks out” she says.

When the criminal case against Yamaguchi was dropped she took him to civil court for damages and won in December 2019 although he has appealed against the decision. She has continued to fight having filed libel lawsuits against three of her most prominent harassers. Yamaguchi’s career meanwhile appears unaffected. He insists their 2015 encounter was consensual and has filed unsuccessful countercharges against her. “It can happen to anyone who goes up against a powerful man” she says.

Ito’s career as a journalist prevented her from staying silent she says; if she couldn’t face the truth of what had happened to her how could she continue her work? “It has been difficult but rape is visible now. We see more cases in the media we’ve had demonstrations in Tokyo and in many other cities. I have no regrets.” David McNeill

Ondjaki

Ondjaki’s novel Transparent City originally published in Portuguese in 2009 and in the UK this year is a moving mural of lives in the underclass of his home city Luanda. Both his motley cast and the crumbling apartment block where they live appear tiny within the sprawling capital home to 8 million people. His characters grapple with the fraught history of their country – Portugal’s colonial plundering war and political upheaval have shaped Angola into an oil-rich nation in the grip of political corruption and inequality. In their everyday despairs and joys Ondjaki reveals a snapshot of lives that he feels are seldom seen.

“It’s about asking who are the transparent ones in a country and who makes them transparent” he says. “Who are the transparent people in Syria right now in Palestine the US? Why do politicians not see specific groups of people?”



Ondjaki’s central character Odonato is a mournful figure nostalgic for a socialist past feeling increasingly invisible as he searches for his son who has become lost in Angola’s criminal justice system. From a sea-shell seller to tax collectors and politicians Ondjaki’s characters feel stuck in time mourning the past or racing against it trying to get by under capitalism. Their lives are bound by loneliness. “Luanda is a very big city so if you are alone you feel alone in the world” Ondjaki says.

The city is brimming with surreal and incredible stories he adds. “You could go to a funeral and think you’re going to get an interesting story for your writing. You will leave with so many that your publisher will say ‘Please! Not so much.’ Luanda writes far better than you can write.”

One of Angola’s most prominent authors with a career in poetry novels and stories spanning two decades Ondjaki is attracting growing acclaim overseas. Transparent City was a bestseller in Portugal and has been translated into Spanish German and French. “We African artists feel that it’s time for us to tell our story our fiction our history to the world” he says. “It’s not that our version is the correct one but what I cannot tolerate is that the European one is the correct one.” He hopes Transparent City does two things: “First be honest. And second that it doesn’t offend the reality of my people.” Emmanuel Akinwotu

Transparent City by Ondjaki translated by Stephen Henighan will be published by Europa Editions on 7 October.

China

Shen Yang

View image in fullscreen Shen Yang Photograph: Dave Tacon/The Guardian

Over the last few years there has been a rise in young Chinese authors writing memoirs about their upbringings as illegal children under China’s notorious one-child policy. In Chinese jargon they are called “black” children; a reference to their lack of a birth permit. According to Chinese government statistics in 2015 at least 13 million people – or 1% of the population – had such a status.

Now that the one-child policy has been relaxed the stories of these illegal children will soon be a part of China’s national collective memory. But to those who grew up tainted with this humiliation the scars are permanent. One is Chinese writer Shen Yang who wrote her story in part to extinguish the nightmares that still haunt her.

Her memoir More Than One Child is not intended as a piece of neatly crafted literature but as an open and honest collection of memories from China’s transition years. Shen Yang says it was not easy to write; she was born on 1 January 1986 by which time her mother had been on the run from the authorities for nine months. “I broke a law simply by being born. If the family planning authorities discovered my existence my mother would be carted off to the clinic to have her tubes tied and our family would be heavily fined. I may have been born on a lucky day but I could not change my destiny.”

Outside her birth home in Shandong province slogans were papered everywhere: “If you have children illegally we will legally demolish your house” and “One excess birth and the whole village gets their tubes tied!” Local authorities used this propaganda to stop “extras” like Shen being born.It was even worse for a girl; Shen was the second daughter with a sister who was four years older. In rural China despite the stringent one-child policy authorities would sometimes allow couples whose first child was a daughter to have a second – as long as he was a boy. Boys could be used as manual labour to help feed the family go to big cities to work and when they married sustain the family’s bloodline.

Shortly after she was born Shen Yang was smuggled to her grandparents’ house in a nearby city. At the age of five she was adopted by her uncle and aunt until she was 16 to avoid the authorities’ attention. But they had an unhappy marriage punctuated by rows and bouts of domestic violence.

As Chinese society evolved however so did Shen Yang’s destiny. Now 35 she’s married to an Italian designer and has been living in Shanghai for the past few years. Her childhood trauma of being an illegal “extra” is still there but writing has been a process of reconciliation with her past. Vincent Ni

Claudia Piñeiro is widely regarded as Argentina’s most popular crime writer with a string of international awards and praise such as: “Hitchcock is a woman […] and she lives in Buenos Aires.” She is prolific across multiple forms: young adult novels plays and screenplays (her latest is a high-profile Netflix thriller premiering later this summer) and she is also well known as a political activist for causes including abortion rights femicide and writers’ rights.

As with the very best crime fiction her novels often feature incisive social and historical scrutiny. Her third novel for adults Elena Knows is a perfect example: a complex character study of three women affected by their society’s oppressive rules within a murder mystery. Elena an elderly woman with Parkinson’s disease is investigating the death of her daughter who has been found dead in a church belfry. The case has been hastily closed and deemed a suicide but Elena is convinced it was murder.

There is an array of potential suspects – ranging from the comical to the pathetic often both – and the stakes are high not just because of the intrigue. Elena must travel to the other side of Buenos Aires in order to have a crucial conversation that she thinks will give her the key to her daughter’s death. With her illness the trip is an odyssey and every step an impossible quest: the pills she has to take for her body to follow the orders of her brain provide the skeleton of the story. As she travels Piñeiro deftly reveals how Elena knew her daughter less well than she thought.

“Often to tell of the society certain characters live in you must tell of its crimes” Piñeiro says. Abortion which is central to Elena Knows only became legal in Argentina in December 2020 and the gruelling and clandestine process women previously had to follow haunts the book. Piñeiro wrote Elena Knows in 2007 when “it was so out of the public debate even the word ‘abortion’ was forbidden”. The novel surged back into popularity as abortion became the subject of an increasingly heated national conversation.

It is not an autobiographical work but Piñeiro took one aspect from her own life: her mother had Parkinson’s too. Piñeiro knows intimately all the quotidian things that happen that are “not mentioned in the research books” how “degraded” the disease can make a person feel. She was drawn during the writing to Susan Sontag’s Illness As Metaphor and her notion that people avert their eyes from ill bodies. This happened to her mother and in some way Piñeiro sees Elena Knows as a work of “literary revenge”: “I wanted to give the gaze back to her and whoever wants to read this novel will have to look in extreme closeup at Elena’s body the whole time.” Marta Bausells

Fatima Daas

When Fatima Daas was growing up in Clichy-sous-Bois a high-rise suburb north of Paris she didn’t see people like her in novels. Born in France to an Algerian family she was a lesbian a Muslim a teenager from the stigmatised banlieue suburbs who spent hours on overcrowded buses to get to the capital to study. She knew what it was to feel different. “As a teenager that quickly meant incomprehension anger injustice and the feeling of being out of place” she says.

Last year aged 25 Daas was hailed as the voice of a new generation for her first novel La Petite Dernière (published in English this autumn as The Last One) a first-person narrative of a young woman called Fatima navigating the contradictions of her own identity – asthmatic not conforming to gender norms gay devoted to her Muslim faith a bolshy rebel who got top grades.

Daas won the Les Inrockuptibles first novel award for the poetic straight-talking and often comic account. She says she wanted to create a fictional character everyone could recognise themselves in and to lay bare the multiple identities of being French.

“Through fiction I was able to explore everything that had made me” Daas says. “Being a woman but not what was expected of a woman. Being a north African woman but also French the only member of the family born in France. Being lesbian being Muslim. It was almost a luxury for me through fiction to make all those identities coexist in my central character. I knew that those identities were in tension and confrontation in society but for once through fiction I felt like I was liberating and reconciling them.”

The musical quality of the novel is key – the story races along with the pace of a song or a poem punctuated by the repeated line “My name is Fatima Daas”. It deliberately reads as if being spoken aloud – in contrast to the “absolute silence” the character grows up in. Daas says it was a way for her to say as a novelist: “I exist I am I love I want”.

Fatima Daas is a pseudonym chosen to match her central character. She began writing fiction aged 14 and her talent was spotted in high-school writing workshops. She later took a creative writing master’s degree.

One of the many labels the fictional Fatima gives herself is “liar”. In the novel lying is surviving but brings its own suffering. Not everyone has the “privilege” of being able to tell the truth about who they are she says: “Often we resent people who lie people who don’t say they’re gay for example. But it’s a privilege to be able to say: ‘I’m this’ or ‘I’m that’ – to tell the truth and not risk losing someone like your mother or father.”

Daas’s depiction of Paris has been hailed by critics showing young people marooned in suburbs only 15km from Paris but with no direct transportation. Her beautifully drawn descriptions of endless hours on public transport were Daas’s way of exploring a commute she once considered “normal” then grew to see as an “injustice”.Daas’s overriding message is that you don’t have to give up any part of yourself: you can inhabit a host of seemingly clashing identities at once. “I wanted to smash the codes and norms that everyone has to navigate” Daas says. “I wanted to talk to everyone who ever felt they had to give up a part of themselves and say: ‘No we don’t have to.’” Angelique Chrisafis

The Last One by Fatima Daas translated by Lara Vergnaud is published by Other Press in the US on 9 November and by Small Axes in the UK in January.

Ludmila Ulitskaya

Ludmila Ulitskaya’s Just the Plague is not as its title might suggest an early mover in the field of “corona-lit”. It refers instead to the little known and potentially disastrous outbreak of plague in Moscow in 1939 which was swiftly thwarted by the secret police. Written as a screenplay in the late 1980s it was submitted by Ulitskaya then an unknown as part of a scriptwriting course application. It was rejected and buried among her discarded papers. “Thirty-two years have passed” she writes in the epigraph “and the script has now acquired a new significance.”

Born in 1943 Ultiskaya grew up in Moscow the daughter of Jewish parents and entered the workforce in the 1960s as a geneticist before a run-in with the KGB closed the lab where she worked. This episode was later fictionalised in her novel Big Green Tent one of many novels plays and short stories that depict the lives of private individuals getting by within the Soviet machine. Through these works – notably Sonechka Medea and Her Children The Kukotsky Enigma Daniel Stein Interpreter and Jacob’s Ladder – she has amassed numerous literary awards including Russia’s most prestigious book prizes France’s Prix Medicis and a nomination for the Man Booker international prize. In 2020 Ulitskaya had the same odds (6/1) as Margaret Atwood and Maryse Condé to win the Nobel.

Departing from her sweeping sagas Just the Plague is thin coming in at just under 120 pages. It is written nearly entirely in dialogue with short descriptive interruptions that read like stage directions. “Each author’s idea each story requires its own genre” Ulitskaya says. “This one wanted to be born in the form of a film script.” She may hop between forms but her style remains consistent: observant distant favouring plot over psychological introspection and conveying biography through exemplary details.

Her script has yet to find a director but Ulitskaya thinks Just the Plague is “begging to become a television series”. (From the first line – “Across vast wastes of snow a freight train makes its way its headlights cutting through a maelstrom of swirling white flakes” – it’s easy to imagine.) In Just the Plague the microbiologist Rudolf Mayer is working on a vaccine when he unknowingly becomes infected with the deadly disease and travels to Moscow putting dozens at risk. The ensuing drama documents the urgent attempts by the NKVD (the precursor to the KGB) to thwart the outbreak orchestrated by Stalin’s notorious right-hand man Lavrenti Beria. Stalin’s purges had reached their grim apex only several years before so when Ulitskaya’s characters are visited by the NKVD in the dead of night to be quarantined they assume their next stop is the gulag.

In blurring the threats of the NKVD and the plague into a single deadly organ Ulitskaya tells a larger story about the mechanics of fear in the Soviet Union. There is an even more uncomfortable subtext to the work however; that the NKVD “carried out at least one useful ‘humane’ act” as Ulitskaya writes in the book’s afterword by stopping the spread of disease: “The security forces of the time proved to be stronger than the predatory force of nature.”

How does the current Russian government’s response compare? “In 1939 with the help of the NKVD the epidemic was avoided. In 2020 it failed” she says. “But we do not know which is more dangerous for humankind: the plague or the secret police.” Matthew Janney

Just the Plague by Ludmila Ulitskaya translated by Polly Gannon will be published by Granta on 2 September.

Sandro Veronesi

“Let us pray for him and for all the ships out at sea” writes Sandro Veronesi in both the opening and closing chapters of his novel The Hummingbird. Bookended like a call to prayer Veronesi’s most acclaimed work recently published in English is a reflective and hopeful contemporary take on the Italian family saga following Marco Carrera a middle-class family man who manages to hover over the chaos of his life as winds of change threaten to blow him off course.

The Hummingbird has captivated European readers selling more than 300000 copies in Italy alone and making Veronesi only the second author to win the Premio Strega Italy’s most prestigious literary award twice. The film adaptation is in production in Italy starring Nanni Moretti (winner of the Cannes Palm d’Or) and Bérénice Bejo (nominated for an Oscar for her role in The Artist) and the novel hashe work has already been translated into 24 languages with Elena Pala’s English translation lauded by Ian McEwan among others.

The book is unconventional cutting between narrative passages emails and phone calls over eight decades even reaching into the future to 2030 thus keeping the reader constantly alert. “It is rhapsodic” Veronesi says; he structured it around the workings of human memory. “It shows that even the most dramatic and painful moments have an ‘after’ in which one can return to live peacefully.”

With many of Veronesi’s past works drawing heavily on his own life it’s tempting to look for him in Carrera his protagonist but he rejects the comparison: “I don’t reflect myself in Marco Carrera. He is not even a projection of who I might have been … If he were a real person I would like to be his friend and above all his tennis doubles partner.”

But Veronesi and Carrera do share a similar concern about the future of western society. In the penultimate chapter Carrera rails against the tyranny of individualism and laments that rationality compassion and generosity are fading away; all of which is undermining our societal structures and putting the world in “great danger”. “The word freedom itself has become an ‘open sesame’ to the lowest forms of selfishness and social dysfunctionality” Veronesi says.

Ultimately Carrera finds hope in the deep relationship he builds with his granddaughter. He sees in her all that is good in humanity and instructs her to lead the fight for truth a challenge that she is ready and willing to accept. “It is for all of us that the novel at the beginning and end invites even secular people to pray” Veronesi says. As the father of five children he wants his readers to know how much of our future lies in the hands of younger generations and that it is they in particular who need our prayers Sophia Seymour and Nina Brown

Military-grade spyware licensed by an Israeli firm to governments for tracking terrorists and criminals was used in attempted and successful hacks of 37 smartphones belonging to journalists human rights activists business executives and two women close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi according to an investigation by The Washington Post and 16 media partners. The phones appeared on a list of more than 50000 numbers that are concentrated in countries known to engage in surveillance of their citizens and also known to have been clients of the Israeli firm NSO Group a worldwide leader in the growing and largely unregulated private spyware industry the investigation found. The list does not identify who put the numbers on it or why and it is unknown how many of the phones were targeted or surveilled. But forensic analysis of the 37 smartphones shows that many display a tight correlation between time stamps associated with a number on the list and the initiation of surveillance in some cases as brief as a few seconds. Forbidden Stories a Paris-based journalism nonprofit and Amnesty International a human rights group had access to the list and shared it with the news organizations which did further research and analysis. Amnesty’s Security Lab did the forensic analyses on the smartphones. The numbers on the list are unattributed but reporters were able to identify more than 1000 people spanning more than 50 countries through research and interviews on four continents: several Arab royal family members at least 65 business executives 85 human rights activists 189 journalists and more than 600 politicians and government officials — including cabinet ministers diplomats and military and security officers. The numbers of several heads of state and prime ministers also appeared on the list. Among the journalists whose numbers appear on the list which dates to 2016 are reporters working overseas for several leading news organizations including a small number from CNN the Associated Press Voice of America the New York Times the Wall Street Journal Bloomberg News Le Monde in France the Financial Times in London and Al Jazeera in Qatar. The targeting of the 37 smartphones would appear to conflict with the stated purpose of NSO’s licensing of the Pegasus spyware which the company says is intended only for use in surveilling terrorists and major criminals. The evidence extracted from these smartphones revealed here for the first time calls into question pledges by the Israeli company to police its clients for human rights abuses. The media consortium titled the Pegasus Project analyzed the list through interviews and forensic analysis of the phones and by comparing details with previously reported information about NSO. Amnesty’s Security Lab examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30 the tests were inconclusive in several cases because the phones had been replaced. Fifteen of the phones were Android devices none of which showed evidence of successful infection. However unlike iPhones Androids do not log the kinds of information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of targeting such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages. Amnesty shared backup copies of data on four iPhones with Citizen Lab which confirmed that they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab a research group at the University of Toronto that specializes in studying Pegasus also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic methods and found them to be sound. In lengthy responses before publication NSO called the investigation’s findings exaggerated and baseless. It also said it does not operate the spyware licensed to its clients and “has no insight” into their specific intelligence activities. After publication NSO chief executive Shalev Hulio expressed concern in a phone interview with The Post about some of the details he had read in Pegasus Project stories Sunday while continuing to dispute that the list of more than 50000 phone numbers had anything to do with NSO or Pegasus. “The company cares about journalists and activists and civil society in general” Hulio said. “We understand that in some circumstances our customers might misuse the system and in some cases like we reported in [NSO’s] Transparency and Responsibility Report we have shut down systems for customers who have misused the system.” He said that in the past 12 months NSO had terminated two contracts over allegations of human rights abuses but he declined to name the countries involved. “Every allegation about misuse of the system is concerning me” he said. “It violates the trust that we give customers. We are investigating every allegation.” NSO describes its customers as 60 intelligence military and law enforcement agencies in 40 countries although it will not confirm the identities of any of them citing client confidentiality obligations. The consortium found many of the phone numbers in at least 10 country clusters which were subjected to deeper analysis: Azerbaijan Bahrain Hungary India Kazakhstan Mexico Morocco Rwanda Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab also has found evidence that all 10 have been clients of NSO according to Bill Marczak a senior research fellow. Forbidden Stories organized the media consortium’s investigation and Amnesty provided analysis and technical support but had no editorial input. Amnesty has openly criticized NSO’s spyware business and supported an unsuccessful lawsuit against the company in an Israeli court seeking to have its export license revoked. After the investigation began several reporters in the consortium learned that they or their family members had been successfully attacked with Pegasus spyware.

Beyond the personal intrusions made possible by smartphone surveillance the widespread use of spyware has emerged as a leading threat to democracies worldwide critics say. Journalists under surveillance cannot safely gather sensitive news without endangering themselves and their sources. Opposition politicians cannot plot their campaign strategies without those in power anticipating their moves. Human rights workers cannot work with vulnerable people — some of whom are victims of their own governments — without exposing them to renewed abuse.

For example Amnesty’s forensics found evidence that Pegasus was targeted at the two women closest to Saudi columnist Khashoggi who wrote for The Post’s Opinions section. The phone of his fiancee Hatice Cengiz was successfully infected during the days after his murder in Turkey on Oct. 2 2018 according to a forensic analysis by Amnesty’s Security Lab. Also on the list were the numbers of two Turkish officials involved in investigating his dismemberment by a Saudi hit team. Khashoggi also had a wife Hanan Elatr whose phone was targeted by someone using Pegasus in the months before his killing. Amnesty was unable to determine whether the hack was successful.

“This is nasty software — like eloquently nasty” said Timothy Summers a former cybersecurity engineer at a U.S. intelligence agency and now director of IT at Arizona State University. With it “one could spy on almost the entire world population. … There’s not anything wrong with building technologies that allows you to collect data; it’s necessary sometimes. But humanity is not in a place where we can have that much power just accessible to anybody.”

In response to detailed questions from the consortium before publication NSO said in a statement that it did not operate the spyware it licensed to clients and did not have regular access to the data they gather. The company also said its technologies have helped prevent attacks and bombings and broken up rings that trafficked in drugs sex and children. “Simply put NSO Group is on a life-saving mission and the company will faithfully execute this mission undeterred despite any and all continued attempts to discredit it on false grounds” NSO said. “Your sources have supplied you with information that has no factual basis as evidenced by the lack of supporting documentation for many of the claims.”

The company denied that its technology was used against Khashoggi or his relatives or associates.

“As NSO has previously stated our technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi. This includes listening monitoring tracking or collecting information. We previously investigated this claim immediately after the heinous murder which again is being made without validation.”

Thomas Clare a libel attorney hired by NSO said that the consortium had “apparently misinterpreted and mischaracterized crucial source data on which it relied” and that its reporting contained flawed assumptions and factual errors.

“NSO Group has good reason to believe that this list of ‘thousands of phone numbers’ is not a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus but instead may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes” Clare wrote.

In response to follow-up questions NSO called the 50000 number “exaggerated” and said it was far too large to represent numbers targeted by its clients. Based on the questions it was being asked NSO said it had reason to believe that the consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information such as HLR Lookup services which have no bearing on the list of the customers targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products … we still do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group technologies.”

The term HLR or Home Location Register refers to a database that is essential to operating cellular phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of cellphone users and their general locations along with other identifying information that is used routinely in routing calls and texts. HLR lookup services operate on the SS7 system that cellular carriers use to communicate with each other. The services can be used as a step toward spying on targets.

Telecommunications security expert Karsten Nohl chief scientist for Security Research Labs in Berlin said that he does not have direct knowledge of NSO’s systems but that HLR lookups and other SS7 queries are widely and inexpensively used by the surveillance industry — often for just tens of thousands of dollars a year.

“It’s not difficult to get that access. Given the resources of NSO it’d be crazy to assume that they don’t have SS7 access from at least a dozen countries” Nohl said. “From a dozen countries you can spy on the rest of the world.”

Pegasus was engineered a decade ago by Israeli ex-cyberspies with government-honed skills. The Israeli Defense Ministry must approve any license to a government that wants to buy it according to previous NSO statements.

“As a matter of policy the State of Israel approves the export of cyber products exclusively to governmental entities for lawful use and only for the purpose of preventing and investigating crime and counterterrorism under end-use/end user certificates provided by the acquiring government” a spokesperson for the Israeli defense establishment said Sunday. “In cases where exported items are used in violation of export licenses or end-use certificates appropriate measures are taken.”

The numbers of about a dozen Americans working overseas were discovered on the list in all but one case while using phones registered to foreign cellular networks. The consortium could not perform forensic analysis on most of these phones. NSO has said for years that its product cannot be used to surveil American phones. The consortium did not find evidence of successful spyware penetration on phones with the U.S. country code.

“We also stand by our previous statements that our products sold to vetted foreign governments cannot be used to conduct cybersurveillance within the United States and no customer has ever been granted technology that would enable them to access phones with U.S. numbers” the company said in its statement. “It is technologically impossible and reaffirms the fact your sources’ claims have no merit.”

How Pegasus works Target: Someone sends what’s known as a trap link to a smartphone that persuades the victim to tap and activate — or activates itself without any input as in the most sophisticated “zero-click” hacks. Infect: The spyware captures and copies the phone’s most basic functions NSO marketing materials show recording from the cameras and microphone and collecting location data call logs and contacts. Track: The implant secretly reports that information to an operative who can use it to map out sensitive details of the victim’s life. Read more about why it’s hard to protect yourself from hacks.

Apple and other smartphone manufacturers are years into a cat-and-mouse game with NSO and other spyware makers.

“Apple unequivocally condemns cyberattacks against journalists human rights activists and others seeking to make the world a better place” said Ivan Krstić head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture. “For over a decade Apple has led the industry in security innovation and as a result security researchers agree iPhone is the safest most secure consumer mobile device on the market. Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated cost millions of dollars to develop often have a short shelf life and are used to target specific individuals. While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users we continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data.”

Some Pegasus intrusion techniques detailed in a 2016 report were changed in a matter of hours after they were made public underscoring NSO’s ability to adapt to countermeasures.

Pegasus is engineered to evade defenses on iPhones and Android devices and to leave few traces of its attack. Familiar privacy measures like strong passwords and encryption offer little help against Pegasus which can attack phones without any warning to users. It can read anything on a device that a user can while also stealing photos recordings location records communications passwords call logs and social media posts. Spyware also can activate cameras and microphones for real-time surveillance.

“There is just nothing from an encryption standpoint to protect against this” said Claudio Guarnieri a.k.a. “Nex” the Amnesty Security Lab’s 33-year-old Italian researcher who developed and performed the digital forensics on 37 smartphones that showed evidence of Pegasus attacks.

That sense of helplessness makes Guarnieri who often dresses head-to-toe in black feel as useless as a 14th-century doctor confronting the Black Plague without any useful medication. “Primarily I’m here just to keep the death count” he said.

The attack can begin in different ways. It can come from a malicious link in an SMS text message or an iMessage. In some cases a user must click on the link to start the infection. In recent years spyware companies have developed what they call “zero-click” attacks which deliver spyware simply by sending a message to a user’s phone that produces no notification. Users do not even need to touch their phones for infections to begin.

Many countries have laws pertaining to traditional wiretapping and interception of communications but few have effective safeguards against deeper intrusions made possible by hacking into smartphones. “This is more devious in a sense because it really is no longer about intercepting communications and overhearing conversation. … This covers all of them and goes way beyond that” Guarnieri said. “It has raised a lot of questions from not only human rights but even national constitutional laws as to is this even legal?”

Clare NSO’s attorney attacked the forensic examinations as “a compilation of speculative and baseless assumptions” built on assumptions based on earlier reports. He also said “NSO does not have insight into the specific intelligence activities of its customers.”

The Pegasus Project’s findings are similar to previous discoveries by Amnesty Citizen Lab and news organizations worldwide but the new reporting offers a detailed view of the personal consequences and scale of surveillance and its abuses.

The consortium analyzed the list and found clusters of numbers with similar country codes and geographical focus that align with previous reporting and additional research about NSO clients overseas. For example Mexico has been previously identified in published reports and documents as an NSO client and entries on the list are clustered by Mexican country code area code and geography. In several cases clusters also contained numbers from other countries.

In response to questions from reporters spokespeople for the countries with clusters either denied Pegasus was used or denied that their country had abused their powers of surveillance.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s office said any surveillance carried out by that nation is done in accordance with the law.

“In Hungary state bodies authorized to use covert instruments are regularly monitored by governmental and non-governmental institutions” the office said. “Have you asked the same questions of the governments of the United States of America the United Kingdom Germany or France?”

Moroccan authorities responded: “It should be recalled that the unfounded allegations previously published by Amnesty International and conveyed by Forbidden Stories have already been the subject of an official response from the Moroccan authorities who have categorically rejected these allegations.”

Vincent Biruta Rwanda’s foreign affairs minister also denied the use of Pegasus.

“Rwanda does not use this software system as previously confirmed in November 2019 and does not possess this technical capability in any form” Biruta said. “These false accusations are part of an ongoing campaign to cause tensions between Rwanda and other countries and to sow disinformation about Rwanda domestically and internationally.”

‘What a question!’

Some expressed outrage even at the suggestion of spying on journalists.

A reporter for the French daily Le Monde working on the Pegasus Project recently posed such a question to Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga during an interview about the legal requirements for eavesdropping:

“If someone asked you to tape a journalist or an opponent you wouldn’t accept this?”

“What a question!” Varga responded. “This is a provocation in itself!” A day later her office requested that this question and her answer to it “be erased” from the interview.

In the past NSO has blamed its client countries for any alleged abuses. NSO released its first “Transparency and Responsibility Report” last month arguing that its services are essential to law enforcement and intelligence agencies trying to keep up with the 21st century.

“Terror organizations drug cartels human traffickers pedophile rings and other criminal syndicates today exploit off-the-shelf encryption capabilities offered by mobile messaging and communications applications.

“These technologies provide criminals and their networks a safe haven allowing them to ‘go dark’ and avoid detection communicating through impenetrable mobile messaging systems. Law enforcement and counterterrorism state agencies around the world have struggled to keep up.”

NSO also said it conducts rigorous reviews of potential customers’ human rights records before contracting with them and investigates reports of abuses although it did not cite any specific cases. It asserted that it has discontinued contracts with five clients for documented violations and that the company’s due diligence has cost it $100 million in lost revenue. A person familiar with NSO operations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal company matters noted that in the last year alone NSO had terminated contracts with Saudi Arabia and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates over human rights concerns.

“Pegasus is very useful for fighting organized crime” said Guillermo Valdes Castellanos head of Mexico’s domestic intelligence agency CISEN from 2006 to 2011. “But the total lack of checks and balances [in Mexican agencies] means it easily ends up in private hands and is used for political and personal gain.”

Mexico was NSO’s first overseas client in 2011 less than a year after the firm was founded in Israel’s Silicon Valley in northern Tel Aviv.

In 2016 and 2017 more than 15000 Mexicans appeared on the list examined by the media consortium among them at least 25 reporters working for the country’s major media outlets according to the records and interviews.

One of them was Carmen Aristegui one of the most prominent investigative journalists in the country and a regular contributor to CNN. Aristegui who is routinely threatened for exposing the corruption of Mexican politicians and cartels was previously revealed as a Pegasus target in several media reports. At the time she said in a recent interview her producer was also targeted. The new records and forensics show that Pegasus links were detected on the phone of her personal assistant.

“Pegasus is something that comes to your office your home your bed every corner of your existence” Aristegui said. “It is a tool that destroys the essential codes of civilization.”

Unlike Aristegui freelance reporter Cecilio Pineda was unknown outside his violence-wracked southern state of Guerrero. His number appears twice on the list of 50000. A month after the second listing he was gunned down while lying in a hammock at a carwash while waiting for his car. It is unclear what role if any Pegasus’s ability to geolocate its targets in real time contributed to his murder. Mexico is among the deadliest countries for journalists; 11 were killed in 2017 according to Reporters Without Borders.

“Even if Forbidden Stories were correct that an NSO Group client in Mexico targeted the journalist’s phone number in February 2017 that does not mean that the NSO Group client or data collected by NSO Group software were in any way connected to the journalist’s murder the following month” Clare NSO’s lawyer wrote in his letter to Forbidden Stories. “Correlation does not equal causation and the gunmen who murdered the journalist could have learned of his location at a public carwash through any number of means not related to NSO Group its technologies or its clients.”

Mexico’s Public Security Ministry acknowledged last year that the domestic intelligence agency CISEN and the attorney general’s office acquired Pegasus in 2014 and discontinued its use in 2017 when the license expired. Mexican media have also reported that the Defense Ministry used the spyware.

Snowden’s legacy

Today’s thriving international spyware industry dates back decades but got a boost after the unprecedented 2013 disclosure of highly classified National Security Agency documents by contractor Edward Snowden. They revealed that the NSA could obtain the electronic communications of almost anyone because it had secret access to the transnational cables carrying Internet traffic worldwide and data from Internet companies such as Google and giant telecommunications companies such as AT&T.

Even U.S. allies in Europe were shocked by the comprehensive scale of the American digital spying and many national intelligence agencies set out to improve their own surveillance abilities. For-profit firms staffed with midcareer retirees from intelligence agencies saw a lucrative market-in-waiting free from the government regulations and oversight imposed on other industries.

The dramatic expansion of end-to-end encryption by Google Microsoft Facebook Apple and other major technology firms also prompted law enforcement and intelligence officials to complain they had lost access to the communications of legitimate criminal targets. That in turn sparked more investment in technologies such as Pegasus that worked by targeting individual devices.

“When you build a building you want to make sure the building holds up so we follow certain protocols” said Ido Sivan-Sevilla an expert on cyber governance at the University of Maryland. By promoting the sale of unregulated private surveillance tools “we encourage building buildings that can be broken into. We are building a monster. We need an international norms treaty that says certain things are not okay.”

Without international standards and rules there are secret deals between companies like NSO and the countries they service.

The unfettered use of a military-grade spyware such as Pegasus can help governments to suppress civic activism at a time when authoritarianism is on the rise worldwide. It also gives countries without the technical sophistication of such leading nations as the United States Israel and China the ability to conduct far deeper digital cyberespionage than ever before.

Azerbaijan a longtime ally of Israel has been identified as an NSO client by Citizen Lab and others. The country is a family-run kleptocracy with no free elections no impartial court system and no independent news media. The former Soviet territory has been ruled since the Soviet Union collapsed 30 years ago by the Aliyev family whose theft of the country’s wealth and money-laundering schemes abroad have resulted in foreign embargoes international sanctions and criminal indictments.

Despite the difficulties roughly three dozen Azerbaijani reporters continue to document the family’s corruption. Some are hiding inside the country but most were forced into exile where they are not so easy to capture. Some work for the Prague-based U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty which was kicked out of the country in 2015 for its reporting. The others work for an investigative reporting nonprofit called the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project which is based in Sarajevo the Bosnian capital and is one of the partners in the Pegasus Project.

The foremost investigative reporter in the region is Khadija Ismayilova whom the regime has worked for a decade to silence: It planted a secret camera in her apartment wall took videos of her having sex with her boyfriend and then posted them on the Internet in 2012; she was arrested in 2014 tried and convicted on trumped-up tax-evasion and other charges and held in prison cells with hardened criminals. After global outrage and the high-profile intervention of human rights attorney Amal Clooney she was released in 2016 and put under a travel ban.

“It is important that people see examples of journalists who do not stop because they were threatened” Ismayilova said in a recent interview. “It’s like a war. You leave your trench then the attacker comes in. … You have to keep your position otherwise it will be taken and then you will have less space less space the space will be shrinking and then you will find it hard to breathe.”

Last month her health failing she was allowed to leave the country. Colleagues arranged to test her smartphone immediately. Forensics by Security Lab determined that Pegasus had attacked and penetrated her device numerous times from March 2019 to as late as May of this year.

She had assumed some kind of surveillance Ismayilova said but was still surprised at the number of attacks. “When you think maybe there’s a camera in the toilet your body stops functioning” she said. “I went through this and for eight or nine days I could not use the toilet anywhere not even in public places. My body stopped functioning.”

She stopped communicating with people because whoever she spoke with ended up harassed by security services. “You don’t trust anyone and then you try not to have any long-term plans with your own life because you don’t want any person to have problems because of you.”

Confirmation of the Pegasus penetration galled her. “My family members are also victimized. The sources are victimized. People I’ve been working with people who told me their private secrets are victimized” she said. “It’s despicable. … I don’t know who else has been exposed because of me who else is in danger because of me.”

Is the minister paranoid or sensible?

The fear of widespread surveillance impedes the already difficult mechanics of civic activism.

“Sometimes that fear is the point” said John Scott-Railton a senior researcher at Citizen Lab who has researched Pegasus extensively. “The psychological hardship and the self-censorship it causes are key tools of modern-day dictators and authoritarians.”

When Siddharth Varadarajan co-founder of the Wire an independent online outlet in India learned that Security Lab’s analysis showed that his phone had been targeted and penetrated by Pegasus his mind immediately ran through his sensitive sources. He thought about a minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government who had displayed an unusual concern about surveillance when they met.

The minister first moved the meeting from one location to another at the last moment then switched off his phone and told Varadarajan to do the same.

Then “the two phones were put in a room and music was put on in that room … and I thought: ‘Boy this guy is really paranoid. But maybe he was being sensible'"" Varadarajan said in a recent interview.

When forensics showed his phone had been penetrated he knew the feeling himself. “You feel violated there’s no doubt about it” he said. “This is an incredible intrusion and journalists should not have to deal with this. Nobody should have to deal with this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZW4udmlldG5hbXBsdXMudm4vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1wdWJsaWNhdGlvbi1vZi12aWV0bmFtZXNlLXBhcGVycy1yaXNlcy1zaGFycGx5LXBvc3QyMDU0MDEudm5w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International publication of Vietnamese papers rises sharply,"Statistics show that the number of papers by Vietnamese researchers published in International Scientific Indexing (ISI) journals has increased significantly in both the social and natural sciences.

Hanoi (VNA) – Statistics show that the number of papers by Vietnamese researchers published in International Scientific Indexing (ISI) journals has increased significantly in both the social and natural sciences.

Educational experts said international integration has prompted universities to work hard to improve their world rankings if they want to affirm their prestige and attract students.

Investing in research and being published in prestigious journals is just one result of that.

In 2017 the Ministry of Education and Training issued regulations on doctoral training requiring both post-graduate students and mentors to have publications in ISI journals.

The issuance of these regulations has yielded success with a sharp rise in Vietnamese research papers being published in international publications over the past three years.

ISI publications up 144.7 percent

Ho Manh Toan from the Centre for Interdisciplinary Social Research Phenikaa University said over the past decade the number of Vietnamese papers published in ISI journals rose rapidly from nearly 1600 in 2011 to around 12500 in 2020.

Last year’s figure was bigger even than the combined volume of 2015 2016 and 2017 and for the period 2011-2015.

Vietnam’s published papers in ISI journals through the years.

Increases have been seen through the years but particularly after 2017 when the above-mentioned regulations came into force. The number of published papers last year was double the number of 6000 in 2018.

This rapid rise has helped Vietnamese universities gain higher rankings on the international education map.





The growth of Vietnam’s publications on ISI journals through the years.

In 2018 the Vietnam National University – Hanoi and the Vietnam National University – Ho Chi Minh City were the first Vietnamese universities to be named among the top 1000 universities in the world according to the annual Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings in the UK.

The QS World University Rankings is an annual publication of university rankings by London-based Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). Being the only international ranking to have received International Ranking Expert Group (IREG) approval the QS ranking is viewed as one of the three most widely-read university rankings in the world along with the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

The QS World University Rankings evaluate universities according to six metrics - Academic Reputation Employer Reputation and Faculty/Student Ratio as well as Citations per faculty International Faculty Ratio and International Student Ratio.

In 2019 the Hanoi University of Science and Technology and the Vietnam National University-Hanoi became the first Vietnamese representatives in the 801-1000 group in the annual global ranking compiled by the Times Higher Education (THE) a British provider of higher education data.

Four universities in Vietnam have placed on a global ranking for science subjects released on March 4 2020 by QS.

They are the Vietnam National University Hanoi; the Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City; the Hanoi University of Science and Technology; and the Can Tho University.

Big strides for social sciences

Among Vietnam’s ISI publications those related to social sciences make up only 5.8 percent.

Despite the modest number the sector has shown substantial growth with many subjects experiencing intensive international integration Toan said.

Toan said that the number of economic papers published in Scopus journals jumped from 107 in 2016 to 1024 last year and the number of published business papers increased from 140 to 1316.

Other subjects such as culture anthropology history political science and international relations have also made big strides in this regard.

There were only a handful of Vietnamese papers published on philosophy literature anthropology and urbanisation in international journals in 2016. The number reached double digits in 2020.

According to Toan SCImago Institutions Rankings upgraded Vietnam’s

economics course from 57th in 2016 to 20th last year. Business courses were also elevated from 63rd to 25th.

Such numbers and analysis reflect the significance of scientific research and publication in international journals.

However the Ministry of Education and Training has recently scrapped the requirements of having papers published in an international publication for researchers and lecturers on doctoral training.

This decision has triggered concern among Vietnamese scientists who have said it will slow down the country’s international integration in scientific research./.",,,

The IRS partners with the Free File Alliance a nonprofit coalition of tax software companies that offer no-cost tax filing services for the Free File program. Intuit says in a blog post on its website that part of the reason it’s leaving Free File— which is available to 2020 filers with adjusted gross income of $72000 or less— is the “restraints” of the program.

“With the Free File program surpassing its founding goals of e-file and free tax preparation and due to the limitations of the Free File program and conflicting demands from those outside the program we are not able to continue in the program and deliver all of the benefits that can help consumers make more money save more and invest for the future” according to the blog post.

Readers may recall that a series of reports by ProPublica found that Intuit and H&R Block had misled filers into paying to file their taxes. The companies kept the free versions of their software from showing up in search engine results according to ProPublica making them harder to find online. The IRS later overhauled the Free File program removing a provision in the agreement that prohibited the agency from creating an online filing system of its own that would compete with the software companies’ products.

Intuit’s blog post says the company will leave the Free File program at the end of the tax season in October because it wants to “provide more financial benefits and empower Americans of all income levels to take control of their finances.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaW50dWl0LXR1cmJvdGF4LWxlYXZlcy1pcnMtZnJlZS1maWxlLXByb2dyYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Despised maker of TurboTax tells Americans the 'free' ride is over,"Intuit is done doing you favors.

The financial software company behind TurboTax announced Thursday that after October it will no longer participate in the IRS's Free File program. That program offered Americans making less than $78000 the opportunity to e-file their federal taxes free of charge.

Intuit has a long and troubled history with the Free File program. In 2019 ProPublica reported that TurboTax intentionally hid its Free File webpage from search engines — and then advertised some of its paid tax products as ""free"" (but charged people who used them).

These questionable practices hurt real people. According to a 2020 audit by the Treasury Inspector General ""more than 14 million taxpayers met the Free File program criteria and may have paid a fee to e-file their Federal tax return in the 2019 Filing Season.""

As ProPublica reported in 2019 TurboTax waged a sustained campaign to stop eligible Americans from filing their taxes online for free.

In other words it sure seems like Intuit makes it its business to screw over taxpayers. But that's not how Intuit sees it. Rather according to company the decision to drop out of the Free File program is all about breaking free of the shackles of free tax filing.

""Without the limitations of the Free File program Intuit can provide more financial benefits and empower Americans of all income levels to take control of their finances at a time they need it most"" reads the company's statement.

Notably Bloomberg Tax reported that H&R Block announced its intention to leave the Free File program in 2020.

Intuit meanwhile further explained in the most passive aggressive manner possible why it decided to leave the program.

It looks like Americans will have to find a new way to overpay for the privilege of filing their taxes online.",,,,,,,,,

But when your first child turns 20 everyday moments become extraordinary.

That means that when Cooper and I are in the car running errands and I glance in his direction and notice his giant adult hands I get a little weepy. How could those once-dimpled baby hands belong to a grown person who’s not even a teenager anymore?

Two full decades of parenting — and praying worrying guiding cleaning crying laughing cheering celebrating — are reflected in those hands.

I recall chunky toddler hands moving in synch with “The Itsy Bitsy Spider” and “The Wheels on the Bus” and “This Little Light of Mine.” I remember increasingly nimble hands piecing together jigsaw puzzles and thousands of Lego bricks.

Cooper takes photos of Mount Rushmore from Iron Mountain Road in Keystone S.D. the week of his 20th birthday.

Cooper takes a video of buffalo at Custer State Park in South Dakota the week of his 20th birthday.

Cooper would hold my hand on morning and afternoon walks to and from elementary school until one day without fanfare or warning he simply let go.

As he continued to grow up he became handier. Cub Scouts and then Boy Scouts gave him opportunities to tie knots whittle build fires and change tires. He is the go-to fixer in the house able to repair vacuum cleaners install new locks and assemble patio furniture.

Those hands can play piano clarinet and guitar. And some obnoxious video games.

When he feels like it those hands can whip up a fine mess of chili or macaroni and cheese.

Cooper’s hands carry a few scars including evidence of an inexplicable pencil stabbing in eighth grade and the infamous magnet incident of 2004.

One Sunday morning in January during Cooper’s mischievous toddler phase he pushed a kitchen chair from the table to the refrigerator climbed atop the chair reached up to the farthest corner and pulled off a square decorative magnet (purposefully placed far far away). Pleased with his own resourcefulness and newly acquired treasure he abandoned the chair held the magnet tight in his fist and tottered across the tile floor.

Exuberance took control of his body and somehow he fell still clutching the magnet which punctured the palm of his tiny hand. There was plenty of blood and other evidence that a Band-Aid wouldn’t suffice.

One parent drove to the emergency room while the other applied constant pressure to the wound. Cooper sobbed during the 10-mile drive (this was long before Frisco was flush with hospitals).

Sure enough he needed stitches in his right hand a procedure that required two trained professionals just to hold him still.

The magnet incident was one of the first among many that remind me of how little control we parents actually have. We lay the groundwork establish routines suggest boundaries model values — and these little humans form their own opinions and make their own choices. At the time though I didn’t see it that way.

I blamed myself for keeping a sharp object in the house and for not anticipating that he would find a way to reach it. I was embarrassed that he was having a meltdown over stitches and that nothing I attempted could console him.

My job was to prevent accidents and I’d failed. I had no idea how many more were to come — the broken clavicle busted chin fractured ankle sliced shin.

Childhood and parenting are peppered with these moments — taking risks making a poor choices by accident making a poor choice on purpose forgetting the rules pushing the limits losing control.

We all end up with a few scars evidence of a messy but meaningful life. And if we’re lucky when we’re feeling especially emotional we can reach over the center console grab a hand to squeeze and know that it’s OK to let go.

One specific form that has begun to take hold in the U.P. is kayak bass fishing via the Upper Peninsula Kayak Anglers club.

The UPKA is currently in its third year and second of hosting live tournaments across the U.P.

UPKA Founder and Tournament Director Jonathan Pepin of Escanaba — who has been casting from kayaks competitively for five years — says fishing from a kayak offers a unique challenge while preserving the fish population.

“What makes kayak fishing great in my eyes is that it’s more intimate” Pepin said. “It’s you on a smaller watercraft battling the water the fish and your own thoughts. You have to do more thinking of how to set yourself up to not only find and catch the fish but how to do it safely and efficiently while in a tournament setting. You have to know how to manage your time on the water and game plan for the event. It’s not as easy as motoring down and covering miles of water in a boat to find a new spot to fish or make it back to your check-in at tournaments end.

“… We practice CPR — catch photo release. All our fish are registered by length through a cell phone app and immediately released back into the water giving the fish the greatest chance of survival!”

Utilizing social media the UPKA has been growing in terms of both its online and competitor communities.

“Currently we have over 500 followers on our UPKA Facebook page and we also have an Instagram and are working on a YouTube page as well” said Pepin. “We are averaging 15 anglers per live event in 2021 and that’s not all Yoopers! Many have traveled from downstate and even as far as Ohio and Illinois. We not only continue to grow as a club and community in the U.P. but statewide with our partners in the Topwater Series and Michigan Kayak Trail.”

The UPKA beyond providing a place to compete in the U.P. also presents the opportunity to fish beyond the confines of the U.P. waters.

“One great thing about UPKA is we are a Kayak Bass Fishing affiliate club and our anglers all have the opportunity to qualify for the KBF National Championship and many other national events” Pepin commented. “In 2020 I was able to participate in the KBF National Championship down on Lake Guntersville in Alabama.

“The National Championship offers a giant payout and the chance to fish some of the best bass fishing lakes in the country. Last year’s National Championship winner took home over $50000 fishing from a kayak!”

One of the goals Pepin and the UPKA strive to accomplish is help bring attention to the quality of fishing in the U.P. to a wider audience.

“The Upper Peninsula has an amazing bass fishery” he said. “From the Great Lakes to inland numerous Master angler size smallmouth and largemouth bass call the U.P. their home. We not only try to bring competitive kayak bass fishing to the U.P. but also showcase the U.P.’s fisheries on a nationwide scale!”

Through its supporters and participation Pepin is confident in the growth of the UPKA with plans to continue flourishing in the future.

“It is definitely growing” he said “Not only with angler participation but with our tournaments as well. Next year in 2022 we are planning some big things that will be firsts in the U.P. and for our anglers. “We couldn’t do it without our anglers and committed sponsors. Local statewide and nationwide sponsors have allowed us to give back to the anglers and kayak community in the form of 100% paybacks prizes discounts and much more.”

Now based in Shanghai Peter Hwang will oversee the management and development of DragonCor an entity created to manage mainland logistics assets owned by Blackstone funds the Manhattan-based firm said in a release. The collection includes the Greater Bay Area’s largest urban logistics park in which Blackstone acquired a majority stake earlier this year.

“We are thrilled to welcome Peter a recognised leader to spearhead the continued growth of DragonCor” said Justin Wai a Hong Kong-based managing director with Blackstone Real Estate. “Peter brings years of experience leading a regional team and orchestrating major transactions and we’re confident he’ll play an important role in building our rapidly growing China logistics platform.”

The upgrade for Blackstone’s China logistics operation comes just four months after the fund manager took in $2.9 billion from the sale of an Australian logistics portfolio as the company continues to look for ways to adapt and deploy its existing investment playbooks in new environments.

Engineering a Win

Hwang’s most recent title was managing director for Asia at records management company Iron Mountain where he led various mergers and acquisitions. During his time in the role Asia revenue grew significantly making Iron Mountain the region’s leading document and data management company Blackstone said.

With Asia logistics developers ESR and Logos having each announced data centre initiatives in recent months Hwang’s Iron Mountain experience also includes overseeing a co-location server facility in Singapore as well as joint ventures in Mumbai Pune and India’s national capital region.

Before his nearly eight-year career at Iron Mountain Hwang served as general manager for business development at pharmaceutical distributor Zuellig Group in Hong Kong. Prior to that he was chief of staff and vice president of corporate development at HKEX-listed China NT Pharma Group.

His earlier experience includes advisory work for McKinsey & Co and engineering projects for the International Space Station at Boeing.

Hwang received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from UCLA and later earned an MBA from Stanford.

“I look forward to working with the DragonCor team and further expanding Blackstone’s logistics footprint which is already among the biggest in China” Hwang said. “This is an especially exciting time for the sector in China which is seeing robust demand for warehouses driven by e-commerce trends.”

Assembly Required

Cliff Chen a Shanghai-based managing director at Blackstone Real Estate said the firm has built the DragonCor portfolio over the last three years into a collection of carefully selected high-quality logistics assets strategically located in China’s major hubs with a diversified tenant base across fast-growing sectors such as technology and third-party logistics.

Blackstone bulked up its mainland logistics holdings this year with the purchase of a 70 percent stake in Guangzhou International Airport R&F Integrated Logistics Park from Guangzhou R&F Properties for $1.1 billion an acquisition that increased the firm’s China logistics portfolio by a third. The deal was announced last November and completed in January.

Assembling countrywide mega-portfolios of logistics assets is becoming old hat for the firm run by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman. Blackstone in May completed its long-anticipated acquisition of Embassy Industrial Parks gaining a portfolio with 10.6 million square feet of logistics and warehouse assets near major cities in India.

In April Blackstone agreed to sell its Milestone Logistics portfolio in Australia to ESR Milestone Partnership a collaborative venture of Hong Kong-listed ESR and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC for $2.9 billion after a protracted bidding contest against four other contenders.

In 2017 Blackstone scored Europe’s single largest real estate deal ever when it sold the Logicor platform to China Investment Corporation for $13.82 billion. That deal which involved 630 distribution centres in 17 European countries came after Blackstone had completed more than 50 transactions to acquire and tune the Logicor platform.",,,,,,

Yet he ended up a few yards from where the ball was deposited which sent the crowd into a frenzy.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9tbGIvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zMTgzNTc2Ny9qYWNvYi1zdGFsbGluZ3MtZ3JhbmQtc2xhbS1jYXBzLW1lbW9yYWJsZS1jb21lYmFjay1sYXN0LXBsYWNlLXBpdHRzYnVyZ2gtcGlyYXRlcy13YWxrLXZpY3RvcnktbmV3LXlvcmstbWV0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Stallings' grand slam caps memorable comeback for last-place Pittsburgh Pirates in walk-off victory over New ...,"PITTSBURGH -- Jacob Stallings was near-speechless clearly overwhelmed after an unforgettable night in what's been a forgettable season for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

On Fireworks Night at PNC Park Stallings the veteran catcher started the festivities a little earlier than expected launching a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning off closer Edwin Diaz as the home team rallied for a 9-7 victory over the stunned New York Mets Saturday.

""Diaz has a great fastball I was trying to be on time for it I wasn't necessarily sitting on it. But just trying to be on time"" Stallings said shaking his head during his postgame on-field interview broadcast on the stadium's PA system. ""I didn't get it all but I just hoped I got enough of it.

""Thankfully I did.""

Trailing 6-0 the last-place Pirates scored all their runs in the final two innings -- five in the eighth and four in the ninth -- en route to the victory. Along the way Stallings notched his sixth career game-ending RBI with the third walk-off slam at PNC Park which opened in 2001.

""We've got a bunch of guys who never quit and play really hard"" he said. ""We just hung on till the end. And we came away with it so that's pretty cool.""

J.D. Davis hit a pair of two-run homers for New York in his first start since coming off the 60-day injured list and rookie starter Tylor Megill pitched six scoreless innings.

But it wasn't enough on a miserable day for the Mets who detailed injuries to star shortstop Francisco Lindor and ace Jacob deGrom before the game.

Lindor is out indefinitely with a strained oblique and deGrom is sidelined with forearm tightness in the latest round of health setbacks for the NL East leaders.

But by night's end Stallings was the main headliner on either side. His homer was the third walk-off grand slam this season in the majors as the catcher joined Seattle's Shed Long and Houston's Jose Altuve in that bracket.

And before the Pirates' rally MLB teams were 314-0 this season when leading by six or more runs in the eighth inning or later.

""I couldn't believe it when it cleared the fence"" Diaz said. ""I thought it was a fly ball.""

He wasn't the only Mets reliever to falter against the Pirates. Seth Lugo pitched just 2/3 of an inning allowing five earned runs three hits and two walks seeing his ERA shoot up to 5.09.

""Our clubhouse we're mentally stronger than that. It's not gonna get us down"" Lugo said when asked if this type of loss could spring a downward turn for the Mets. ""One loss doesn't define the team. We're a good ballclub and we're gonna show it [Sunday].""

Clay Holmes (1-1) recorded the win despite giving up a solo home run to Brandon Nimmo in the top of the ninth that increased New York's lead to 7-5. In the bottom half of that frame with that same score the Pirates loaded the bases with one out as Ke'Bryan Hayes was hit by a pitch Bryan Reynolds walked and John Nogowski hit an infield single.

Diaz (3-4) appeared on his way to escaping the jam when he struck out Gregory Polanco looking on a full-count pitch. But then Stallings pulled his slam down the left-field line beyond the outstretched glove of Kevin Pillar who climbed over the wall in a desperate attempt to make the catch.

Diaz had not allowed a home run in 48 1/3 innings dating to last season the longest active streak in the majors.

""This kind of loss is ... yeah"" Davis said shrugging his head in disbelief. ""It is what it is.""

Casualty will be airing a special episode next week which focuses solely on the coercive control we're seeing in Jacob and Tina's relationship.

Recent episodes have highlighted the insidious hold Tina has over Jacob and next week's scenes will see this intensify.

Charles Venn and Adele James take centre stage in the powerful scenes which play with time to explore the choices Jacob has to make.

Here are five key moments to watch out for:



1. The episode plays with time

BBC

As we explained above next week's scenes will break format and play with time as Jacob faces several moments of choice. At first he initially speaks up for himself but when Tina reacts badly he changes tack and tries to keep the peace.

The episode actually starts at the end of the day following a particularly dark moment for Jacob. It then rewinds to the start of the day where we see them seemingly happily on their way to ED but when Jacob confronts Tina over their credit card bill they argue. Time then rewinds and Jacob is offered the chance to make a different choice this time pretending he’s fine with the bill and Tina seems pacified. For a while anyway.

2. Jacob and Tina find themselves in a terrifying situation

BBC

Next week's episode will also feature an astonishing stunt as Jacob and Tina come across an overturned car on the way into work.

After Tina smashes a window and rescues the driver Jacob discovers a young girl Jeannie on the side of the road. Tina recognises Jeannie from her time on the oncology ward and remembers that she lost her dad as a teenager.

Back in ED Jacob gets full credit for the rescue leaving Tina rattled.

3. Jacob's past is explored

BBC

As Jeannie is treated in the ED Jacob notices signs of an eating disorder. Once they are alone Jacob tells her he understands how she feels about food as he was bullied for being overweight as a child.

He explains he doesn't discuss this with anyone even Tina unaware that she has overheard. Irritated once again Tina later berates him for breaking patient boundaries bringing up her brother Nate and insinuating Jacob has a saviour complex.

4. Iain worries about Jacob

BBC

As Tina's relentless criticism starts to take its toll on Jacob an observant Iain is the first to notice that his friend is out of sorts.

Wanting to lift Jacob's spirits Iain suggests that they go for a drink later on. Jacob accepts but when Tina says she wants to go out with Jacob tonight he feels obliged to agree to that instead.

5. Tina's behaviour takes a worrying turn

BBC

Finally Tina's behaviour will take an even more sinister turn following a run-in with Jacob in resus. When Jeannie's condition rapidly deteriorates Tina asks Jacob if she can attempt the procedure as part of her training.

It's clear this is not the right clinical decision but Jacob is emotionally manipulated by Tina to an extent that he allows it. Unsurprisingly it quickly becomes clear that Tina is too inexperienced and Jeannie nearly dies as a result.

Dylan is furious and questions why Jacob let such a junior member of his team do such a complex procedure before time rewinds. This time we see Jacob take the assertive line and do the procedure for himself saving Jeannie but with devastating repercussions for himself...

Casualty airs these scenes on Saturday July 24 on BBC One.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.""



On Wednesday afternoon a photo was captured of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson kissing quite passionately on the streets of New York where Pascal was seen in a tan blazer and a brown dress shirt while Johnson wore a leather jacket over a white tee. Naturally the image of the two locking lips went viral leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out it was all just a moment of movie magic.

The pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their new romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song—whose debut feature film Past Lives was nominated for Best Picture this year—the upcoming flick follows the dynamic between a matchmaker a wealthy man she meets and her ex. In addition to Johnson and Pascal the movie also stars Chris Evans Zoë Winters Dasha Nekrasova Louisa Jacobson and Marin Ireland.

Materialists just began filming in New York in late April according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.

To make matters even more interesting about a week ago Johnson was seen filming a scene with costar Evans and in a few paparazzi photos the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film to say the least.

Johnson is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones which costars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile Pascal has a lot on his plate as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico which just began filming in April.

But there was more geniality than specificity in private meetings with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders just three weeks before a self-imposed May 24 spring session adjournment date.

Democrats were prepared to talk to Johnson about his Monday reference to $1 billion owed to Chicago Public Schools due to years of underfunding under the state’s school funding formula — but the issue wasn’t even broached during a nearly 30-minute meeting with the governor.

And the mayor’s controversial support for a new lakefront Chicago Bears stadium also wasn’t a focal point of the meeting.

Johnson told reporters he reminded Pritzker and legislative leaders that Chicago is the economic engine of the state and deserves its “fair share of resources.

“It’s also to continue to build relationships with the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity injustice. This is a unique chance for us to do that” Johnson said of his trip. “So it’s a level-setting. It’s making sure that we’re building on relationships but it’s also clear that in order for the state of Illinois to be the great state that it is that the city of Chicago has to have its fair share of resources.”

Johnson called discussions with the Illinois General Assembly about the Bears “ongoing” dubbing Soldier Field a “structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.” The Bears last week met with Pritzker aides who highlighted their opposition to the plan. The governor’s office last week called the proposal a “nonstarter” after the meeting.

“And that’s what this is about providing solutions to a problem … like everything else I’ve inherited” Johnson said.

It was the Chicago mayor’s first trip to the state capitol since taking office. Johnson also met with Pritzker and legislative leaders in Springfield in April 2023 in a ceremonial visit weeks before he was sworn in.

Johnson defended the timing of his visit — and his late-in-the-game budgetary asks — saying “We’re at the right time.”

“You know when stuff gets done. So we’re down here at the right time” Johnson said.

Several members of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus also met privately with Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch on Wednesday in what was dubbed an informal city lobbying day. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) the mayor’s hand-picked Education Committee chair said it marked the first time in five years that members of the caucus had come to Springfield.

“The thing we’ll do next year is we’ll come in January. We come earlier. We get earlier access” Taylor said. “We can get a lot of those things that we’re looking for.”

Taylor said her requests included funding for infrastructure and investments in education some narrower than the mayor’s.

“He’s advocating for some of the same things we are but remember it’s 50 other folks. It’s just 20 of us as the Black Caucus and so he’s advocating on the entire city. We have specific asks for the South and West sides” Taylor said.

“Him coming down is a great thing. Him coming down with us didn’t make or break us because now the other caucuses have to do their due diligence to come down here as well.”

During Johnson’s closed-door meetings the Illinois Senate Executive Committee quietly cleared an education measure that Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union had opposed.

The bill was initially intended to stop the Chicago Board of Education from closing or making any changes to selective enrollment schools until 2027 when the board will be fully elected. It was a response to a resolution passed by the CPS board that called for a plan to invest in neighborhood schools and move away from school choice.

The measure the Senate committee passed Wednesday cleared the House last month. It included a moratorium on all Chicago school closings until 2027 — and it would also stop the Chicago Board of Education from changing standards of admission for selective enrollment schools. The measure must still clear the full Senate.

Johnson said he has had discussions with lawmakers to amend the measure: “Those amendments are being assessed and analyzed now.”

As for whether he felt snubbed by the Senate’s approval during his visit the mayor countered that he understood the “process.”

“There’s a process that the General Assembly goes through” Johnson said. “I understand that process and we’re going to stick to that process.”

But back to Johnson she’s not only a key person on my beauty vision board but her style game is also on point.

Spotted on the set of the romantic comedy Materialists Johnson donned a totally chic ensemble—essentially a variation of what I wear on a daily basis consisting of a versatile button-up shirt and oversized shoulder bag. But the magic happened on the lower half of her uniform showing off a nostalgic pair of jeans I honestly forgot about.

Johnson’s bootcut denim threw it back to my high school days boasting a light-washed hue that’s ideal for spring and summer. If you’ve been sleeping on bootcut pants it’s time to revive them. They’re some of the most flattering pants you can own since they’re fitted throughout the hips and thighs while featuring a leg-lengthening flare.

Johnson’s bottoms cascaded to the floor and dragged behind her but that’s customizable depending on your height and desired fit. Either way style your comeback jeans with a bodysuit or off-the-shoulder blouse for a sleek finish. I love pairing my bootcut denim with kitten heels for an added boost of height though sneakers are just as good—and Johnson proved it.

The actress slipped on a pair of comfortable Nike sneakers that included a grippy bottom and crawling toe cap. Her footwear nods to popular model-approved styles leaning into the chunky dad look that fashion has come to know and love. The sneaker style is super practical too given that it can be elevated by the above jeans or dressed down with workout shorts oversized T-shirts and maxi skirts.

Johnson is seemingly wearing a variation of the Waffle Debut Vintage Sneaker though Reebok Steve Madden and New Balance offer great lookalikes. The key is finding a style that includes the three staple elements: a grooved sole lace-up design and front toe detail. And of course they must be comfy!

You won’t find that combination among the other big-name flagships on the market.

But reader it is $1300. That’s a $100 increase over last year’s model and more than an iPhone 12 Pro Max ($1199) or a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra ($1249 but often on sale for less) with an equivalent 256GB of storage. That is simply a lot to ask someone to pay for a phone.

7.5 Verge Score Sony Sony Xperia 1 III $ 1299 The Good Good high-res OLED 120Hz panel

Lots of manual photo and video controls

Sophisticated minimalist design The Bad Short time frame for security update support

Expensive

Seriously it’s $1300 $1299 at Sony$1299 at Amazon How we rate and review products

For that $1300 you get a top-notch experience on basically every level (except for its relatively short security-support timeline) but I struggle to see any one way in which it sets itself apart from the established competition. There are serious photo and video recording capabilities within the native camera apps but nothing that could be considered unique to Xperia or a must-have.

It all amounts to a very expensive device that does a lot of things well but without a strong value proposition for any one kind of person.

The 6.5-inch OLED offers a fast 120Hz refresh rate.

Sony Xperia 1 III screen battery and ergonomics

The Xperia 1 III’s screen stands out among its fellow flagships both in terms of its slimmer 21:9 aspect ratio and its higher 1644 x 3840 resolution which Sony calls 4K (it’s close). It’s also an OLED panel and this year’s version offers a 120Hz maximum refresh rate.

There’s no variability unfortunately so you’ll need to choose between locking it in at a standard 60Hz (the default) or that higher 120Hz rate for the smoothest of smooth scrolling experiences. Opting for 120Hz comes with a warning that the battery will drain faster and it does but not unreasonably so. I kept it enabled throughout my time using the phone. Overall it’s a lovely screen with a couple of notes: Auto brightness is sometimes a little squirrely indoors and the panel itself doesn’t get terribly bright outdoors. It’s still usable outside in bright light but it can feel like a strain to see what’s on the screen.

Dieter was a fan of the Xperia 1 II’s look when he reviewed it and I’m in agreement about the III: it’s a sophisticated understated design and I dig it. I like the slight matte treatment for the back panel glass and all-around build quality (including its IP65/68 durability rating) measures up to the flagship class with a metal frame and Gorilla Glass Victus on the front. The Sony branding is so unobtrusive it practically disappears into the back panel until the light catches it and the whole thing looks at home next to an RX100 series camera.

I both like and dislike the phone’s unique tall-and-slim profile

The Xperia 1 III gets an upgraded 4500mAh battery compared to the previous-gen’s 4000mAh likely a necessary move given the 120Hz display. Battery life is adequate not stellar. I averaged two hours of screen time on a day of lighter use which drained the cell to only about 50 percent by the end of the day. I was concerned about how it would hold up on a day of heavier use recording some 4K video clips but even in that case the battery lasted through the end of the day. I’d pack a charger or a backup if I planned on shooting video extensively or on a long travel day where I anticipated more than four hours of screen-on time but for day-in-day-out use the Xperia 1 III does fine. There’s also support for 30W wireless charging.

I both like and dislike the phone’s unique tall-and-slim profile. It fits my hand more easily and it is possible to reach your thumb across the screen in one-handed use (forget about reaching the far upper corner though). But it’s also more prone to slipping out of pockets. I do like the fingerprint sensor embedded in the on / off button on the side; it’s quick and it doesn’t care if I’m wearing a mask.

Sony Xperia 1 III performance and software

Spec-wise the Xperia 1 III is a flagship through and through. It uses a Snapdragon 888 processor with 12GB RAM and 256GB of built-in storage. There’s 5G connectivity here and unlike last year’s model those in the US will be able to take advantage of it — as long as you’re on Verizon or T-Mobile. The Xperia 1 III doesn’t support AT&T’s 5G and there’s no mmWave support just sub-6GHz on T-Mobile and Verizon.

Sony doesn’t have a firm security-support timeline for the Xperia 1 III but tells us that owners can expect two years of support. The phone ships with Android 11 and the company doesn’t have plans for future OS version upgrades. That puts it well behind Samsung’s and Apple’s support policies both of which offer at least four years of security updates and multiple OS version upgrades. Considering its high price tag this is a significant shortcoming against its peers.

Sony has equipped the Xperia 1 III with dual front-firing speakers and says they’re louder than those in the 1 II. Paired with the high-res OLED screen it makes watching videos a high-quality experience. I was delighted when I heard a car offscreen and the audio tracked as it passed through the scene from the left to right speakers. Maybe I’m easily impressed by these things but I can see myself genuinely enjoying watching a movie or a show on the Xperia 1 III rather than as a last resort to stave off boredom.

The Xperia’s rear panel includes three cameras and a time-of-flight sensor.

Sony Xperia 1 III camera

Sony is a highly regarded maker of mobile imaging sensors and in the past few years has gotten more serious about the camera hardware in its own Xperia phones. This year’s iteration includes a total of three 12-megapixel rear-facing cameras including a telephoto lens with a folded-optic design that includes two focal lengths: 70mm and 105mm equivalents. All three cameras including that telephoto unit use a sensor with dual phase-detection autofocus a technology that helps Sony Alpha cameras achieve class-leading autofocus speeds. If you’re a numbers kind of person here’s the quick rundown on the rear-facing camera hardware in the Xperia 1 III:

Sony Xperia 1 III rear cameras Camera Resolution Focal length (equiv.) Aperture Sensor Size Optical stabilization Standard wide 12-megapixels 24mm f/1.7 1/1.7"" Yes Telephoto 12-megapixels 70mm / 105mm f/2.3 / f/2.8 1/2.9"" Yes Ultrawide 12-megapixels 16mm f/2.2 1/2.5"" No There are three rear-facing cameras on the Xperia 1 III including a telephoto lens with two focal-length settings.

The Xperia’s Photography Pro camera app now includes a “basic” auto-everything shooting mode as the default. Switching over to one of the semi-auto or manual modes brings up an interface resembling an Alpha camera’s quick menu. The basic mode is refreshingly minimal — there are quick shortcuts to different focal lengths to turn bokeh mode on or off enable continuous shooting and access flash settings but not much more than that.

Manual modes introduce a lot more control and more display options like a big beautiful (to me at least) horizon level. It will all feel very familiar to anyone who’s used a conventional camera especially if that camera is a Sony. I like both the basic and advanced shooting mode experiences and a two-stage shutter button is a very welcome addition but my one complaint is that there’s no real on-screen indication when a photo is taken. I live with all of my phone’s notifications and audio signals on mute so without the audio cue I missed it when I only half-pressed the shutter on a few occasions thinking I’d fully pressed it.

Switching to manual mode in the camera app brings up an Alpha-camera-esque interface.

I’ll admit that it took a minute for me to warm up to the Xperia’s telephoto camera. I tend to like a wider lens and I’ve used too many bad or mediocre smartphone telephoto cameras to get too excited about them. But once I started trusting it — especially at the 70mm focal length — I started to really enjoy using it to layer foreground and background elements or bring more attention to a subject I can’t get closer to. You know stuff you use a telephoto lens for. The image quality won’t put your dedicated zoom lens out of work but it’s good enough.

There’s a tendency for smartphone telephoto lenses to just amplify the shortcomings of the small-sensor-small-lens combo working to create them which manifests as ugly purple fringing or obviously smeary details. The images I took at 70mm are blessedly free from these artifacts especially if you’re looking at them at social media sizes. The 105mm focal length starts to look a little artifact-y and details are noticeably soft but as long as there’s plenty of light images don’t look distractingly bad.

That’s the good stuff. I’m a little less excited about one of the other marquee camera features on the Xperia: autofocus. Namely Sony’s dual phase-detect and tracking AF technologies which it has imported to the Xperia series from its Alpha range. Don’t get me wrong Sony autofocus is amazing. It’s why I own a Sony camera. You can see it at work in the Xperia 1 III when it effortlessly identifies a human or animal subject and tracks it around a scene keeping up even when the subject turns away or becomes obscured behind something else. I’m just not convinced that it does much good here.

First it seems to contribute to some distracting autofocus fluttering between near and distant subjects in some situations with the telephoto lens. Combined with the inherently less stable ergonomics of taking pictures with a phone versus a dedicated camera it can make for a real challenge trying to get a photo of something in the distance.

Taking closer-range photos of moving kids and pets in dim conditions is probably a more common use case for many people and it’s one that no phone manufacturer has been able to crack just yet — including Sony. In these situations dual phase-detect will keep up with your subject but that doesn’t mean you’ll get a sharp shot. Just like every other phone camera system it’s bound by the laws of small-sensor-small-lens physics. Situations where there’s just not enough available light to keep shutter speed high enough will still result in some blur no matter how well the subject tracking is keeping up.

Just like every other phone camera system it’s bound by the laws of small-sensor-small-lens physics

In very low light the camera will assemble data from multiple frames to create a brighter less noisy image. This actually happens automatically in darker conditions and doesn’t require a trip to a separate night mode which I appreciate. But it does require you to hold the camera steady for a second or two and isn’t well suited for moving subjects.

Sony has included a darn good camera system on the Xperia 1 III and it’s one I enjoyed using. I got to flex some creativity that I’d normally avoid with a smartphone and reserve for when I have a dedicated camera on hand. But it hasn’t found a way yet to bend the laws of optics and physics.

We noted in our Xperia 1 II review that rather than leaning into computational photography the way Apple and Google have Sony seems to be leaning into its traditional camera chops applying the technology that has pushed the company’s mirrorless cameras to the top of the game. That approach has paid off in some ways — a great native camera app a surprisingly good telephoto lens — but it doesn’t always translate and I’m not sure how much further Sony can take that approach.

Sony Xperia 1 III video recording

The Xperia 1 III is also well equipped for the serious mobile video shooter with up to 4K / 60p recording and a native video app that includes plenty of manual control over video settings. You can set shutter angle manually set points for pull focus and apply one of Sony’s pro-video-esque color profiles. I have no problem telling you that this was all way over my head but I played with it anyway.

Your video files are associated with projects and certain parameters like frame rate are preserved from clip to clip within a project. You also have the choice of recording to internal storage or directly to a microSD card if you don’t want to burn up your storage space with 4K video files. I’m happy to report that the SIM tray where the microSD card slot lives simply pops out of the side of the device so you won’t have to hunt down a safety pin every time you want to grab your card to transfer files. That’s a nice touch especially if you’re going to be taking that card out often to transfer footage to a computer.

Sony’s Cinematography Pro app offers plenty of manual control and the ability to set points for pull focus.

There’s not much you can do in the way of editing files — you can trim them or grab a still frame — so they’ll need to be exported for anything more than that. It’s also possible to use the Xperia 1 III as an external monitor for video recording with a dedicated camera (doesn’t need to be a Sony) or to use it for live-streaming.

This is all much more robust than any native video-recording options you’ll find on a Samsung Google or Apple flagship. For someone who’s entrenched in the Alpha camera ecosystem it could make sense as a compact lightweight option for recording clips or as part of a live-streaming setup. But there are also strong third-party apps and accessory options for mobile video shooters especially those using iOS that have benefited from years of development and use in the field. While the Xperia packs more of this into its native app experience it’s not exactly a unique proposition.

The Xperia 1 III doesn’t offer enough above and beyond the established flagships to justify its high cost.

In the Xperia 1 III Sony has created a sophisticated device that both looks good and delivers flagship-level performance. It offers sophisticated camera hardware and software and a lovely high-resolution OLED that’s not quite like anything else in its class. And yet I’m struggling to think of anyone who should buy this phone over an iPhone 12 Pro Max or a Galaxy S21 Ultra.

There’s the basics: for $1300 you’d be getting a device that’s likely to only see a couple of years of security updates. And if you’re on AT&T you’re paying top dollar for a 5G device that can’t access the carrier’s 5G network. It’s hard to make a case for the Xperia just based on those facts.

things just don’t add up in the Xperia 1 III’s favor

But suppose you plan on trading in your phone in a couple of years anyway and you’re not on AT&T or don’t care about 5G (still a reasonable response to have toward 5G right now). The Xperia 1 III will deliver a very good picture-taking experience with camera hardware as good as anything else out there right now. You’ll get a great entertainment consumption device with good audio and a lovely screen. And if you’re interested in shooting video you’ll have a powerful tool in your hands right out of the box.

But none of these features go far enough above and beyond what you can get with an iPhone or Galaxy flagship to make the Xperia stand out. Factor in the shorter time frame for device support and uncertainty of any OS platform updates and things just don’t add up in the Xperia 1 III’s favor.

With most statutory controls in England due to end on Monday Mr Hunt said the situation facing the NHS is “very serious” with rapidly increasing numbers of hospital admissions.

“The warning light on the NHS dashboard is not flashing amber it is flashing red” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

Professor John Edmunds of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said new infections could reach 100000 a day within weeks.

Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he wants the lifting of lockdown on so-called “freedom day” to be “irreversible” but in recent days ministers have begun to sound more cautious.

While social-distancing rules in England will come to an end Government guidelines advise face masks should still be worn in enclosed spaces such as in shops and on public transport while pubs and bars should be table service only.

He pointed to the examples of Israel and the Netherlands which have been forced to reintroduce controls despite high levels of vaccination like the UK.

“Covid hospital patients are doubling every two weeks. That means we are heading for 10000 Covid hospital patients by the end of August which is about 20 times higher than this time last year” he said.

“I think coming into September we are almost certainly going to see infections reach a new daily peak going above the 68000 daily level which was the previous daily record in January.

“If they are still going up as the schools are coming back I think we are going to have to reconsider some very difficult decisions. How we behave over the next few weeks will have a material difference.”

Prof Edmunds said that without the social-distancing measures which brought the first two waves of the pandemic under control the virus would continue to spread.

“My hunch is that we are looking at a high level of incidence for a protracted period right through the summer and probably through much of the autumn.

“We started easing restrictions before everybody was vaccinated. That is going to lead to infections in the unvaccinated people – primarily in this instance the younger individuals.

“We are at about 50000 (infections) a day now. The epidemic has been doubling roughly every two weeks and so if we allow things as they are for another couple of weeks you could expect it to get to 100000 cases a day.”

He said England should have followed the example of Scotland and kept some infection control measure in place.

“What I have been concerned about for many months is that if the unlocking really is a big release… then there’s potential for a very large wave indeed” he told Times Radio.

“This idea that it would be a final ‘freedom day’ was I have to say somewhat naive. The public health expectation was that we would need additional measures to keep the rate of increase of cases under control.”

Mr Hunt said the Government needs to make urgent changes to the NHS Covid app amid evidence people are deleting it due to the high numbers being “pinged” and told to self-isolate.

“The risk with that app is that it is beginning to lose social consent and so we should either make it less sensitive or move to a system where you have to get a test when you are pinged” he said.

“The risk is that if people are deleting the app then you can’t even ping them to ask them to have a test.”",,,,,,,,,

California has led the way in many aspects of its response to the novel coronavirus. It was the first state to order a lockdown the first to move homeless people into motels and the first to provide financial assistance for undocumented workers.

If you have lost your job or your income during the COVID-19 shutdown here's where you can look for financial assistance in California.

Where to start

The first thing to know is that you are not alone. According to the Pew Research Center the virus has impacted more than 4 in 10 Americans in a major way. Here are some steps you should take to get back on your feet.

Make sure you file for unemployment in California if you have not yet done so.

Make a list of all your monthly bills and work out which ones are essential. Be ruthless -- cut back on anything you don't really need. Then speak to your service providers and any creditors to find out what assistance they are able to provide. For example many banks are helping customers by allowing them to suspend credit card payments or granting forbearance on loans.

Keep looking for work. Unemployment is high but some companies are still hiring. Even if you have to accept less money than you made before or go outside your comfort zone any cash you can bring in will help you get by during the crisis.

If you already have high-interest debt try to avoid taking on any more. If you are unable to pay down your credit card debt see if you can consolidate it with a lower-interest personal loan.

Obviously if you have emergency cash tucked away in your savings account now is the time to use it. There may be a second stimulus check in the works and the economy will eventually recover but in the meantime this is exactly the type of situation you saved your emergency fund for in the first place.

Getting support in California

California's Education Development Department has a list of resources online and you'll find more information on the state's COVID-19 site. If you are not sure where to turn call United Ways by dialing 2-1-1 to find resources on just about everything from credit counseling to healthcare assistance.

The California Public Utilities Commission has suspended disconnections of water gas and electricity until April 2021. It also has a list of affordable internet plans in your area.

If you are an undocumented worker speak to local NGOs to apply for help from the Resilience Fund.

What to do if you can't afford food in California

California's SNAP program is called CalFresh and is the largest food assistance program in America. It's designed to help low-income households put food on the table and you can apply online. There's an expedited processing service for those in dire straits such as households with less than $100 in the bank and less than $150 in monthly income.

It's also worth seeing whether you qualify for Women Infants and Children food benefits. And if you have older children download the CA Meals for Kids app to find nearby lunch programs.

There have been some delays to the state's P-EBT program which makes payments to parents of children who would otherwise have received school meals. The deadline for applications has been extended to July 15 and the program promises parents will hear back by July 30.

Local authorities have partnered with restaurants to deliver up to three meals a day to at-risk seniors. California's Great Plates Delivered program is scheduled to run until August 9.

The state also has a wide network of food banks to distribute donated food. If you don't qualify or have exhausted your SNAP benefits these food banks will provide emergency food assistance.

What to do if you can't pay your rent or mortgage in California

California's Governor Newsom has extended the state-wide moratorium on evictions until the end of September but if you are having trouble paying your rent don't wait until then. Talk to your landlord and try to prioritize rent payments if you are able.

The Los Angeles City Council recently approved a $100 million rental relief package. You can apply online through July 17 and households with an income at or lower than 80% of the area median can apply.

If you are a homeowner several major mortgage lenders including Wells Fargo U.S. Bank JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup have agreed to provide relief to borrowers in California. The lenders agreed to offer mortgage forbearance of up to 90 days and waive certain fees.

Lawmakers are also considering proposals to help homeowners tenants and landlords in the aftermath of the crisis. These include extended forbearance periods long-term payment plans for missed rent and ways to ensure missed rent payments during COVID-19 do not impact a person's credit score.

If you are homeless or at risk of homelessness the state's Homekey program may be able to help. Local authorities are able to place those who don't have a roof over their heads in hotels motels and vacant apartment buildings.

Find more information on the protections and resources in California for homeowners and renters from the state's housing agency. Make sure you are aware of the national housing assistance resources that are in place as well. If you or your landlord have a federally backed mortgage (such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages) help is available.

California has a number of protections in place in addition to the nationwide pandemic assistance. Taking advantage of the help you are entitled to may help you weather the storm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzM3OTQ1NjAwLWIyY2EtNDczOS04Yzc5LWQzZjZjYmI4M2NlYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US banks ramp up spending on pay and technology,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

They have been around for centuries and will probably be here for a long time. Here we take a look at the top 10 largest banks in the world. The ranking is based on data from S&P Global Intelligence which publishes a report on global banking and financial services every year ranking the world’s 100 largest banks based on total assets.

Ranked: Top 10 largest banks

American banks dominated the ranking for decades. But the emergence of China as a global economic powerhouse has helped many Chinese banks earn a place among the largest in the world. Out of the top 10 largest banks four are from China two from the US and two from France.

The S&P Global Market Intelligence’s ranking is based on total reported assets. It’s not adjusted for different accounting practices. The US banks use US GAAP method while banks in most other countries use the IFRS. If American banks reported under the IFRS method JPMorgan Chase would be the fourth biggest bank instead of sixth.

10- Credit Agricole

The second largest banking behemoth in France has total assets of $2117 billion. It has been ranked as one of the world’s most sustainable companies. Founded in 1894 Credit Agricole has a history of providing banking and other financial services to farmers. It also happens to be the world’s largest cooperative financial institution.

9- Bank of America

Personal finance guru Ramit Sethi has been a vocal critic of the Bank of America calling it “one of the worst banks on the planet.” But it is one of the world’s largest banks with total assets of $2281 billion. With a market value of $325 billion it’s the world’s third largest bank by market capitalization. The company strengthened its investment banking arm by acquiring Merrill Lynch in 2008.

8- BNP Paribas

The largest bank in France was created in 2000 following the merger of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Paribas. It has $2357 billion of assets under management. BNP Paris has more than 40 million customers in 75 countries across the globe.

7- HSBC Holdings

Headquartered in London HSBC is the largest bank in Europe with total assets of $2521 billion. It was established in 1885 as Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in British Hong Kong. It has offices in more than 80 countries offering consumer finance private banking corporate banking and investment banking services. HSBC has found itself in the midst of several scandals including money laundering in the last few years.

6- JPMorgan Chase & Co

This is the largest bank in the United States by total assets as well as by market capitalization. The company has $2533 billion in assets under management and its market value currently stands at $390 billion. It was formed in 2000 following the merger of JPMorgan & Co and Chase Manhattan Bank. It offers retail banking corporate banking asset management and private wealth management services.

5- Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group

The Japanese financial conglomerate has $2787 billion of assets under management. It offers retail banking corporate banking and investment banking services. It was formed in 2005 following the merger of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UFJ Bank. It is also the second largest public company in Japan. 4- Bank of China The top four largest banks on the planet are all Chinese which are known as the “Big Four.” The Bank of China has total assets of $2991 billion. It was established in 1912 as one of the official issuers of bank notes. The bank has a presence in more than 27 countries including Canada. Besides retail banking and corporate banking the Bank of China is engaged in insurance and wealth management services. 3- Agricultural Bank of China Also known as AgBank it has $3235 billion of assets under management. The Agricultural Bank of China was created in 1951 following the merger of the Cooperation Bank and the Farmers Bank of China. It has more than 330 million customers and 25000 branches across China. The state-owned giant is one of the world’s top 10 largest banks.

2- China Construction Bank Corp

Headquartered in Beijing the CCB has a staggering $3400 billion of assets under management. It offers retail banking corporate banking investment banking private equity and wealth management services. It also operates in the treasury sector dealing with debt securities money markets and currencies. Until 2013 the Bank of America owned a little over 10% of the China Construction Bank.

1- Industrial & Commercial Bank of China

China’s ICBC is the largest bank on the planet with total assets of $4009 billion. The state-owned bank offers retail banking corporate banking and investment banking services. It was founded in 1984. The ICBC has close to half a million employees across China.

This latest analysis follows the look at top employers of Harvard Stanford and Wharton MBAs (see Who Really Hires Harvard Stanford & Wharton MBAs These Days) a report on where McKinsey Bain & BCG hire the most MBAs and a look at the MBA hires by Goldman Sachs JPMorganChase & Morgan Stanley.

THE MOST FREQUENT TOP FIVE EMPLOYER ACROSS 24 SCHOOLS? AMAZON

The data reveals some big surprises. For one thing notes David White a founding partner of Menlo Coaching the top employers are not the same as the top feeders.”In unpublished research we identified Deloitte as the #1 largest feeder company to the 24 U.S. MBA programs we analyzed sending around twice as many students as the runner up BCG” he says. “However Deloitte is only the fifth largest post-MBA recruiter across these same 24 programs.”

So which company is the most frequent Top Five employer? Amazon. “It made the list of the top five employers at every M7 school.” says White. “In total it was a top five employer at 22 of the 24 MBA programs we examined. Beyond Amazon Google was the other big tech company to appear frequently in the top five employer lists.”

Not surprisingly perhaps some schools are local favorites of companies. “Although the top five employers at most MBA programs are national recruiters who appear in the lists for many different MBA programs there are a few major employers with a regional recruiting footprint” explains White. “For example Dell was a top five employer at UT Austin McCombs and UNC Kenan-Flagler but not at other MBA programs and Microsoft was a top five recruiter only at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business.”

GEOGRAPHY MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME MBA EMPLOYERS

For prospective MBA students the real takeaway might well be this: ""Graduates can join McKinsey Bain or BCG even if they are not at a top-ranked school"" adds White. ""We examined 14 MBA programs outside of (M7 + Haas Tuck Yale). In those 14 programs all but two include one of McKinsey Bain and BCG as one of their Top 10 employers. For example UCLA Anderson and NYU Stern both have all three firms among their top 10 employers.""

Once you expand to looking at the top 10 employers instead of the top five Facebook pops up frequently as another tech recruiter alongside Amazon and Google. In Menlo Coaching's top 10 employers report you can see a larger number of employers who recruit disproportionately at MBA programs near their headquarters with pairs like USC Marshall and Amgen Emory Goizueta and UPS Rice Jones and ExxonMobil and Chevron) as well as Washington Foster and Starbucks.

The company taking the largest percentage of MBAs out of any one school among the top 24 is the Boston Consulting Group at Kellogg: BCG has hired 11.5% of Kellogg graduates in the past three years. The only other double-digit employer from a single school is Amazon which has hired 10.3% of the MBA grads out of Washington Foster in three years.

AT STANFORD GOOGLE TIES BCG AS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR EMPLOYER

Overall at the 24 leading schools McKinsey and BCG are the #1 and #2 employers respectively. Bain follows in fourth place. Amazon ranks #3 at 4.1% and represents the only non-consulting firm in the top five (see table below). ""The high placement rate at Amazon reflects its position as a highly desirable company for MBAs targeting tech"" says White. ""It also reflects Amazon's own interest in hiring MBA graduates especially outside the M7: Amazon is the top employer for UNC Kenan-Flagler UCLA Anderson Texas McCombs Michigan Ross UW Foster NYU Stern and Duke Fuqua (tied).""

Only one financial services company makes the top ten: JPMorgan Chase employing just under 1% of the graduates in tenth place.

McKinsey Bain and BCG maintain their attraction for MBA graduates from M7 programs. Indeed for all M7 programs MBB ranks at the top (though Google ties BCG at Stanford's #3 according to Menlo's analysis. ""In addition to the clear relationship between M7 attendance and placement at an MBB firm listings for programs outside the M7 reveal strong placement rates at the Big Four strategy consulting firms or Deloitte PwC KPMG and EY-Parthenon"" adds White. ""Placements at Deloitte and EY-Parthenon are especially high across the board.""

But a joint investigation published this week by the Guardian and Food and Water Watch showed how this choice is largely an illusion. In fact a handful of mega firms dominate every link of the food supply chain: from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to cereals and beers.

And that is not good news for consumers in terms of choice and real competition on prices or for small and medium-sized farmers given little choice on what they grow or which animals they raise while food industry workers face low pay and high risks.

The planet also loses out when industrial agriculture is focused on extracting maximum profits for minimum costs – an exploitative model with grave consequences for animal welfare water land and global heating.

“It’s a system designed to funnel money into the hands of corporate shareholders and executives while exploiting farmers and workers and deceiving consumers about choice abundance and efficiency” said Amanda Starbuck a policy analyst at Food & Water Watch.

Here are some of the key figures and charts from our deep analysis of sales data from thousands of supermarkets across the US:

1. Almost 80% of dozens of everyday grocery items are supplied by just a handful of companies

Our research started by identifying dozens of different key grocery types that Americans buy every day including different kinds of veggies fruits and grains prepared foods beverages and animal products.

We then studied the scanner sales data from thousands of US stores that is compiled by market research firms for these products.

And our analysis revealed that a shocking 79% of the groceries in a basket of 61 everyday types of food and drink are being sold by a small amount of the top companies which we defined to mean four firms or fewer.

It’s widely agreed that consumers farmers small food companies and the planet lose out if the top four firms control 40% or more of total sales.

2. PepsiCo has a huge grip on the market for dips with 88% of market share

Our analysis showed that the consolidation of the food system runs deep: four firms or fewer controlled at least 50% of the market for 79% of our 61 types of groceries. For almost a third of shopping items the top firms controlled at least 75% of the market share.

The market for dips is a good example.

PepsiCo controls 88% of the dip market as it owns five of the most popular brands including Tostitos Lay’s and Fritos.

Snacks and condiments – market share for top three or four companies

3. Ninety-three per cent of the sodas we drink are owned by just three companies

In the carbonated soft drinks category of our research the power of just three firms was overwhelming accounting for 92.9% of sales in our analysis.

Coca-Cola has 42.4% PepsiCo has 27.4% and Keurig Dr Pepper has 23.1%.

This kind of dominance is not good news if you are a smaller operator of a drinks company trying to get a toehold in the market.

Across all types of food and drink the big firms are helped by so-called category captains in stores who represent leading brands or manufacturers and work with major retailers to decide which products get prominent spots on our supermarket shelves. This makes it very hard for new independent brands to get a break.

When they do get a tiny foothold it rarely lasts. Take craft beers a booming market thanks to hipsters and old-school beer enthusiasts which is why new brands are quickly acquired by mega breweries. It’s not clear from the labels but the Belgian beer giant Anheuser-Busch owns more than 600 brands including mainstream favorites like Budweiser and Beck’s.

Beverages – market share for top three or four companies

4. Just three firms dominate sales of 73% of the breakfast cereals we eat – despite shelves stacked with different boxes

We have all stood in front of a wall of cereal boxes in a supermarket and felt dizzy at the options. But really there is far less choice than you might think when you are deciding what cereal to have for breakfast.

Our research showed three firms dominate: General Mills with 27.9% market share Kellogg Company with 26.8% and Post Holdings with 18.1%.

5. More than 80% of beef processing and 70% of pork processing is controlled by four multinational giants

A spate of mega-mergers means that meatpacking plants are now controlled by just a handful of multinationals including Tyson JBS Cargill and Smithfield (now owned by the Chinese multinational WH Group).

Forty years ago only a third of the beef and pork processing industry was controlled by the top four firms.

But after a spate of mega mergers 80% of beef processing and 70% of pork processing is controlled by four multinational giants. In 2017 these top firms had a combined revenue of $207bn.

Portion of meat market controlled by the Top 4 companies

Meanwhile farmers and consumers lost out. In the last 40 years these huge corporations have been paying farmers less and less for beef and selling it to consumers at increasing prices.

How much farmers are paid for beef and how much distributors sell it for

Pork prices have stayed steady for consumers but farmers have been getting paid less and less.

How much farmers are paid for pork and how much distributors sell it for

So what can be done?

Last week Joe Biden signed an executive order to tackle the rampant concentration across the US economy – including food and farming. Biden called on government agencies to enforce existing anti-trust laws and consider rolling back recent mega-mergers which boosted profits and power for a handful of corporations while hurting the rest of us. The order specifically directs the USDA to take swift action to protect farmers including by making it easier for them to sue meat processors for alleged abuses.

But the problems in the current system run deep.

“From farm to fork America’s food system has been rooted in the exploitation of women Native Americans and people of color. This is at the heart of capitalist food politics – big corporations taking as much as they can and paying as little as possible for it” said Raj Patel an academic and the author of Stuffed and Starved: Markets Power and the Hidden Battle for the World’s Food System.

In addition to executive actions which could be overturned by the next president such deep-rooted injustices need sweeping reforms by Congress. But bills banning new mega-mergers and factory farms currently lack bipartisan support despite public opinion supporting them.

It’s time to support small-scale regenerative farmers regional food hubs and grocery co-ops according to Starbuck the policy analyst at Food & Water Watch. “Alternatives already exist. We just need to boost public funding and resources to help sustainable affordable more equitable food systems take root.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The now Mrs Gorman said she was immediately attracted by her husband’s personality.

“We didn’t know each other but he was throwing out some moves on the dancefloor and we started talking” she said.

“I definitely fell for him straight away.

“I just really liked his funny personality - we just clicked straight away.”

The smitten pair took their relationship to the next step in 2018 during a weekend away in the Lake District.

Mrs Gorman said: “Mark had hired a sports car for the weekend as a surprise and took me away for a few nights to the Lakes child-free.

“We ended up going to Buttermere and stopped to skim some stones.

“When I turned round to find a stone Mark was on one knee with a ring.

“I said yes immediately and promptly sat on his knee - it was lovely.”

The wedding was originally due to take place at the Abbey House Hotel in November but was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Instead the pair opted to wed at the registry office in Barrow on June 11 followed by a meal at the Old Farmhouse.

Mrs Gorman said: “We were originally meant to be having three times as many guests and it was meant to be at Abbey House but seeing as though we didn’t want to keep putting the date back we just decided to book it at the registry office.

“We’re planning on having a big night do when everything is back to normal.

“In the end having the smaller wedding made it really intimate and personal.

“The whole day was so fun and loving. It was very emotional.

“We had some very emotional informal speeches excellently done by my maid of honour Rebecca and Mark’s best men Craig and Paul.

“The meal at the Old Farmhouse was lovely and they catered excellently making it feel as normal as it could be in the circumstances.”

For their honeymoon the couple enjoyed a two night stay in Windermere at Applegarth Villa.

The newlyweds plan to have a family moon again when things return to normal.

This is as his boss might say a big deal.

Mr. Klain has previously hosted blowouts to celebrate his round-numbered birthdays notably his 50th in 2011 when hundreds of friends and Obama administration luminaries descended on a Maryland farm for a state fair-themed extravaganza complete with deep-fried Oreos and tributes to the honoree.

Plans for his 60th have become such a source of Beltway status anxiety that a small universe of Washington strivers is angling for details: Some have asked White House contacts whether a celebration is in the works and if invitations have gone out.

The commotion makes clear that Mr. Klain is an unquestioned man to see in the current White House the most influential chief of staff of recent vintage and a marked departure from the four battered and marginalized short-timers who held the position under President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Klain who was the chief of staff for Vice Presidents Biden and Al Gore is viewed in and out of the West Wing as the essential conductor of administration business a surrogate for the president and — in the mischievous portrayal of opponents — an all-powerful unelected orchestrator of an ultraliberal agenda.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZmluZXJ5MjkuY29tL2VuLWdiLzIwMjEvMDcvMTA1ODAwMzgvYnV5LW5vdy1wYXktbGF0ZXItbW9ydGdhZ2UtZWxpZ2liaWxpdHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Klarna & Clearpay Affect Your Mortgage Eligibility,"Unbothered

What's trending this morning:

Dubbing themselves ""digital nomads"" expats are moving to some of the world's most remote places where they can live and work in paradise. But many don't stick around long enough to reckon with the long-term effects of their lifestyle:

Many places desperate to revive their COVID-ravaged economies have gone to extraordinary lengths to welcome the nomads. Countries from Barbados and Aruba to Estonia and Georgia are offering special work visas that permit foreigners to stay for as long as six months often with an option to renew. Tulum according to Lonely Planet is the ""hotspot for digital nomads.""

But as more and more foreigners settle in for a year-round Burning Man Tulum is starting to look more like the next Fyre Fest. The troubles already plaguing the town – shoddy electricity a crappy sewer system polluted waters – are exacerbated by the flocks of Bluetoothed boobies.

Unlike the hordes of tourists who come and go for a few days nomads create a permanent strain on local infrastructure. They enjoy all the benefits of life in the tropics but they don't pay taxes.

Under the private-equity firm 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz was supposed to be a powerhouse in the food world – but so far it hasn't gone as planned:

Current and former employees said 3G-approved executives and a maniacal focus on cutting costs have hobbled the two historic brands. Many are leaving and fear for the company's future especially as a sales boost from eating at home fades post-pandemic.

While other food companies such as General Mills and Kellogg risk a similar slowdown as society opens up Kraft Heinz is in a more dire place analysts said.

Insiders said that 3G's cost-cutting has left the company unable to introduce new products such as plant-based meat. They also said the deep cuts have caused morale to plummet and turnover to soar.

Here's what else employees said about the merger:

The goal is to deliver packages to customers' doorsteps using fully electric drones. The problem is that Amazon's Prime Air team is seeing internal conflict high turnover and launch delays that threaten the project's success:

The tensions came to a head at an all-hands meeting in March where Prime Air's leadership answered questions that employees submitted and voted on. Questions zeroed in on these contentious issues including those between longtime employees and new hires who the former accuse of moving too slowly. They also brought up the division's high turnover rate which was 20% in 2020.

The question that received the most upvotes pointed to a cultural clash between the new executives and existing company structure according to a transcript of the meeting obtained by Insider.

""One peer remarked that in the last year all four of the individuals in his leadership chain have been replaced by Boeing expats"" the inquiry said referring to the multiple executives who joined Amazon from Boeing in the past year. ""What are we doing to preserve Amazon's unique culture and principles within Prime Air while building out our org with established industry leaders?""

We spoke with eight Black women in high-powered asset-management roles who talked openly about microaggressions mentors and diversity on Wall Street:

""It's a male-dominated industry and what some would call a good ol' boys' club"" said Dekia Scott the chief investment officer of the Atlanta-based energy company Southern Company when asked whether the industry understands why it has a diversity and equity problem.

""With evolution and more women going into the investment field those numbers have begun to change. But the whys of how we got here I think everyone knows it.

""Are we prepared to change it? I think it depends on who you talk to. I view this issue as turning a 757 aircraft in slow-course fashion versus just hooking a right in a Dodge minivan. It's a tremendously large industry. It's not going to make huge strides in a year or two or three. But we should make meaningful change.""

PAUL — Minnesota already the home or birthplace of the Hamm’s Bear the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Dough Boy can add a well-known newcomer to its pantheon of iconic food brand mascots. At the ripe old age of 105 — or age 1 depending upon how you count — Mr. Peanut rolled into St. Paul’s Como Regional Park on Thursday July 15 to celebrate his adoption by Hormel Foods.

Hormel based in Austin Minn. completed purchase of the entire Planters snack nut portfolio from Kraft Heinz for $3.35 billion in June. The acquisition included Planters Nut-rition Planters Cheez Balls and Corn Nuts as well as three production facilities.

The dapper Mr. Peanut mascot who dresses in a top hat monocle and a cane was born in 1916 and laid to rest in January 2020 weeks ahead of the Super Bowl in an advertising campaign that featured him sacrificing himself to save actors Wesley Snipes and Matt Walsh after an explosive crash involving the NUTmobile. He was resurrected a few weeks later as a well-dressed Baby Nut in a Super Bowl LIV commercial.

The 26-foot-long NUTmobile which tours the country promoting the Planters brand also made a showing at Como Park. As part of its promotional campaign Mr. Peanut is distributing $5 million nationally mostly in the form of $10000 “Little Acts of Substance” checks to nonprofits and individuals involved in charitable acts. A total of 10 checks will be distributed in Minnesota this summer to five nonprofits and “five Minnesotans who add substance to their community” reads a prepared statement from the company.

On Thursday Mr. Peanut awarded $10000 to the Thielen Foundation a youth sports initiative founded by Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen.",,,,,,,,,

Cheese pizza arrives at Kroger grocery stores nationwide,"article

If your kid has been missing Chuck E. Cheese you may find a staple of the family entertainment venue in your local grocery store.

CEC Entertainment announced this week it reached a deal with Flatlander Foods to bring Chuck E. Cheese’s signature pizza exclusively to the Kroger Company’s frozen food aisles. The pizzas are available with pepperoni or just plain cheese.

""We are thrilled to bring Chuck E. Cheese to the grocery aisle with a new product inspired by our famous pizza and created to be enjoyed in family homes across the country"" CEC Entertainment spokesperson Melissa McLeanas said in a news release. ""This partnership is just the beginning as we continue to grow our Licensing Division and extend our brand in new categories for families to enjoy outside of our four walls.""

CEC Entertainment made strides internationally last year focusing on Latin America and Europe. But the company hasn’t forgotten its roots.

The pizzas are produced in the United States and follow the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutritional guidelines. Each pizza which costs $6.99 comes with 250 e-tickets that can be used on future visits to any participating Chuck E. Cheese locations.

Last month the company took its beloved characters outside of their venues for a live concert tour through Clearwater Fla. Nashville Tenn. Atlanta Ga. and Dallas Texas.

Over the next three years CEC Entertainment plans to open more than 100 new stores in the U.S. and abroad.

COLUMBIA S.C. — Recipients of Women Infant and Children (WIC) benefits in South Carolina can now use self-checkout lanes at two major grocery retailers with locations around the state.

The state's Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) announced on Monday that participants in the WIC program can now use their WIC cards at the self-checkout lanes of both Walmart and Kroger.

“This newly available method for checking out should help make WIC participants’ shopping experience easier” WIC Vendor Management Unit Manager Lorraine Glover said.

WIC which provides several services including access to nutritious food has about 72000 program participants in South Carolina. There are about 600 authorized retailers.

In order to use the self-checkouts at store locations the participant's eWIC card needs to be the first type of payment used during the transaction. And other features like balance enquiry will still require a standard register and cashier.

(WKYT) - UPDATE -- The Versailles Police Department has confirmed Luke Craig is in custody.

They say around 6:40 p.m. police got a tip that an individual was at Kroger in Versailles who matched the description of Craig.

Police say Craig ran into the treeline behind the store where they found him.

Versailles police took him into custody before he was transferred to Kentucky State Police custody.

We’ll keep you updated.

------

Lexington Police and Kentucky State Police are searching for a teen who escaped from the Fayette Regional Juvenile Detention Center.

At just 16 years old Kentucky State Police warn Luke Craig is a threat to public safety. He escaped Sunday afternoon at around 3:45.

Troopers say if you see him do not approach him but call KSP instead. They say he’s considered dangerous. He’s about 5-foot-5 weighs around 130 pounds and wearing a green jumpsuit and black sneakers.

Craig is accused of killing his mother and sister in Anderson County September of last year. He led officers on a chase through Anderson Franklin and Shelby counties. Officers finally caught up to Craig in Jefferson County.

As for his current whereabouts Trooper Bernis Napier with Kentucky State Police says it’s hard to pinpoint a specific area.

“We’ve been receiving calls and tips and we’re investigating all of those leads and going to all those locations to see if we can locate him” Trooper Napier said. “Some of them are out of the Lexington area but we’re still checking those areas and making sure he’s not there and if he is there we can try and get him located and picked up.”

Trooper Napier says part of the ongoing investigation is how Craig escaped.

SURFSIDE Fla. – Theresa Velasquez a music executive at Live Nation has been identified as a victim in the collapse of a 12-story Florida condominium that killed at least 97 people authorities announced Saturday.

The Miami-Dade Police Department said in a news release that Velasquez 36 was a confirmed fatality in the June 24 collapse of the Champlain Towers South condo. Her body was recovered July 8.

She becomes the 95th fatality identified in the collapse police said.

Velasquez a Los Angeles-based executive for the event promotion company had flown into Miami to visit her parents at the Surfside condo both of whom also died in the collapse.

""Theresa was an impassioned leader at Live Nation who elevated every project she was part of at the same time breaking down barriers for women and the LGBTQIA+ community"" the company said in a statement. ""We will always remember and honor the impact she made and will miss her dearly.""

In June 2020 Velasquez was included in Billboard's Pride List of music industry-shaping LGBTQ executives.

A day after the collapse Live Nation Entertainment president/CEO Michael Rapino tweeted ""Keeping Theresa Velasquez in our thoughts one of LiveNation’s own and a beloved friend daughter sister and co-worker. Sending love to everyone in Surfside – we need miracles tonight.""

The bodies of Velasquez's parents Julio Velasquez 66 and Angela Velasquez 60 were recovered and identified earlier. Angela owned a small men's clothing shop called Fiorelli.

The recovery effort at the condo site is slowly winding down with perhaps one more body still buried in the rubble. Work is now shifting toward determining what caused the oceanfront condo to come down.

A judge is also considering what should be done with the building site. An outright property sale government purchase for construction of a memorial or a combination of both are among the suggestions.

Theresa Velasquez 36 was listed as a victim of the collapse on Saturday in the Miami-Dade Police Department’s daily press release. The Miami-Dade PD noted that Velasquez’s body was recovered on July 8. According to the Miami Herald Velasquez had arrived in Miami the night before the collapse to visit her parents Julio and Angela Velasquez who both also died in the collapse.

But for those who work and perform at the venue something important will be missing.

Derek Boczkowski one of 313 Presents’ primary events production managers — since September 1989 when he joined the staff at The Palace of Auburn Hills — died unexpectedly of heart failure on March 5 at the age of 49. He was a genuinely beloved fixture primarily at DTE but also at the company’s other venues usually the first person performers would see when they arrived and the person charged with making sure things went smoothly — or at least as smoothly as possible — for any given event.

“He was a true heart” says 313 Presents President Howard Handler. “He was the essence of all of us who love putting on shows and on some levels he was every fan. He lived for the shows and for the artists. He was always the first guy to the meeting a big smile on his face. He loved what he did.”

Gina Lacy Talkington Boczkowski’s girlfriend of eight years adds that his drive was simply “the people.”

“He just loved meeting all the different people and he loved making people happy — even if it was people he didn’t know just putting on a show that made everybody happy and enjoy themselves. It really was just the people in general.”

Befitting his gregarious personality and bearlike physical presence Boczkowski left behind a treasure trove of memories with family friends co-workers and colleagues — as well as artists with whom he developed relationships. Eminem invited Boczkowski to play basketball at his house for instance and he would periodically journey south to be part of Hootie & the Blowfish’s annual Monday After the Masters charity golf tournament. Detroit-born comedian John Heffron became a friend and will perform at a celebration for Boczkowski on Nov. 12 at Mark Ridley’s Comedy Castle in Royal Oak.

Talkington says Jimmy Buffett’s visits to Detroit were special as well. “He was always really excited for those shows” she remembers adding he soldiered through one with a torn cornea. “He went in even though he could hardly see all day long because it was (Buffett).”

Common among all are stories of warmth dedication and dependability as well as gestures small and magnanimous and a perpetually cheerful demeanor despite grueling hours. Boczkowski got the job done in a seamless fashion and was there to do it again sometimes just hours later — often employing verbiage that co-workers dubbed “the Derektionary.”

When the circus hit town Boczkowski could sometimes be seen walking behind the elephants with a shovel when the situation required. He would help clear chairs from an arena floor or step in for an absent runner to help transport a performer on the ground. He made sure VIPs were taken care of even when unannounced and he could produce “magical” parking spots backstage when needed.

And during the pandemic Boczkowski was still out at DTE painting railings as well as overseeing shows such as Jurassic Quest and Magic of Lights.

“He was such an amazing human being” remembers Live Nation’s Ron Clause noting that Boczkowski always helped care for Clause’s dog Miss Bella who regularly came to shows. “After a long 20-plus hour day he would often say ‘It was a great day Ron but after all these hours with you I may have to go to church two times this week. Maybe three.'”

Few tales illustrate Boczkowski’s mettle better than the summer 2014 Masters of the Mic rap show at DTE headlined by DMX who also died this year. Brian Szlaga 313’s director of entertainment booking recalls that DMX was running late that night — in fact did not leave the hotel until 15 minutes after he was due on stage with a tight 11 p.m. curfew. Despite Boczkowski’s visible agitation DMX and his tour manager pulled him into his usual pre-show prayer circle.

“Derek took off his hat bowed his head and let DMX do his thing all the while internally freaking out because … he wasn’t on stage yet” Szlaga says. In the show summary Boczkowski — who attended services twice a week at Kensington Church in Troy — wrote that DMX “was so inspiring the Pope would have been impressed!” The rapper wound up playing a 20-minute set and spent another 10 minutes taking photos with fans before leaving the stage.

“Derek never wanted to upset anyone” notes Jim Reid who worked with Boczkowski at Palace Sports & Entertainment and is now a senior director of festival operations for Live Nation. “He always wanted to fix it massage it make it right.”

Boczkowski’s interest in live entertainment production started at an early age according to his younger brother Brian. Raised mostly in Sterling Heights a steady diet of events including sports stoked a desire for the elder Boczkowski to be part of that world. “Our parents weren’t musicians or anything but we always grew up listening to music. That was his love” Brian says.

Boczkowski graduated from Central Michigan University with a degree in commercial recreational facility management. But he really exercised his passion attending Disney University in Florida and interning at The Palace before being hired full-time.

“He loved The Mouse and believed wholly in the Disney Way” Reid says. “I don’t know if Disney taught him to care or if his care drew him to Disney but Derek had an incredible level of care.”

Connie Marshall Rautenberg who trained Boczkowski at The Palace and remained friends with him after she left in 2002 remembers him as “eager really gung-ho super-passionate very excitable at times but in a good way.” Time off she says often found Boczkowski back at Disney. “He always came back with ideas which was great.”

Boczkowski was also a fan — “but in a cool way” Reid says — often taking pictures with the performers but also those around them. “It was more about Derek wanting to have some fun and share things with his staff” says Gary Meyer a production director for Live Nation who worked scores of shows with Boczkowski. “Accounts event staff interns — he would post some pictures with as many people as he could.”

Dave Clark Live Nation’s Great Lakes Region president adds that there was always a sense of comfort and confidence when Boczkowski was working a show. “The job is Smokey the Bear; I don’t want to be the firefighter I want to be the guy who prevents forest fires” he explains. “I always knew it was going to be a lot easier when Derek was on the case.”

Away from the venues he worked at Boczkowski could often be found being entertained. Anything related to the British bands Joy Division and New Order in particular were must-sees. He was in fact buried in a New Order T-shirt. Boczkowski could often be found at the Comedy Castle and produced Laughapalooza concerts for Mark Ridley at the Meadow Brook Amphitheatre.

“He and I just loved to exchange comedy stories” Ridley says. “He always had had numerous suggestions for me about which comedians to bring in. I jokingly said at one time ‘Derek I’m gonna throw my position as booking agent over to you.’ Sure enough he’d have one or two (ideas) that were spot-on.”

Even at the Comedy Castle Ridley adds Boczkowski was always up to take a photo with the headliner.

313’s Handler says plans are being made for “a proper memorial” for Boczkowski backstage at DTE while Live Nation’s Clark reports that a veteran production manager asked about Boczkowski during a recent Jimmy Buffett concert in Indiana. “He goes ‘Who is gonna replace Derek?'” Clark says. “I said ‘Well I can answer your question two ways: Yes there’s another body that can fill that role but that doesn’t mean anybody can replace Derek.”

Adds Mark Hogue Bob Seger’s most recent production manager “Derek was a fine man and upheld the tradition of great production guys at (DTE). I knew them all. He was always one that put a smile on my face each time I saw him. I have the Seger banner from The Palace hanging in my living room and think of (Boczkowski) each time I see it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2NhbDEwLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjEvMDcvMTcvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtbGl2ZS1uYXRpb24tZXhlYy1oYWQtYXJyaXZlZC1uaWdodC1iZWZvcmUtc3VyZnNpZGUtYnVpbGRpbmctY29sbGFwc2UtdG8tdmlzaXQtcGFyZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los Angeles music exec had arrived night before Surfside building collapse to visit parents,"Theresa Velasquez 36 was an executive with Live Nation Entertainment in Los Angeles who had arrived to visit her parents Angela Maria and Julio Cesar Velasquez the night before the collapse at Surfside. Her parents lived in Apt. 304. All three perished in the collapse.

SURFSIDE Fla. – Miami-Dade County police on Saturday identified 36-year-old Theresa Velasquez as the latest victim of the Surfside collapse.

As of Saturday 95 victims have been identified and 95 families have been notified according to Miami-Dade County. 97 missing persons reports were opened with the Miami-Dade Police Department while 241 people are accounted for according to the latest information.

Theresa an executive with the entertainment company Live Nation arrived from Los Angeles on Wednesday night June 23 to visit her parents. It was the night before the collapse of the Champlain Towers South.

Angela Maria 60 and Julio Cesar Velasquez 67 lived in Apartment 304 for nearly a decade. Angela born in Colombia was well known in the community as the owner of Fiorelli a men’s clothing and furnishings retailer inside the Weston Town Center.

The couple’s daughter Theresa — a.k.a. DJ Theresa — got her start in the music industry in Miami Beach as a nightclub deejay. She eventually began touring internationally as a deejay and producer where she would be featured at large events including Super Martxe in Madrid and Circuit Festival in Barcelona Miami Beach’s White Party and Aqua Girl Miami New York’s Electric Zoo and Mysteryland USA on the former site of Woodstock in Bethel N.Y.

Teaming up with Grammy-nominated deejay Hector Fonseca she started her own music label Audio4Play in 2011. According to her Linked In page Audio4Play leads the LGBT nightlife scene showcasing today’s hottest up and coming talent in nightlife.

Performing music and touring as a deejay inspired Theresa to learn about the business side of the industry. She graduated from Georgetown University in Washington D.C. then got a master’s degree in music business from New York University. She went on to work for Sony Music SFX Entertainment and had been an executive with Live Nation Entertainment for the past six years.

Live Nation CEO and president Michael Rapino described Theresa as “a beloved friend daughter sister and co-worker” in a Twitter post soon after the collapse.

On Thursday July 1 before any of the three were recovered the couple’s son and Theresa’s brother David who lives in New York spoke at a vigil for his family which was organized by the Weston Town Center. Angela was known by many having been one of the first tenants of the center as a shop owner for nearly two decades.

Theresa and Angela were recovered on Thursday July 8 while Julio was recovered the next day according to Miami-Dade Police.

Officials have said that efforts to recover remains from the debris are nearing an end.

The M142 HIMARS is a light multiple rocket launcher mounted on a standard Army M1140 truck frame that was developed for the U.S. Army in the late 1990s. It carries a single six-pack of rockets or one ATACMS missile on the Army's Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) 5-ton truck and can launch the entire MLRS family of munitions. HIMARS ammunition is interchangeable with the MLRS M270A1 but it is only able to carry one pod rather than the standard two for the M270 and A1 variants.

The HIMARS can be transported on the C-130 aircraft and be deployed in areas previously inaccessible to heavier launchers. The HIMARS fire control system electronics and communications units are interchangeable with the MLRS M270A1 launcher and the crew and training are the same.

Under a contract with the U.S. Army Lockheed Martin has delivered more than 400 HIMARS launchers to the Army Marine Corps and international customers. Since May 2005 the Army has fielded eleven additional battalions in both active and National Guard units and plans to field six more. The Marine Corps has fielded more than 38 launchers.

The HIMARS which was successfully combat-tested in Operation Iraqi Freedom has also been deployed by such countries as Jordan Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9taC02MC1yLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXByb21vdGVkLWJ5LXRydW1wLXNvbGQtYnktbG9ja2hlZWQtaW5kaWFuLW5hdnktZmluYWxseS1pbmR1Y3RzLTFzdC1iYXRjaC1vZi1tdWx0aS1yb2xlLWNob3BwZXJzL9IBkgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9taC02MC1yLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXByb21vdGVkLWJ5LXRydW1wLXNvbGQtYnktbG9ja2hlZWQtaW5kaWFuLW5hdnktZmluYWxseS1pbmR1Y3RzLTFzdC1iYXRjaC1vZi1tdWx0aS1yb2xlLWNob3BwZXJzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MH-60-R Helicopters: Promoted By Trump & Sold By Lockheed Indian Navy Finally Inducts 1st Batch Of Multi-Role Choppers,"The Indian Navy has received the first two of its 24 multi-role MH-60-R (Romeo) helicopters from the US Navy the Defense Ministry said on Saturday.

A statement issued by the ministry said the navy received MH-60-R helicopters in a ceremony held at the US Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego on Friday.

“MH-60R helicopters manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation USA is an all-weather helicopter designed to support multiple missions with state of the art avionics/sensors” the statement said adding that “induction of these MRH would further enhance the Indian Navy’s three-dimensional capabilities.”

The Indian Navy is buying 24 of these helicopters from the US government through foreign military sales. “The helicopters would also be modified with several India Unique Equipment and weapons” it said.

The first batch of Indian personnel is currently receiving training in the US “to exploit these potent helicopters” the ministry said.

These helicopters are a replacement for the Sea King 42/ 42A helicopters which were decommissioned in the 1990s and are “envisioned to operate from frontline ships and aircraft carriers providing them the critical attributes of the flexibility of operation enhanced surveillance and attacking capability” the Indian Navy had said in an earlier press release.

“The delivery of the helicopters … comes at a time when the Indian Ocean Region is witnessing increasing security threats due to the proliferation of submarines” the navy said.

“The helicopters can be effectively employed for offensive and defensive roles including Anti-Submarine Warfare Anti-Ship Strike Low-Intensity Maritime Operations Search and Rescue over the horizon Network Centric Operations and Electronic Warfare.”

The statement said the acquisition of MH-60R has provided the “Indian Navy with a key capability and effectively contributes to the make in India initiative.”

Last year in February the then US President Donald Trump had confirmed that India and the United States were set to sign a $3 billion contract on delivering US-made helicopters and other military equipment to the South Asian country.

“And I am pleased to announce that tomorrow our representatives will sign deals to sell over three billion dollars in the absolute finest state-of-the-art military helicopters and other equipment to the Indian Armed Forces” Trump had said during his speech at a cricket stadium in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.

The US president also praised the New Delhi-Washington military cooperation and joint drills between the two countries.

Earlier in the month India’s Cabinet Committee on Security approved the purchase of $2.6 billion worth 24 Sikorsky MH-60R Seahawk naval anti-submarine helicopters for the Indian Navy from the US.

A ceremony that marked the formal transfer of the helicopters from the US Navy to the Indian Navy was attended by India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu. ""The induction of the all-weather multi role helicopters is an important milestone in India-US bilateral defence ties"" Sandhu said on the occasion.

The Indian Navy is procuring a total of 24 of these helicopters manufactured by Lockheed Martin under foreign military sales from the US government at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion. The deal was signed in February 2020 when the then US president Donald Trump was on his maiden visit to India.

According to the Indian Navy these are all-weather helicopters designed to support multiple missions with state-of-the-art avionics and sensors. ""The helicopters would be modified with several India-specific unique equipment and weapons"" Commander Vivek Madhwal spokesperson for the Indian Navy said. He added that induction of these helicopters would further enhance the Indian Navy’s three-dimensional capabilities. ""In order to exploit these potent helicopters the first batch of Indian crew is presently undergoing training in the US"" Commander Madhwal added.

The US Navy tweeted that this deal will enhance navy-to-navy cooperation and “strengthen our combined subsurface and surface warfare capability and capacity in the Indo-Pacific region.”

The ceremony also witnessed exchange of documents between Vice Adm Kenneth Whitesell Commander Naval Air Forces US Navy and Vice Adm Ravneet Singh DCNS. Senior leadership of the US Navy and Lockheed Martin Corporation were also present.

William L. Blair Vice President and Chief Executive Lockheed Martin India said: “MH-60R is the most advanced maritime multi-mission helicopter in operation - deployed globally and its mission performance by far second to none. We appreciate the tremendous confidence placed in Team Seahawk by the Indian Navy through their selection of the Romeo. We stand committed to making this program a tremendous success in partnership with the United States Navy and the Indian Navy.”

Multiple official sources confirmed that the first batch of helicopters will arrive in India by June 2022. The deliveries of all 24 helicopters are scheduled to be completed by 2025.

The 24 MH-60R helicopters built by Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky Aircraft will be procured under the 'government-to-government' route. The MH-60R is the US Navy's primary anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare helicopter and is also capable of search and rescue and supply missions. These helicopters will replace 15 Sea King anti-submarine warfare helicopters de-inducted from service in 1991 and one Sea King 42B MRH lost in an accident. The current MRHs in service—Sea King 42Bs—were inducted in the 1980s when the Indian Navy got its now decommissioned aircraft carrier INS Viraat.

As multiple attempts by Indian Navy to procure helicopters for its frontline warships have been delayed it has led to acute shortage of its helicopter fleet. Its warships like Kolkata class destroyers are operating without anti-submarine helicopters on board. While the Indian Navy’s programme for 111 Naval Utility Helicopters is yet to be formalised the Navy in April decided to lease light helicopters to meet the crucial requirement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXp6L2Vsb24tbXVza3MtbGlnaHQtcmVhZGluZy1zZXNzaW9uLXdpdGgtc29uLWxpbC14LWlzLXdoeS1oZXMtZWxvbi1tdXNrLTM5Njk1MDAuaHRtbNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvYnV6ei9lbG9uLW11c2tzLWxpZ2h0LXJlYWRpbmctc2Vzc2lvbi13aXRoLXNvbi1saWwteC1pcy13aHktaGVzLWVsb24tbXVzay0zOTY5NTAwLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk's 'Light Reading' Session With Son 'Lil X' is Why He's Elon Musk,"Apart from rambling about dogecoin and space voyages Tesla Boss Elon Musk is very popular to lighten Twitter often with his tweets (read: memes). on Thursday However Musk shared an adorable picture of his one-year-old son leaning over a magazine page that featured an article “Lockheed A-12.” However the picture has garnered attention on social media and made fans think about why the toddler was reading such magazines rather than doing baby things.

Along with the picture Musk wrote: “Some light reading with lil X”

Musk’s son X Æ A-12 who was born on May 4 last year amid the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic left many scratching their heads and wracking their brains over the right way to pronounce his name. Many even wondered what the cryptic code-like name meant. While Canadian musician Grimes had previously explained the meaning of X Æ A-12 Musk on SNL joked that it was pronounced ‘Cat running across the keyboard’. The joke came during his monologue on the show got many laughs on the internet as well as among fans.

Later Grimes has revealed that she and Musk had changed their son’s name according to California Law where names must be written on birth certificates using the 26 alphabetical letters of the English language however apostrophes and dashes can also be included. Following this in the birth certificate it states that the baby’s first name is “X” its middle name is “AE A-XII” and its last name is “Musk” Independent Reported.

•X the unknown variable ⚔️•Æ my elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial intelligence)•A-12 = precursor to SR-17 (our favorite aircraft). No weapons no defenses just speed. Great in battle but non-violent + (A=Archangel my favorite song) (⚔️ metal rat)— Grimes (@Grimezsz) May 6 2020

Earlier this year Claire Elise Boucher known professionally as Grimes had shared a video of their son playing with a portable keyboard. Grimes celebrated her 33rd birthday on March 17 and the musician wrote that the kid all of 10 months surprised his mom with a loop on her keyboard.

The singer wrote “It’s my Bday!!! Also lil X made a loop on my keyboard? Prob an accident but tbh he played a super fire set just now.”

The Indian Navy is procuring 24 of these helicopters manufactured by Lockheed Martin under foreign military sales from the US government at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion.

A ceremony was held at the Naval Air Station North Island or NAS North Island San Diego on Friday that marked the formal transfer of the helicopters from US Navy to Indian Navy. It was attended by India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu.

The ceremony also witnessed exchange of documents between Vice Adm Kenneth Whitesell Commander Naval Air Forces US Navy and Vice Adm Ravneet Singh DCNS. Senior leadership of the US Navy and Lockheed Martin Corporation were also present.

Sandhu said the induction of the all-weather multi role helicopters is an important milestone in India-US bilateral defense ties.

India US friendship Touching the Skies! he said in a tweet. He noted that the bilateral defence trade has expanded to over 20 billion dollars in the last couple of years.

Going beyond defence trade India and the US are also working together on co-production and co-development of defense platforms he said.

Sandhu also highlighted reform measures that have been undertaken by India in the defense sector in recent times that have opened up new opportunities for foreign investors.

The MH-60R helicopter is an all-weather helicopter designed to support multiple missions with state-of-the-art avionics.

The induction of these MRH would enhance Indian Navy's three-dimensional capabilities. The helicopters would also be modified with several unique equipment and weapons.

The first batch of the Indian crew is presently undergoing training in the US.

According to the Department of Defense the proposed sale will provide India the capability to perform anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions along with the ability to perform secondary missions including vertical replenishment search and rescue and communications relay.

India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defence. India will have no difficulty absorbing these helicopters into its armed forces it had said in a communication to the Congress in April 2019.

The Indian cabinet had cleared the purchase of the helicopters in February 2020 weeks before the historic visit of the then US President Donald Trump."

In Ferra v. Loews Hollywood Hotel LLC the court unanimously held that employers must pay premium payments to employees for missed meal rest and recovery breaks at the employee’s “regular rate of pay” instead of their base hourly rate as many employers were doing. The regular rate of pay may be higher than the base hourly rate because the regular rate of pay must include all nondiscretionary incentive payments such as bonuses and commissions. Moreover because the court’s decision applies retroactively the court created exposure for California employers that acted in good faith trying to comply with the law by paying premium pay at the base hourly rate. California employers should expect a new wave of class action and Private Attorney General Act (PAGA) claims based on this decision.

Background

Jessica Ferra was a bartender for Loews who earned an hourly wage as well as quarterly nondiscretionary incentive payments. According to Loews’s meal and rest break policy hourly employees who are not provided with a compliant meal or rest period are entitled to an additional hour of pay according to their base hourly wage at the time the meal or rest period was not provided. Loews did not factor in nondiscretionary payments (like Ferra’s quarterly incentive payments) which employees may have earned in addition to hourly wages  into the calculation of premium pay owed under section 226.7(c) of the California Labor Code.

Ferra alleged that “Lowes by omitting nondiscretionary incentive payments from its calculation of premium pay failed to pay her for noncompliant meal or rest breaks in accordance with her ‘regular rate of compensation’ as required by section 226.7(c).” The trial court ruled in favor of Loews and the appellate court affirmed. The California Supreme Court reversed concluding that premiums paid for break violations must be at the higher “regular rate of pay” which must include a calculation of incentive compensation in its rate.

Regular Rate of Pay for Overtime

California law provides that daily overtime rates are multiples of employees’ regular rates of pay. The overtime rate for workers who are paid a guaranteed hourly rate and performance-based incentive bonuses or piecework earnings take those incentive payments to be part of their regular rates—making the overtime pay greater than their base hourly rate. An employee is thus entitled to one and one-half times his or her regular rate of pay for time worked in excess of 8 hours in one day and double his or her regular rate of pay for time worked more than 12 hours in one day.

The court explained that the reasoning behind application of the regular rate of pay includes the California legislature’s statements that “[t]he eight-hour workday is the mainstay of protection for California’s working people” “[n]umerous studies have linked long work hours to increased rates of accident and injury” and “[f]amily life suffers when either or both parents are kept away from home for an extended period of time on a daily basis.” The court also noted that the higher overtime rate serves as a disincentive against requiring employees to work overtime.

Regular Rate of Compensation

California law also requires premium payments for meal rest and recovery break violations. “If an employer does not provide an employee with a compliant meal rest or recovery period … section 226.7(c) [of the Labor Code] requires the employer to ‘pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee’s regular rate of compensation.’” Loews argued for the application of the canon of statutory interpretation that “a lawmaker is presumed to intend a different meaning when it uses different words in a statutory scheme.” Because the legislature used the term “regular rate of compensation” instead of “regular rate of pay” many courts concluded that the legislature intended premium payments to be paid at the base hourly rate of pay.

The California Supreme Court disagreed. The court applied a different principle of construction that provides that “where statutes use synonymous words or phrases interchangeably those words or phrases should be understood to have the same meaning.” The court concluded that the legislature and the courts had used the terms “pay” and “compensation” interchangeably and thus the court interpreted the legislature’s intent to apply the same meaning to both terms.

The court also identified several policy reasons to apply the regular rate of pay to premium payments including that “when [employees] are forced to work through break periods [there are] ‘greater risks of work-related accidents and increased stress’” and “denials of ‘time free from employer control that is often needed to be able to accomplish important personal tasks.’”

The court also notes that “[w]hen construing the Labor Code and wage orders [the court] adopt[s] the construction that best gives effect to the purpose” of protecting employees regarding “working conditions wages and hours.” Thus the court “liberally construe[s] the Labor Code and wage orders to favor the protection of employees.”

Retroactive Application

The court concluded the opinion by clarifying that its decision applies retroactively unpersuaded by the potential exposure such a determination presented to employers:

Loews argues that our decision will have a substantive effect because it will expose employers to “millions” in liability. But Loews cites no evidence that retroactive application of our holding will expose employers to “millions” in liability and even if Loews were correct it is not clear why we should favor the interest of employers in avoiding “millions” in liability over the interest of employees in obtaining the “millions” owed to them under the law.

California employers can expect a new deluge of class and collective actions seeking statutory and civil penalties for failing to pay meal rest and recovery break premiums at the regular rate of pay.

Key Takeaways

In light of the court’s decision California employers may want to consider taking the following steps:

Update Premium Pay Systems

Employers may want to update their premium payment systems to pay any meal rest or recovery period premium payments in accordance with the applicable regular rate of pay. Because premium payments are often due before earned incentive compensation is final and can be calculated employers may want to develop a process of retroactively making “true up” payments at the regular rate of pay for break premiums previously paid.

Restitution Payments

Employers may want to provide restitution payments to employees who received premium payments in prior periods at the base rate only rather than the regular rate of pay may help to avoid the costs of litigation including statutory and civil penalties attorneys’ fees and related costs.

Incentive Compensation Programs

Employers may find it useful to modify or eliminate incentive compensation programs that unreasonably increase the administrative burden of having to make retroactive “true up” calculations for premium payments.

Waiver Programs

Employers may want to adopt a first and second meal break waiver program that enables employees to voluntarily waive their first meal break for shifts of 6 hours or less and their second meal breaks for shifts that are more than 10 hours (but not more than 12 hours) long.

Attestation Programs

In light of the state high court’s decision employers may want to implement an attestation program through which employees can confirm on a regular basis whether they received legally compliant opportunities to take timely and duty-free meal rest and recovery breaks.

During its current term the California Supreme Court is also considering another case addressing the question of whether break premiums should be treated as “wages” that must be accurately recorded on wage statements and are susceptible to waiting time penalties if not paid to departing employees on a timely basis. Now more than ever California employers may want to closely review their meal rest and recovery break policies and practices to help avoid mounting class and PAGA liability exposure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZmlnaHRpbmdpbGxpbmkuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS83LzE4L2Zvb3RiYWxsLWNhcm5leS1rcmFtZXItYW5kLWxvd2UtdG8tYXR0ZW5kLWJpZy10ZW4tbWVkaWEtZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carney Kramer and Lowe to Attend Big Ten Media Day - University of Illinois Athletics,"The annual Big Ten Football Media Days are set to take place this Thursday and Friday July 22 and 23 at Lucas Oil Stadium.

The Fighting Illini represented by head coach Bret Bielema senior outside linebacker Owen Carney  senior center Doug Kramer and senior offensive lineman Vederian Lowe will make their media rounds on Thursday.

Carney was an All-Big Ten second team selection last season by both the coaches and media before coming back for his super senior season in 2021. He was fourth in the Big Ten in sacks (5.0) and 13th in TFLs (7.0) during the abbreviated 2020 season. His 3.0 sacks against Purdue 10/31/20 tied for seventh all-time in a game for an Illini.

Last season Lowe earned All-Big Ten honorable mention recognition from coaches and media.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVsLzE3L2F0LWhvbWUtYXMtaG9nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At home as Hog,"FAYETTEVILLE -- Jermaine Hamilton-Jordan took a break from summer workouts in early June at the University of Arkansas to return home to Kansas City Mo. for his high school graduation.

The freshman defensive back who was an early enrollee at Arkansas in January went through graduation ceremonies with his fellow seniors from Lincoln College Prep at Arrowhead Stadium -- home of the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs.

""It was great to graduate at Arrowhead"" Hamilton-Jordan said. ""One day I hope to be playing on the field there.""

Before Hamilton-Jordan can try to live his NFL dream he has a college career on which to focus.

""It was fun to be home for graduation but I was ready to be back up here to campus"" he said. ""There's just something about being in Fayetteville now that I love. I love the environment. I really love being around all my teammates. I really can't get homesick.

""My mom misses me but she told me when I committed to where I wanted to go to college that's where I should be -- going to class working out. She knows what I'm here to do so she lets me grind.""

Lincoln College Prep Coach William Lowe said that when he saw Hamilton-Jordan at graduation it was easy to tell how much he already has changed his body since coming to Arkansas.

Hamilton-Jordan 6-1 said he's increased his weight from 190 pounds to 205 pounds.

""When Jermaine came back a few weeks ago the first thing we noticed was all the good weight he's put on"" Lowe said. ""Being able to eat at the training table as much as he wants and working out with Arkansas' strength and conditioning staff we knew that would really benefit him.

""That was the plan for him going down to Arkansas a semester early. That's been a really big advantage for Jermaine going from high school football to high level college football with the increased strength and the physicality and the speed of the game.""

Enrolling early at Arkansas also helped accelerate Hamilton-Jordan's transition from playing linebacker -- his position at Lincoln College Prep -- to nickelback for the Razorbacks.

As a senior last season Hamilton-Jordan had 91 tackles including 17 for lost yards in eight games. He had 150 tackles in 12 games his junior season.

""He always played in the box for us as a linebacker just because he was a dynamic high school player"" Lowe said. ""We got him closer to the ball and he could make so many plays for us.

""He played outside linebacker his freshman and sophomore years. People ran away from him so then we put him inside and let him run to the football and have a bigger impact on the game.""

Lowe said the Lincoln College Prep coaches knew Hamilton-Jordan would play defensive back in college so he got some work there in practice during individual drills last season. The high school's defensive backs coach Kareem High played at Kansas.

""Getting Jermaine some work in practice at defensive back that was just something we did to help him out so he'd feel more comfortable when he got to Arkansas"" Lowe said.

Hamilton-Jordan said he appreciated what the Lincoln College Prep coaches did for him but the position switch still was a challenge in the spring.

""It helped because I wasn't just at square one"" he said. ""I had already learned some things so I could continue to advance when I got up here.

""But spring practice was frustrating at first because I struggled with my footwork. Coming from linebacker I wasn't used to backpedaling all day long. When my footwork came along that's when everything started making more sense.""

Hamilton-Jordan said help from Arkansas' experienced defensive backs including Joe Foucha Jalen Catalon and Simeon Blair made the move easier.

""I know I have to work my way up the depth chart but the older guys helped bring me along like Joe Cat Sims"" he said. ""Sims called me every day and he'd come get me and we'd go watch film.""

Hamilton-Jordan said he feels good about his knowledge of the playbook.

""With school I'm very intelligent so the playbook that will always come"" he said. ""That's natural for me. I know those spots where I'm supposed to be. I have the film from spring that showed me things I'm not supposed to do.

""Now I can look at the film and fix some things. I know what the playbook says and I'm getting comfortable with doing it on the field.""

Arkansas defensive coordinator Barry Odom had a lot to do with Hamilton-Jordan's decision to sign with the Razorbacks over other offers that included Kentucky Iowa State Kansas State Kansas Washington State and Tulsa.

Before joining Coach Sam Pittman's staff at Arkansas in 2020 Odom was the head coach at Missouri.

""As an eighth-grade kid I watched Coach Odom at Mizzou"" Hamilton-Jordan said. ""I went on visits to Mizzou my freshman sophomore and junior years. I just wanted to be coached by Coach Odom.""

Hamilton-Jordan said his interest in Missouri waned after Odom was fired.

""My phone wasn't working one day and I was at the store getting it fixed"" Hamilton-Jordan said. ""My high school coach had called my mom and he said Coach Odom had just called and he's at Arkansas and he'd like to give you an offer.

""I said 'Mom I'm going to Arkansas.' ""

Hamilton-Jordan hopes to help the Razorbacks turn around their program the way he helped Lincoln College Prep which went from 3-7 his freshman season to 6-4 11-1 and 7-3 his last three seasons.

""We just kept getting better and getting more kids into the program"" Lowe said. ""Jermaine was the face of that.

""Now Lincoln Prep in Kansas City it's known for being a football school. Where shoot four years ago going into Jermaine's freshman year it probably would have been the opposite.

""Jermaine just has a knack for getting to the football. He plays at a different speed than everybody else. If you lined him up in a footrace Jermaine probably wouldn't win. But if you put people on the field and give somebody the ball Jermaine will beat the other guys to him.""

The Razorbacks were 3-7 playing a 10-game SEC schedule last season after being 1-24 in conference play from 2017-19.

""That was another reason I wanted to play here because I know about helping build a winning program"" Hamilton-Jordan said. ""I know you need that bonding. You've got to love your brother.

""If you love the person to the left of you and to the right of you there's really no stopping your team because you'll put it all on the line for each other.""

Hamilton-Jordan said he likes the feeling of being around his new teammates.

""The team vibe is serious"" he said. ""The guys told me coming in 'Those three wins last year might have looked good but at the end of the day that's not the standard for Coach Pittman.'

""As a team we're focused. We're strong. We know what work we have to do. We've got to go through the hard work now so that in the fall it will show.""

Lincoln College Prep's 11 victories in 2019 have resulted in a documentary in the works on the season.

A film crew followed around some of the players last season including Hamilton-Jordan. He said he expects the documentary to air in August.

""It's like a 'Last Chance U' type of deal but for high school"" said Hamilton-Jordan referring to a Netflix series focused on junior-college football. ""The story line will be about the challenges we faced coming from 3-7 our freshman year to turning it around with an 11-1 record our junior year.

""I think it will be pretty good and I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out. With things happening now in college with NIL [name image and likeness] hopefully I can use this documentary as a platform.""

Seemingly taking a page out of About Last Night and St. Elmo's Fire co-star Demi Moore's playbook — the actress photographed herself in a black bikini during her recent Grecian getaway — actor Rob Lowe 57 posted a shirtless selfie to mark his own beach

Posing against a postcard-perfect backdrop of palm trees and crystal-blue water the 9-1-1: Lone Star actor bared his chest and shoulders for the smoldering shoot which shows him sporting some graying stubble. Also on display: The Brat Packer's upper arm tattoo a relic from his partying days that Lowe has previously described as ""horrible.""

“I don’t know what it is anymore” Lowe who has been sober for more than 30 years told Ellen DeGeneres back in 2014. “It once was a koi fish. A traditional Japanese koi fish and a swirl of water and now it’s a wonderful blob. Like my mind.”

While his caption notified fans that he'd be going ""off the grid Gilligan's Island-style"" Lowe's sons couldn't resist ribbing their dad for squeezing in one last thirst trap. Both sons are known for mocking their famous father online.

""Off the grid yet posting shirtless selfies on Instagram?"" teased John Lowe while son Matthew observed ""A 3-hour tour doesn’t really qualify as off the grid.""

Other commenters were much more impressed however.

""Well aren’t you aging gracefully"" read one comment while a fan hailed him as the ""hottest man on the planet — then and now.""

""How are you so hot?"" another fan posted.

""Still smokin'"" added another admirer.

What's his secret? According to a 2018 interview with Today Lowe credited going sober maintaining an active lifestyle and eating well.

""Don’t get me wrong; I still love pasta and pizzas"" he said. ""But I know that they’re a special treat. In my business I don’t have the option to not be at my best. So I just make healthy choices most of the time. I never diet.”

He added that wife Sheryl Berkoff — with whom he'll celebrate 30 years of marriage this week — is “the worst sandbagger ever.""

Lowe cracked ""She’ll say things like ‘I like a little meat on my man!’ That’s not the kind of support I’m looking for! Her big motto is just a bite. That’s a one-way trip to Palookaville. Do you think Gisele is telling Tom Brady just a bite? I think she’s not.”

GALENA PARK Texas (KTRK) -- If you're thinking the air has taken an unusual turn in the Galena Park area you're not alone and you're not wrong.

Harris County Pollution Control Services confirmed to ABC13 that they've received numerous resident complaints and they're looking into it. At least one woman in the area described the smell as a combination of garlic and bug spray.

Just after 9:30 a.m. Friday a message posted to CAER (Community Awareness Emergency Response) announced the source of the smell as the LyondellBasell Houston Refinery at 12000 Lawndale. Plant officials said they're working to address the odor and sought to clear the air on any potential health impact.

""While unpleasant the odor does not pose any harm to our workers or community and there is no need for nearby community members to be concerned or take any action"" the statement read. ""We regret any concern this odor may have caused.""

Galena Park's mayor posted the update to Facebook as well.

On Friday afternoon the LyondellBasell Houston Refinery issued the following statement:

""At approximately 5 p.m. on Wednesday July 14 2021 our Houston Refinery located at 12000 Lawndale experienced a leak onto the roof of one of the storage tanks due to the heavy rain events in the area. This did not immediately result in an odor but during our cleanup efforts yesterday July 15th an odor became present.



The plant's incident response team is working to eliminate the odor as quickly as possible.



We understand that the material is odorous and community members may be able to detect a slight odor. Air monitoring demonstrated no levels of concern for the community.



There were no injuries. We reported the situation to the appropriate state and federal agencies and are still investigating the cause of the leak. We apologize for any concern this may have caused.



As always the health and safety of our people and the community are our highest priorities.""

Harris County Pollution Control Services also issued a statement:

""PCS has identified chemicals of interest-carbon disulfide dimethyl disulfide methyl ethyl disulfide. Residents may experience irritation of the respiratory system and digestive system. Cause of odor has been capped and smell should dissipate by later this evening. Sensitive populations should limit outdoor time and use face coverings.""

The odor lingered in the area Saturday according to residents who spoke with ABC13.

Company representatives said in a statement that progress was being made to get rid of the smell but weather conditions and ongoing work may cause more periods of the unpleasant odor.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBkAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire bully Katherine Asplundh's new in-laws have $95M history of exploiting undocumented workers: ruling,"Pennsylvania’s billionaire Asplundh family were dragged into a bullying scandal after their son’s new wife tried to force another woman to give up her Instagram handle and now it has emerged they were once fined $95 million for hiring undocumented workers.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

5 The two Katherines went back and forth on Instagram. Instagram

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue."

This is the conviction of Mike Tansey managing director for travel and growth markets in Accenture a Fortune Global 500 professional services company.

With two decades of management consulting experience including 15 years specialising in the travel industry Singapore-based Tansey has his finger on the pulse. He leads Accenture’s travel industry team across multiple markets and has worked with organisations such as Singapore Airlines InterContinental Hotels Group Cathay Pacific Marriott International and Qantas. So Tansey understands the challenges companies face in transforming online and offline customer experiences.

“What Covid-19 has done is reset everybody’s market share effectively to zero. Before the smaller independent chains might have found it hard to compete against the big guys. Now suddenly all of us are back at the starting line. We’re talking to several hotel clients on how they can take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grab market share because loads of people will want to travel.”

(Related: What will hospitality and design look like after the pandemic? Florian Sander has answers)

The traditional approach is to spend millions on mass media campaigns. However brands now recognise that this is ineffective and unaffordable says Tansey and are trying different approaches. He gives the example of Banyan Tree. With the hotel group Tansey helps them to identify unique guest behaviour and profiles filtered by property and source markets.

This approach is not new but it was not popular until the pandemic. Tansey cites another example: Thai Smile Airways. The airline appointed Accenture before Covid as it wanted to tap on its data analytics expertise. It worked. Despite the pandemic the company gained domestic market share rising from 9.23 per cent in 2019 to 11.5 per cent in 2020.

He says: “It’s difficult for people to understand that the critical difference is the really detailed data analytics that goes behind it. Most people would think that 10 or even 30 data fields are sufficient.” Accenture captures data in 170 fields.

“For example we create a customer analytic record for every person who has stayed in a particular hotel for the last five years. We apply trend analysis against the data collected to identify specific behaviours of those guests. Then we use that information to create digital marketing campaigns most of which is done through social media such as Facebook where the content you see changes dynamically (depending on your profile). This precise targeting is what will drive an ‘unfair’ share of the market.”

Another gap that hospitality players need to plug is customer service infrastructure. It needs to be robust enough to handle the massive volume of upcoming itinerary changes.

Tansey recalls being frustrated recently at being put on hold for two hours before he could speak to a representative of “a major airline” on refunding a cancelled ticket.

“Online travel agents found it particularly difficult at the beginning of Covid-19 because they set up the business model to be from light to no touch. If I suddenly need to cancel my flights and everyone’s doing the same they just don’t have the infrastructure to cope with that volume of calls. That’s going to continue because there’s still going to be volatility in the travel business in the next year Tansey warns.

“We can solve a lot of these digitally. But the problem is that the businesses particularly the smaller ones don’t have the money to do it. However as revenues pick up they will invest in those types of technologies to future-proof themselves.”

In the meantime staying ready for change and being constantly aware of what’s happening around the world is vital. Tansey says: “We will not go from where we are now to everything being back to normal. There’s going to be a period of transition. We need to remain adaptable and adjust quickly to changes both in this region and our source markets.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVyaW5kaWEuY29tL29wZXJhdGlvbnMvMTYwMTEtdmlrYWxwLXJhai1hcHBvaW50ZWQtYXMtZGlyZWN0b3Itb2Ytc2FsZXMtYW5kLW1hcmtldGluZy1hdC10aGUtc3QtcmVnaXMtbXVtYmFp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vikalp Raj appointed as Director of Sales and Marketing at The St Regis Mumbai,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hotelierindia.com/operations/16011-vikalp-raj-appointed-as-director-of-sales-and-marketing-at-the-st-regis-mumbai on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVyaW5kaWEuY29tL29wZXJhdGlvbnMvMTYwMTEtdmlrYWxwLXJhai1hcHBvaW50ZWQtYXMtZGlyZWN0b3Itb2Ytc2FsZXMtYW5kLW1hcmtldGluZy1hdC10aGUtc3QtcmVnaXMtbXVtYmFp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbmV3c21lLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N1bW8tc3VzaGktYmVudG8tbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LTIwMjEtbWVuddIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sumo Sushi & Bento launches new 2021 menu,"Sumo Sushi & Bento has launched a variety of new flavours in a brand-new menu offering.

One in four employees plan to leave their place of employment as the pandemic winds down according to multiple surveys.

What's behind this change and what can employers do to attract and keep qualified workers?

The ""long tail"" of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused many employees to re-evaluate their overall life trajectories including their work lives. The daily commute to a 9-to-5 job isn't worth it anymore for a lot of employees. Some 42% of current remote workers say that without long-term remote work options they will look for another job according to a Prudential survey of U.S. workers. And more than ever several surveys report that workers say flexibility and life/work balance is more important to them than compensation and benefits.

To further complicate the landscape boomers are retiring earlier than expected. In fact boomers retired at twice the rate from 2019 to 2020 according to the Pew Research Center. Many have experienced the freedom and satisfaction of working remotely and the re-evaluations of their lives have demonstrated that leaving the workforce is a possibility or at the very least going part-time or signing on in a consulting role.

This exodus presents formidable challenges. Companies are forced to actively recruit most often competing against a wealth of options for each employee. Each of those new employees must be onboarded and trained costing the company time and money. Finally the crucial knowledge accumulated by boomers and even Gen Xers is lost unless the company finds a way to capture catalog and disperse it. The Work Institute's 2020 Retention Report estimates the cost of all this turnover for companies across the U.S. at $630 billion. That works out to approximately $15000 per employee.

Millennials have often been misrepresented as entitled demanding employees — more so than previous generations. Truth is they are often exceptionally hard workers who have little problem being at the workplace. They crave the social aspect as well as the structure it often imposes. However these younger workers also desire flexibility. They want to feel that they are supported and encouraged by their employer. And they want to work for a company to not only make money but also to make a difference in regard to social issues and climate change.

A Bersin & Associates research report calculated that it costs four to six times less to ""build"" a strong employee than to ""buy"" one. So creating a more employee-centric culture can help your organization thrive. Retaining employees and attracting new ones require that you focus on two areas of your business: the physical workplace and your culture.

Physical: Zoom fatigue is real and there will be enough employees who will choose to return to the workplace. How much flexibility can you accommodate? Will you need to create workstations that employees can use temporarily whenever they come to the office rather than offices earmarked for specific employees?

Cultural: Creating a culture that gives employees support and encouragement to thrive is essential to retaining and attracting talent whether your employees are on the factory floor in an office or working remotely from home. What you do to hone your culture can also affect your ability to bring remote workers together as well as how you configure a physical workspace. At the same time how can you foster a great culture that accommodates a combination of both in-person and virtual employees?

It comes down to defining what is truly important to your employees. What do potential hires need in order to see you as a place they want to work and stay? Can you structure your business to accommodate the needs of a partially remote workforce and the varying requirements of new employees particularly millennials and Gen Z? Listen carefully to what they need. And make sure your employees know that you're actively listening.

This year and 2022 could be volatile years. Whether your employees are working on the front lines or remotely the nature of work and what the workplace needs to be is shifting —and it's an ongoing challenge. You don't want to get left behind and miss huge opportunities to make changes that will position your company for a stronger future. Leaders need to take stock and reflect on what works and what does not. Relying solely on ""old ways"" may have been what built your business but they could prove to be one of your greatest liabilities in a post-pandemic culture.

We believe the workplace is a place to inspire collaboration not where we inspect work or productivity. We want employees to want to be in the office and not to feel like it's a punishment. Building a strong culture can seem entirely too daunting. Doing it right is worth every effort. And if our society has learned one thing over the past year a one-size-fits-all solution fits no one.

The story so far: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday banned Mastercard from issuing new debit and credit cards to customers in India with effect from July 22. According to the RBI the U.S. card-issuer has failed to comply with the local data storage rules announced by the central bank in 2018. The ban has unsettled banks operating in India that use Mastercard’s services to issue a variety of cards to their customers.

What is the RBI’s data localisation policy?

In 2018 the Indian central bank had issued a circular ordering card companies such as Visa Mastercard and American Express to store all Indian customer data locally so that the regulator could have “unfettered supervisory access”. This meant that foreign card companies had to store complete information about transactions made by Indian customers in servers located within India. Companies were initially required to comply with these rules within six months. The reason offered by the RBI to back up its data localisation rule was that local storage of consumer data is necessary to protect the privacy of Indian users and also to address national security concerns. Since the order Mastercard Visa and other foreign card companies have lobbied to dilute the rules . But the RBI has remained strict that companies must comply with its data localisation rules. Consequently Mastercard deleted Indian customer data from its foreign servers and promised to invest in building local servers in India to store local customer data. The RBI however has not been impressed. It has banned Mastercard from issuing new cards to customers from July 22. Reuters reported Mastercard as having said it was “disappointed” with the RBI’s decision and it had provided regular updates on its compliance with the rules since 2018. The company was quoted as saying it would continue to work with the Indian central bank to provide any additional details required to resolve its concerns.

Existing Mastercard customers however can continue to use their cards. Earlier this year American Express and Diners Club International were also banned by the RBI from issuing new cards after they failed to comply with the 2018 circular.

What is the need for local data storage?

Experts believe that customer privacy and national security are genuine concerns that need to be taken seriously. However many also believe that data localisation rules are too stringent and they could simply be used by governments as tools of economic protectionism. For instance they argue it may not be strictly necessary for data to be stored locally to remain protected. Broadly speaking formal international laws to govern the storage of digital information across borders may be sufficient to deal with these concerns. Governments however may still mandate data localisation in order to favour local companies to foreign ones.

China for example has used its cyber-security laws to discriminate against foreign companies. A similar trend may be playing out in India with the Centre’s emphasis on economic self-sufficiency. In 2018 Mastercard had launched a complaint with the U.S. government that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was actively promoting Indian cards like RuPay and that it was affecting the business of foreign card companies. Governments may also believe that mandating foreign companies to set up local infrastructure can boost their local economies.

What lies ahead?

Indian banks that are currently enrolled in the Mastercard network are expected to make alternative arrangements with other card companies. The process is expected to take a few months and their card business is expected to take a significant hit meanwhile. The RBI’s data localisation policy as it burdens foreign card companies may end up favouring domestic card issuers like RuPay. Mastercard owns about one-third of the market share in India and the RBI’s ban is likely to significantly benefit its competitors. RBL Bank for instance has decided to enter into an agreement with Visa after the RBI’s ban on Mastercard. Similarly the ban on American Express and Diners Club earlier this year benefited the Indian card network RuPay. Some believe that even Visa a foreign company which dominates card payments in India may come under regulatory pressure in the near future. Thus the card payments sector may end up being restricted to a few domestic companies which in turn can lead to reduced competition. This could mean higher costs and lower quality services for customers.

It is also worth noting that in today’s digital economy data have turned out to be a valuable commodity which companies as well as governments have tried to gain control over. Information about spending patterns and other customer data can be monetised by companies in a variety of ways. With no clear rules on who owns customer data and to what extent conflicts over data ownership are likely to continue for some time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1iYW4tdG8taGl0LXNiaS15ZXMtYmFuay01LW90aGVycy13aGF0LWhhcHBlbnMtdG8teW91ci1kZWJpdC1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC0zOTczNTQxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MasterCard Ban to Hit SBI Yes Bank 5 Others. Will Your Debit Credit Card be Blocked?,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had said in a statement that a ban on Mastercard would be imposed effective from June 22. The reason behind the ban of this card was cited as non-compliance with local data storage guidelines. This big impact is going to be felt by at least five private banks as well as non-bank lenders and the card-issuing company itself. The banks that will be the most affected by this change are the RBL Bank YES Bank and Bajaj Finserv according to a Nomura Research report. All the credit-card schemes that these lenders offer come under the Mastercard.

A little further down the spectrum Induslnd Bank ICICI Banks and Axis Bank will be the second most affected as they have around 35 to 40 per cent of their credit card schemes tied to the banned card according to the report. The exception to this category is HDFC Bank. Even though this lender has around 45 per cent of its credit card schemes under Mastercard it will not feel the impact as much since it is already restricted as a bank from issuing new cards. Another major bank the State Bank of India (SBI) will also have to deal with the fallout though minimal. The bank only has around 10 per cent of its schemes coming under the Mastercard ambit as per the report.

Another issue that surfaces in light of this ban is the co-branding issue. Co-branded credit cards that are associated with Mastercard will have to be stopped. Banks such as SBI Axis Bank and RBL Bank which all have co-branded credit cards will have to undertake a massive revamp of their card branding.

What Are the Implications for Your Debit and Credit Card?

This change will by no means affect existing cardholders of Mastercard. Customers who are using Mastercard in debit or credit form need not worry. RBI has made it clear that this change will not affect existing cardholders and only applies to banks and customers going forward. All the services that you had been using can be continued on the Mastercard. Though it is banned in the above-mentioned institutions as a payment system the card is allowed to function within the country under the ‘Payment and Settlement Act System Act 2019’.

Having said that the RBI has prohibited the issuing of debit cards credit cards and even pre-paid cards by banks to new customers going forward. This order comes into effect from July 22.

This is not the first time that something like this has occurred. Previously RBI had barred American Express Banking Corp. and Diners Club from onboarding any more new customers onto their platform from May 1. The reason behind this was cited as something similar to the reasoning behind Mastercard’s ban. RBI claimed that the entities were non-compliant with the directives and guidelines given on the storage of payment systems data. These stringent measures by RBI come in light of the 2018 mandate wherein the banking entity made it clear that all service providers must store and process data related to their respective payment systems that are only in India.

Here’s what it means for customers and the payment system in India:

Why have these companies been barred from enrolling new customers?

On July 14 the RBI imposed restrictions on Mastercard Asia Pacific Pte Ltd from onboarding new domestic customers (debit credit or prepaid) in India from July 22 citing non-compliance with guidelines for storage of data in India. The RBI said it had given almost three years for Mastercard to comply with the regulatory directions but it was unable to complete the process.

In April this year the RBI had imposed restrictions on American Express Banking Corp and Diners Club International Ltd from enrolling new domestic customers onto their card networks from May 1 2021 also citing non-compliance of storage of data.

Will existing card users and banks be affected?

No. Existing customers using a credit card or a debit card with Mastercard American Express or Diners Club as the payment network can continue using these. Banks and non-banking finance companies that were planning to use these payment networks won’t be able to use these platforms to enrol new customers until the RBI lifts the ban.

“This leaves only Visa Inc and homegrown NPCI’s RuPay as payment providers under no restrictions currently. We don’t know if Visa has fulfilled all the requirements of data localisation as envisaged in the Storage of Payment System Data circular of the RBI. In the near term we don’t foresee any material impact on card issuers (especially credit card issuers) but there could be a medium-term impact if this situation persists” banking group Nomura said in a report. Banks that were planning for new customers through Mastercard will have to look at Visa for enrolment.

Yes Bank RBL Bank and Bajaj Finserv are likely to be most impacted as their entire card schemes are allied with Mastercard Nomura said. Around 60% of HDFC Bank’s card schemes are tied to Mastercard Diners and AmEx. For ICICI Bank and Axis Bank 35-36% are linked to Mastercard. The card portfolio of Kotak Mahindra Bank is allied with Visa.

What do the RBI guidelines stipulate?

By the RBI circular on Storage of Payment System Data dated April 6 2018 all system providers were directed to ensure that within six months the entire data (full end-to-end transaction details information collected or carried or processed as part of the message or payment instruction) relating to payment systems operated by them is stored in a system only in India. They were also required to report compliance to the RBI and submit a board-approved system audit report conducted by a CERT-In empanelled auditor within the timelines specified. However credit and card firms with global operations have been resisting the move citing costs security risk lack of clarity timeline and the possibility of data localisation demand from other countries.

According to Kazim Rizvi Founding Director of think-tank The Dialogue the RBI’s decision to restrict entities from onboarding new customers is a crucial development in their endeavour to ensure that all payment system operators store or localise their end-to-end transaction data only in India. “The motivation behind such a move is to carry out effective law enforcement requirements as data access for law enforcement purposes has been a challenge” Rizvi said.

Why have these firms not complied?

The RBI had stipulated that data should be stored only in India and no copy — or mirroring — should be stored in other countries. Payment firms like Visa and Mastercard which currently store and process Indian transactions outside the country have said their systems are centralised and expressed the fear that transferring the data storage to India will cost them millions of dollars. Besides once it happens in India there could be similar demands from other countries upsetting their plans.

What has upset foreign players is that domestic payment companies including e-commerce firms which are storing the data within India were putting pressure for data storage within the country. While the Finance Ministry had suggested some easing of norms in transferring the data the RBI has refused to budge stating that the payment systems need closer monitoring in the wake of the rising use of digital transactions. It’s not clear if Visa has obliged the RBI and transferred data storage to India.

Is there a way out?

Experts agree that it is necessary for all entities to comply with the RBI’s localisation mandate. “At the same time however it’s true that hard localisation may impact India’s payments ecosystem” Rizvi said.

“To have a more effective mechanism for law enforcement we need to move beyond MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty) which is slow and ineffective to a system based on bilateral treaties on data transfers with the EU UK and the US. Here the idea must be to ensure that Indian law enforcement requirements of access to data are met in a timely manner while at the same time allowing data flows to foster innovation and trade in the tech ecosystem” Rizvi said. However the RBI is against the suggestion that a copy of data stored outside be brought to India.

What’s the role of card networks?

Firms such as Mastercard Visa and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) are Payment System Operators authorised to operate a card network in India under the Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) Act 2007. Under the Act the RBI is the authority for the regulation and supervision of payment systems in India. The RBI’s payment system enables payments to be effected between a payer and a beneficiary and involves the process of clearing payment or settlement or all of them.

Funds transferred using debit or credit cards are routed through platforms such as Mastercard Visa and NPCI. The RBI has decided to allow non-bank entities — Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers card networks White Label ATM (WLA) operators Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms – to become members of the centralised payment system (CPS) and effect fund transfer through RTGS and NEFT.

How big is India’s card business?

According to RBI data there were 90.23 crore debit cards and 6.23 crore credit cards in India as of May 2021. There were 57841.30 lakh debit and credit card transactions valued at Rs 12.93 lakh crore during 2020-21. Of these debit card transactions accounted for a volume of 40200.24 lakh valued at Rs 6.62 lakh crore.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvcmJpLXMtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1iYW4tdG8taGl0LWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWdyb3d0aC1mdXJ0aGVyLTEwMTAyNzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RBI's Mastercard ban to hit credit card growth further,HDFC Bank – the largest credit card issuer in the Indian market – was banned by the RBI in December 2020 from issuing new cards following repeated instances of outages in the bank’s internet and mobile banking platforms. The largest private sector lender which had a card base of 15.38 million in November saw its card base declining to 14.85 million in May. HDFC Bank was adding around 2 lakh cards every month before the ban. As a result of the ban on HDFC Bank the overall growth of credit cards in the system also suffered. In recent media interactions HDFC Bank officials said the lender has upgraded its systems and has submitted a plan to the regulator for the future without giving any indications on when the restrictions could be lifted.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2Nyb2xsLmluL2FydGljbGUvMTAwMDM1OS9yYmlzLWJhbi1vbi1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWNvdWxkLWJlLWEtd2luLWZvci1pbmRpYW4tZ292ZXJubWVudHMtb3duLXBheW1lbnQtc3lzdGVtc9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjcm9sbC5pbi9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMDAzNTkvcmJpcy1iYW4tb24tbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1iZS1hLXdpbi1mb3ItaW5kaWFuLWdvdmVybm1lbnRzLW93bi1wYXltZW50LXN5c3RlbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RBI’s ban on Mastercard could be a win for Indian government’s own payment systems,"India’s decision to ban Mastercard from issuing new debit and credit cards in the country could be a win for the government’s own payment systems – and that is not all good news.

On July 14 the Reserve Bank of India said United States-based Mastercard had not complied with data storage rules from 2018 that require foreign card networks to store Indian payments data within the country so the regulator can have “unfettered supervisory access”. The ban on Mastercard will come into effect on July 22. The RBI’s move will not impact existing customers of Mastercard.

Most banks in India provide four types of debit and credit cards: Visa Mastercard Maestro (a part of the Mastercard enterprise) and RuPay. Of these only RuPay is Indian and until its launch in 2012 the sector was dominated by foreign players.

With one of these four out of the picture for now experts believe RuPay could be the one player to see exceptional gains. This is particularly because of the Narendra Modi government’s tough stance against foreign card companies in recent years.

“The dependence on foreign brands will be consciously reduced as the government seems focussed on making homegrown one successful” said Mumbai-based independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga. “This probably a nudge for the banks to seriously consider the homegrown names.”

Mastercard RuPay and UPI

The ban on Mastercard the world’s second-largest payments processor comes after India’s central bank in May barred American Express and Diners Club International from issuing new cards due to similar violations.

Customers of these two networks had flocked to RuPay which is owned by RBI’s National Payments Corporation of India and was already a dominant player with a market share of around 60% in November 2020. Experts believe a similar trend will follow Mastercard’s ban. Mastercard currently accounts for nearly 33% of all card payments in India.

“Data localisation is a major issue on a global level…With Mastercard getting banned major channels will be Visa and RuPay. Most of the banks will be partnering with more than one payment company now” said Asutosh Mishra head of research for institutional equity at Ashika Stock Broking. “A lot of PSU banks are already offering RuPay cards.”

The other beneficiary of the ban would be the Unified Payment Interface a partly state-owned digital payment system. UPI payments which are done from one bank account to another without adding a beneficiary can be a replacement for cards. The UPI payment process is easier faster and more secure which makes it a contender to replace card payments. In addition there are no transaction charges on UPI payments unlike credit cards.

The two Indian platforms may be in for great times ahead because experts warn that even Visa could see a ban like the one that American Express Diners Club International and Mastercard are facing. This trend though could be a dangerous one.

RuPay in Modi’s India

While the government-owned platforms gain more business customers have much to lose from the bans on international card networks as it will leave Indians with limited options. In addition global companies could see this as an obstruction to free trade making them wary of protectionism in India.

The Modi government has been blamed for using nationalistic sentiment to promote RuPay in the past.

In 2014 when Modi launched his flagship financial inclusion campaign Jan Dhan Yojana the beneficiaries were offered a basic bank account along with a free RuPay debit card. Foreign payment companies such as Mastercard and Visa were left out of this project.

In 2018 Modi had appealed to Indians to serve the nation by using Rupay debit and credit cards instead of foreign card networks.

Mastercard had reportedly raised this issue with the Office of the US Trade Representative in 2018 and said that Modi “associated the use of RuPay cards with nationalism claiming it serves as ‘kind of national service’”.

Mastercard’s return

Baliga believes that Mastercard will leave no stone unturned to keep its customer base intact in India even if it means conforming to the stipulated requirements by the RBI. In 2019 Mastercard had announced a $1 billion (Rs 7452 lakh crores) investment in the country over five years following its earlier investment of the same amount in 2014.

We are “fully committed to our legal and regulatory obligations in the markets we operate in” the company said in a statement after the RBI ban. “While we are disappointed with the stance taken by the RBI in their communication dated July 14 we will continue to work with them to provide any additional details required to resolve their concerns.”

Meanwhile banks with an exclusive tie-up with Mastercard are already looking to partner with other payment networks to issue new cards. RBL Bank Bajaj Finserv and Yes Bank were the most affected lenders because of the ban. On July 15 RBL Bank entered into an agreement with Visa Worldwide for issuing credit cards.

Bumble (BMBL 11.49%) and Match Group (MTCH 2.55%) have a complicated and acrimonious relationship. Bumble's founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd previously co-founded Match's flagship dating app Tinder with Sean Rad Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen.

But Tinder then stripped Wolfe Herd of her co-founder title. In response she filed a sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against Tinder which was settled for over $1 million.

In 2014 Wolfe Herd partnered with Andrey Andreev the Russian founder of a dating app called Badoo to launch Bumble as a female-first dating app. However Tinder sued Bumble in 2018 claiming that Wolfe Herd stole trade secrets and violated its patents and Bumble counter-sued. That war finally ended last June with both companies settling all their litigation for undisclosed terms.

When Bumble went public this February many investors wondered if it could become as big as Match -- which owns significantly more dating apps than Bumble. However the market's enthusiasm for Bumble waned after its public debut and the stock slipped below its IPO price of $43 per share in May.

But could Bumble still be a great growth stock for the next decade? Let's examine its future plans to see if it can match -- or even surpass -- Match Group's valuation by 2030.

Bumble has been growing faster than Match

Bumble's revenue rose 36% to $488.9 million in 2019 then grew 19% to $582.2 million in 2020. Bumble experienced slower growth in paid users throughout the pandemic but it expects its revenue to grow 24%-26% in 2021 as the crisis ends and more people start dating again.

Match's revenue rose 19% to $2.1 billion in 2019 and grew 17% to $2.4 billion in 2020 and analysts expect its revenue to increase 22% this year.

Bumble and Match trade at 12 times and 15 times this year's sales respectively. Bumble's bulls will likely argue that it should trade at a higher price-to-sales ratio than Match because it's growing faster.

But Bumble is also a lot smaller than Match

However the bears will argue that Bumble needs to generate much stronger growth to justify a higher valuation since it's a much smaller company.

Bumble's total paying users (on both Bumble and Badoo) rose 22% to 2.5 million in 2020 and grew 30% year-over-year to 2.8 million in the first quarter of 2021. Bumble hosted 1.35 million of those users while Badoo served the remaining 1.45 million users. Bumble generates most of its revenue from its namesake app which generates more than twice as much average revenue per user as Badoo.

Match's paid subscribers (across all its apps) rose 12% to 10.9 million in 2020 then grew 12% year-over-year to 11.1 million in the first quarter of 2021.

But what about the next 10 years?

The global online dating market could grow at a CAGR of 8.3% between 2019 and 2025 according to Allied Market Research. However both Bumble and Match are likely growing faster than the broader market.

If Bumble grows its annual revenue at an average rate of 25% over the next five years then maintains an average growth rate of 20% over the following five years it could generate $4.4 billion in revenue by 2030. That growth trajectory which would equal a CAGR of 22.5% could be tough to achieve -- but Bumble still has plenty of irons in the fire.

The company could add more female-friendly features to Bumble launch additional premium tiers and monetize Bumble BFF which is designed for platonic friendships and Bumble Bizz which hosts professional connections. That expansion beyond basic dating could turn it into a social network.

Bumble also launched voice and video calls two years ago and it could further expand that platform to chase Zoom (ZM -0.16%) into the growing video conferencing market. Tinder only rolled out video calls a year ago. Like Match Bumble could also eventually acquire other smaller dating apps to reach different demographics and overseas markets.

If Bumble generates $4.4 billion in revenue by 2030 and its stock still trades at 12 times sales it could be worth about $50 billion. But it will still likely remain much smaller than Match for a simple reason.

Even if Match grows half as quickly as Bumble with a CAGR of 11.25% between 2020 and 2030 it would still generate nearly $7 billion in revenue by the final year. Assuming Match also trades at 12 times sales it would be worth $84 billion. If it grows just a little bit faster it could easily be worth $100 billion.

Look beyond the market cap comparisons

Simply put Bumble is highly unlikely to be worth more than Match in ten years even if it continues to grow at a much faster rate. But Bumble doesn't need to eclipse Match to be a good investment.

Its past growth suggests there's healthy demand for dating apps that let women make the first move and those foundations could enable it to build other female-empowering social networking services in the future. Therefore it could still be a promising growth stock to own for the next decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjEvMDcvMjAyMS1jb25jYWNhZi1nb2xkLWN1cC11c21udC0xLWNhbmFkYS0wLW1hdGNoLXJlcG9ydC1zdGF0cy1hbmQtZ3JvdXAtc3RhbmRpbmdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Concacaf Gold Cup: USA 1 - Canada 0 | Match Report Stats & Group Standings,"KANSAS CITY Kansas (July 18 2021) – Shaq Moore scored his first career international goal just 20 seconds into the match to lead the U.S. Men’s National Team to a 1-0 victory against Canada and secure the top spot in Group B of the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup.

With the victory the USMNT continued their perfect record in group play and set up a quarterfinal clash with Jamaica or Costa Rica on Sunday July 25 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington Texas.

With the victory the USMNT continued their perfect record in group play and set up a quarterfinal clash with Jamaica or Costa Rica on Sunday July 25 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington Texas.







With four changes to the starting lineup that faced Martinique on Thursday the U.S. came out on the offensive and tallied the fastest goal ever scored by a USMNT player in the modern era (1990-present) and the fastest in Gold Cup history.

The quick tally was set up after a loose ball was collected in midfield and played out wide to Sebastian Lletget who was darting up the left side. Lletget hit a low one-time cross through the box where Moore was able to bury it home after beating his man to the back post.

The goal was the Tenerife-based player’s first goal for the U.S. National Team in his eighth cap and sent the capacity crowd of 18467 at Children’s Mercy Park into wild celebrations.

The party atmosphere subsided shortly after when the U.S. found themselves without their captain Walker Zimmerman after he suffered an injury in the 9th minute. Zimmerman went down while attempting to keep Canada’s Richie Laryea from breaking in clean on goal on the right side of the penalty area.

The U.S. kept control of proceedings for most of the first half but it was Canada that almost earned a quick strike at the start of the second half but U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner was up to the task. A poor back pass was pounced on by Cyle Larin and the Canadian striker hit his attempt on goal but Turner dove low to his right for his first save of the evening.

The Canadians who finish second in the group despite the loss and also move on to the quarterfinal round were in the ascendancy for much of the second half but failed to find the goal they needed to win their eighth game in succession. The U.S. who needed a victory to secure the group had some nervy moments to contend with near the end when Daryl Dike and James Sands both had to battle through knocks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9hcnRpY2xlMjUyODQ1ODYzLmh0bWzSATdodHRwczovL2FtcC5rYW5zYXNjaXR5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYXJ0aWNsZTI1Mjg0NTg2My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Soccer on the rise in Canada as national team meets USMNT in Gold Cup match Sunday,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kansascity.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Yet team officials hope—no expect—to set an MLS attendance record for its opening match next March.

“Our expectation is crystal-clear” Charlotte FC President Nick Kelly tells me by phone in May. “We want to be 74000-plus. We can do that at Bank of America Stadium. We think if we can create a first game with 74000-plus Charlotte and Carolina soccer fans that’ll set the precedent of what to expect for the remainder of the year.”

Bank of America seats 75000 for Carolina Panthers games. While it’ll typically be configured to seat 38000 in the lower bowl for soccer and the team expects most games to draw about 30000 fans Charlotte FC aims to fill the upper deck for “first kick” in 2022. So much for tempering expectations in financially tenuous times. “Given the capacity of Bank of America Stadium the demand we’ve seen since our club’s announcement and the chance to be a part of the first MLS match ever for Charlotte FC leads us to believe this is an attainable target” Kelly says. “A lofty one but attainable.”

The FC draws much of its confidence from the success of its future rival to the southwest Atlanta United which owns the attendance record Charlotte FC is trying to break: 73019 for a 2018 playoff game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The United has maintained one of MLS’ most ardent fan bases since its debut season in 2017. The United made the playoffs that year and won the MLS Cup in 2018 and the team is considered the gold standard for MLS expansion success. Charlotte shares not just a rivalry but a similar Southern sensibility a booming young professional class and a growing international influence. “If we’re not looking at them” Kelly says “we’re not setting the right standard.”

But Charlotte FC entered the league under circumstances Atlanta United didn’t face. Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper paid a record expansion fee of $325 million to secure the 30th MLS franchise announced in December 2019. A few months later came the COVID lockdown a burden for all pro sports franchises but especially onerous for one just getting started. “We got stuck with one of the hardest challenges probably in professional sports” Kelly says.

Of course COVID and economic hardship landed heavily on Charlotte FC’s potential fans too—which caused concern and anger when they heard how much it might cost to attend the games.

***

The club hired Kelly nationally known for his sports marketing work for Anheuser-Busch in December 2020. Two months later Charlotte FC announced it would require season ticket holders to buy personal seat licenses or PSLs in addition to some of the highest season ticket prices in MLS. The PSL a one-time fee that ranges from $350-$900 is a first for an MLS franchise. With the PSL factored in the per-game cost of an average season ticket is $54—highest in MLS.

The prices stunned even some enthusiastic Charlotte soccer fans especially considering the team’s own estimation of its fan base compared to the Panthers’: five times more likely to be between 18 and 34 years old and four times as likely to be Hispanic. The city’s Latino community comprises a large number of low- and working-class residents.

“The one thing that we basically made very clear to (disgruntled fans) was that we respect your opinion on the PSL” Kelly says. “We hear you but we’d still love to have you to a match. If the season ticket model is not for you we’re going to have affordable ways for every fan in the Carolinas to get in the building.” After a news conference in late May Kelly stressed that when single-game tickets go on sale—price range to be determined as they hadn’t gone on sale as of this writing—that “we’ll be sure we price at a level that allows fans to attend a match in our inaugural season.”

Other fans say they understand the need for the team to balance affordability and profitability. “I get it from a business perspective why they would do PSLs because they’ve got a product that people want to watch and buy into” says David Gusler president of Mint City Collective a 2000-member Charlotte FC supporters’ group. “If you have the ability to do that and get funding to invest back into the stadium I get it. But then from a fan perspective it’s not the most fan-friendly option when you already have a stadium built. It just doesn’t seem to rub some soccer fans very well.”

Gusler bought season tickets in the standing-room supporters’ section which doesn’t require a PSL and averages $27 per game. So did Kristin Bobenage a Panthers season ticket holder. “I feel like the (season) ticket prices are not overly expensive” Bobenage says. “If you’re committed to going to every single match then it might be but I feel like hopefully there are opportunities for it to be inexpensive just to fill some of the seats.”

Despite the pricing objections Kelly says a “very very low number” of people asked for refunds of their season-ticket deposits and many of those canceled because of relocation or COVID-related financial issues. Of the 10000 deposits the team secured after the December 2019 announcement Kelly says in May more than half have converted to season tickets and the club had “thousands” yet to contact. “We’re far exceeding where we thought we would be three months into ticket sales” he says.

Far enough to draw a record crowd for the first game and 30000 per match after that? Club officials are still working on that part. The team planned to build on initial demand over the summer with a marketing blitz it calls the For the Crown Tour with initial stops at the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Memorial Day weekend and the Carolina Country Music Festival in Myrtle Beach South Carolina in mid-June. “The purpose of the tour is to reach an audience that might not yet be engaged with our club” Kelly says.

In the fall the team plans to take advantage of $50 million in soccer-specific renovations at the stadium which Panthers fans will see all season not to mention Clemson and Georgia fans who’ll converge there for a college football game Sept. 4. “It’ll be hard to miss” Kelly says.

And as the FC builds its roster players will join the campaign. “Oh we’re going to wear out our players this fall” he says. “They’ll be at every tailgate out there.”

***

Fans thrilled with the announcement at the end of 2019 were surprised 10 months later when the team and city announced a change in location for the team headquarters. When Tepper initially stood before a crowd and bank of cameras at the Mint Museum Uptown he and team officials expected to house the headquarters at the long-vacant Eastland Mall site the hub of Charlotte’s east side and the heart of the city’s largest Latino community.

In October though the team revealed that it would locate its headquarters at the stadium and reserve part of the old mall site only for its elite Academy youth program which practices at Manchester Meadows in Rock Hill but expects to move to Eastland in July 2022. The main factor was the city’s hesitation to spend an estimated $110 million in public money to prepare the Eastland site and surrounding area for the headquarters; the revised plan requires only a $35 million public investment $25 million of that amount for the city’s share of stadium improvements and construction around it. Kelly who says Charlotte FC will be headquartered at the stadium “for the foreseeable future” adds that the centralized location makes sense given the Panthers’ planned relocation of its headquarters to Rock Hill South Carolina in summer 2023.

“We’re going to take a lot of the practice fields the Atrium Dome (indoor practice facility) even the weight room and convert it over to be soccer-specific” he says. “Literally overnight we would be able to turn this into one of the best soccer facilities in the world … even when you start looking over in Europe. Our practice facility would be in uptown. Our headquarters would be in uptown. We’re not in a suburb coming in town for a soccer match. For a lot of these international players to have the ability to live play work all within an uptown South End type of lifestyle is an extremely attractive option when we’re recruiting talent to come here.”

The switch turned out to be less of a concern for many in Charlotte’s Latino community than ticket prices. “There were mixed feelings about (the headquarters) anyway” says José Hernández-Paris the executive director of the Latin American Coalition. The LAC is Charlotte’s most prominent Latino advocacy organization and Hernández-Paris’ office is 1000 feet from the Eastland site. “I’ve been to training sites in other countries and I’ve seen the training. … It’s a large field with a fence. I’m not sure what impact that would have on the community surrounding it.”

On the whole he says the Latino community eagerly awaits the first season.

“I didn’t really expect the community to be as excited as I’ve seen it—to be able to support a local team” Hernández-Paris says. “Many people in the community have made Charlotte home and it’s very traditional in most of Latin America that each city has their own team that symbolizes a pride or a connection to the city. I think people are finding that it’s an opportunity to connect to Charlotte and to have the pride of being a Charlottean particularly in a sport like soccer which is so ingrained in our culture.”

Even with the team’s uptown location and the extensive renovations to accommodate soccer—including a new synthetic-turf field to replace the natural surface the stadium has sported since its opening in 1996—some city officials expect Tepper and his organization Tepper Sports and Entertainment to eventually come back to the city for more public investment.

“We had intentions of having a big discussion on everything all at once: Eastland soccer headquarters football and an entertainment district around the stadium” says Tariq Bokhari a Republican who chairs the City Council’s workforce and business development committee. “COVID happened other things happened and we had a smaller initial discussion. We know that there are other discussions that likely have to still be had.”

Still Bokhari as the representative for District 6 in south Charlotte and a soccer dad to three young children says he sees MLS as a great opportunity for the city. For him the vision crystallized when he toured Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta with his fellow council members in 2018.

“What we learned primarily on that Atlanta trip—and why they had such drastic success so quickly—was the deep connection and leveraging of the fan base” Bokhari says. “Getting that excitement roaring hot and allowing that to fuel them going on this dominant journey where they control the airwaves they control the ratings and they won the championship. … I walked away from that knowing that the key to success or failure lies within the fan base.”

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

As well as discussing Anderson's problems with his weight Rafael praised the fellow Brazilian's skill and claimed he could have been one of the best in the game.

""We could be on the team coach and pass the services on the motorway and Anderson would jump up impulsively and yell 'McDonald's McDonald's'"" Rafael revealed in The Sunshine Kids: Fabio & Rafael Da Silva which is due out later this year.

""The guy was crazy but I love him. Give him a football and he would just play with freedom and sometimes if he got a good run of games he could play as well as any player in the league. Not only that but when he was playing well we were playing brilliant football.

""He picked up a lot of big injuries and then his problems with eating the way he did started to affect him. It was no coincidence that his best form came when he had a lot of games because that was when he couldn't eat so much.

""I will say something about Anderson. If he had been a professional football player he could have been the best in the world. I'm saying this was all seriousness. I don't know if he ever took anything seriously. He just loved life in such an easy and casual way.

""In some ways that was a quality. It was what made him so popular and one of the most popular players at the club. But he would just eat whatever was put in front of him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0b28ub3JnLzIwMjEvMDcvMTcvZnJvbS1idXJnZXJzLXRvLWJ1aWxkaW5ncy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4td29lcy1hcmUtaGl0dGluZy1hbGFza2Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From burgers to buildings supply chain woes are hitting Alaska,"Alan Brown moved to Juneau recently from Nashville Tennessee and he’s got a little sticker shock going through the drive-thru at McDonald’s in Juneau. He orders a McNugget meal and the guy on the other side of the speaker tells him his total and to have a good day.

“So $10.17’s my total. At home it would’ve been like $7 and change” Brown says.

Brown isn’t an economist but he did a thing economists like doing with McDonald’s menu — he compared the price of an identical product in two different markets. The menu is also a handy way to track inflation in one place over time.

The Economist magazine has its Big Mac index. But for decades state economists have gone with the quarter pounder with cheese occasionally highlighting what it costs in different Alaska communities in the magazine Alaska Economic Trends. Spoiler alert for the July issue: It’s $5.49 in Juneau up 10 cents from before the pandemic in 2019.

This issue of Trends focuses on spikes in the cost of living and attributes a lot of that to supply chain problems related to the pandemic. There was deflation last year amid lockdowns but now the world is reopening.

McDonald’s wouldn’t answer questions for this story. But a local food truck business that specializes in burgers shared what’s driven its first price increases since opening in 2014. On social media last month Pucker Wilson’s said its supply costs have more than doubled since January. So the prices of most menu items went up by $1. Pucker Wilson’s cheeseburger is now $10.

Restaurants generally operate on thin profit margins so they’re especially sensitive to changes in food prices. Plus staffing is tough right now and there are fewer customers around with a short cruise ship season.

“This is by far and away the hardest thing that we’ve ever had to deal with” said Reecia Wilson the main owner of five downtown Juneau restaurants including Hangar on the Wharf.

Wilson said market conditions led her to leave two of her seasonal restaurants closed this summer and raise prices.

“It’s difficult to manage your day-to-day operations and just get through the day let alone worrying about having to reprint your menus and pay attention to the inflation as we lean into a very different business model” she said.

Wilson said prices are up across the board with meats and seafood especially. She hopes the supply chain problems are temporary and that she can rebuild her businesses.

Meilani Schijvens who runs the economic publications firm Rain Coast Data in Juneau summed up her take on what’s going on.

“I think that most people — most organizations — miscalculated how quickly once people got the vaccines and once the vaccines were distributed — how quickly sort of normal life would return and so normal demand” Schijvens said. “And so you just see a lag. And you see it locally nationally globally in terms of getting the supply chains up to the level of the demands that we are now having.”

Burgers and menu prices are one indicator of supply chain issues. Schijvens highlighted another price-related indicator often measured by the millions.

“So we’re seeing a lack of building supplies. We see that locally with our building projects our construction projects have gotten really expensive really fast” she said.

The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities does a lot of construction and Christopher Goins is the DOT construction engineer who estimates he’ll oversee more than $140 million in the department’s construction contracts across the region this season.

“We’re definitely seeing price fluctuations a lot of prices going up materials shortages in general across the board” Goins said.

The way competitive bidding on government contracts goes construction companies doing work now likely locked in what they’re being paid months ago or even years ago for multi-season projects — before materials prices went wild.

“Yeah so (for) the most part our state of Alaska contracts really don’t have what we call ‘escalation clauses’” he said. “When a dollar amount comes in it’s pretty much a fixed dollar amount for that contract.”

Goins said the department has been willing to give contractors extra time. But it’s on them to factor risk into their bids which Goins is seeing for projects in the bidding stage now.

When bids come in higher than budgeted there’s only a few options: Ask policymakers for more money scale projects back to fit the budget or don’t build.

“So that’s the harsh hard realities of the budgeting process from our end” Goins said.

It’s pretty much the same story with Goins’ counterpart at the City and Borough of Juneau.

Looking forward Goins has hopes but no certainty.

“I don’t think we’re through this inflationary blip if it is a blip” he said. “And hopefully the markets as the country gets back to producing and the world gets back to producing we hope that some of those higher spikes will begin to fall.”

SAN DIEGO COUNTY Calif. — Southwestern College hosted a memorial Sunday to commemorate the 37-year anniversary of what was at the time the largest mass shooting in American history.

The Higher Education Center at San Ysidro 460 West San Ysidro Boulevard was the scene of a tribute to the 21 victims who lost their lives on July 18 1984 at the site of the former McDonald's restaurant said Andre Harris spokesman for Southwestern College.

In front of the center stood a memorial that features 21 hexagonal pillars representing each victim. The memorial was decorated with flower displays.

Family members related to some of the victims were present at the memorial.

The massacre happened at a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro where 41-year-old James Huberty fatally shot 21 people and wounded 19 others before being killed by a police sniper about 77 minutes after he first opened fire.

""Southwestern College's Higher Education Center was built on the site of the former McDonald's"" Harris said. ""It stands as a symbol of triumph over tragedy in the community. The Higher Education Center is viewed as education outlasting hate and violence.""

Southwestern College Superintendent and President Mark Sanchez said the date ""lives forever in our hearts. We stand with those whose lives were forever altered by this tragedy. We grieve and mourn with the entire community but we also hope our institution can stand as a symbol of triumph over tragedy hope over helplessness and love over loss.""

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nb3NzYW1lci1zZWxscy1yaWdodHMtZHJ1Zy1ob3Blcy0xMjExMDAwMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gossamer sells rights to drug it hopes can rival a new Merck therapy,"Gossamer Bio has sold rights to an experimental drug that could rival a new medicine from Merck & Co. in a deal at least one analyst believes “bodes well” for the company.

On Monday Gossamer and the Italy-based Chiesi Farmaceutici announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and eventually sell the drug which is called seralutinib. Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known in short as PAH and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.

PAH or pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.

Unlike other treatments Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.

Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial titled “Prosera” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.

While Gossamer remains confident in its drug company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022 when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning they traded at about 75 cents apiece.

Joseph Schwartz an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns according to Schwartz is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.

The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration” the analyst wrote.

Story continues

Per deal terms Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs the former is responsible for financing Prosera.

In the U.S. the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.

Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales. Chiesi has agreed to pay Gossamer $160 million as a development reimbursement and may shell out up to $326 million more provided certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.

Various mobile app continued to rise in popularity – with the usage and need of shopping online that have become ubiquitous.

We can’t deny how essential mobile phone to be used for almost every aspect of our lives. In fact a report stated that Singaporeans downloaded 245.4 million apps in 2018 spending approximately US$399.3 million on apps alone.

[REITs]

Q1 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc

Although mobile apps today play an important role a number of Singaporeans still prefers to browse for product and conduct purchases on desktops. This was evident in our previous study on the State of E-commerce.

We conducted a study to portray who were the mobile e-commerce shopping apps with the highest monthly active users in Southeast Asia in Q1 2019 with the help of App Annie Intelligence. This data comprises combined iPhone and Android phone averaged monthly active users Q1 2019 in selected countries – Singapore Malaysia Indonesia Philippines Thailand and Vietnam.

We also analysed the top most visited e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia in Q1 2019 obtained through SimilarWeb. The companies selected for this study were amongst the top 50 most visited platforms – on desktop and mobile web – in Singapore.

Lazada Qoo10 Shopee & Taobao Were The Most Actively Used Apps

Lazada

Lazada juxtaposed its annual anniversary event to offer a varied range of products and prices that took place from 21 to 27 March 2019. The platform received a tremendous amount of traffic over week-long celebration that came to its peak with a 24-hour shopping extravaganza on 27th March.

Through the app itself on average shoppers would log on as often as six times a day to play in-app games. On top of that Lazada live streamed performances artistes on its app to attract consumers.

More importantly Lazada has strengthened its position as a key e-commerce player in Singapore as Redmart was integrated into Lazada’s app and website on 15 March 2019. Customers now are able to browse to more than 400000 retailers in Lazada’s ecosystem – within the same app as what users have been using and at redmart.lazada.sg.

Nonetheless Lazada requires a series of app updates over the next few months as well as launching the Redmart features and functionalities which is hoped will be ready by end-June 2019. These include; order amend delivery slot incentives my list features search functionality delivery slot reservation and order rescheduling.

Furthermore Chinese New Year 2019 that fell on February 4th to 5th – coincides with the February new moon and the year of the pig – was celebrated by people in Southeast Asia countries as a time to honor deities and to be with family.

In conjunction with this Lunar New Year Lazada Singapore celebrated its CNY campaign with huge promotions such as 888 flash deals up to 88%off and up to $88 vouchers. It is a celebration sale period as consumers will actively go through the Internet and e-commerce to find what they need for the preparation of the occasion.

Qoo10

Qoo10 remains as a strong competitor in Singapore with the 2nd highest in monthly active users on its mobile app in Singapore in Q1 2019. The Singaporean-based e-commerce company in 2018 stated that the company will continue to focus its progress on the city-state and remains as a strong competitor in the mobile shopping app arena.

Among the possible drivers of its performance in Q1 2019 could be the introduction of its partnership with Grab Pay that provides consumers the option to pay later for rides food delivery and for shopping on Qoo10.

Ku Young Bae the CEO of Qoo10 is optimistic of its company’s future as there is much room for improvements such as in its diverse product selection more cross-border merchant sources a predominantly domestic vendor base self-owned cross-border shipping network and price competitiveness to drive further growth in Singapore.

Shopee

Shopee – as the third most actively used app – is amongst the fastest growing e-commerce apps as compared to others in the list of the most active users in Singapore. Shopee was founded in 2015 where the trend in Southeast Asia had a tendency towards users were to purchase through their smartphones. Founded since 2015 the e-commerce company has considered itself as a mobile-first platform prioritising its developments on the mobile app which has made them amongst the most actively used apps in Singapore. In terms of its overall ranking Shopee’s mobile app was ranked at 2nd place amongst other apps.

In its past months prioritised a ‘hyper-localised’ user experience approach by having a different app for each country. This was part of their strategy to focus on taking a highly localised approach to each market. Sea – the parent company of Shopee – in March 2019 stated it aims to raise US$1.5B in an effort to drive further growth for Shopee. It also has become the most visited e-commerce platform (on desktop & mobile web) in Southeast Asia during the quarter which garnered a total traffic increased by 5% from website and app combined as compared in Q4 2018 to 184.4 million visits.

Taobao

As the fourth most actively used app in Singapore in particular TaoBao seemed to be performing well in countries where there were more consumers proficient in the Chinese language – Mandarin. As such Taobao although usable in other countries in Southeast Asia was most actively used in Singapore and Malaysia. Taobao was actively used in Singapore as most sellers would provide delivery services to Singapore as well as attractive deals and products that are sometimes not available in the country.

Beyond its ley mobile app Taobao products are also available to Singaporeans via a Taobao agent or third-party platforms such as EZBuy SGShop Peeka and Oops.

Nevertheless if users are to prefer Lazada as their platform to shop through Taobao it is still feasible to purchase the items from there as Lazada recently excelled cross-border business across Southeast Asia.

The Most Visited E-commerce Platforms on Desktop & Mobile Web in Singapore and Southeast Asia

Qoo10 remains as the most visited e-commerce platform in Singapore garnering an average of 7.9 million visits on desktop and mobile web in Q1 2019. Subsequently Lazada was the second most visited at 7.4 million visitors and Shopee at 2.5 million visitors in the same period.

Totalling the overall traffic garnered in Q1 2019 across Southeast Asia Shopee is the most visited e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia (six countries – Indonesia Malaysia Philippines Thailand Vietnam & Singapore) in Q1 2019 with a total average of 184.8 million visitors.

In terms of ranking Lazada remains as the most visited platform (on desktop and mobile web) in Malaysia Philippines and Thailand. Overall Lazada obtained 179.7 million visitors in Q1 2019 (six countries – Indonesia Malaysia Philippines Thailand Vietnam & Singapore).

Report Methodology for Vital Insights on Mobile E-commerce Shopping Apps in Southeast Asia in Q1 2019

App Annie Intelligence for iPhone and Android phone were derived from mobile usage data collected from a large sample of real-world users combined with additional proprietary data sets. For the purposes of this report an active user is defined as a device having one or more sessions with an app in the time period. A single person may be active on multiple devices in any time period and will therefore be counted as one user per device in the total active users. For example when a user logs into the app it would be counted as a session during a given month and counted as an active user.

Monthly Active Users (MAU) rankings in this report are based on unified apps made possible by App Annie’s exclusive DNA. In unified apps similar versions of the same app with different names and on different platforms are unified. For example ShopeeSG: Lowest Price Madness on iOS and ShopeeSG: Men Sale for Android on Google Play are all aggregated and ranked as a single Shopee unified app.

US President Joe Biden says FB killing people with Covid misinformation,"US President Joe Biden has hit out at Facebook again saying that such social media platforms are allowing Covid vaccine misinformation to spread and are ""killing people"".

In an interaction with the media on Friday Biden directly criticised Facebook.



See Zee Business Live TV Streaming Below:

Asked for a message to social media platforms like Facebook Biden replied: ""They`re killing people... the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated and they`re killing people.""

Facebook defended its policy on fighting vaccine misinformation.

""We will not be distracted by accusations which aren`t supported by the facts"" a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge.

""The fact is that more than 2 billion people have viewed authoritative information about COVID-19 and vaccines on Facebook which is more than any other place on the internet. More than 3.3 million Americans have also used our vaccine finder tool to find out where and how to get a vaccine"" the company spokesperson added.

Earlier this week a report from US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on social media platforms to tame accounts that share misinformation.

""They`ve designed product features such as `Like` buttons that reward us for sharing emotionally charged content not accurate content. And their algorithms tend to give us more of what we click on pulling us deeper and deeper into a well of misinformation"" he told reporters.

In May the social network announced to push down all posts by users who repeatedly share misinformation and fake content across its platforms as it expands its fact-checking programme to individuals from Pages Groups Instagram accounts and domains.

The social network said that the new rule applies on false or misleading content about Covid-19 and vaccines climate change elections or other topics so that fewer people see misinformation on its family apps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzLWNlby1lZC1iYXN0aWFuLWNuYmMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian On The Company's Tech Endeavors,"First On CNBC: CNBC Transcript: Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian Speaks with CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Today

Watch CNBC’s full interview with Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian

All references must be sourced to CNBC.

WILFRED FROST: CES kicking off in Las Vegas. More than just tech companies are making headlines this year. Delta Air Lines announcing a number of new ventures including plans for a digital concierge service that expands the airlines relationship with Lyft and a new venture into robotics. Delta is exploring the use of exoskeleton suits its employees can wear to help with lifting heavy cargo or machinery. Joining us now live from CES in a first on CNBC interview is Ed Bastian the Delta Air Lines CEO. Ed a very good afternoon to you. Thanks for joining us.

ED BASTIAN: Hey Wilf. Thanks for having me. A lot of excitement going on out here.

WILFRED FROST: I bet. We’ve had great coverage from our colleagues all day. And delighted for you to be a part of it. Ed tell us what will you launching there at CES? I guess not typical for an airline to be there. It’s very much app-based expansion.

DELTA AIRLINES CEO : Yeah it was great. We were -- we delivered -- I delivered the opening keynote for CES. The first time an airline had ever done that. In fact the opening question that the CEO of CES gave me is why is an airline here? And it gave me the opportunity to tell our story. And our story really is about all of the investment we’ve made to improve the quality of our operations. We’re the on-time leader. We’ve got the most reliable highest performance airline in the industry.

Investing billions in dollars in the in-flight experience. And now we’re doing the same to improve the ground experience. And you see our airports going up in many parts of the country and the improvements. We need to bring technology alongside that whether it’s digital whether it’s the Fly Delta app whether it’s new technology like parallel reality. And that was our opportunity to describe that.

WILFRED FROST: And in terms of the new technology aspect to what extent is it only really for on the ground services for the consumer? I mean you were disappointed that free WiFi on all flights is still not a reality.

DELTA AIRLINES CEO ED BASTIAN: Well we’re working on free WiFi. We’re committed to getting to free WiFi. But it has to be WiFi that has the expectations that consumers deserve: high-quality content high-quality bandwidth and speed. We’re not quite there yet but we’re on the path to getting there. And as I said this morning we will get there within the next two years. Sooner if we can. And then when we get there we have to make it the same price on the ground which is generally free.

COURTNEY REAGAN: So Ed you explained a little bit about technology helping the operations of Delta. What about on sort of on the consumer-facing side? When we all travel it’s become stressful experience. Obviously there are many players that tie in together from the TSA and security the airline itself as well as the airport operations. But have been really announced any technology for making my experience potentially less stressful?

DELTA AIRLINES CEO: Sure well that was one of the key themes for the presentation is that we need to find ways to destress consumers as they’re traveling. And we all know that there’s stress in the environment particularly in the ground experience. So we announced together with Lyft a closer integration. So when you’re traveling on Delta yew the Fly Delta App you’ll be able to monitor your arrival or destination information through Lyft. They’ll have cars there available waiting for you.

We unveiled a vision of the future because it was really a visionary presentation going out over the next five years whereby you don’t even need to bring your bag to the airport. Because we know how much stress is involved in bringing your bag and checking it or trying to get an overhead bin for it.

Why not have the opportunity to have us get your bag from your home to your destination so it’s waiting for you when you arrive at that hotel. If you’re in a business meeting you can go directly to the business meeting. Or if you’re going to a new city you have a chance to go explore it. I mean there’s many many things that we’re doing. But we’ve got the credibility because we’ve got the core reliability performance of the airline fixed. And now it’s our opportunity to bring technology to make a real difference with our consumers.

WILFRED FROST: And I wanted to ask you about Boeing if I may another story relating to the timing of the return of the 737 Max today. Today the airline saying that it’s going to push for a simulator training for all pilots moving forward. But either way there’s been a delay after delay as to when this plane might return. To what extent do industrial executives like yourself losing fate in the company whenever it makes any target whether it’s related to the 737 Max return or anything else are you losing faith in the ability of this company to make – to meet the promises it makes?

DELTA AIRLINES CEO : Well Wilf as you know we don’t fly the 737 Max. So we’re not directly impacted by that issue. We’ve been monitoring it. We’ve been in touch with Boeing around it. Yes we have to -- we do have concerns regarding what it will mean for future development and future technology innovation in our space. We have basically two suppliers in our space we have Airbus and we have Boeing.

And we need Boeing to get through this crisis. We need them to get focused on the innovation and the development of the new technology for the new aircraft that we’re waiting to order. And they continue to push our industry forward not just from an efficiency with cleaner emissions but also better comfort for our customers. So I have confidence in Dave Calhoun. I’ve known Dave for a long time. I think he’s the right man for the job. We’re staying in close touch. But it is frustrating yes.

WILFRED FROST: That said that frustration aside Ed is there a part of you that actually weirdly welcomes further delays in the 737 Max? Of course the original tragedies aside because you don’t fly the plane? Have there been some gains in market share for you because of the delays in the 737 Max’s return?

ED BASTIAN: No. We’re not – we’re hoping for that plane to get in the sky. You know you’re right. We have on the margin some additional revenue and some additional share that we’ve gained because the plane has not been flying. But all the other airlines that do fly the plane I think gave a good job of covering off their key competitive markets.

You know the great thing about airplanes is they move and they can go fly to different revenue pools to make sure they’re protecting their key markets. So we’ve had some marginal benefit. When it does come back I’m sure there will be marginal negative impact. I think it will be small for us. But you know we really want -- it’s not good for any of us to have that plane out of the sky.

COURTNEY REAGAN: Ed there’s been a lot of focus on the energy market this week as you well know after the events in Iran after the assassination of the General there. What is your outlook for jet fuel prices? I know the airline stocks got taken down a bit yesterday as energy prices moved higher albeit preparing some of those losses by the end of the session. So how are you focused on the cost of jet fuel going forward this year?

DELTA AIRLINES CEO : Well we watch it closely Courtney as you can imagine. You know we’ve built our business to be able to sustain short-term shocks like this. And we talk about short-term shocks going from $60 to $70 a barrel. You know we’ve been built on a model where we had to cover over $100 a barrel not that long ago. So I think the industry is in a good spot.

I know Delta is in a very good spot. We’ve built our business to cover oil and we expect oil to be on range-bound somewhere between $60 and $80 a barrel where it’s been for the last several years. If it gets above $80 obviously there’s some decisions that we’ll have to take over time. But right now there’s no change to our strategy. We’ve got a great plan for 2020 and we’re not seeing any real negative impacts from you know the most recent short-term spike we’ve seen this week.

WILFRED FROST: Ed I wanted to ask you about the investment you made in LATAM Airlines Group. Is that a sign that you think the domestic airline travel market is somewhat saturated in ex-growth? And if at the moment 72% of your revenue comes from the domestic market where will that number by in five years? Significantly lower than 72%?

ED BASTIAN: Well it’s a fair point. Because over time -- not yet but over time the domestic market will become relatively saturated. You see how congested air travel can be at times in our key markets. We’re building bigger airplanes and we’re building bigger airports but we’re not building new destinations in the domestic market to fly.

You know we’re doing well. We’re growing 5-7% a year. And we’ll continue. And I see that growth rate staying pretty strong over the next couple of years. But over time certainly as we enter the next century of our future which will be happening in the next few years international I think is the place we need to be.

That’s why we’re investing in Latam. And a great airline they have 40% market share throughout all of South America. A really important future partner for us. That’s why we’re investors in Virgin Air France KLM Korean China Eastern. We have taken a contrarian view that we need to get inside these other airlines not just as commercial partners but as equity owners to try to bring a longer-term opportunity for us and for them to the future.

WILFRED FROST: Ed great to speak as always. Thanks for joining us.

ED BASTIAN: Appreciate you guys having me.

It was 2:20 PM when I arrived at the makeshift vaccination clinic at a Park MGM bar on the Las Vegas Strip Saturday and by then Gov. Steve Sisolak Congresswoman Dina Titus and Las Vegas comedian Brad Garrett were gone.

Free walk-in COVID vaccination shots were being administered in the back of the MGM Resorts property next to Park MGM’s Eataly but it was quiet. A friendly MGM Resorts worker was trying the best he could do to lure people off the Strip for a shot.

The friendly staffers of the state’s Immunize Nevada program were holding down the fort at the all-day “Viva Vax VEGAS” signing up anyone who wanted a vax shot and signing them up for free prizes.

Up until then about 50 people had received vaccination shots against the COVID virus which is infecting more and more residents in Clark County. The Southern Nevada Health District issued a recommendation Friday that all people — vaccinated or unvaccinated — should be wearing masks when inside at places.

While the Vegas Golden Knights were trading away a once-bright prospect Cody Glass and receiving a couple young fellas named Nolan Patrick and Brett Howden in NHL trades Saturday the local NHL team was loaning out their knight mascot the golden knight played by Lee Orchard. Orchard was dressed in the full knight costume as the VivaVax event and he was feeling the 105-degree heat today.

Las Vegas sports teams and venues have been involved in hosting COVID vax events.

COVID vax jabs have been done on the T-Mobile Arena plaza before Golden Knights games inside the Raiders’ Allegiant Stadium and even at the Las Vegas Aviators baseball park in Downtown Summerlin.

The Raiders cheerleaders were set to make a cameo at 3 PM at VivaVaxVEGAS in an attempt by the state to get more people to get vaccinated against a virus that has killed more than 600000 Americans.

Overall only 42 percent of Nevadans are completely vaccinated.

The test positivity rate for Clark County has increased to more 10 percent in Clark County.

That number could go up because the COVID cases do not reflect the number of people infected with the coronavirus at the July 10 Garth Brooks concert where 65000 people — mostly unmasked — attended at Allegiant Stadium a week ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3RoZW5ldmFkYWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3JldHVybi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LW9ha2xhbmQtYXMtc2Vla2luZy10by1mb2xsb3ctcmFpZGVycy10by1hLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLXN0YWRpdW0taW4tc291dGhlcm4tbmV2YWRh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Many questions remain as A's seek to follow Raiders to a billion-dollar stadium in Southern Nevada,"Less than five years after bringing the NFL’s Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas Southern Nevada is dancing with Major League Baseball’s Oakland Athletics the Northern California city’s last professional sports franchise which is seeking to flee the crumbling Oakland Coliseum for possibly a new multi-billion dollar stadium in the desert.

The situation surrounding the Athletics – often referred to as the A’s – has far different scenarios and circumstances than the 2016 endeavor by the now-Las Vegas Raiders. The AFC West team launches its second season inside the $1.9 billion Allegiant Stadium next month.

However when this dance music ends the possibility exists that the A’s will remain in Oakland.

A’s President David Kaval said the franchise is on parallel paths toward vacating the 55-year-old Oakland ballpark that also formerly housed the Raiders.

One path is a waterfront ballpark in Oakland as part of a $12 billion development at the Howard Terminal near Jack London Square. But the A’s and the city are roughly $500 million apart in negotiations on a term sheet. A preliminary vote on the 34000-seat stadium by Oakland’s City Council is scheduled for Tuesday.

The other path leads to an estimated $1 billion retractable roof ballpark with 33000-to-35000 seats located on a yet-to-be-determined Southern Nevada location. At least two sites on the Strip behind Bally’s Las Vegas and across from the Sahara are being considered.

The A’s contract to play in the nearly 47000-seat Coliseum expires in 2024 so a time element is in play.

The unanswered question hanging over the process like a fog bank above San Francisco Bay is how much the A’s would seek in public financing from Southern Nevada to build the stadium.

Las Vegas has the distinction of providing the single-largest-ever pot of public money for a stadium project in the U.S. – $750 million – to help the Raiders develop the 65000-seat glass-domed facility. A special session of the Legislature was needed to approve an increase in the Strip’s hotel room tax.

Allegiant Stadium is located on 62 acres along the west side of Interstate 15 across from Mandalay Bay and has large lanai doors that open to offer views of the Las Vegas Strip.

Kaval said the baseball stadium’s location – the A’s are considering nearly two dozen potential sites – would help determine a private-public partnership. Allegiant Stadium is in unincorporated Clark County. Meanwhile the A’s have been exploring sites along the Strip in downtown Las Vegas Henderson and Summerlin.

“It’s too early to figure that part out yet. We don’t know” Kaval said during a half-hour phone interview with The Nevada Independent last week. “We’re approaching this with humility and we’re just dipping our toe in the water to see what’s possible and to understand. Obviously the community is just coming off the pandemic and you have a lot of things happening. We just want to be really thoughtful about how we approach it. We’re really trying to learn more about the opportunity and how some of these partnerships take place.”

At last week’s Major League All-Star Game in Denver baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said Las Vegas was not a bluff to frighten the city of Oakland. Kaval insisted that the Las Vegas Valley was not a stalking horse to push a favorable Oakland vote. He said the team is serious about Southern Nevada.

He and other A’s executives have made three trips to Las Vegas since Major League Baseball gave the A’s approval to explore stadium options outside Oakland. Another trip is planned Wednesday regardless of the vote.

Kaval said the team retained Legends Global Partnerships a company part-owned by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to conduct a market study on Southern Nevada to help determine a location for the ballpark and the potential audience for the American League franchise.

“If (the market study) shows (a) 90 percent locals (fan base) then a location like Henderson or Summerlin makes a lot of sense” Kaval said. “If there is going to be a predominant or significant number of tourists then being in the resort corridor makes sense.”

The Raiders engaged Legends to secure their stadium’s naming rights and as the official premium ticketing and sponsorships agency.

“Key questions need to be answered” Kaval said. “This will drive a lot of our decision-making. We commissioned the study because we are very serious about this parallel path in Las Vegas. That’s why we’re coming every two weeks. The early returns are positive and exciting and we want to see how this plays out.”

Public financing downsides

Stadium financing pitfalls concern some observers.

Las Vegas could join a handful of cities that have funded multiple stadium projects simultaneously or in close proximity and have run into financial troubles.

Victor Matheson a sports economist and economics professor at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester Massachusetts said Baltimore had financial “horror stories” providing public financing for Camden Yards home to baseball’s Baltimore Orioles and M&T Bank Stadium for the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens.

When the recession hit in the late 2000s Matheson said Cincinnati had trouble paying off bond obligations that funded the Great American Ball Park for the Cincinnati Reds and Paul Brown Stadium for the NFL’s Cincinnati Bengals.

Baseball stadiums he said often sit empty before and after 81 regular season home games. The challenge in Southern Nevada he said could be creating two multi-billion-dollar venues that are competing for the same events other than football and baseball.

Matheson also warned of a “substitution effect” as both tourists and locals spend money at the stadium that would have gone into the local casino market. He was critical in 2016 of Allegiant Stadium’s public financing.

“Las Vegas which was among the hardest-hit places by the pandemic because it depends heavily on the hospitality sector may not have the money to provide significant public funding” Matheson said in an interview last week. “Convention traffic is not yet back in Las Vegas nor is international tourist traffic. This could put Las Vegas in the same boat as Cincinnati and Baltimore.”

The Raiders played the 2020 inaugural home games at Allegiant without fans because of capacity restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic recording zero dollars in game day ticket sale proceeds and concession revenues.

Tourism declines led to a more than 60 percent drop in Las Vegas hotel room taxes in 2020 which fund the stadium’s public financing. Clark County twice dipped into the Las Vegas Stadium Authority bond reserve to make its twice a year payments.

Jeremy Aguero a principal at Applied Analysis a research and consulting firm that serves as staff for the Las Vegas Stadium Authority Board said two years of reserves were built into the Allegiant Stadium financing and more than a year-and-a-half of debt service financing remains. Las Vegas he said is building back its room tax generations.

As for financing a potential stadium for the A’s he said it was a “loaded question” when asked if there could be concerns about public money for another ballpark.

Until “we know all the circumstances of what is being proposed” he wasn’t going to speculate about a potential stadium for the A’s. Aguero said he hasn’t met with the team’s representatives.

“The approach they are taking is correct because they are not leaving any stone unturned and they are doing a lot of groundwork” Aguero said. “We just have to be mindful of the structure of any deal. The devil is in the details but what we’ve learned no one can pull off a major project like Las Vegas.”

Kaval agreed with Aguero’s analysis on that last point.

“The success Las Vegas has had in doing big projects like Resorts World Allegiant Stadium and the convention center expansion is a positive attribute that the commissioner’s office noted” Kaval said. “That’s important to make this a reality.”

Clark County Commission Chairwoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick said in an interview she was hesitant to support any public financing for a baseball stadium “at this time.” She had “just a meet and greet” with the team’s contingent and was looking forward to seeing any detail the team provides on the public financing aspect.

“I think it’s way too soon. I don’t think we can fund what they might be asking for” Kirkpatrick said. “We have a lot of businesses still hurting and we’re still in the middle of a pandemic.”

Toward the end of the legislative session in May lawmakers rejected an idea by a lobbyist representing a consortium of Southern Nevada governments who said there was interest in allowing Sales Tax Anticipation Revenue (STAR) bonds and Tourism Improvement Districts as a potential “tool in the toolbox” for developers. Language for allowing the use of STAR Bonds for a stadium was removed by lawmakers during the conference committee.

Kaval said it was important for the A’s to “understand what the options are.” A few years ago he said Mesa Arizona – where the A’s hold spring training – funded a new baseball facility through a rental car tax. In 2008 Washoe County financed $30 million of the $55 million cost for Greater Nevada Field in Reno through a 2 percent tax on rental cars.

Having Major League baseball in Southern Nevada would drive tourism and drive jobs” Kaval said.

Show me the money

A recent Forbes study showed the value of the Raiders was $3.1 billion at the end of 2020 up from $761 million in 2011 and an increase of 117 percent over just the past five years.

The rise was attributed to the move to Las Vegas as well as personal seat licenses and ticket sales associated with Allegiant Stadium. The Raiders are now the 12th most valuable NFL franchise and the 29th most valuable professional sports franchise.

Major League Baseball took notice of the figures.

Bo Bernhard executive director of the UNLV International Gaming Institute suggested “in the sports world locating a franchise in Las Vegas can catapult your value.”

Bernhard was involved in the early stages of the Raiders move by producing a report that showed the NFL and Las Vegas could co-exist when Nevada was the only state with legal sports betting.

That issue disappeared with the nationwide legalization of sports betting in 2018.

Sports betting consultant Sara Slane said Major League Baseball has multiple sports betting partnerships for official league data and league-controlled assets.

“Major League Baseball is very ingrained in the sports betting industry” Slane said. “The teams have also embraced sports betting. These deals range from direct market access for mobile and retail (wagering) in Arizona with the Diamondbacks to more traditional sponsorship and marketing opportunities.”

Bernhard expects the A’s would follow the same path with marketing agreements and partnerships as the Raiders and the NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights.

“The Raiders found new ways to monetize the game experience and Las Vegas is far more attractive to those in the corporate world because of the entertainment here” Bernhard said. “The Raiders and baseball add to that value.”

All roads lead to the Strip

The 2016 debate over the Raiders’ stadium request quickly ended when the major Strip casino operators including MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment agreed to a room tax increase – roughly 0.88 percent or $1.50 a night – that was overwhelmingly approved by the Legislature and signed off by then-Gov. Brian Sandoval.

The other fact was the Strip’s insistence that the $1 billion 1.4 million-square-foot expansion to the Las Vegas Convention Center’s West Hall also be funded.

Several gaming insiders questioned whether Strip casino operators would support another room tax increase to fund a baseball stadium especially if it’s built in the suburbs away from Las Vegas Boulevard.

Officials from MGM Resorts and Caesars declined to comment on the A’s.

In a statement Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO Steve Hill said he met with the team’s leadership and appreciated the interest in Las Vegas.

“It’s great the A’s organization is considering Las Vegas for its potential relocation” Hill said. “The rapid growth of professional sports teams and high-profile sporting events in Las Vegas have quickly catapulted the destination to become the sports capital of the world. We think it would be a great fit.”

Don Logan president of the Las Vegas Aviators the A’s Triple-AAA farm team since 2019 believes the stadium would find support from the Strip even if the ballpark is built in Henderson or Summerlin. Logan now in his 39th season with the minor league franchise said casinos would use the A’s games to bring in customers from all over the country.

“It’s about filling rooms and these are very sophisticated marketers” Logan said. “The tourists will come for major league sports. It allows Las Vegas to offer more as a destination.”

At least two Strip locations are being looked at as potential stadium sites.

A spokeswoman for Treasure Island owner Phil Ruffin confirmed the A’s toured the Las Vegas Festival Grounds a 60-acre site at the corner of the Strip and Sahara Avenue Ruffin acquired from MGM Resorts in 2019 as part of his $825 million purchase of Circus Circus.

A 27-acre location behind Bally’s Las Vegas Paris Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood is also under consideration according to Kaval. The site was a potential stadium location for the Montreal Expos back in 2004. The team studied Las Vegas as a relocation possibility before settling on Washington D.C. The land is owned by real estate investment trust VICI Properties.

“VICI doesn’t comment on specific conversations” company President John Payne said in an email. “However our significant land bank in Las Vegas represents a compelling opportunity to widen the Las Vegas Strip along the center of gravity and we regularly study opportunities to maximize long-term value.”

Kaval said architectural designers are working up plans and conceptual ballpark designs for many of the potential sites.

Cone of silence

State and local elected leaders have toned down the initial exuberance for a baseball stadium. Many declined interview requests and sent statements through their press offices.

Gov. Steve Sisolak one of the primary proponents behind the Raiders’ move to Las Vegas and an advocate for the Allegiant Stadium’s public financing didn’t offer answers to questions about the A’s that were provided to his spokeswoman.

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said in a statement “We have had great discussions with the A’s management and we look forward to future talks with the team to showcase the advantages of moving to Southern Nevada.”

A spokeswoman said Henderson City Manager Richard Derrick had a second meeting with the A’s on July 8 to discuss the team’s “continued interest in relocating to Southern Nevada.” The discussions were described as “largely exploratory.”

One site in Henderson that has drawn attention includes three vacant parcels totaling 109 acres and is adjacent to the Galleria Mall and bordered on the east by U.S. 93-95. The Aviators’ Logan targeted the location for a spring training complex in the 1990s.

Aviators won’t fly away

Logan and Kaval said the arrival of the A’s would not spell the end for the Las Vegas Aviators who have been playing baseball in Southern Nevada since 1983. Three Major League teams – Minnesota Twins Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros – co-exist in the same cities as their top minor league clubs.

“Minor League baseball is family-oriented and price-conscious” Logan said. “It will be a challenge because you are talking about 150 baseball games combined over six months. That’s a lot of baseball. Everyone I’ve spoken with said it’s viable.”

Logan told his staff the process for the A’s “needs to play itself out” and the team would support the effort.

The Aviators franchise is owned by Howard Hughes Corp. as is the 10000-seat Las Vegas Ballpark in Downtown Summerlin. The stadium opened in 2019 and the LVCVA has a 20-year $80 million naming rights deal for the facility. The stadium has been widely praised in minor league baseball circles.

But could it house the A’s on a temporary basis if a major league ballpark were in construction?

“Major League Baseball will make that decision” Kaval said.

Good-bye Oakland?

Manfred the baseball commissioner who approved the Las Vegas exploration said Tuesday’s vote “will determine (the) fate of baseball in Oakland.” However even if the council votes in favor of the waterfront stadium other approvals such as the environmental impact on the site are still needed.

“A no vote accelerates the effort in Las Vegas” Kaval said. He noted that Major League Baseball rejected the Coliseum site.

“The league said a renovation or a new rebuild is not something that fits the future of baseball” he said.

The A’s have spent more than three years working on the Howard Terminal location and Kaval said the site was preferred by Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf. But the council has never taken a vote on the project. A spokesman for Schaaf did not return multiple phone messages emails or text messages.

After Manfred’s remarks Schaaf reiterated her support for the Howard Terminal project in a statement provided to the East Bay Times.

“MLB has once again made it clear that the only path to keeping the A’s rooted in Oakland is a ballpark on the waterfront and we agree” she said through spokesperson Messiah Madyun. “We are continuing to work closely with the A’s on a deal that is good for Oakland good for the A’s and good for our entire region.”

The battle to ban smoking in casinos is heating up again.

Americans for Nonsmokers Rights a California-based advocacy group seeking to ban smoking in casinos nationwide has jumped on the record and near-record revenue performances of the nation’s casinos since full reopenings began a few months ago to push for smoke-free casinos.

When Atlantic City casinos reported an all-time revenue record in the month of June Americans for Nonsmokers Rights President and CEO Cynthia Hallett jumped to the conclusion that revenue and operating smoke-free are connected.

“Another record-breaking revenue month in Atlantic City — while casinos operated smoke-free — offers the latest evidence that smoke-free is good for business” she said. “Industry arguments for indoor smoking even in the year 2021 have lost credibility. It’s time for Gov. (Phil) Murphy and Senate President (Stephen) Sweeney to act to finally close the casino loophole so that workers and guests are not forced to breathe harmful secondhand smoke. No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck.”

The loophole Hallett referenced was an exception in New Jersey’s indoor smoking ban that allows smoking to occur within casinos.

When the pandemic was raging New Jersey leaders ordered a temporary ban on all smoking in casinos. That expired on the Fourth of July but Murphy has pledged to support a permanent smoking ban in casinos in the future.

Americans for Nonsmokers Rights has documented that the amount of revenue generated isn’t reliant on the ability to smoke.

According to the anti-smoking group 22 states and U.S. territories ban smoking at casinos. In the Silver State thanks to the Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act smoking is banned in any stadium or public place that is not a casino bar or a few other exceptions.

In most cases a smoking ban results in an initial dip in revenue followed by an increase to previous levels.

But ask a smoker to put out his cigarette pipe or stogie in a casino and you’re bound to get a fight. Some casinos have banned smoking at table games but most Las Vegas properties allow it.

Like New Jersey Nevada casinos have seen high gaming win numbers since fully reopening. Most analysts have attributed that to pent-up demand for entertainment and that smoking has nothing to do with it.

One Las Vegas casino that opted to go smoke-free when it reopened to the public at the end of September last year Park MGM continues to ban smoking in its casino.

A spokesman for MGM Resorts International said it doesn’t report casino revenue trends by property so whether Park MGM is making more now than it did before COVID-19 shutdowns is an unknown.

Americans for Nonsmokers Rights also is taking advantage of a big story in the local news: the potential relocation of the Oakland A’s to Las Vegas. Because of that team’s ban on stadium smoking the group noted to A’s management and Major League Baseball that it wants its support in banning smoking in Nevada casinos.

The Berkeley-based organization went up the road to Oakland seeking support if and when the A’s decide to plant roots in Southern Nevada.

“MLB has long been a pioneer in major league sports to curb the use of tobacco among players as a way of protecting their health and setting an example for fans of all ages” Hallett wrote to Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred.

“As it currently stands only two franchises the Cardinals and Royals are located in cities that allow smoking inside of casinos. As you continue your consideration of Las Vegas or other cities as new home cities for the Athletics or other MLB teams we hope you will contribute to creating safe environments in communities that host MLB franchises.”

It remains to be seen whether the A’s will move to Las Vegas or whether they will have any influence on smoking policies if they do.

And It Smells Like Marijuana.,"For Caitlyn Hunter’s 21st birthday trip to Las Vegas last month her mother booked spots on a “Las Vegas Cannabis Tour” a business started during the pandemic that guides tourists through marijuana dispensaries in that city. Ms. Hunter of Houston Texas expected an educational afternoon where she her mother and grandmother could smoke marijuana together and her grandmother could learn about different marijuana strains that might help her with knee pain.

What they got instead Ms. Hunter said was a “crazy experience” involving a guide in 4-inch pink stilettos cracking dirty jokes a raucous van ride around the Las Vegas Strip (with a sober driver) the consumption of multiple cannabis products a shopping bag full of decorative bongs to use as flower vases back home and at one point a grandmother unable to speak without bursting into uncontrollable laughter. In short Ms. Hunter concluded a perfect celebration.

Sharon Erick had a different experience in Vegas. Vacationing there from Atlanta in May she and her small group of friends all in their 30s had to work to find outdoor dining where they weren’t overwhelmed by the odor of cannabis. “We had no idea weed had been legalized in Nevada” she said. “We smelled it everywhere.”

So did Judi Durand on a recent business trip in Arizona. She encountered the telltale aroma outside the Phoenix airport on the shuttle bus to the rental car area and even when she checked in to her lodging. “I didn’t expect to be in a family-friendly hotel in Chandler Ariz. and get a vague waft of marijuana in the room” said Ms. Durand who was visiting from her home in North Carolina (where the substance is not legal).“People are getting bolder with it” she said. “It’s not very fair.”",,,

Family Reunited With Dog 8 Years After Pet Went Missing,"Two Indiana women are thanking modern technology for helping them reunite with their beloved dog eight years after he went missing.

Cara Seiler and Kailey Kuntz first adopted Kemo a Blue American Bulldog/Pitbull mix as a puppy. Unfortunately the happy family was separated when the pup disappeared in 2013 when he was just 2 years old.

""We had always hoped. We never really stopped looking"" Seiler told ABC21 this week. ""We were always watching 'Found Pet' posts all over just to see if any might have been him.""

On Tuesday the pair got the call they had been anxiously awaiting for nearly a decade: Kemo had been found!

""And I'm like 'What? What do you mean they have Kemo?'"" Seiler exclaimed. ""He's like 'They have Kemo. You have to call them.'""

Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control/Facebook/Facebook

In a Facebook post on Wednesday Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control said Kemo was brought to the facility as a stray. It was only when the dog was scanned for a microchip that the incredible discovery was made.

Seiler said the two cried ""all the way from Auburn to Fort Wayne.""

""I can't describe it. I can't"" Seiler told ABC21 of the moment they reunited. ""And he knew who we were the second we walked through the door. So that's what made it even more surreal.""

""We are over the moon happy that Kemo was finally reunited with his family! This was such a heartwarming moment to watch and we're so glad Kemo had a microchip to make this moment possible"" the shelter wrote on Facebook.

Holly Pasquinelli of the FWACC said this reunion is the longest she has seen at the center due to a microchip and that the staff was pleased to help bring Kemo and his owners back together.

""We were just so happy that this dog that had been missing that they'd probably given up hope on was finally able to make his way back home"" Pasquinelli told ABC21 via video call.

While Kemo was missing Seiler and Kuntz began their own animal rescue in Waterloo called ""Canine Haven."" All rescues brought to the facility are microchipped so families can reunite with lost pets like them.

The FWACC also encourages pet owners to microchip their furry friends.

""We hope this story inspires anyone who is missing a pet to never give up hope! We also urge everyone to please get your pets microchipped just in case they were to ever get lost"" the shelter wrote in their Facebook post.

""It is just such an important thing to get your pets microchipped because it's a permanent form of identification that will never fall off never go missing and never leave"" Pasquinelli told ABC21.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkY2V4ZWMuY29tL3NvdXJjaW5nLXByb2N1cmVtZW50L2FydGljbGUvMjE1MDkyNzMvcmFua3Bhay1maW5kaW5nLWRpYW1vbmRzLWluLXRoZS1yb3VnaC1vZi10aGUtZ2xvYmFsLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finding Diamonds in the Rough of the Global Supply Chain,"There has never been a time when supply chains have been more challenged than right now. A simple glance at recent annual reports and earnings statements often reveals more mentions of supply chain disruptions and logistics challenges than product or service innovations. Even consumers facing regular shortages of many of the products they demand are hearing the term “supply chain” uttered in casual conversations frequently. It is more than fair to say the pandemic has created a level of stress on manufacturing and distribution systems that is unmatched.

But while that kind of intense pressure can lead to traumatic strains over the short term it can also lead to systemic improvements over the long term. Pressure over time can create gems the kind of brilliant discoveries that add tremendous value to business – ultimately making them more economically and environmentally sustainable.

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis could ultimately result in a greater strengthening of the supply chain. Companies who witnessed systemic shortcomings and are willing to embrace change may emerge stronger.

Here are several key indications that this is already happening.

Awareness is growing. We need to address the constraints

An Ernst & Young survey of 200 senior supply chain executives found that in the wake of the pandemic many plan to overhaul their strategies in order to become “more resilient [and] collaborative” without compromising on efficiency. More companies are thinking about diversifying their vendor base localizing more of the supply chain and investing in their infrastructure. And nearly two-thirds of the executives said the pandemic accelerated the supply chain’s adoption of digital technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic process automation which can increase real-time responsiveness and predictability.

Put simply the awareness of supply chain management has increased exponentially and this awareness and focus will result in new levels of innovation.

Environmental sustainability is at the forefront. Take care of the planet

Last year’s surge in e-commerce activity brought a greater level of attention to packaging and its impact on the environment. Plastic packaging now accounts for almost half of the plastic waste polluting oceans and filling landfills and consumers have taken note. A January survey conducted by Ranpak with The Harris Poll found that more than two-thirds of Americans (68%) are more likely to purchase from retailers who offer plastic-free packaging options and 72% are more likely to purchase from brands that ship sustainably.

The pandemic has only increased focus on sustainability. Companies can make this behavioral adjustment now which will not only provide positive environmental impact but also better serve their customer’s needs and interests.

Automation is benefiting workers and companies. We must innovate

Automation can help develop and enhance the labor force rather than impede it. Talk of automation inevitably triggers fear of workforce reduction but that needn’t be the case. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. warehouse employment reached an all-time high of 1.25 million during the pandemic. And the shift to e-commerce shows no sign of abating post-pandemic accelerating the need for automation to help facilitate around-the-clock operations and find room for efficiency improvements. Advancements in productivity will help streamline labor management and reallocate employees to high-value roles.

And of course automation can deliver revolutionary advancements.

Logistics are becoming more visible and prestigious. Don’t waste this opportunity

Think about the toilet paper shortage early in the pandemic the cargo ship blockage of the Suez Canal the freezing cold winter in Texas or the cyberattacks on packaging companies and the news headlines generated about the impacts of these stories on global supply chains. Typically much of the work done by the logistics industry is invisible to end consumers. Now consumers have become more aware of the capabilities importance and challenges of keeping products flowing through the global supply chain. This top-of-funnel attention can bring more cachet to what is now (and really has always been) such a crucial part of the business management process. This improvement in visibility can and will attract greater levels of talent and investment that will yield new technologies and solutions.

It’s often hard to think positively in the midst of chaos. The struggles of the last 18 months are still with us. Despite this remain confident about how forward-thinking companies are responding productively learning valuable lessons and reinventing themselves to face the challenges that lie ahead. Operational diamonds aren’t easy to find but their emergence from pressure represent real breakthroughs. For today’s global supply chains the best times are ahead.",,,,,,,,,

The new technique is called “speech neuroprosthesis” that on trial enabled a man who has speech paralysis to communicate in sentences effectively. The Speech Neuroprosthesis is an implant that translates brain signals to the vocal tract into words that write on a screen.

The Speech Neuroprosthesis is a commendable achievement of efforts harnessed over a decade by UCSF neurosurgeon Edward Chang MD. The technology has been approved through a successful clinical trial helping a man with speech paralysis unable to speak independently now express on a digital screen via the brain transplant. Research has appeared on July 14 2021 on the UCSF website publishing research news.

Science has been chasing the human mind for centuries. For ages scientists have been fighting tooth and nail to decode the human brain. While this breakthrough in speech paralysis through Speech Neuroprosthesis is not about decoding the elusive dreaming mechanism it is a powerful demonstration of science capturing brain activity in the most impactful way.

According to Dr. Chang “To our knowledge this is the first successful demonstration of direct decoding of full words from the brain activity of someone who is paralyzed and cannot speak.” Senior author on the study Joan and Sanford Weill Chair of Neurological Surgery at UCSF Jeanne Robertson Distinguished Professor believes that the technology will restore communication by connecting with the brain’s natural speech machinery.

Earlier communication neuroprosthetics focused on spelling-based approaches to type out letters one-by-one in text. But in this new development Dr. Chang’s focused on speech-muscle controlling signals. His team focused on how a person could wholly articulate in a sentence. The new development has advanced from monitoring hand-movement signals that enable typing.

Globally thousands of people lose the ability to talk owing to several conditions such as but not limited to stroke accident or disease. Dr. Chang’s Speech Neuroprosthesis approach taps into speech’s natural and fluid aspects and promises more rapid and organic communication. As development continues his approach as described in this study could soon restore normal communication among those affected by speech paralysis.

In the conventional spelling-based approach articulation takes a longer time. In general typing or writing processes a lot more time than speaking. Patients affected by speech paralysis are forced to write and those who are fully paralyzed have to work too hard to follow the spelling-based approach. With Speech Neuroprosthesis patients affected by speech paralysis or fully paralyzed have equal opportunity to express.

Patients at the UCSF Epilepsy Center volunteered to help Dr. Chang and his team record their brains’ speech patterns using electrode arrays. A good outcome encouraged the new trial with people with paralysis. So at the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences Chang and his colleagues mapped the cortical activity patterns connected to the vocal tract producing consonants and vowels which Dr. David Moses studied to recognize in words through statistical modeling of the language improved accuracy.

Since the study began with volunteers with epilepsy but who could talk there was no guarantee of any success with decoding complex human speech mechanisms particularly with those affected by speech paralysis. The team developed machine learning models to map complex brain activity to intended speech to achieve the breakthrough. Additionally for people with speech paralysis who didn’t move their vocal muscles for years to map brain signals moving those muscles was a dare.

So the trial began with testing the technology with patients with paralysis. Dr. Chang partnered and associate professor of neurology Dr. Karunesh Ganguly launched “BRAVO” (Brain-Computer Interface Restoration of Arm and Voice). A brainstem stroke candidate in his late 30s who had lost connection between his brain and his vocal tract and limbs volunteered. For anonymity the candidate is named BRAVO1.

BRAVO1 worked with the entire team of researchers to create a 50-word vocabulary. These 50 words such as “water” “family” and “good” were recognized by Dr. Chang’s team using advanced computer algorithms. The 50-word vocabulary helped the team create hundreds of sentences for BRAVO1 to express his daily life without struggling with typing.

Dr. Chang and his team surgically implanted a high-density electrode array over BRAVO1’s speech motor cortex. Then as the patient regained sense over 48 sessions and several months they achieved a 22-hour recording of his brain’s neural activity. The implanted electrodes recorded brain signals from BRAVO1 ‘s speech cortex using those 50 words in the sessions. The neural network models then distinguished the subtle speech patterns and decoded words one by one on a screen.

Once the team established decoding words they progressed to prompting BRAVO1 to answer questions such as “How are you today?” or “Would you like some water?” BRAVO1’s responses such as “I am very good” or “No I am not thirsty” appeared on screen and that too at a rate of 18 words per minute with up to 93 percent accuracy (75 percent median). The technology used the “auto-correct” function in that modeling to help BRAVO1 express with great accuracy.

A study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials might give you pause about getting your morning coffee from anywhere but your home.

In it researchers Ved Prakash Ranjan Anuja Joseph and Sudha Goel from the Indian Institute of Technology determined that drinking hot beverages from paper cups can release 25000 micron-sized plastic particles into your drink after just 15 minutes. These potentially harmful materials are apparently invisible to the naked eye.

What’s wrong with drinking coffee from paper cups?

The authors estimate that an average person drinking three regular cups of tea or coffee out of paper cups daily ultimately exposes themselves to 75000 micro-plastic particles.

“Disposable paper cups are popular for consuming beverages. These paper cups have an interior that is laminated with a hydrophobic film made of mostly plastic (polyethylene) and sometimes of copolymers” the authors wrote in the new paper. “The objective of this study was to evaluate the degradation of these films as a result of exposure to hot water (85–90 °C). Due to deterioration of the films ions like fluoride chloride sulfate and nitrate were released into the water contained in the paper cups.”

“We could confirm the release into the MilliQ water of microplastic particles using a scanner. A disposable paper cup exposed to hot liquid for 15 minutes will have approximately 10.2 billion submicron-sized particles.”



The results revealed that exposure of paper cups to hot water triggers the release of microplastics that contain heavy metals in them.

The plastic linings extracted from cups exposed to hot water were subsequently analyzed for changes in physical chemical and mechanical properties.

Four out of every five cups featured in the analysis were lined with HDPE grade plastic which means they were designed o resist chemical agents. Yet surface properties of the liners reliably deteriorated after exposure to hot water.



“Micro-plastics act as carriers for contaminants like ions toxic heavy metals such as palladium chromium and cadmium as well as organic compounds that are water-repelling and can cross over into the animal kingdom” the authors explained in a release. “When ingested regularly over time the health implications could be serious.

“This study shows careful consideration needs to be done before the promotion of replacements for bio-hazardous products and environmental pollutants” Institute director Professor Virendra Tewari says. “We have been quick to replace plastics cups and glasses with disposable paper cups.”

Although the authors can only theorize about the impact their findings will have on the long-term health of those who habitually drink hot beverages out of paper cups the team is concerned about the wide-spread use of these products in commercial markets.

For most vendors paper cups are simply a cheap alternative to potentiaally safer carry-wear.

“There is definitely a push factor from the companies that install and maintain coffee or tea vending machines that are ubiquitous in offices” a spokesman for the environmental charity Ecolife said on the back of the new report. “Apart from ingesting microplastics as outlined in the study paper cups leave behind thin plastics that contaminate the environment. Disposable paper cups do not decompose in a landfill and cannot be recycled. There is a continuous and growing demand for them that can only be met by further deforestation.”

The group assessed with “high confidence” that Beijing-linked digital operators carried out the attack that ensnared hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide a senior Biden administration official told reporters on Sunday.

In addition the partners alleged the ministry — which oversees the civilian arm of Beijing’s intelligence gathering operations — has utilized contract hackers to conduct other malicious cyber activities around the globe including a ransomware attack on an American company and other pursuits to line the pockets of MSS officials.

The use of such hired muscle “was really eye-opening and surprising for us” said the official who was only authorized to speak anonymously.

The coalition includes the U.S. the so-called “Five Eye” nations Japan the European Union and NATO. Monday’s announcement marks the first time the transatlantic alliance has condemned Chinese digital activities the official said.

The massive Exchange hack was first disclosed in March — at the same time the Biden administration was dealing with the SolarWinds breach that has since been formally attributed to Russia’s foreign intelligence service.

At the time Microsoft announced that it had uncovered new vulnerabilities in its Exchange Server program which runs businesses’ email systems adding the tech giant had assessed with “high confidence” that a hacking group known as HAFNIUM a Chinese state-sponsored group was exploiting the vulnerabilities.

The White House signaled late last month that it was getting closer to pinning the attack on a specific culprit.

The administration official said naming the offender took so long in part because of “new attributes” like the sheer breadth of the global campaign which impacted tens of thousands organizations across the U.S. alone.

The White House also wanted to combine the exposure with “network defensive information” such as malware signatures and other indications of compromise the official said. The FBI NSA and CISA issued a joint release that documented over 50 tactics and techniques the Chinese state-sponsored hackers use when targeting U.S. and allied networks and ways to mitigate them.

In addition the U.S. wanted to include its partners and allies in the attribution process and present a unified front in the face of Beijing’s efforts “which we felt was really critical to conveying our criticism and our concerns about the irresponsible malicious activities coming out of China” according to the official who added such concerns had been raised the country’s Communist government.

Monday’s announcement was markedly different from the one that accompanied the attribution for the SolarWinds intrusion which saw Moscow officially blamed and sanctioned in the operation that compromised multiple government agencies and private sector companies.

The official said the administration had made clear that it would take action to protect the country “no matter who's responsible and we're not ruling out further actions to hold the [People's Republic of China] accountable.”

“We're also aware that no one action can change the PRC behavior and neither can one country acting on them” the official added. “We felt like the core takeaway here is that we're making it clear to China that for as long as these irresponsible malicious cyber activities continue it will unite countries around the world” to call out the nation’s behavior and promote joint efforts on cybersecurity and network defense.

The administration official declined to offer additional details about the ransomware incident.

“It literally was what we think about with ransomware … a large ransom request made to an American company and it really raised concerns for us with regard to the behavior and frankly … with regard to the fact that individuals affiliated with the MSS conducted it.”

Coalition officials pinned the attacks on groups tracked as APT31 and APT40 by cybersecurity experts according to a press release from the UK National Cyber Security Centre. Supporting statements were also issued by NATO the UK government the European Union Council Australia Japan Canada Latvia Lithuania Estonia Slovenia Finland and Denmark.

Moments after the White House announcement the DOJ also levied formal charges against four Chinese nationals for their role in the APT40 hacking group.

Indeed Microsoft’s core software business remains the cash cow investors have relied on for decades. This core business has been extremely successful and is likely to continue its success over the long-term. Of note this business has provided growing recurring cash flows that have given Microsoft the ability to aggressively expand into other key businesses. (See Microsoft stock charts on TipRanks)

Among the two focal points many growth investors appreciate are cloud computing and gaming. After all according to the company’s recent financial results these two segments were among the fastest-growing of all the company’s core businesses. They’re the wave of the future. Unsurprisingly they’re also the segments investors care about right now.

Let’s dive into each of these businesses and discuss why growth investors still like this stock at this valuation.

Cloud Computing Key to Success for Investors in MSFT Stock

One of the key segments that investors in MSFT stock examine on a regular basis is Microsoft’s cloud computing division.

In fact Intelligent Cloud made up $15.1 billion of the $41.7 billion reported in overall revenue for Microsoft this past quarter. On a year-over-year basis this segment was up 23% a rather impressive growth rate for any business in this current environment. The results do make sense considering the boost cloud saw last year during the pandemic.

Truth be told cloud computing is so intertwined with Microsoft’s business model that it’s hard to break out an exact percentage of the company’s business that is truly derived from cloud. However the fact that Intelligent Cloud makes up more than 36% of Microsoft’s business speaks volume about the growth rate of this incredible segment in recent years.

As Microsoft looks forward toward a cloud-oriented data-driven future the company hopes its core products will continue to be chosen by consumers who have increasing discretion. Indeed investors seem to remain bullish on MSFT stock. Until the company’s growth rates in this segment slow there’s a lot to like about a bullish long-term outlook on this company.

Gaming a Meaningful Growth Avenue for Microsoft

Another key segment that doesn’t get as much attention from analysts is gaming. That said many argue that this line of business could prove to be crucial for the company over the long-term. In fact Microsoft has shown some impressive results in its gaming segment of late.

The company’s gaming business falls under the “More Personal Computing” category which made up approximately 31% of Microsoft’s overall revenue this past quarter. The company’s impressive growth rate in its Xbox content and services business of 34% suggests the pandemic-related catalysts that carried this segment last year are far from over.

Indeed as we all stayed home much more than usual gaming revenues ballooned recently. Investors expecting to see a meaningful decline this year in this segment have thus far been disappointed. For long-term investors in MSFT stock this is a great thing.

Moreover gaming aficionados have a lot to like about Microsoft’s upcoming Xbox Series X. This new gaming console’s specs are absolutely incredible. In fact many pundits are already crowning the new Xbox as the winner in the “PS5 vs. Xbox” discussion.

Of course time will tell how well these new consoles perform. However Microsoft has another interesting angle: the company’s approach to digital gaming. That is to say consoles may be great for near-term revenue generation but the company is looking forward to an even more digitally-oriented future.

According to a recent release from Microsoft the company is reportedly looking at embedding “the Xbox experience directly into internet-connected televisions with no extra hardware required except a controller.” Such a move would allow for the company’s Xbox division to move toward a streaming or cloud gaming model. If it works well with low-latency and impressive results Xbox and Microsoft could have the edge on a hyper-growth area of the gaming market.

What Analysts Are Saying About MSFT Stock

According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus MSFT stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 26 analyst ratings there are 26 Buy recommendations.

As for price targets the average Microsoft price target is $298.92. Analyst price targets range from a low of $270.00 per share to a high of $330.00 per share.

Bottom Line on Microsoft

There are so many reasons why investors like MSFT stock right now. For growth investors dialing in one’s focus on the company’s cloud and gaming divisions makes it easy to understand Microsoft’s valuation.

Microsoft is a massive company that continues to grow at market-beating rates. Until the company slows down MSFT stock appears to have a tremendous amount of room to run even higher.

The setup can become quite pricey once you throw in Microsoft's accessories but it's still an attractive and affordable entry point into the Surface line-up.

The Surface Go 2 is Microsoft’s second-generation entry-level tablet boasting Surface-level quality without the typically hefty price tag. But don’t let that fool you; Microsoft’s more affordable tablet still offers plenty of hardware to satisfy the more demanding tablet user. With Windows 10 onboard the tablet also boasts access to some of the best office and creative tools in the business.

Read on for Android Authority’s Microsoft Surface Go 2 review and to see if it can make the cut as one of the best Windows tablets on the market.

Upgrades over the original Surface Go include a larger display and a more powerful processing package. Like all of Microsoft’s Surface tablets the Surface Go 2 comes with a sturdy built-in kickstand. It was released in mid-May 2020 and is available from the Microsoft Store Amazon and many other retailers. See also: Android Authority’s guide to the best tablets

Core specifications offer a 10.5-inch display with 1920 x 1280 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio complete with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The Microsoft Surface Go 2 comes with either a dual-core 1.7GHz Intel Pentium 4425Y or 3.4GHz Core m3 8100Y processor. Both pack the same Intel UHD Graphics 615 although the latter offers a marginally faster 900MHz compared to 850MHz clock speed. All but the cheapest model come with 8GB RAM and a 128GB SDD rather than 4GB RAM and 64GB of slower eMMC storage.

On the front you’ll find a 5MP camera capable of 1080p video flanked by a Windows Hello face authentication camera array. This allows for fast secure tablet unlocking. There’s an 8MP camera on the back complete with autofocus and 1080p video capabilities. The Surface Go 2 is bundled with a 24W Surface Connector charger in the box but the tablet can also be charged over USB-C via USB Power Delivery at up to 45W.

Microsoft rounds out the feature set with Bluetooth 5.0 Wi-Fi 6 a headphone jack ambient light sensor microSDXC card reader a dual-speaker and mic setup and a USB-C port. There’s also firmware TMP onboard an essential component for a free upgrade to Windows 11. The most expensive model includes 4G LTE bands for data on the go via physical SIM or eSIM.

Like its predecessor the Surface Go 2 runs Windows 10 S Mode which limits you to downloading applications from the Microsoft Store and using the Edge browser. This can be upgraded to a full version of Windows though this is a one-way deal. You can go back but only by downloading the Recovery Image and factory resetting the device.

The Microsoft Surface Go 2 is available exclusively in a Platinum colorway. Your main customization options come from the Surface Go Type Cover. This is available for $129.99 in Ice Blue Poppy Red (pictured) Platinum and Black color options.

What’s good?

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

We tested the 8th Gen Intel Core m3 processor 8GB RAM variant of the Surface Go 2 and performance is rock solid for word processing multi-tab web browsing and the like. Intel’s integrated mobile graphics supports an external 4K display I connected via USB-C without lag. Very handy for improving productivity versus the tablet’s small display. It’s also powerful enough to run some less demanding new titles and older games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim at playable frame rates although this definitely isn’t a gaming-oriented device.

Unlocking the tablet using facial recognition is also blazingly fast. It feels even snappier than the first-gen premium-tier Surface Pro X I’ve been using for a while. The setup process is simple and as it’s based on infrared depth mapping is far more secure than the basic face-unlock technology you’ll find on other laptops and smartphones.

On the subject of cameras the front-facing webcam is great for video calls and the like. It offers a wide enough field of view and handles bright backlights and HDR environments well so your calls won’t look washed out. However you won’t find every video conferencing app on the Microsoft Store. See Zoom for example.

The Surface Go 2 is a brilliant little tablet that's powerful enough for work in a pinch.

While quite pricey the Surface Go Type Cover is a nicely built keyboard/cover combination. Despite the thin profile key travel is reasonable and the trackpad is very responsive. It feels like a necessary accessory for the tablet as it vastly improves web browsing and document editing while also offering screen protection when porting the tablet around. My only complaint is that the keys are a little sticky and loud. It’s definitely not a replacement for a sturdier office keyboard but serves its purpose well enough.

Overall the Surface Go 2 is a brilliant little entertainment tablet with access to the best Windows applications. It’s powerful enough for work in a pinch as well.

What’s not so good?

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Although the Surface Go 2 version I used comes with a 128GB SSD only 73GB is actually free once you take into account the Windows OS and other pre-installed Microsoft apps. That’s not a lot of space for your own applications and media files. This storage limitation will be even tighter on the more affordable 64GB eMMC storage model. Although there’s the option to add in a microSD card for more storage this format isn’t really suitable for apps.

Speaking of software Windows 10 Home in S Mode is fine for basic use and can be removed at will but it’s an irritating obstacle for installing your favorite games multimedia and even an alternative web browser. Microsoft shouldn’t be trying to insinuate that software downloaded from outside its ecosystem is inherently less safe. Also remember you can’t go back to S Mode unless you factory reset the tablet.

I’m also not convinced by the tablet’s battery life. Microsoft advertises 10 hours of use but this doesn’t seem achievable unless you go offline and turn the screen brightness right down. In reality four to six hours of screen-on time is more realistic. That’s still solid enough battery life for lighter use cases but this tablet doesn’t offer multi-day use and fades fast when you throw heavier workloads at it.

This so-so battery life might explain Microsoft’s decision to stick with a 60Hz refresh rate display. This specification is a little underwhelming compared to rival tablets like the iPad which have adopted 120Hz panels. While fine in the cheaper model I would have liked to see a higher refresh rate included with the Core m3 Surface Go 2.

Microsoft advertises 10 hours battery life but four to six is more realistic.

Finally pricing. While the base unit entry price is affordable the Microsoft Surface Go 2 quickly becomes expensive once you add in the pretty much obligatory accessories. You’ll want the Surface Go Type Cover ($129) to make web browsing and document creation more practical on the go. Windows just isn’t well suited to a touch-only experience. At the very least the Surface Go Sleeve protective cover ($69) will help protect the display if you already have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse ready to go. The Surface Pen ($99) is thankfully much more optional.

By the time you’ve added an accessory or two to your purchase the Surface Go 2 could cost close to $1000 at the high-end. As well-built as the Surface Go 2 is it certainly shouldn’t command an ultra-premium price so if you’re looking to spend that kind of money you’re better off looking at more premium alternatives.

Microsoft Surface Go 2 review: Should I buy it?

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

The Surface Go 2 is a fantastic little Windows tablet for entertainment and light workloads. The range offers a very affordable entry point into Microsoft’s Surface line-up and is one of the best value devices on the market right now. However the costs quickly add up once you add the keyboard cover and Office software — and those who want to do more than surf the web will want to spring for the Core m3 model too. So the real cost of ownership probably starts at closer to the $700 mark. Fortunately Microsoft offers an Essentials Bundle that works out a little cheaper than buying everything individually.

Microsoft’s Surface Go 2 isn’t the only powerful portable Windows machine out there at that price. Alternatives include Lenovo’s 2-in-1 IdeaPad Flex 5 ($690) and HP’s Envy x360 series ($699). The 2-in-1 market is certainly the place to look if you need a sturdier keyboard for work and play. At the higher-end Microsoft’s own more powerful Surface Pro 7 ($749) is a great machine although it’s Wi-Fi only. Related: Here are the best Microsoft Surface laptops and tablets

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and S7 Plus ($529) are noteworthy tablet alternatives if you’re happy with an Android device. Prices range from $580/€599 up to $899/€879 not including the stylus or cover. That nets you a fancy 11-inch 120Hz LCD display 256GB storage decent Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and optional 4G LTE connectivity. If you’re planning to spend money on the high-performance Surface Go 2 Apple’s 10.9-inch iPad Air ($599) fills a similar role in Apple’s ecosystem.

Microsoft Surface Go 2 Essentials Bundle The newest Microsoft Surface Go features a larger screen and more processing power than ever. Take your creativity anywhere with this Essentials Bundle that includes a type cover and Office 365. See price at Amazon

The team from the University of California found that immunization with either Pfizer-BioNTech’s BNT162b2 or Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced enrichment of spike-specific B cells.

The viral spike protein mediates the initial stage of the SARS-CoV-2 infection process and is the primary target of antibodies following natural infection or vaccination.

Ilhem Messaoudi and colleagues say that vaccination also activated CD4 T cells and induced robust antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cell responses.

Furthermore clonally expanded CD8 T cells were observed in all vaccine recipients.

A pre-print version of the research paper is available on the bioRxiv* server while the article undergoes peer review.

Vaccination and infection provide two different pathways to immunity

Since the COVID-19 outbreak first began in December 2019 in Wuhan China intense global efforts to rapidly develop effective vaccines against the causative agent SARS-CoV-2 have led to the emergency use authorization of several vaccines.

These include the messenger RNA- (mRNA) based vaccines developed by Pfizer (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273). Findings from clinical trials indicated that a 95% maximal protection is achieved within 1 to 2 months following the second dose of either vaccine including protection against several circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

However the mechanisms by which these vaccines elicit long-lasting cellular immune responses to the virus remain poorly understood.

Natural infection and vaccination provide two different pathways to immunity which studies have previously shown to be characterized by distinct T and B cell responses.

“Additional studies that integrate functional transcriptional and repertoire analysis of the memory immune cell response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination are needed” writes Messaoudi and colleagues.

What did the researchers do?

The team used single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays to assess humoral (antibody) and cellular responses to two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine (14 days following a second dose) in four individuals. The results were compared with the immune responses observed in three convalescent individuals who had experienced asymptomatic or mild infection.

What did the study find?

Both infection and vaccination induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies.

These antibodies were detected as early as two weeks following a first vaccine dose with levels increasing several-fold after a second dose.

While neutralizing antibody titers following the first vaccine dose were comparable to those among convalescent individuals significantly higher levels were observed in the vaccinees following the booster dose.

However several important B cell adaptations were shared between vaccinees and convalescent individuals.

Analysis by flow cytometry revealed a reduction in the level of naïve B cells but an expansion of memory B cells in both groups.

Additionally single-cell RNA sequencing showed a reduction in IgA+ memory B cells following vaccination a finding that has recently been described for convalescent individuals.

Immunological changes with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination (A) Experimental design for the study. Blood was collected from SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects before vaccination 2 weeks post dose 1 and 2 weeks post prime boost vaccination (VACC group) or in SARS-CoV-2 exposed but asymptomatic individuals (CONV group) before and after convalescence. Immune phenotypes of PBMC and antigen specific T and B cell responses were measured using multi-color flow cytometry. Longitudinal serological responses to the vaccine were measured using ELISA and neutralization assays. Memory T and B cells from a subset of PBMC samples (n=4/group for vaccine volunteers n=3/group for convalescent health care workers matched) were profiled using scRNA-Seq at the baseline (pre-vaccination or and post-vaccination time points. (B) UMAP projection of 32867 memory T and B cells with major subsets annotated. (C) Violin plots of key gene markers used for cluster annotations. Normalized transcript counts are shown on the Y-axis.

Vaccination appeared to establish durable memory and potential recall responses

Importantly the team observed a modest expansion of plasmablasts and a significant increase in spike-specific B cells just two weeks following a second vaccine dose indicating the establishment of durable memory and potential recall responses to infection.

Single-cell analyses also revealed an expansion of activated CD4+ T cells and robust spike-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cell responses following vaccination.

Frequencies of activated CD8 T cells were comparable between the vaccinated and convalescent groups. However natural infection induced the expansion of larger CD8 T cell clones including distinct clusters.

This is likely due to the recognition of a broader set of epitopes presented by the virus that is not found in the mRNA vaccines say the researchers.

“Our study highlights a coordinated adaptive immune response where early CD4 T cell responses facilitate the development of the B cell response and substantial expansion of effector CD8 T cells together capable of contributing to future recall responses” concludes the team.

The index climbed to a new intraday record high after the announcement.

Other stocks that helped push the Dow Jones to a record high included those that benefit from the reopening of the economy like United Airlines and Carnival. Bank stocks like Wells Fargo Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase also pressed the index higher.

Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) surges led by Apple big tech

October 12 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) climbed more than 300 points out of the gate this morning as Apple advanced on hopes about this week’s iPhone event. The jump in U.S. stocks comes despite a statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who said that talks over the next round of coronavirus stimulus have officially stalled.

She wrote in a letter to House Democrats that the White House’s proposal is “wholly insufficient.” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in their own letter to lawmakers over the weekend that they will keep negotiating with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

The Dow Jones’ (INDEXDJX: .DJI)’s gain this morning follows a strong week last week. The index posted its largest weekly gain since August last week and the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 had their best weeks since July. Investors are also getting ready for the third-quarter earnings reports which are slated to start rolling out this week with a number of airlines and major banks scheduled to report.

Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) slips as presidential debate approaches

September 29 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) slipped today after rallying on Friday and Monday due to renewed hopes that there would be another stimulus package. Today the index is falling ahead of the presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

Globally more than 1 million people have now died from the coronavirus and that’s serving to shake up global stock market indices as well. When Trump and Biden take the stage for their debate tonight they are sure to discuss the handling of the pandemic and plans for the economic recovery. The U.S. has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world at 7.1 million and the highest death toll at more than 205000 of any country in the world.

The debate could set the tone for the markets leading up to the November presidential election.

Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) declines amid economic uncertainty

September 18 2020 Update: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) fell 150 points before cutting its losses in morning trading today. U.S. stocks have been pressured by signs of trouble in the economic recovery and a fresh surge in coronavirus infections.

Today is also a quadruple witching day which means both options and futures on indexes and stocks are expiring at the same time. The result is volatility on the stock market. The phenomenon often results in above-average volumes due to the way traders are moving out of hedges on their futures and options contracts.

Other pressure on the Dow Jones is coming from the presidential election and Congress’ lack of a deal on further coronavirus stimulus measures.

Survey puts Dow Jones Industrial Average at 52k in 5 years

August 17 2020 Update: A new survey suggests the average investor is excessively optimistic—so optimistic in fact that they see the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) at 52000 in only five years.

MarketWatch reported on the survey which was conducted by money-management firm Schroders. The firm surveyed 23450 private investors in 32 different countries including 1500 people in the U.S. U.S. investors are even more investors than those in other countries.

The average investor expects stock prices to continue skyrocketing putting the Dow Jones at around 52000 after accounting for dividends. The average investor predicted a return of 15.4% per year for the next five years.

How The Dow Jones Industrial Average Works

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) has fallen off a cliff the past few weeks. The index is up almost 5% in trading on March 13th 2020 but that is still several thousand points below the recent high. The DJI is currently trading at 22188.26. Previously the Dow climbed to a new record high at 29408 in early February before pulling back not long after the market opened. However as the day rolled on the index flipped back into the green.

The Dow Jones was up about 84 points amid further progress in the trade talks between China and the U.S. China plans to slash in half its tariffs on some $75 billion of imported U.S. goods starting on Feb. 14. It’s the first step in the nation’s phase-one trade resolution with Washington. Tariffs on many goods will be cut from 10% to 5% while other goods’ tariffs will be slashed from 5% to 2.5% according to China’s Ministry of Finance.

INDEXDJX: .DJI: Previously

Commenting on today’s trading which saw the Dow Jones INDEXDJX: .DJI near 29000 Gorilla Trades strategist Ken Berman said:

It seems that the resilience of domestic stocks continues to be impressive. Indeed it only took a few days to completely erase last week’s scary sell-off. It wasn’t that long time ago that we celebrated Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) 28000 and thanks to today’s broad rally the industrial average got very close to topping 29000 and bulls already have the historic 30000 level in their crosshairs.”

The major indices all finished in the green for the second day in a row and the large-cap benchmarks also closed at their highest levels ever. Equities were boosted by the de-escalation between the U.S. and Iran. The Dow Jones (INDEXDJX: .DJI) was up 212 or 0.7% to 28957 the Nasdaq gained 74 or 0.8% to 9203 while the S&P 500 rose by 22 or 0.7% to 3275. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an almost 3-to-2 ratio on the NYSE where volume was slightly above average.

Even though the major indices finished below their intraday highs. This was due to a shallow afternoon dip. However all of the key sectors gained ground with even the defensive utilities edging higher. Tech stocks consumer goods and services were the strongest issues which is as healthy as it gets when it comes to bull market rallies. The relative weakness of small-caps was the only major red flag today. This was despite the fact that large-caps continue to hit record highs the Russell 2000 remains much weak from a technical perspective.

Dow 29000 I ndexdjx:.DJI this week?

The Volatility Index (VIX) hit its lowest level since last week’s airstrike. Additionally short interest continues to decline on Wall Street. Analysts agree that there is no lack of risk appetite among equity investors. That said we did have several short-lived pullbacks in recent weeks. These downturns ensure that the positive sentiment hasn't turned into exuberance. In fact the positive shift in global economic trends provided another boost for stocks just after the trade agreement between the U.S. and China. The lofty gains will eventually lead to a deeper correction until the bullish catalysts keep on coming. In the meantime the foundation of the rally remains solid.

Iran in focus

The traditional safe-haven assets such as Treasuries Silver and gold all declined today and the price of oil also continued to fall in the face of the improving economic outlook as the odds of a new military conflict in the Middle East declined. President Trump unexpectedly called for the resumption of the talks with Iran. While the hardliners in the Persian state called for revenge downplaying the effects of yesterday’s missile attacks. However the two sides seem to be steering away from a major conflict.

The government jobs report will likely steal the show tomorrow. Volatility could already spike higher in pre-market trading because of the release. All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls figure following last month’s blowout reading of 266000. This week’s bullish ADP payrolls number also indicates further gains. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 3.5% while hourly earnings are forecast to rise by 0.3%. As the global economy has been showing signs of life in recent weeks Treasuries yields could explode higher. Yields will follow if the U.S. labor market continue to show robust growth.

Dow (I ndexdjx:.DJI) 29000 next?

Technical Corner. Since the major indices all erased last Friday’s dip. It’s no surprise that technicals continue to be bullish across the board. Indeed not a single trend indicator flashing red. The major indices are still well above their rising 200-day moving averages of 8153 for the Nasdaq 2981 for the S&P 500 and 26817 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and now just shy of Dow 29000. Despite the late-day pullback the benchmarks are also north of their steeply rising 50-day moving averages of 3149 for the S&P 500 8682 for the Nasdaq and 28024 for the Dow.

Thanks to five consecutive bullish months Apple’s (AAPL) stock achieved yet another technical milestone passing the $300 per share level yesterday. Apple lost the title of the most valuable public company due to the IPO of the Saudi oil giant Aramco. However Apple took over Microsoft (MSFT) while crossing $1.3 trillion in total capitalization. The stock hit another record high today and it’s well above both its moving averages. However an orderly pullback of the INDEXDJX: .DJI could happen anytime. Apple is still likely to lead the way higher in 2020.

Younten Tshedup

To boost public confidence Prime Minister Dr Lotay Tshering will receive the Moderna vaccine as his booster dose at 9am today.

This would be three days ahead of the scheduled second mass vaccination campaign which starts from July 20. Lyonchhen will receive the Moderna vaccine along with a group of volunteers at the RBP flu clinic in Thimphu. He was the second person to receive the Covishield vaccine (AstraZeneca) on March 27 earlier this year.

In a news release posted on social media the Prime Minister was quoted saying “In addition to my professional understanding and scientific data this will help me share my personal experience with you all.”

Lyonchhen announced the government’s plan in his office’s Facebook page to go ahead with the Moderna vaccine as the second dose for those who received AstraZeneca as the first dose. However he said that AstraZeneca doses will also be made available as the second dose for those who insist on it for personal reasons.

Lyonchhen in the Facebook post yesterday said that all the Covid-19 vaccines that have received emergency use approval (EUA) were safe. Bhutan currently has four different types of vaccines at its disposal — AstraZeneca Moderna Pfizer and Sinopharm — which are all WHO EUA approved.

However he said that on the protection from the vaccines there was growing literature indicating better immune response in people who received mRNA (Moderna or Pfizer) as their second dose to AstraZeneca as their first dose.

He explained that while the heterologous regimen (mixing of vaccines) produced better immune response it did not mean the homologous mode (same vaccine for two doses) of vaccination were ineffective. “It is also valid to have same vaccine for the second dose.”

Given the sufficient doses the country had Lyonchhen said first-timers can receive either AstraZeneca Sinopharm or Moderna vaccines and for this group of people the second dose could be Moderna and Sinopharm vaccines in four weeks later or AstraZeneca between 12 to 16 weeks in homologous mode.

Heterologous options would also be provided based on availability he added.

The country has secured approximately 965850 doses of various types of Covid-19 vaccines including 60000 plus extra doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the first round.

The Prime Minister also said that the limited number of Pfizer vaccines (5850 doses) would be used to cover children between 12 and 17 years in high-risk areas of Phuentsholing and Samtse. The vaccines would also be used for those travelling outside for treatment and studies.

“While studies are underway we are also waiting for evidence to emerge in the coming days for use of Moderna in children below 17 years for which works are already underway to ensure timely vaccination” he added.

Mix-and-match is safe

There is growing evidence that mixing of Covid-19 vaccines was not only effective in triggering a robust immune response against the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus but it was also found that the side effects were almost the same as in the homologous approach if not less.

Of the many three studies conducted in the United Kingdom Spain and Germany found that mixing of AstraZeneca vaccines with a mRNA vaccine produced significant increase in the immune response in people.

People aged 18 to 69 participated in the clinical trials for the studies. It was also found that there were only mild to moderate side effects including headache fever joint pain and pain at the site of injection. No major AEFI (adverse event following immunisation) were reported in any of the studies.

Technically mixing of different vaccines has been happening for a long time now. The same heterologous approach is used in vaccines for malaria tuberculosis Ebola and some cancer therapy.

Some experts said that all the EUA approved vaccines for Covid-19 were made keeping in mind the initial strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus detected in Wuhan China. “No doubt the vaccines are still effective today. However the efficacy of these vaccines reduces when it has to fight new mutants like the Alpha Beta or the Delta variants” said an expert. “This is why the mix-and-match regimen is picking up in many developed countries where multiple variants of the virus have been reported.”

Lyonchhen said that people must consider getting vaccinated first rather than exploring the choice of vaccines. He said that the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus was more contagious which was why a high vaccine coverage was required to achieve herd immunity.

“We need to vaccinate an arbitrary minimum of 80 percent of the total population in the shortest possible time. This will give us the much-desired opportunity to reduce Covid-19 from the public health hazard status to an individual health problem” he said.

Lyonchhen said that vaccination and subsequently herd immunity was the only way to enter the ‘new normal’ era sooner. “However as we consider post-vaccination protocols the same restrictions will continue to be imposed on those who are not vaccinated given the risk they pose to themselves or others.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZiY25ld3MuY29tLmZqL25ld3MvY292aWQtMTkvbW9kZXJuYS12YWNjaW5lcy10by1iZS1yb2xsZWQtb3V0LWZyb20tbW9uZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna vaccines to be rolled out from Monday,"More than 150000 doses of Moderna vaccines have arrived in the country.

The vaccines came in as a support of the United States of America under COVAX Facility vaccine dose sharing mechanism which is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.

Head of Fiji’s Vaccination Taskforce Doctor Rachel Devi says 75000 doses will be used for pregnant mothers and the rest will be for the Suva and Nausori corridor.

Dr Devi says the Moderna vaccines will be utilized within a month’s time and will be rolled out from Monday.

US Ambassador to Fiji Tony Greubel says that he has communicated to Washington the dire need for Moderna vaccines.

Priorities for the Moderna vaccine are pregnant women in order to protect them from severe illnesses hospitalization and other consequences of COVID-19.

Those who will receive the Moderna vaccine will be fully immunized within 28 days."

The flamboyantly militant Chechen leader and his cronies famously clowned with a visiting Mike Tyson. He flew in former Brazilian soccer stars for a celebrity match against his own private team. And he hired Hollywood stars for his 35th birthday.

His critics and perceived opponents have had less reason to celebrate a regime marked by alleged political assassinations kidnappings and other systematic persecution.

Rights groups describe Kadyrov's 14-year tenure as ruthless and oppressive petty and vindictive and serially abusive of women and minorities.

But that hasn't deterred a local youth group in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina from adopting Kadyrov as the face of a summertime Chechnya Fest music festival that they say actually has nothing to do with Chechnya or its strongman.

They're using images of Kadyrov in full military dress in promotional materials on- and off-line to attract visitors to the festival in Bileca in the Serb-dominated part of the country on July 22.

""This isn't directed against anyone"" an organizer from the Jezerina Youth Group Vladimir Milidragovic told RFE/RL's Balkan Service. ""The festival is visited more and more each year and from 200 visitors at the first festival we reached more than 2000 [attendees] at the 2019 festival.""

""People of all nations come here"" he said.

Milidragovic said the festival -- headlined by ""DJ Terrible"" -- is humanitarian in its aim and proceeds will go to ""socially useful activities.""

Some of this year's money will go toward medical treatment for an unnamed local resident he said.

So why Kadyrov?

Kadyrov a ceaseless self-promoter on social media is inarguably Chechnya's most recognizable man.

But Bileca is not home to an ethnic Chechen community nor does it have any other obvious connections to Kadyrov or Russia.

Milidragovic said the Chechnya Fest's name stems from the way Bileca's other residents used to tease the ""once-naughty young men from Jezerina"" by calling them ""Chechens"" as a playful reference to the deadly serious rebels in southern Russia in the 2000s.

""We put it there but we don't have anything against anyone"" Milidragovic said. ""Since the first festival started seven years ago we haven't changed the name and it's stayed to this day.""

A promotional banner for Chechnya Fest was spotted on the highway between Sarajevo and the Adriatic Coast and its Kadyrov connection tweeted out this week by Montenegrin civic activist and publicist Ljubomir Filipovic.

Filipovic suggested it was even ""more disturbing"" that Trebjesa Brewery in neighboring Montenegro which is owned by U.S.-based Molson Coors Beverage Company was a sponsor.

Local representatives for Molson Coors did not respond to RFE/RL questions about the amount of the brewery's support for Chechnya Fest or its marketing association with Kadyrov.

Bileca is a town of about 10000 on the tip of a scenic lake in Republika Srpska the entity that along with the Bosniak and Croat federation makes up Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Its population is overwhelmingly Orthodox Serb up from around 80 percent in previous decades to over 98 percent in the 2013 census.

The town of Bileca is supporting this year's Chechnya Fest with a grant of 500 Bosnian marks (around $295).

Mayor Veselin Vujovic called Chechnya Fest's organizers all ""good Serbs and patriots.""

He also said he wasn't aware that they were using any widely criticized Chechen strongman to promote their event.

""If that's the case they'll have to change it without further ado"" Vujovic said adding that he didn't know who Kadyrov was. ""If that character is there they won't be able to put him on the posters.""

But after being told that Kadyrov is a longtime loyalist of Russian President Vladimir Putin the mayor said: ""Then that changes things.""

""When it comes to Putin there's no dilemma for me"" Vujovic said. ""I have personal sympathy for him because the man is a great leader.""

Putin appointed Kadyrov to lead Chechnya in 2007 three years after Kadyrov's Kremlin-backed father was killed in a bombing.

Last month Putin credited Kadyrov with turning a war-torn republic into ""one of the safest"" places in Russia.

""With your personal participation -- direct sometimes really direct personal participation -- indeed Chechnya has become one of the safest constituent entities of the Russian Federation"" Putin said in a videoconference last month to endorse another term for Kadyrov according to the Kremlin. ""It is absolutely perfect.""

Human Rights Watch's associate director for the region Tanya Lokshina described the endorsement of ""Kadyrov and his brutal Chechen regime"" as sending ""a grim signal about justice"" there.

She called Putin's characterization of Chechnya as especially safe is ""particularly cynical.""

She cited the abduction just last month by Chechen and Daghestani police of the daughter of a Kadyrov associate who was said to be fleeing harassment for her sexual orientation as well as other abductions and extrajudicial punishment.

RFE/RL and other media have reported in detail about waves of antigay ""purges"" in Chechnya.

The young men of Jezerina were warned there might be a backlash against associating an otherwise carefree cultural event with a purported serial rights abuser.

WATCH: Ramzan Kadyrov with Mike Tyson

""It started as a joke but I've suggested to them many times they they'll get negative publicity and a problem further developing the festival"" Nebojsa Rogan from the Bileca Cultural Center told RFE/RL. ""But they've been using it for six years and won't change the name or the way they promote the festival.""

He said the Jezerina Youth Group does a lot of good things for the community. They've built a children's playground and an outdoor fitness station there Rogan said in addition to other humanitarian activities.

But he said the ""Kadyrov"" marketing ploy is inappropriate.

""I don't really support that publicity or that style"" Rogan said. ""Some 'DJ Terrible' performs there and they have posters with Kalashnikovs and Kadyrovs and I don't know how to explain that.""

Mondelez International’s unit in the country Mondelez Philippines is the first Southeast Asian unit of the Chicago-based multinational to have its own “Pride Month” celebration in recognition of the LGBTQIA+ (lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer intersex asexual and others) community.

Not only is Mondelez Philippines the region’s pioneer in celebrating Pride Month its “Diversity Council” is also the first of its kind in Mondelez’ Southeast Asian offices which brings to the market Cheez Whiz Oreo Tang Toblerone Cadbury Tiger biscuits and Eden cheese.

In establishing and institutionalizing gender-based measures in the company Mondelez Philippines took its cue from its parent company. Mondelez International has become a global leader in promoting diversity and embracing the value of inclusivity in its campaigns.

One of its groundbreaking international diversity initiatives is Oreo’s “pride” campaign encouraging members of the community to “share your pronoun with pride” and inviting more people to become LGBTQIA+ allies.

Mondelez Philippines’ thrust to embrace diversity is anchored on the parent company’s commitment to “do what is right.” One of its corporate pillars is “building a winning growth culture” where every member of the team is treated with care and integrity.

“Since 2017 the commitment from the company is ahead of legislation it goes above the minimum of what is provided under the law” Mondelez Philippines people lead Aileen Aumentado said during a recent virtual media conference.

Noteworthy

One noteworthy policy is the inclusion of domestic partners of all genders in the coverage for HMO (health maintenance organization) benefits. Primary caregiver and single parent leaves “regardless of birth story” are also available to the employees.

“We also provide equitable pay regardless of gender. We focus on the merits” Aumentado added.

She said the company partnered with Philippine Financial and Interindustry Pride (PFIP) to further boost its diversity measures and ensure inclusivity in all of its offices.

Aumentado said they were promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace in their bases of operations in Metro Manila Baguio City and Cebu City to allow their members to bring their best and most authentic selves thus enabling them to greatly contribute to the company’s growth as well.

Chris Eugenio PFIP operations strategist said it was important to ensure workplaces remain diverse and inclusive so that they become hubs “for creativity and innovation.” Such an environment he added “promotes growth and an agile mindset.”

To achieve this he encouraged all companies to institutionalize SOGIE (sexual orientation gender identity and expression) education. “Make it part of standard corporate training and onboarding. Make it become part of everyday interactions” he added.

Eugenio also said companies must promote LGBTQIA+ visibility and representation across all levels of the organization.

“You do not just hire [LGBTQIA+ employees] but you should support and provide opportunities to help them succeed and thrive take management and leadership roles” he said.

Not a melting pot

For Mondelez Philippines country director Ashish Pisharodi their partnership with PFIP is important.

“We support diversity and inclusion because a truly inspiring workplace is one where each colleague retains individuality rather than conforming to stereotypes” he said.

“We are not a melting pot but a mosaic where we see all the components” Pisharodi added.

He said that when colleagues feel safe and confident to speak their mind it enriches the discussion because there is no bias or judgment.Mondelez Philippines prides itself in removing unconscious bias among the employees and keeping a “balanced” candidate slate for mid and early careers.

Supply Chain people lead Karl Sandoval attested to this.

“The fear was there. A male-dominated manufacturing unit is not easy to handle” he said acknowledging certain gender roles in his mind.

But during the recruitment he said the company acknowledged him for his individuality “instead of being part of a social group.”

Sandoval said he found a second home that brings out the best in him.

“They challenge me as ‘Karl’ not as a member of a social group” he shared.

Aumentado for her part said she was “proud that we are trailblazers. Mondelez Philippines is home of the best practices in many ways in terms of ‘people program.’”

She clarified though that the company does not set a numeric target for LGBTQIA+ members in the workforce. “It is more of the environment that allows people to thrive regardless of gender” she explained.

Microaggressions

For Sandoval workplaces should be sensitive to “microaggressions” against the LGBTQIA+ community the most common he said is “not using or promoting the preferred names and pronouns” which should be “very basic.”

As a foundational right in the workplace the right to a preferred name and pronoun affirm one’s gender identity he said. “The most common offenders are the ‘kuyas’ and ‘ates’ our support and maintenance staff because they don’t know any better” Sandoval said.

To address this it is imperative to inform the administrative and clerical staff about SOGIE sensitivity. “This is stemming out of ignorance they just don’t know” he added.

Another foundational right is the provision for inclusive amenities and facilities including restrooms.

Aumentado said Mondelez Philippines was embracing inclusivity because “we cannot express love to our consumers if we cannot express that love to our own people.”

Sandoval noted that Mondelez International is part of the Business Coalition for Equality in the United States and the Philippine unit’s initiatives in supporting the LGBTQIA+ community is all about “walking the talk.”

He however cautioned other companies “you don’t become inclusive overnight.”

Sandoval advised other corporations to take the time to establish the right foundations for diversity and inclusivity. “It’s all about listening and learning from the community understanding what their needs are” he said. —contributed INQ",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9waW5kaWEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvdmlyYWwtbWVzc2FnZS13cm9uZ2x5LWNsYWltcy1jYWRidXJ5LWNob2NvbGF0ZXMtaW4taW5kaWEtY29udGFpbi1iZWVmL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9waW5kaWEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvdmlyYWwtbWVzc2FnZS13cm9uZ2x5LWNsYWltcy1jYWRidXJ5LWNob2NvbGF0ZXMtaW4taW5kaWEtY29udGFpbi1iZWVmL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact Check: Viral message claims Cadbury Chocolates contain beef company says its products in India are vegetarian,"A message is going viral on social media which claims that Cadbury chocolates contain beef. A screenshot from a website is being circulated on social media platforms that says that if a product contains gelatine as an ingredient that means it was derived from beef. Several people shared this screenshot to claim that Cadbury products sold in India contain beef. But the company says that the message is misleading as it does not relate to India and its products sold in India do not contain any beef or any other meat-based ingredients.

Many people also tagged the official handles of the company to clarify on the issue and the company replied to them informing that screenshot shared by them is not related to Mondelez products manufactured in India. Mondelez International is the American company that owns the British company Cadbury now.

“All the products manufactured and sold in India are 100% vegetarian. The green dot on the wrapper signifies that” the company stressed.

Hi Madhu the screenshot shared in the Tweet is not related to Mondelez products manufactured in India. All the products manufactured and sold in India are 100% vegetarian. The green dot on the wrapper signifies that. -1/n — Cadbury Dairy Milk (@DairyMilkIn) July 18 2021

The company also requested people to verify facts related to their products before sharing them further. “As you can well imagine negative posts like these damages consumer confidence in our well-respected and loved brands” the company responded to Twitter users who were spreading the viral claim.

Although the screenshot is indeed from a Cadbury website the company is right when it says that it is not related to products sold in India. The screenshot contains the URL of the site which is Cadbury.com.au which means it is the website of the Australia unit of the company as .au is the country code top-level domain for Australia.

The webpage shared in the viral message is available at the Halal section of the website which means that it is talking about products sold in Australia.

This is not the first time the confectionary company had to respond to rumours about the ingredients of its products. People keep alleging from time to time that its popular chocolates contain beef. However the packaging of its products contains a green dot which means that it does not use any non-vegetarian ingredients. They only use plant-based and milk-based ingredients.

For example the ingredients of Dairy Milk are listed as Sugar Milk Solids Cocoa Butter Emulsifiers apart from added flavours.

Therefore it can be concluded that the products of Cadbury in India do not contain gelatine derived from gelatine the viral message used information from Cadbury in Australia to claim it relates to India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljd29ybGQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NhZGJ1cnktY2xhcmlmaWVzLW92ZXItYmVlZi1yb3ctc2F5cy1wcm9kdWN0cy1zb2xkLWluLWluZGlhLWRvbnQtY29udGFpbi1nZWxhdGluZS_SAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXB1YmxpY3dvcmxkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYWRidXJ5LWNsYXJpZmllcy1vdmVyLWJlZWYtcm93LXNheXMtcHJvZHVjdHMtc29sZC1pbi1pbmRpYS1kb250LWNvbnRhaW4tZ2VsYXRpbmUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cadbury clarifies over beef row says 'products sold in India don't contain gelatine',"Advertisement

However refuting the claim Mondelez which sells Cadbury said that the screenshot is not related to products manufactured in India. Also the screenshot which is going viral shows the Cadbury Australia website and not Cadbury India.

I was struck by this observation from Ron Carucci in his HBR article last month on returning to the office:

“If the transition to WFH wasn’t challenging enough the transition back to the office may prove even more difficult.

“Our brains will be looking for familiar routines to “return” to that simply won’t be there. And when that happens our brains will have to expend extra energy to adjust on the fly. This transition will invite us all to bring the best versions of ourselves back to the office and reveal how the pandemic made us even stronger. Knowing that your role as the team’s leader is uniquely important in helping others traverse this with hope kindness and patience to make sure those are the versions that actually show up.”

Ron cites a recent Harvard study that found that 81% of people either don’t want to go back to the office or would prefer a hybrid schedule going forward. Of those 27% want to remain working remotely full-time and 61% want to work from home two to three days a week.

Separate from the obvious benefits of schedule flexibility and a barefoot commute one in three felt that both their overall performance and quality of work was better than the previous year and one in three were able to better focus on work from home.

This return hesitancy is sparking friction as businesses figure out the new normal most prominently in financial services.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman recently warned he would be “very disappointed” if workers aren’t back in the office by Labor Day. And if they’re not he threatened “then we’ll have a different kind of conversation.” Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are taking a similar hardline tack.

UBS Bank in contrast will allow two-thirds of employees to permanently adopt a hybrid schedule. Citigroup made a similar announcement.

Independent of how much the future of work takes place in a traditional office it’s a good time to re-consider the role that the office plays.

Is it an office worth returning to?

Here are a few related cartoons I’ve drawn over the years:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcG9ldHNhbmRxdWFudHMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTgvdG9wLW1iYS1lbXBsb3llcnMtYXQtMjQtbGVhZGluZy11LXMtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc2Nob29scy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top MBA Employers At 24 Leading U.S. Business Schools,"Who really hires the most MBAs at the leading business schools in the U.S.? Sure you know McKinsey Bain and BCG are there and so is Amazon and Google. But who else? And what percentage of the graduating class at top MBA programs are actually hired by these firms?

In a rare and exclusive look at elite MBA employment we present the top ten employers of MBA graduates at 24 of the leading business schools over the past three years. Only a few business schools disclose a ranked listing of top employers and when they do the schools limit those lists to a single graduating class. Now for the first time an extensive analysis of MBA recruits by Menlo Coaching the premium MBA admissions consulting firm has pulled the curtain back on exactly which firms are hiring in a big way from these schools. Menlo Coaching’s research team analyzed 51991 student profiles on LinkedIn to get to the bottom of it. To access the full report on all 24 schools from Menlo Coaching you can click here.

This latest analysis follows the look at top employers of Harvard Stanford and Wharton MBAs (see Who Really Hires Harvard Stanford & Wharton MBAs These Days) a report on where McKinsey Bain & BCG hire the most MBAs and a look at the MBA hires by Goldman Sachs JPMorganChase & Morgan Stanley.

THE MOST FREQUENT TOP FIVE EMPLOYER ACROSS 24 SCHOOLS? AMAZON

The data reveals some big surprises. For one thing notes David White a founding partner of Menlo Coaching the top employers are not the same as the top feeders.”In unpublished research we identified Deloitte as the #1 largest feeder company to the 24 U.S. MBA programs we analyzed sending around twice as many students as the runner up BCG” he says. “However Deloitte is only the fifth largest post-MBA recruiter across these same 24 programs.”

So which company is the most frequent Top Five employer? Amazon. “It made the list of the top five employers at every M7 school.” says White. “In total it was a top five employer at 22 of the 24 MBA programs we examined. Beyond Amazon Google was the other big tech company to appear frequently in the top five employer lists.”

Not surprisingly perhaps some schools are local favorites of companies. “Although the top five employers at most MBA programs are national recruiters who appear in the lists for many different MBA programs there are a few major employers with a regional recruiting footprint” explains White. “For example Dell was a top five employer at UT Austin McCombs and UNC Kenan-Flagler but not at other MBA programs and Microsoft was a top five recruiter only at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business.”

GEOGRAPHY MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME MBA EMPLOYERS

For prospective MBA students the real takeaway might well be this: ""Graduates can join McKinsey Bain or BCG even if they are not at a top-ranked school"" adds White. ""We examined 14 MBA programs outside of (M7 + Haas Tuck Yale). In those 14 programs all but two include one of McKinsey Bain and BCG as one of their Top 10 employers. For example UCLA Anderson and NYU Stern both have all three firms among their top 10 employers.""

Once you expand to looking at the top 10 employers instead of the top five Facebook pops up frequently as another tech recruiter alongside Amazon and Google. In Menlo Coaching's top 10 employers report you can see a larger number of employers who recruit disproportionately at MBA programs near their headquarters with pairs like USC Marshall and Amgen Emory Goizueta and UPS Rice Jones and ExxonMobil and Chevron) as well as Washington Foster and Starbucks.

The company taking the largest percentage of MBAs out of any one school among the top 24 is the Boston Consulting Group at Kellogg: BCG has hired 11.5% of Kellogg graduates in the past three years. The only other double-digit employer from a single school is Amazon which has hired 10.3% of the MBA grads out of Washington Foster in three years.

AT STANFORD GOOGLE TIES BCG AS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR EMPLOYER

Overall at the 24 leading schools McKinsey and BCG are the #1 and #2 employers respectively. Bain follows in fourth place. Amazon ranks #3 at 4.1% and represents the only non-consulting firm in the top five (see table below). ""The high placement rate at Amazon reflects its position as a highly desirable company for MBAs targeting tech"" says White. ""It also reflects Amazon's own interest in hiring MBA graduates especially outside the M7: Amazon is the top employer for UNC Kenan-Flagler UCLA Anderson Texas McCombs Michigan Ross UW Foster NYU Stern and Duke Fuqua (tied).""

Only one financial services company makes the top ten: JPMorgan Chase employing just under 1% of the graduates in tenth place.

McKinsey Bain and BCG maintain their attraction for MBA graduates from M7 programs. Indeed for all M7 programs MBB ranks at the top (though Google ties BCG at Stanford's #3 according to Menlo's analysis. ""In addition to the clear relationship between M7 attendance and placement at an MBB firm listings for programs outside the M7 reveal strong placement rates at the Big Four strategy consulting firms or Deloitte PwC KPMG and EY-Parthenon"" adds White. ""Placements at Deloitte and EY-Parthenon are especially high across the board.""

FSS Yuanta Morgan Stanley raise questions about valuation



By Park Jae-hyuk



Kakao's ambitious plans to list Kakao Bank and KakaoPay on the benchmark KOSPI market in August are facing growing doubts recently from financial regulators and securities analysts who regard the valuations of the IT firm and its financial subsidiaries as overestimated.



On Friday the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) asked KakaoPay to correct its prospectus submitted July 2 saying that the document may hinder reasonable investments or cause a serious misunderstanding for investors.



""As a result the overall stock issuance schedule may change so we hope investors take this into account"" KakaoPay said in its regulatory filing.



The mobile payment service provider was planning to go public on Aug. 12.



Selecting three foreign financial platform operators ― America's PayPal Square and Brazil's PagSeguro ― as its comparable companies it has sought to price its stock at somewhere between 63000 won ($55) and 96000 won so that its market capitalization can reach up to 12.5 trillion won.



The FSS declined to disclose which parts were specifically problematic in KakaoPay's prospectus but its request has been interpreted by many as an order to lower the target price range given that Krafton and SD BioSensor both of which had also selected firms based abroad as their comparable companies lowered their target price ranges after the financial watchdog asked them to correct their prospectuses.



KakaoPay has yet to confirm whether it will lower its target price range and delay its initial public offering (IPO).

Indeed Microsoft’s core software business remains the cash cow investors have relied on for decades. This core business has been extremely successful and is likely to continue its success over the long-term. Of note this business has provided growing recurring cash flows that have given Microsoft the ability to aggressively expand into other key businesses. (See Microsoft stock charts on TipRanks)

Among the two focal points many growth investors appreciate are cloud computing and gaming. After all according to the company’s recent financial results these two segments were among the fastest-growing of all the company’s core businesses. They’re the wave of the future. Unsurprisingly they’re also the segments investors care about right now.

Let’s dive into each of these businesses and discuss why growth investors still like this stock at this valuation.

Cloud Computing Key to Success for Investors in MSFT Stock

One of the key segments that investors in MSFT stock examine on a regular basis is Microsoft’s cloud computing division.

In fact Intelligent Cloud made up $15.1 billion of the $41.7 billion reported in overall revenue for Microsoft this past quarter. On a year-over-year basis this segment was up 23% a rather impressive growth rate for any business in this current environment. The results do make sense considering the boost cloud saw last year during the pandemic.

Truth be told cloud computing is so intertwined with Microsoft’s business model that it’s hard to break out an exact percentage of the company’s business that is truly derived from cloud. However the fact that Intelligent Cloud makes up more than 36% of Microsoft’s business speaks volume about the growth rate of this incredible segment in recent years.

As Microsoft looks forward toward a cloud-oriented data-driven future the company hopes its core products will continue to be chosen by consumers who have increasing discretion. Indeed investors seem to remain bullish on MSFT stock. Until the company’s growth rates in this segment slow there’s a lot to like about a bullish long-term outlook on this company.

Gaming a Meaningful Growth Avenue for Microsoft

Another key segment that doesn’t get as much attention from analysts is gaming. That said many argue that this line of business could prove to be crucial for the company over the long-term. In fact Microsoft has shown some impressive results in its gaming segment of late.

The company’s gaming business falls under the “More Personal Computing” category which made up approximately 31% of Microsoft’s overall revenue this past quarter. The company’s impressive growth rate in its Xbox content and services business of 34% suggests the pandemic-related catalysts that carried this segment last year are far from over.

Indeed as we all stayed home much more than usual gaming revenues ballooned recently. Investors expecting to see a meaningful decline this year in this segment have thus far been disappointed. For long-term investors in MSFT stock this is a great thing.

Moreover gaming aficionados have a lot to like about Microsoft’s upcoming Xbox Series X. This new gaming console’s specs are absolutely incredible. In fact many pundits are already crowning the new Xbox as the winner in the “PS5 vs. Xbox” discussion.

Of course time will tell how well these new consoles perform. However Microsoft has another interesting angle: the company’s approach to digital gaming. That is to say consoles may be great for near-term revenue generation but the company is looking forward to an even more digitally-oriented future.

According to a recent release from Microsoft the company is reportedly looking at embedding “the Xbox experience directly into internet-connected televisions with no extra hardware required except a controller.” Such a move would allow for the company’s Xbox division to move toward a streaming or cloud gaming model. If it works well with low-latency and impressive results Xbox and Microsoft could have the edge on a hyper-growth area of the gaming market.

What Analysts Are Saying About MSFT Stock

According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus MSFT stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 26 analyst ratings there are 26 Buy recommendations.

As for price targets the average Microsoft price target is $298.92. Analyst price targets range from a low of $270.00 per share to a high of $330.00 per share.

Bottom Line on Microsoft

There are so many reasons why investors like MSFT stock right now. For growth investors dialing in one’s focus on the company’s cloud and gaming divisions makes it easy to understand Microsoft’s valuation.

Microsoft is a massive company that continues to grow at market-beating rates. Until the company slows down MSFT stock appears to have a tremendous amount of room to run even higher.

Yuan Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Zoom. “Zoom is built on a core belief that robust and reliable communications technology enables interactions that build greater empathy and trust and we believe that holds particularly true for customer engagement. Enterprises communicate with their customers primarily through the contact center and we believe this acquisition creates a leading customer engagement platform that will help redefine how companies of all sizes connect with their customers. We are thrilled to join forces with the Five9 team and I look forward to welcoming them to the Zoom family.”

“Businesses spend significant resources annually on their contact centers but still struggle to deliver a seamless experience for their customers” said Rowan Trollope Chief Executive Officer of Five9. “It has always been Five9’s mission to make it easy for businesses to fix that problem and engage with their customers in a more meaningful and efficient way. Joining forces with Zoom will provide Five9’s business customers access to best-of-breed solutions particularly Zoom Phone that will enable them to realize more value and deliver real results for their business. This combined with Zoom’s ‘ease-of use’ philosophy and broad communication portfolio will truly enable customers to engage via their preferred channel of choice.”

Zoom’s acquisition of Five9 is complementary to the growing popularity of its Zoom Phone offering. Zoom Phone is a modern cloud phone system that offers a digital alternative to legacy phone offerings enabling organizations to connect and interact in new and convenient ways to keep businesses moving.

The combination also offers both companies significant cross-selling opportunities to each other’s respective customer bases. As a result of the acquisition Zoom will play an even greater role in driving the digital future and bringing companies and their customers closer together.

Following the close of the transaction Five9 will be an operating unit of Zoom and Rowan Trollope will become a President of Zoom and continue as CEO of Five9 reporting to Eric Yuan.

That’s a possibility Congress could soon hear about when the FCC reports on the feasibility of making streaming services adopt the Emergency Alert System.

In the 1960s a predecessor system to the EAS was established to warn Americans to get into bomb shelters in the event of a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. Later all broadcast stations and cable and satellite operators were required to install and maintain the system. These days the EAS has shown rust.

Notably in January 2018 citizens of Hawaii woke up to the ominous alarm of a ballistic missile threat that proved to be a mistake. In the wake of this errant message and as part of defense appropriations legislation the FCC was directed to study improvements. “As climate change increases the frequency and seriousness of weather emergencies maintaining an effective emergency alert system has never been more important” says FCC commissioner Geoffrey Starks.

But what about streamers? How does one ensure that those bingeing Bridgerton get the message of say an incoming tornado?

In fighting the possibility of imposing emergency alert obligations for streaming services both the tech and entertainment lobby (even the Motion Picture Association has filed a comment) make two big points. First they argue it’s not necessary given the prevalence of mobile phones which receive wireless emergency alerts. Second it would be very costly to pull off. And in the engineering community there’s some debate about the challenges of focusing emergency alerts given the large geographic footprint of streaming services.

But perhaps the bigger issue is whether the FCC is going to start taking a more active role in ordering Netflix Hulu Disney+ and others around like broadcasters. A notice of proposed rule-making notes the agency hasn’t yet even defined “streaming services” with an invitation for comment.

“While it is interesting that the FCC is looking into EAS on streaming it is not a case where the FCC is looking to push its jurisdiction into regulating internet content” cautions David Oxenford an expert on communications law at Wilkinson Barker Knauer. He stresses that the FCC is merely studying the issue and won’t decide one way or the other but will just report its findings back to Congress. Still there’s the possibility of new legislation that makes streamers get with the government’s priorities — especially as politicians talk a big game about regulating Big Tech.

Netflix says it will restore the 100-year-old movie palace’s Egyptian Revival-style architecture renovate the interior and upgrade projection and sound equipment. But for many of Los Angeles’s most ardent cinephiles these promises don’t outweigh the streaming giant’s plan to allocate over half of the theater’s weekly calendar space to screenings of Netflix titles. After a number of delays due to the pandemic the Egyptian is now slated for a 2022 relaunch. A year from now the lobby may not be the only thing that looks different.

Run for over two decades by the nonprofit American Cinematheque the Egyptian had in recent years been losing money to the point that a sale was necessary simply to keep the lights on. Under the deal the Cinematheque — which in addition to running the Aero Theater in Santa Monica recently announced a programming partnership with the Los Feliz 3 cinema — will continue to program autonomously on weekends while Netflix will use the theater for their premieres and special events during the week. It seems far-fetched that the arrangement will somehow per PR literature allow the Cinematheque to “expand the scope and diversity of its widely praised movie and event programming” but it’s nonetheless preferable to the alternative; look no further than the fate befallen the recently shuttered ArcLight Cinemas and its equally storied Cinerama Dome.

“It was always a very tricky balance to keep [the Egyptian] functioning” said Gwen Deglise deputy director and co-director of programming at the Cinematheque in a phone conversation with Hyperallergic. She pointed out that “the American Cinematheque does not own the Aero” either (though it does have full control of programming) and that thus “it made more sense for the American Cinematheque not to own the Egyptian and to get the support of an organization that could keep the building in great shape and handle the seismic retrofitting that’s required by the city and state.”

Opened in 1922 by entertainment tycoon Sid Grauman the Egyptian played host to Hollywood’s first-ever movie premiere: Douglas Fairbank’s action-adventure picture Robin Hood. For the next six decades the theater was one of LA’s primary venues for classic and contemporary studio fare. (Grauman who had already founded downtown’s Million Dollar Theater would within five years go on to open both the El Capitan Theatre and Chinese Theatre along the same two-block stretch of Hollywood Boulevard.) After first closing in 1992 the Egyptian was famously purchased from the city for $1 by the Cinematheque which remodeled and reopened the theater in 1998 with the additional Spielberg Theatre screening room and a revamped programming philosophy that made room for international arthouse and experimental cinema alongside the theater’s familiar rotation of repertory titles from Hollywood’s Golden Age.

For Maggie Mackay executive director of the nonprofit film space Vidiots the Egyptian is “a place to see movies I’ve loved my whole life that I rarely get to see on a big screen with an audience” citing a 25th-anniversary screening of John Carpenter’s Halloween with Jamie Lee Curtis in attendance as one particularly memorable experience. With special events like this and fan-favorite genre festivals like Noir City: Hollywood and Beyond Fest an annual showcase for horror sci-fi and fantasy films one was rarely left wanting by the Egyptian’s eclectic screening slate.

No doubt among the most unfortunate aspects of Netflix’s planned renovation is the removal of the Spielberg room where Los Angeles Filmforum screened a wide variety of artists’ cinema for over 20 years. Tucked off from the theater’s front lobby the Spielberg which Deglise admits “never really worked for the Cinematheque” because of its small size and the attendant costs involved in keeping it operational was an oasis for adventurous outside curation. “[It] served a unique function” said filmmaker and archivist Ross Lipman whose 2015 documentary NOTFILM screened to sold-out audiences for a week in the Spielberg. “[It] was a small intimate space capable of all-format presentations. It was great for shows that were too esoteric for larger spaces but still merited a professional touch.”

As Adam Hyman executive director of Los Angeles Filmforum told me: “The American Cinematheque was really good to us with cheap rent for a good screening room of the right size for most of our audiences.” While Filmforum had lost calendar dates in recent years because of the Cinematheque’s financial needs Hyman said it “didn’t seem fatal.” It was only later when reading about Netflix’s renovation plans that Hyman knew the Spielberg’s days were numbered. By then he said “it was a done deal.”

While Filmforum has confirmed a new screening space at the revamped Bootleg Theater Hyman believes the loss of the Spielberg will affect more than just his series. “There will need to be a new space that can host 80 to 120 people for smaller festivals” he said noting that a number of key venues have either closed for good or have yet to announce plans to reopen after the pandemic. Paul Malcolm film programmer at the UCLA Film & Television Archive agreed: “The Spielberg is a loss full stop for an essential part of that community that I’m assuming now has to find a regular home again.”

Despite all this many in the community believe the Egyptian can still be a vital part of LA’s theatrical ecosystem which will soon welcome Vidiots’ Eagle Rock cinema as well as two theaters at the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. “It’s important to remember” Malcolm said “that [organizations like the Archive] are not separate from the community we serve and that our success depends on having a lot of different kinds of programming institutions all contributing their unique visions to the whole.” Lipman concurs adding that “if [the Cinematheque] can keep their programming intact and at a reasonable volume [at the Egyptian] — if this lets them stay solvent — I’m fine with Netflix using the theater on other nights and will be glad they stepped in.”

Not unlike their recent acquisition of New York’s Paris Theatre Netflix is now invested in one of LA’s most iconic cinemas — which questions of monopolization notwithstanding does preserve an essential part of Hollywood history. Said Mackay: “I wish that arts nonprofits especially those fighting to keep film accessible to the public and to maintain human interaction around cinema were better supported by government and public funding but ultimately it’s good news that we’ll still be able to go to the Egyptian that the building will remain and that movies still have a place in Hollywood.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbmV0ZmxpeC1nYW1pbmctcGxhbnMtbWFya2V0aW5nLWRldmljZS1mb3ItZW5nYWdlbWVudC0yMDIxLTfSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ldGZsaXgtZ2FtaW5nLXBsYW5zLW1hcmtldGluZy1kZXZpY2UtZm9yLWVuZ2FnZW1lbnQtMjAyMS03P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's gaming plans aren't really about creating video games,"Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings at a news conference in Toronto Canada on September 22 2010.

Netflix reportedly has major plans to add video games to its wildly popular streaming service.

Those games could arrive on Netflix as soon as next year according to Bloomberg.

But what kind of games should users expect? A Netflix job listing draws a pretty clear picture.

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

With over 200 million paid subscribers worldwide Netflix is an absolute behemoth.

The streaming entertainment giant has successfully transitioned from a scrappy startup paying to license content to a major player in Hollywood splashing out tens of millions of dollars on its own productions.

So what's next for Netflix? The answer to that question at least in part appears to be video games.

The company just hired former EA executive Mike Verdu to lead its ""Interactive"" department and a new Bloomberg report says the plan is to add games directly onto the streaming service. Those games would show up in the same app that you're currently using to watch the new season of ""I Think You Should Leave"" albeit as its own genre the report says.

But don't expect to see the latest ""Super Mario"" or ""Call of Duty"" games on Netflix anytime soon.

The goal with Netflix's gaming division is to ""create new types of stories and new product experiences"" a Netflix job listing says."" Those games will be overseen by the new Netflix ""Interactive"" department.

The game library is apparently intended as a marketing hook for the existing service rather than a reason unto itself to subscribe. The goal of games created by Netflix Interactive is to ""enhance and deepen member engagement"" the listing said.

We've already got a pretty good idea of what those games will look like as well as the job listing explicitly calls out a previous example of ""games"" that Netflix produced: ""Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.""

""Black Mirror: Bandersnatch"" offers viewers linear choices at pre-determined points in the story similar to a choose-your-own-adventure book.

Netflix



Viewers of the special ""Black Mirror"" episode can interact with plot elements using their remote control effectively changing the direction of the story and its characters.

Though it has game-like elements such as light interactivity and divergent storytelling ""Bandersnatch"" is unlike most video games in every other way.

That may not matter for upcoming Netflix Interactive games which are unlikely to compete directly with games on other platforms.

""The opportunity before us is to expand our slate of interactive innovations and capabilities including but not limited to new types of features game-like experiences and different ways of interacting with stories"" the job listing says. ""It's time to reimagine the future of entertainment yet again.""







Rather than creating traditional video games it sounds from the listing like Netflix Interactive aims to do something interactive that leans more toward the film world than the video game world.

Exactly what that looks like remains to be seen but it could arrive as soon as next year on Netflix: According to the Bloomberg report Netflix wants to have games on its platforms ""within the next year.""

""I do think they will try and do think they will fail"" Wedbush managing director Michael Pachter told Insider back in May regarding Netflix's gaming ambitions. ""It's hard to make games.""

Pachter's similarly critical of the possibility of Netflix making games so quickly.

He said there's ""no chance"" that happens in a recent episode of Bloomberg Quick Take: ""They don't have a team they're not capable of making games and the idea that they think they're gonna launch games next year is crazy. There's no chance they get anything made in the next year.""

(Port City Daily photo/Johanna Still)

CAROLINA BEACH –– A Netflix series is planning on heavily relying on the palm trees and southern coastal aesthetics of Carolina Beach to depict the sunshine state. One of its first scenes –– shooting this August –– portrays a bloody shark attack on the strand behind Seawitch Motel according to a presentation given to the town’s city council by the film’s locations manager.

“Florida Man” which received an eight-episode order from the streaming giant is expected to film sporadically in New Hanover County starting next month through Thanksgiving.

Starring Golden Globe nominee Edgar Ramirez “Florida Man” tells the story of an ex-cop who travels from Philadelphia to Coronado Beach Florida for a presumably quick gig. The job is to hunt down a mobster’s fugitive girlfriend but the journey is prolonged into unveiling “buried family secrets” and “an increasingly futile attempt to do the right thing in a place where so much is wrong” according to materials presented to the town’s council.

“We have an all-star cast and all-star crew that’s going to be affiliated with this so I think it’ll be another good experience for the town” locations manager Mike Hewett told council members Tuesday. “This is . . . a longer stay than the last show that was here [“Along for the Ride”] because we are eight episodes versus just one movie.”

Hewett said the production is eyeing sites in town for recurring locations in the show. The city hall will turn into the Coronado Beach police station. Seawitch Motel and Carolina Beach Yacht Club are also key locations. Other businesses to be featured include Seawitch Cafe Malama Cafe and Ocean Grill and Tiki Bar.

In mid-August the production is commandeering about 200 yards of beach for an all-day shoot backing Seawitch Motel on Carolina Beach Avenue. It is planning to depict a shark attack and will station up to six vehicles including emergency response vehicles and news vans on the beach.

“You know our show’s ‘Florida Man’ so it’s stupid criminals doing stupid things” Hewett said. “And ‘Florida Man’ getting bit by a shark is something that’s kind of funny.”

Carolina Beach unanimously approved the use of the strand noting the filming dates were around the slow down of tourist season. Hewett added the proposed shark attack filming location is also not as densely populated compared to the rest of the area cutting down on shoreline interruptions for beachgoers.

Netflix recently wrapped another project –– “Along for the Ride” –– that used the beach town as its main backdrop for the coastal-set movie. Tim Murphy the town’s recreation programs superintendent and community events coordinator told council in May several other film projects were scouting out the area.

Also in the Cape Fear Amazon’s adaptation of a Jenny Han novel “The Summer I Turned Pretty” is in pre-production.

Hallmark film “One Summer” is shooting at Elijah’s restaurant and Legion Stadium Pool in the coming week. The production also filmed scenes in Oak Island earlier this month closing down part of East Dolphin Drive.

FOX series “Our Kind of People” has taken out permits to shoot house party scenes at luxurious homes in the high-end Landfall community and on Wellesley Place later this month. The production is also seeking young adult extras especially people of color for a yacht party scene.

Several 2020 Wilmington-filmed productions have announced upcoming release dates including “Halloween Kills” on Oct. 15 “Scream” on Jan. 14 and “The Black Phone” on Jan. 28.

Film in 2021 is already estimated to have a $331-million financial impact on the state. So far it is the third-highest year in direct in-state spending since 2007.

Guy Gaster director of the NC Film Office indicated that number is bound to rise. He is predicting 2021 will exceed 2012’s spending record of $377 million by the end of the year.

2021 is also currently the third-highest year for job opportunities since 2011. Projects have created 20206 jobs; most of those are background extras.

“This will go down as one of our best if not the best year on record in terms of spending by productions in the state” Gaster said.

NEE,NextEra Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL29waW5pb24vaW93YS1pcy1pZ25vcmluZy10aGUtbW9zdC1lZmZpY2llbnQtY2xlYW4tZW5lcmd5LXNvdXJjZS1udWNsZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iowa ignoring most efficient clean energy source — nuclear,"Windmills are so common in Iowa that they are featured on our state license plate cementing the identity of the windmill in our community and in a mental picture of the Iowa plains. Solar panels have also become increasingly common as they can provide efficient small sources of energy for houses and farms with large roofs to host the panels.

The idea of solar farming fits into our state ethos as America’s producers and providers. Iowa’s farmers feed the world and our ethanol corn powers the country. It seems like a natural next step to venture into this new farming phase. However even though these clean energy initiatives are exciting one major piece of the puzzle is missing in our state — nuclear power.

Nuclear power plants hawd a 9 percent share of total U.S. generation capacity in 2019 but produced 20 percent of the country’s electricity due to their reliable energy output. Iowa until recently had only one functioning nuclear reactor hosted in a large building in Palo that employed about 600 people.

Duane Arnold opened in 1974. A larger plant in Vandalia as well as other locations were preliminarily planned but due to cost perceived risk and anxiety over radiation many plans were tossed out.

The plant director cited reasons for closing as the inability of the small plant to keep up with cheaper energy as well as cost of damage from the Derecho. It’s worth noting that there are considerable tax incentives for individuals and companies to install wind turbines and solar panels.

This decommissioned nuclear site will be the location of a large NextEra Energy solar farm spanning 3500 acres in Palo. The new solar project is expected to bring in a $700 million investment $41.6 million in tax revenue and around 300 construction jobs.

Let’s compare wind turbine power potential the most popular clean energy source in our state to nuclear energy: On average 3000 turbines have been built in the U.S. each year since 2005. Right now in the U.S. there are 68792 turbines with a total rated capacity of 121431 megawatts. Nuclear energy has by far the highest capacity factor of any other energy source. This basically means nuclear power plants are producing maximum power more than 93 percent of the time during the year. That’s about 2.5 to 3.5 times more reliable than wind and solar plants according to the Department of Energy.

That reliability is important because renewable plants are considered intermittent or variable sources and are mostly limited by a lack of fuel meaning sometimes the sun doesn’t shine or the winds aren’t very strong. In the future energy plants will likely be built with one renewable power source and one reliable power source like coal or nuclear power.

Duane Arnold is located near the borders of Benton and Linn County. Following the announcement of the plant closure an article ran in the Des Moines Register claiming there was finally hope for Iowans to have “less cancer” plaguing our communities.

Although I disagreed with the article's celebratory tone regarding the plant closure the numbers presented painted a scary narrative that at first glance seem rather alarming.

The author stated “In Benton and Linn Counties … the cancer rates in children age 19 and younger was 7% above the Iowa rate in the period before Duane Arnold operated.” And “from 2013 to 2017 the Linn County child cancer rate was 20% above the state's. … For Linn County residents under age 50 who lived near Duane Arnold most or all of their lives the cancer rate was 15% higher than the state.”

When looking into these figures a bit further we can see that Benton County is actually in the lower half of all Iowa county’s cancer incidence rate and Linn County’s cancer incidence rate is about in the middle of the pack. Palo Alto County hours north of the town of the nuclear plant has the highest cancer incidence rate in the state and there has never been a nuclear energy plant in that county.

Linn County is the second largest country in the state with convenient access to cancer screening facilities. Similar to COVID testing the more we screen for something the more of that disease we will uncover.

It’s good to locate and identify cancer for treatment of course but it’s worth noting that people who live in (relatively) proximity to a nuclear power plant might be more likely to be tested for cancer because of the perceived radiation threat even though they are not exposed to meaningful levels of radiation.

Furthermore there is evidence that higher background radiation levels are associated with slightly longer life expectancy according to a study by BGU and Nuclear Research Center Negev scientists. Background radiation is an ionizing radiation that exists in the environment from natural sources. It includes radiation coming from outer space and radiation from earth based sources. With higher background radiation levels life expectancy actually increased. This seems counterintuitive to the information we are fed from television shows and movies on radiation exposure yet it follows the still emerging science on nuclear radiation.

Now this of course doesn’t mean that people haven’t been seriously injured from radiation exposure from living next to nuclear power plants that disregard safety procedures. However there is solid evidence to support that living in proximity to a modern well monitored nuclear plant will have no negative effects on the surrounding communities.

Energy production is a collaborative and diverse field that’s becoming more tailored to community needs. Attaching solar panels on top of apartment buildings to stoplights and on houses is a wise way to take advantage of the sun’s energy but using Iowa farmland has a high opportunity cost considering the area could be used to produce food rather than the more unpredictable solar energy storage.

Fear mongering about nuclear power and romanticizing inefficient wind and solar energy for large scale use without other reliable sources is foolish. People who have a vested financial interest in producing and financing lower risk energy production are not reliable sources for Iowa’s energy planning. We need to follow science and lead with logic instead of fear of innovation.

It’s worked on everything from Doraemon to Gundam and next month it’s taking on Star Wars.

This is one of my favourite sneakers of all time the Presto Mid Utility (more famously known lately for its Acronym collabs) dressed in a colourway that is officially known as “Carbon Green/Black-Ghost-Pollen ” but which has already and predictably been labelled the “Boba Fett. ” But it’s not the only one. There are actually three pairs in this line coming all of them using the same shoe and all of them inspired by...that scene in Empire Strikes Back when Vader has all the Bounty Hunters lined up?

The second pair above are “Darth Vaders” (all-black is usually a winner but that silver heel might be a little much) while the third ( below) and potentially even nicer than the Boba Fetts are already known as “Bossk”:

Note that Nike does n’t have the Star Wars license. Adidas does  and they’ve spent the last few years releasing some over-branded corny as shit stuff that looks marketed purely to 9 year-olds and the comic book guy from The Simpsons. Nike’s shoes here are just for legal purposes a collection of sneakers that just happen to all h ave some very particular themes and colourways in common.

For Nike to come out like this and release a whole line of Star Wars-inspired shoes right at a point when Adidas’ efforts have been ridiculed by sneakerheads definitely feels like more than just a tribute it feels like a statement.

All three pairs are scheduled for release in November 2021 and being general release shoes might actually be pretty easy to get your hands on!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL3NhY2FpLW5pa2UtYmxhemVyLWxvdy1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sacai Nike Blazer Low 2021 Release Date,"Following the Sacai x Nike Blazer Mid collab back in 2019 both Sacai and Nike will be releasing another Blazer project this time focused around the low-top silhouette.

It’s always hard to predict where Nike will take the Dunk Low next. One minute they’re adapting “Be True To Your School” offerings; the next they’re celebrating Chinese New Year and Hawker culture in lavish gilded fashion. Today the silhouette arrives somewhere in the middle taking on numerous Autumnal hues in preparation for the season.

Appropriate to its “Cider” namesake the pair dons shades reminiscent of ale and breweries. The forefoot ankle flap Swoosh and tongue for example push a clean wheat suede while deeper browns sit adjacent along the lace unit toe cap and lining. A deep navy tone then sits right underneath loosely complementing the logo hits that dress a much brighter purple.

For a closer look see the leaked retailer images below. A release is expected to arrive late Summer or early Fall at tentative $110 USD price point.

Given more recent drama over a possible merger of Kansas City Southern with either Canadian Pacific or Canadian National one thing remains clear — almost four decades after SPSF we’re still not good at predicting the future.

Naturally I took this as a challenge. What might we see in the next 50 or so years? I talked with the greatest minds in railroading and then came up with some predictions of my own.

2022: Having lost its bid for KCS a desperate Canadian Pacific merges with Genesee & Wyoming. It clears the regulatory hurdles at the Surface Transportation Board when lawyers argue that the entire CP system will be converted into nine separately managed regional railroads so it’s “not really a Class I.”

2023: Amtrak reintroduces hot meals on its trains. Flavors include “Chicken Egg Noodles and Vegetables in Sauce” and “Vegetable Crumbles with Pasta in Taco-Style Sauce.” For extra convenience meals are pre-packed in weatherproof bags and are easily made hot thanks to the included heater element. Cost savings abound since Amtrak and the U.S. Army both use the same supplier for Meals Ready to Eat™.

2024: BNSF declares its entire locomotive fleet will consist of heritage units. Every locomotive will wear a one-off historically inspired paint scheme. While this may cause some marketing confusion it also cuts down on legal bills as any time there is an accident nobody knows what railroad to sue.

2026: In a bid to lower operating costs Norfolk Southern institutes one-horse crews on all trains.

2027: Union Pacific merges with Norfolk Southern. The new company name — Union Pacific.

2028: Only two years behind schedule luxurious high-speed rail opens between Southern California and Las Vegas featuring leather upholstered seats gourmet meals and three on-board cocktail bars. In related news Greyhound comes out of bankruptcy due solely to heavy demand for one-way bus tickets back to Los Angeles.

2029: CSX celebrates the 200th anniversary of the founding of Baltimore & Ohio Railroad by painting all its locomotives dark blue with yellow lettering.

2032: In a bid to prop up declining coal traffic BNSF hosts the world’s largest pit barbecue festival in Gillette Wyo. sponsored by Powder River Briquettes a Berkshire-Hathaway company.

2035: Union Pacific merges with United Airlines. The new company name — Union Pacific.

2038: Someone in Silicon Valley invents a new form of transportation that “bundles many passengers together into a single large vehicle that can move very fast along a fixed guideway.”

2039: Union Pacific merges with retail and logistics giant Amazon. The new company name — Union Pacific.

Late last summer after churning along through the pandemic with only a two-week pause managers at FreightCar America called hundreds of workers into the break area at the company’s factory near Muscle Shoals Alabama to tell them that the plant was closing for good.

For some employees the news wasn’t a shock: They’d been hearing rumors that management would move the work elsewhere for years. The timing however seemed odd. Only a few months earlier the publicly traded company had received a $10 million Paycheck Protection Program Loan — the maximum amount available under a pandemic relief program designed to keep workers employed. Some had believed the funds would keep the doors open for a little while longer.

Nevertheless the plant’s managers announced that all production would move to FreightCar’s new facility in Mexico which meant most of the assembled workers would lose their jobs.

Jim Meyer FreightCar America’s CEO told ProPublica in an email that he had not intended to shutter the plant when he received the PPP money and that it had allowed the company to keep workers on the job through most of 2020 despite a sharp dropoff in new orders.

Robert Bulman however thinks the $10 million just helped FreightCar’s Shoals plant keep producing while company officials got ready to shut it down.

“When the Mexican plant opened we were told at the beginning they would just be helping Shoals and making parts for the trains” said Bulman who worked at the Alabama plant for seven years before getting laid off last year. “But the whole time it was a setup we were gone.”

FreightCar America isn’t the only large company to have taken out a multimillion-dollar Paycheck Protection Program loan and then laid off a substantial chunk of its workforce. An analysis of applications for trade adjustment assistance which the federal government provides to workers whose jobs have disappeared due to imports shows that at least half a dozen companies that applied for more than a million dollars apiece in PPP loans terminated more than 50 workers in 2020 after their aid was approved.

To be clear the companies may have complied with program rules which put a premium on getting money out fast. The regulations changed frequently in the months after the Congress established the PPP as part of the CARES Act in March 2020 and the law was later amended to allow more of the money to be used for non-payroll expenses. The law also contained many exemptions that stretched the definition of what qualifies as a small business.

A paper mill in northeast Washington state called Ponderay Newsprint for example went bankrupt and laid off 150 workers two months after being approved for a $3.46 million loan. Its bankruptcy trustee John Munding said the money was used to pay workers and the government forgave the loan while the company’s assets were acquired by a private equity firm.

A Nebraska aircraft parts manufacturer called Royal Engineered Composites was approved for $2.74 million in April 2020 in order to support 250 jobs but laid off 99 workers by mid-May. The company declined to comment.

Canadian-owned Supreme Steel took $1.69 million in May 2020 for its plant in Portland Oregon which it closed five months later terminating 112 employees. Spokesperson Rhandi Berndt said that “the closure was the result of market forces” and declined to answer further questions.

In order for PPP loans to be forgiven the federal Small Business Administration initially required borrowers to spend 75% of the funds on payroll over eight weeks. Since the maximum PPP loan amount was for 2.5 times companies’ average monthly payroll in 2019 that should have guaranteed that wages and hours could be maintained as required by the CARES Act.

In the case of FreightCar and some other borrowers the original eight-week “covered period” of the PPP loan passed before layoffs occurred allowing the companies to have their loans fully forgiven. But the other cases may have easily qualified as well because Congress changed the rules.

Last June after businesses protested that they couldn’t spend their PPP money fast enough in a stalled economy the legislation was amended to require only that 60% of a loan go toward workers’ pay and the covered period was extended to 24 weeks. Since borrowers had to spend less of the loan on payroll over a longer period to keep the money they had wide leeway to let people go as they saw fit.

“It wouldn’t be difficult to lay off 50% of your workforce and still get full forgiveness” said Eric Kodesch an attorney at Lane Powell who has helped many clients with their PPP applications.

The SBA has not publicly released data on forgiveness of specific loans but aggregate statistics show that so far out of all applications processed more than 99% of the total dollar value has been forgiven. The SBA declined to comment on individual borrowers or identify loans that have been forgiven.

There’s another reason why a casual reader of the CARES Act might think companies would not qualify for PPP money: Many are actually very large businesses.

In general the CARES Act set an upper size limit of 500 employees. With a few exceptions the law required SBA to count all “affiliate” companies toward that total. That would include companies owned by private equity firms as well as subsidiaries contained within holding companies. It exempted hotels restaurants and franchises but no other industries. (That’s why Shake Shack and Ruth’s Chris Steak House qualified for loans though each returned the money after a barrage of negative press coverage.)

However a number of program nuances allowed large companies to obtain PPP loans.

FreightCar laid off 550 people with the Shoals plant shutdown according to a notice filed with the state of Alabama. Along with its headquarters employees that alone would exceed the PPP’s ostensible 500-employee cap. But FreightCar availed itself of a loophole baked into the PPP. The SBA’s alternative size standards a complex set of industry-by-industry thresholds that have been debated for decades allowed it to qualify with up to 1500 workers.

Originally the SBA allowed foreign-owned applicants to count only their U.S.-based employees under the 500-person cap. That guidance changed last May requiring foreign-owned applicants to count their entire global workforce. But plenty of companies had already gotten PPP loans and were allowed to keep them.

For example Ledvance LLC a Chinese-owned global lightbulb manufacturer operating in the U.S. under the brand name Sylvania was approved for a $9.36 million PPP loan in April 2020. Then between May and July it laid off 50 people while closing down a distribution center near Bethlehem Pennsylvania. Ledvance spokesperson Glen Gracia said in an email that the layoffs were “unrelated to the pandemic and in full compliance with LEDVANCE’s participation in the Paycheck Protection Program.”

Then there’s Chick Master Incubator Company which took $1.34 million in April 2020. In June its corporate parent — a Zurich-based private office that invests the fortune of a long-established industrialist family — announced it would combine Chick Master with its other hatchery holdings and close the plant laying off 68 people in Medina Ohio by year’s end. Chick Master didn’t reply to a request for comment.

One type of applicant however still likely should not have qualified: companies controlled by private equity firms whose total holdings exceed the SBA’s size standard for the borrowers’ specific industries. Cadence Aerospace a supplier of aerospace and defense parts that itself has bought three companies in the last three years is majority-owned by Arlington Capital a private equity firm managing billions of dollars. Cadence was approved for a $10 million PPP loan in April 2020 and later that month laid off 72 people at its Giddens Industries subsidiary in Washington state according to a notice filed with the state. Arlington Capital did not respond to a request for comment.

The Shoals plant was the last remaining U.S. manufacturing facility for FreightCar a 120-year-old company headquartered in Chicago that had been shrinking its U.S. footprint for years. In 2008 it shuttered its plant in Johnstown Pennsylvania. In 2017 it shut down its factory in Danville Illinois. In 2019 it closed its plant in Roanoke Virginia and announced it would open a new facility under a joint venture in Castaños Mexico. When executives informed investors in September that the Shoals facility would also close and manufacturing would shift to Mexico they projected $25 million in overall savings including a 60% reduction in labor costs.

“Our manufacturing transformation is now largely complete and we have taken control of our own destiny” Meyer said on an earnings call in March. “We have dramatically repositioned our competitive profile and in so doing created a new company one that is able to win.”

In 2013 the future looked different. When the Shoals plant opened it offered about $12 an hour to start and a chance at advancement. One worker who asked not to be named in order to protect her future employment prospects left a tile-making job to become a welder constructing a variety of rail cars from hoppers to gondolas. Soon she moved up to air brake tester sliding underneath the massive steel vehicles to fix pipes.

“I went to FreightCar to retire” said the worker. “I wasn’t planning on leaving when I got there.”

In the following years safety pay and management concerns led to a union drive. During the campaign anti-union employees circulated flyers warning that the plant would shut down if workers voted to organize and in 2018 they voted decisively against it.

As it turned out the Shoals facility wouldn’t last long anyway.

Leading up to 2020 FreightCar touted the Shoals plant’s competitiveness. A marketing video showed production lines run by industrial robots and skilled workers. “This is the largest newest most purpose-built factory in North America” boasted Meyer. “A modern state-of-the-art factory in every sense of the word.”

But the company was still losing money to the tune of $75.2 million in 2019. When the pandemic further slowed down orders executives started talking up the new facility in Mexico instead.

“The Mexico labor rate is approximately 20% of that in the U.S.” Meyer said on an earnings call in August 2020. “And the new plant provides other sources of savings beyond just labor.”

Also on the August earnings call executives explained that loan proceeds had made up for some of the cost of the company’s move to Mexico. Chris Eppel then the company’s chief financial officer said that the money also “partially offset” operating losses and inventory purchases. Meyer still got his $500000 base salary in 2020 plus stock options worth nearly that and a $1 million bonus for securing a $40 million loan from a private investment company.

FreightCar did not take out a second-draw PPP loan; updated rules excluded publicly traded companies.

After the plant closure announcement the air brake tester found a job making dashboards and bumpers for Toyota. It takes three times as long for her to get to her new job as the 20-minute drive she had to FreightCar and she’s paid six dollars less per hour. Although FreightCar gave employees a few thousand dollars in severance payments she said all of hers went towards bills.

“It’s like starting all over again” she said. “If they did right by us like they did their supervisors maybe we’d be in more decent shape than what we’re in now.”

Although he was later released the situation no doubt has left many in doubt concerning President Muhammadu Buhari’s solemn oath to secure Nigerians.

Mr. President with due regard to your exalted office recent unfolding happenings constrained me to tell you loud and clear that kidnappers have remained stubbornly resolute in their bid to wreak havoc on innocent people. Precisely if a ruler of a whole community such as Kajuru isn’t safe from kidnapping then who is? People from most parts of the north-western states are living under palpable fear of being attacked or kidnapped by heavily armed bandits.

Activities of kidnappers armed bandits and other criminal elements have continued to cripple most of our daily activities. Abductors have become a cog in the progressive wheels of the North. It’s deeply exasperating how criminals are having a field day with no scruples to attack kidnapping innocent citizens at will. For fear of being abducted some of our children have deserted schools with no intention to return.

To cut it short some northern children are presently captives in kidnappers’ den receiving harsh treatments every kind of molestation harassment with no end in sight about their release. Kidnapping banditry and other criminal activities rage on in some parts of the North and more worrisome it’s going on smoothly unchallenged.

Commuting through the lengths and breadths of some north-western roads is now frightful. We have abandoned rural communities living at the mercy of armed bandits as if they don’t share the same right with urban communities. In some rural areas some of their places have been deserted thereby becoming no-go areas with rampaging bandits daily killing unleashing dreadful activities and making large scale abductions.

With scores of people being kidnapped and killed on daily basis particularly in some parts of Kaduna Zamfara Katsina Kebbi Sokoto and FCT I don’t think one can imagine this could happen under Buhari’s leadership. Are we not capable enough to flush out the criminals from their hiding places? Why can’t we deploy adequate troops to secure rural communities against the harmful injurious well-armed devastating bandits? Are rural communities not Nigerians? In spite of the presence of complete security apparatus some roads of the Northern states have now been forcefully taken by happy menacing marauders thereby forcing innocent citizens to abandon those roads. It’s utterly disgusting to hear that it is now a common trend to see people in various mosques and other gatherings begging to raise ransom to librate their family member (s) held captive in kidnappers’ den.

Although I’m now sitting on a layman’s chair concerning the country’s constitution and judicial processes but if it takes President Buhari to take another oath of office for him to redeem his pledge to liberate us from the hands of kidnappers and bandits let it be. Besides the oaths they took during their swearing ceremonies I think there is the need for President Muhammadu Buhari governors of Kaduna Katsina Niger Kebbi and Zamfara states respectively to repeat a second oath of office.

Taking another oath of office might eventually serve as a reminder to them to dutifully serve their citizens.

The transition to Lean-Agile was achieved in partnership with the U.S. Air Force development teams at Hill Air Force Base Utah Eglin Air Force Base Fla. and Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center in Tucson Ariz.

“With this collaborative relationship we are now able to deliver software updates to be tested on the F-16 in weeks instead of the months it would have taken using the traditional waterfall method” said Mark Rossi director SABR programs Northrop Grumman. “Agile software development allows us to rapidly and affordably deliver capabilities to our customers – keeping F-16 operators ahead of their adversaries for decades to come.”

The AN/APG-83 features all-weather high-resolution synthetic aperture radar mapping to present the pilot with a large surface image for more precise target identification and strike capabilities compared to legacy systems. Its design incorporates proven hardware and advanced operating modes from Northrop Grumman’s fifth-generation F-35 AN/APG-81 and F-22 AN/APG-77 AESA radars. The high degree of commonality shared manufacturing processes and infrastructure drives efficiencies and affordability improvements across all of Northrop Grumman’s AESA radar programs.

The AN/APG-83 is an official program of record for both the U.S. Air Force’s active Guard and Reserve components. The U.S. Air Force has achieved initial readiness requirements for SABR to meet a U.S. Northern Command Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) for homeland defense and expects to formally declare full operational capability (FOC) after JEON fielding has completed in late 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvY291bGQtZmF0YWwtZmxhdy1kb29tLXVzLW5hdnktc3VibWFyaW5lcy0xODk4MzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could This Fatal Flaw Doom U.S. Navy Submarines?,"Sub-hunting spy planes armed with torpedoes maritime drones armed with missiles high-resolution surface scanning cameras and fast-moving surface ships dragging sonar sensors while conducting surface reconnaissance are all fast-growing threats to U.S. Navy submarines.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Perhaps an undersea drone could identify an enemy subsea target pass the data back to an undersea-warfare commander who in turn instantly sends coordinates to a helicopter armed with Very Light Weight Torpedoes. This innovative kill-chain concept was demonstrated by Northrop Grumman in a Navy exercise.

Sub-hunting spy planes armed with torpedoes maritime drones armed with missiles high-resolution surface scanning cameras and fast-moving surface ships dragging sonar sensors while conducting surface reconnaissance are all fast-growing threats to U.S. Navy submarines.

Part of the challenge is finding ways to minimize Navy submarine vulnerability to enemy detection and attack by simply remaining at safer depths yet in order to achieve a high-degree of high-speed connectivity submarines need to break the ocean surface by coming to “periscope depth” which is closer to the surface.

The U.S. Navy is working with a number of industry partners such as Northrop Grumman to identify evolve and refine new kinds of undersea communications technology.

“Today the submarine comes to periscope depth and conducts the majority of its transmissions at this depth. Capabilities we’re developing at Northrop Grumman will allow the submarine to never have to come up to the surface because it is at its most vulnerable when at periscope depth” Alan Lytle vice president of Strategy & Mission Solutions Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors division Northrop Grumman told The National Interest in an interview.

Interestingly while most people might immediately associate Northrop Grumman with high-profile programs such as its B-2 and B-21 stealth bombers the company’s history with undersea warfare goes back nearly 100 years including substantial World War II efforts. Years ago Northrop Grumman was involved in adapting radio frequency (RF) technologies to undersea acoustic systems and developed the first electric torpedoes for Navy submarines.

“We have been working in the undersea domain for well over 50-years and our support for the Navy stretches back even further” said Jenny Roberts director of strategy investments & integration Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors division Northrop Grumman.

Roberts who formerly worked as a director for undersea influence at the Navy’s Undersea Warfare Division says Northrop Grumman innovators seek to align closely with the sense of mission and purpose now driving the U.S. Navy’s push to stay in front of undersea warfare technology.

“We bring together the power of the corporation’s continuous innovation to provide capabilities our Navy customers need for mission success” Roberts explained to The National Interest. As part of the ongoing effort to synchronize efforts with the Navy Northrop Grumman developers are placing a special premium on innovation in the areas of undersea warfare and cross-domain networking.

For instance perhaps a surface drone submarine ship or fighter jet can identify and share time-sensitive targeting data across domains in near real-time integrating crucial threat information exponentially faster than ever before. The ultimate goal of this is to massively truncate sensor-to-shooter timelines. Perhaps an undersea drone could identify an enemy subsea target pass the data back to an undersea-warfare commander who in turn instantly sends coordinates to a helicopter armed with Very Light Weight Torpedoes. This innovative kill-chain concept was demonstrated by Northrop Grumman in a Navy exercise.

“To deter future conflict or to ensure we win if future conflict arises we need to provide capabilities which expand the influence of the undersea force including connectivity across all domains” Lytle added.

In light of this Northrop Grumman developers discuss their efforts to link undersea and space domains in the context of the Pentagon’s fast-evolving Joint All Domain Command and Control initiative. JADC2 as it is called seeks to engender a kind of multi-node connectivity between otherwise disparate pools of information across multiple domains.

Before yesterday’s game between the Washington Nationals and San Diego Padres the Vice Chief of Space Operations threw out the first pitch alongside other Space Force Guardians.

General David Thompson was one of the first members to join the new branch back in 2019 and has been a part of Space Command since 2015 when it was a part of the US Air Force. General Thompson currently holds the role of Vice Chief of Space Operations which is the second-highest position in the Space Force. Prior to this position he was the Vice Commander of the Space Force. This was before the Space Force joined the Joint Chiefs of Staff and had the title changed to Vice Chief. While in the Air Force General Thompson served in many high roles in most of the different military commands.

The Space Force was hosted by the Washington Nationals in their first of a three-game series with the San Diego Padres. Alongside General Thompson throwing out the first pitch other Space Force members sang the National Anthem. The Nationals ended up falling short to the Padres in the game with a score of 8-24.

Three big milestones have recently been completed bringing the world’s most complex and powerful space science telescope ever built much closer to being fully prepared for its million-mile journey to orbit. These three testing milestones are outlined below:

Deployable Tower Assembly Testing: Completed

This telescoping tower helps Webb maintain its necessary super cool operating temperatures by separating its mirrors and instruments from the comparatively warmer Sun-facing side and spacecraft bus. When fully deployed the tower reaches ten feet in length which also gives the observatory’s sunshield just enough room to unfold its complex mechanisms. Recently this tower was fully extended for the very last time in testing just as it would once in space. Testing teams then lowered the tower and locked it into place to prepare for launch later this year. The next time this tower will deploy will be when Webb is in space.

AOS (Aft Optics Subsystem) Cover: Removed

Webb’s “lens cap” has been removed! A technician can be seen carefully removing what’s known as Webb’s aft optics subsystem cover. This important piece of protective equipment has kept the observatory’s instruments clean contaminant-free and safe from stray light while it was assembled and fully prepared for flight. Now that launch is so close the cover has been removed to allow engineers freedom to continue packing up the rest of the observatory into its flight-like formation.

Unitized Pallet Structure: Stowed for Launch

Webb’s tennis court-sized sunshield folds up perfectly to rest on what is known as a unitized pallet structure. These long support structures are part of the observatory’s complex folding mechanism that allows it to just barely fit inside an Ariane 5 rocket for launch. Now that Webb’s lens cap has been removed engineers were free to finish the process of folding the pallets upward into their final configuration for launch. In the accompanying picture Webb’s pallet structures can be seen partially lifted but they have since been fully raised and locked in place for launch later this year.

The testing was conducted in a clean room at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach California.

The James Webb Space Telescope will be the world’s premier space science observatory when it launches in 2021. Webb will solve mysteries in our solar system look beyond to distant worlds around other stars and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvdW5kZXJzZWEtZHJvbmVzLWFyZS10YWtpbmctbmF2eS1zdWJtYXJpbmVzLW5leHQtbGV2ZWwtMTg5ODM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Undersea Drones are Taking Navy Submarines to the Next Level,"Here's What You Need to Remember: From a tactical circumstance given that attack submarines and nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines are likely to conduct large amounts of clandestine patrols it seems as though an ability to avoid having to surface would bring an extraordinary operational advantage.

Could newer kinds of AI-enabled undersea drone data processing and analysis introduce new breakthrough possibilities when it comes to solving the longstanding challenge of achieving high-speed real-time connectivity?

Submarine commanders and weapons developers explain that UUV undersea functionality is dependent upon limited battery power and would therefore be further enabled by an ability to “process the data at the source of the sensor” to distinguish and transmit only the most critical information needed by human decision-makers.

“That’s the concept how do you get all of that information back to a human to analyze. Maybe you don’t want to do that? Maybe you want to allow the UUV to do some initial analysis and make some modifications to its behavior autonomously?” Alan Lytle Vice President of Strategy & Mission Solutions Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors division Northrop Grumman told The National Interest in an interview.

Organizing and optimizing information at the source Lytle says requires less power and makes real-time undersea transmission more effective something which might remove the need to have a forward-operating undersea drone gather data which can only then be analyzed upon return to the host platform to be downloaded.

“You significantly improve the mission effectiveness of the UUV if you can process data at the source of the sensor the power and bandwidth required to send back key critical information is significantly lower” Lytle explained.

This is where AI comes in as Northrop Grumman developers are working to develop and refine advanced algorithms able to take in “gathered” information perform analytics and make determinations regarding moments of relevance or significance to commanders. Lytle’s point about forward-operating sensing and computing applies here as AI-enabled computer systems could take in acoustic or optical sensor data bounce it instantly against a vast database to make identifications draw comparisons and perform analysis at the point of collection so as to streamline data transmission and selectively feed the information most crucial to human decision-makers.

Northrop Grumman’s sensing and AI-related computing efforts in this capacity seem to align with Chief of Naval Operations Michael Gilday’s 2021 NAVPLAN given that his text makes reference to ongoing work to deploy resilient systems able to “operate with infrequent human interaction.”

“Through analysis simulations prototyping and demonstrations we will systematically field and operate systems that possess the endurance and resilience to operate with infrequent human interaction” Gilday writes.

Newer more advanced computer algorithms allow submarine commanders to operate sensors with much greater degrees of resolution and return-signal image fidelity. Sensors enabled by newer computer applications can see farther and much more clearly underwater.

“With our latest systems you can get down to less than one-inch resolution. It is the difference between being able to discern a World War II aircraft that crashed into the sea bed or see much more precisely such that submarine personnel could view bullet holes in the fuselage that must have caused it to be shot down” Lytle said.

From a tactical circumstance given that attack submarines and nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines are likely to conduct large amounts of clandestine patrols it seems as though an ability to avoid having to surface would bring an extraordinary operational advantage. This is particularly critical given that nuclear-armed submarines certainly can’t risk giving up their position. Additionally attack submarines are increasingly being developed for undersea ISR missions as they can more effectively access areas along enemy coastlines where more detectable surface ships might be less effective. As part of this operational equation Virginia-class attack submarines continue to receive cutting-edge upgrades adding new quieting technologies making them much harder to detect.

“A large part of success in the undersea theater is the deterrence value. There is a tremendous conventional deterrence value because an enemy does not know where the submarine is or know where the unmanned underwater system is... and if you don’t know exactly where it is you have to search this massive swath of ocean. What we are trying to enable is an operational circumstance wherein the boat never has to come to periscope depth” Lytle says.

Earth is a wet rock floating through space; it doesn’t care if we drown our coastal cities or turn our farmland into desert. Rather carbon capture is one of the technologies we will need if we want Earth to continue to be a tolerable place for humans to live.

In brief The carbon-capture chemistry we have today is too expensive. It works and it makes economic sense in a few settings. But to meet the global-consensus goal of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and dodge the worst consequences of climate change we need to deploy more than 150 times as much carbon-capture capacity as we have now. That means reducing costs and making more options available for a wide range of CO 2 emission sources. Read on about the growing number of businesses government labs nonprofits and academic researchers racing to bring the next generation of carbon-capture technology up to scale and into the market.

In 2020 we sent 40 billion metric tons (t) of carbon dioxide into Earth’s atmosphere. We need to cut that number to 0 by 2050 if we are to avoid the worst consequences of climate change according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If we don’t the natural systems that keep Earth’s climate relatively peaceful and comfortable will start to tip. The shift will be chaotic and the new normal might not be conducive to life as we know it.

To reach net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 we need an all-of-the-above approach. Efficiency improvements can reduce our energy needs and renewable and nuclear power may eventually be able to supply enough electricity for our homes offices and cars. But nuclear power is expensive and lacks public support and renewables are struggling to find the land they need to be deployed at scale. On top of that activities such as aviation and iron smelting are currently impossible to carry out commercially without releasing CO 2 .

That’s where carbon capture comes in. Removing carbon dioxide from point sources such as the flue gas of power plants and locking it away underground can be a big part of the path to net zero. Related technologies known as direct air capture can remove CO 2 that is already in the ambient air. But all of it depends on carbon capture getting a lot bigger cheaper and more efficient—and doing so quickly.

Slow start

Capturing the CO 2 from power plants’ flue gas is where most of the action is. “Decarbonization of the power sector becomes the backbone that the decarbonization of the rest of the economy happens on” says John Northington director of the National Carbon Capture Center a research facility near Birmingham Alabama.

What’s your gas stream? Different emission sources require different carbon-capture methods. Ammonia ethanol natural gas processing: Emit gas streams with more than 80% CO 2 . The CO 2 is captured with compression and dehydration membranes or physical solvents. Chemical plants iron steel and paper mills: Emit gas streams with 15–80% CO 2 . The CO 2 can be captured with physical solvents solid sorbents or membranes. Coal and natural gas power plants and boilers: Emit gas streams with less than 15% CO 2 . The CO 2 can be captured with chemical solvents. Ambient air: Has a CO 2 concentration around 0.041%. The CO 2 can be captured with metal-organic frameworks or chemical systems. Sources: Global CCS Institute National Petroleum Council.

But just one commercial power plant has carbon capture: the coal-fired Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan which captures 1 million t of CO 2 per year on one of its four generators. Carbon capture elsewhere on other industrial processes such as natural gas production adds another 27 plants and gathers 25 million t per year. Not nearly enough.

The people developing the technology that will make capturing carbon practical have gained unlikely allies in the past couple of years: the oil and gas companies responsible for the lion’s share of CO 2 emissions. Though these firms have had their eyes on carbon capture for some time Northington says they’re investing serious money in it now.

Data from the patent research firm Patent Seekers bear that notion out. Oil companies have gotten the largest number of carbon-capture patents in recent years followed by government agencies and research institutes universities and engineering and technology companies.

Klaus Lackner an engineering professor working on direct air capture at Arizona State University says the change in attitude is a result of pressure from two directions: competition from cheap renewable energy and public demand for low-carbon options. Major changes are coming to the energy market Lackner says. “The question isn’t ‘Will we have a transition?’ We will. The Exxons and Shells and other companies have to figure out how to make it through that transition. Their business model falls apart if you can’t have liquid fuels.”

Lackner says he’s been pushing fossil fuel companies on this point for years telling them “Your societal license to dump CO 2 into the air will go away. You need to figure out how to operate without needing that license.”

Matt Steyn a senior adviser with the advocacy wing of the Global CCS Institute (GCCSI) a carbon-capture-and-storage think tank says the change is also driven by the scientific consensus expressed by the IPCC and the International Energy Agency. “The target has been set; the timeline has been set” he says. The conversation has shifted from “What do we do?” to “How do we do it?”

As we deploy more plants costs will come down just as they have done in every other sector. Steve Oldham CEO Carbon Engineering

Carbon capture of all types is a gas-separation problem. The goal is pure CO 2  ideally at high pressure so it can go into a pipeline and be injected safely underground. For some industrial processes the capture technology available today works fine. In ammonia and corn ethanol plants for example the gas exiting exhaust pipes is 80% or more CO 2 and just needs to be dried and compressed for transport.

As the CO 2 in emissions gets more dilute the energy required to extract it rises. The emissions coming from steel plants and many chemical processes tend to be between 15 and 80% CO 2 . The flue gas from fossil fuel combustion in air such as in coal or natural gas–fired power plants is generally less than 15% CO 2 .

Capture with solvents

Ironically oil companies are some of the biggest practitioners of carbon capture today because they use solvents membranes and other technologies to remove CO 2 from natural gas deposits found in locations such as Russia and west Texas. When they use or sell that CO 2 instead of venting it that counts as carbon capture. That’s why ExxonMobil can claim to capture more CO 2 than any other company even if it uses most of that to push more oil out of the ground.

Amine-based extraction systems developed for natural gas processing have been adapted for other CO 2 sources such as the power plant in Saskatchewan but the energy cost of using such systems on more dilute streams is crushingly high. Second-generation solvent systems are poised to come to market next followed by membranes and solid sorbents. And numerous innovative and experimental approaches are racing to catch up.

Syrie Crouch vice president for carbon capture and storage at Shell which built the Saskatchewan plant says deploying capture where it’s simple is an important start. US ethanol makers for example capture only 3 million t of the 43 million t of CO 2 their plants produce each year. “The key is to capture that lowest-hanging fruit first and then work on down the cost curve” she says.

Incumbent amines

The most mature carbon-capture technologies today use solvents. These systems pump emissions through a solution that absorbs CO 2 but lets through other gases such as nitrogen. The CO 2 -rich solvent then flows into a boiler where heat drives the pure CO 2 back out of solution. That stripping step is the energy hog.

Though the terminology is harsh to a chemist’s ears carbon-capture solvents are considered either chemical or physical. Chemical solvents mostly amines such as the industry standard 30% monoethanolamine in water get a CO 2 -solubility boost through reversible chemical reactions with water and CO 2 that form carbonates bicarbonates and carbamates.

Physical solvents such as methanol rely on intermolecular interactions to dissolve CO 2 . Companies including Linde Air Products and UOP offer such systems commercially. They use less energy than chemical solvents but require high pressures and low temperatures. They’re not suitable for combustion flue gas but have been used for many years to remove CO 2 from natural gas.

Amine solvents have the advantage of being mature technology. The systems are well understood with well-characterized economics and risk profiles that investors know how to analyze. Dow Shell Fluor and others offer monoethanolamine solutions for carbon capture. Boundary Dam Unit 3 uses amines as did NRG Energy’s Petra Nova plant in Texas which captured more than 1 million t of CO 2 per year from 2017 until NRG shut it down in 2020.

BASF Linde General Electric and the start-up Carbon Clean are among those working on advanced amines. These systems use chemicals such as piperazine alongside or instead of monoethanolamine to get better stability kinetics and thermodynamics. The US Department of Energy recently awarded Linde and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign $47 million to build a 200 t per day pilot facility using an advanced amine solvent from BASF at a coal-fired power plant near Springfield Illinois.

But capturing CO 2 with amines comes at a steep cost. Fitted onto a power plant’s systems they consume 30–50% of the plant’s energy output. Most experts including Shell’s Crouch expect that amine systems can get only 10–20% more efficient. At the same time amines can seem like a safe bet compared with a next-generation technology. “If you’re making your first investment in carbon capture and storage you don’t necessarily want to be taking massive risks on something new and untested” the GCCSI’s Steyn says.

The next generation

At the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) and the Wyoming Integrated Test Center (ITC) two next-generation carbon-capture technologies that look promising are solid sorbents and membranes.

The NCCC and ITC sites are essentially coal-fired power plants that can pipe their flue gas into a series of testing bays. The NCCC tests systems at scales from less than 1 t per day up to about 25 t per day; tests at the ITC run between 25 and 450 t per day. The sites which use a combination of public and private financing serve as technology development bridges between lab-scale carbon-capture concepts and pilot-scale tests on commercial power plants.

The NCCC’s Northington says the incumbent amine systems can capture carbon at a cost of $60–$65 per metric ton. Advanced amines and other second-generation solvents are about $40 per metric ton. A handful of commercial installations that will use advanced amines are in early-stage engineering now he says. Solid sorbents membranes and other transformational technologies will reach $30 or less per metric ton he predicts.

“We want choice in the marketplace” says William Morris technical director of the ITC. “People are really trying to figure out what works for them not only in their industry but in their specific circumstance.”

Solid sorbents include zeolites metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) activated carbon and porous silica particles. They’re often functionalized with amine groups to increase their activity and make them more selective for CO 2 .

Merry-go-round

Generally solid sorbents have faster absorption kinetics than amines and require less energy to release the CO 2 again. They can also hold more CO 2 per unit volume than most solvents. That means that solid-sorbent systems can be smaller reducing capital costs and can be stripped of their CO 2 using vacuum or modest heat.

The start-up Svante forms solid sorbents into large nanoporous disks divided into slices like a pizza. On a giant turntable the disk slowly rotates each slice through a flue gas stream a CO 2 -stripping module and one or two sorbent preparation stations. The firm has a 10000 t per year demonstration plant on a natural gas–fired boiler in Canada. It raised $75 million in February to advance a design for cement plants.

In addition to Svante ExxonMobil Kawasaki Heavy Industries TDA Research and others are testing solid-sorbent systems for flue gas capture. Shell which is shifting its R&D to solid sorbents tested a system that uses amine-functionalized solid sorbents on a wood-burning power plant in Austria; it is now readying a scaled-up test at a manure-to-power plant in the Netherlands. After these trials Crouch says Shell will offer the technology on the open market.

Membranes are even further along than solid sorbents Morris says. Membrane systems use selectively permeable materials that exploit the small chemical and physical differences between CO 2 and the rest of a gas mixture to achieve separation. Like amines membranes are already being used in natural gas processing and other areas where CO 2 pressure and content are high.

“The next technology outside of amines that will deploy will be membranes” Morris predicts. He says membranes are coming fast for capturing CO 2 from flue gas at power plants. And Northington expects membranes will play a big role in carbon capture for the chemical industry and heavy manufacturing which have moderate to high CO 2 concentrations.

Getting any new carbon capture technology to market won’t be cheap. Morris says getting a robust set of data from testing at the ITC can cost seven figures. One membrane maker Membrane Technology and Research (MTR) won $52 million in funding in May from the US Department of Energy to do just that. MTR ran a 20 t per day version of its system for 1400 h at the NCCC in 2015 and will use the funds to scale it up to 150 t per day in Wyoming. The company expects to demonstrate capture at less than $40 per metric ton.

MTR’s membrane polymers are isoporous meaning their pores are uniform in size and arranged geometrically unlike the randomly arranged multisize pores in most gas-separation membranes. The regular pore pattern lets molecules flow more smoothly through the material lowering the amount of pressure needed relative to conventional membranes. And a tighter distribution of pore sizes increases selectivity for CO 2 .

Another membrane maker Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) also seeks to decrease costs by reducing pressure. CMS uses facilitated transport membranes which are specialized fluoropolymers coated onto a porous substrate. CEO Erica Nemser likens the mechanism to Tarzan swinging through the jungle on vines. The CO 2 is Tarzan and fluoropolymers decorated with activating groups act as the vines passing CO 2 along with minimal pressure needed.

The firm’s systems are already being used to separate olefins from paraffins and to remove water and dissolved gases from solvents oils and lubricants. The system that will capture CO 2 in flue gas will be a modification of one that’s in field trials now for removing CO 2 from biomethane. Chemical changes to the fluoropolymer make the membrane selective toward different chemical species Nemser says.

CMS’s units are built around membrane cartridges about twice the size of a can of spray paint—hence the “compact” in the company’s name. The bigger the gas stream to be treated the more cartridges the system uses. Chief Technology Officer Hannah Murnen says such modular systems will make carbon capture accessible for a wide range of CO 2 point sources. In contrast the towers needed to mix amine solvents with a gas stream and strip the CO 2 out later make economic sense only at enormous scales she says.

CMS says it will be able to deliver carbon capture for as little as $20 per metric ton. “It’s time for membranes. It’s membranes’ day in the sun” Murnen says.

Tomorrow’s tech

Amines may dominate carbon capture today and membranes and solid sorbents may be right on their heels but a need this serious—and a market this big—is attracting plenty of other contenders. And a good-enough concept could leap ahead if the people behind it can show it works and is scalable.

Saipem and Chart Industries both hope to adapt technology and equipment already in use in other chemical processes.

In January 2020 Saipem an energy technology and engineering firm acquired CO 2 Solutions a start-up that is using enzymes to boost the carbon-capture kinetics of aqueous potassium carbonate. K 2 CO 3 reacts with CO 2 and water to form potassium bicarbonate KHCO 3 . The bicarbonate solution releases its CO 2 at relatively low temperatures—around 75 °C under reduced pressure—meaning it can tap low-grade heat that most industrial processes would waste.

That chemistry has been used to scrub CO 2 from the air in submarines and other closed environments and in some high-CO 2 -concentration settings. The trouble is that the absorption kinetics are too slow for it to work well at flue gas concentrations and pressures; the contact towers would have to be even bigger than those used with amines.

To solve that problem Saipem catalyzes the reaction with the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Natural carbonic anhydrase is already one of the fastest enzymes speeding up the formation of HCO 3 – by a factor of 107. The team at CO 2 Solutions modified the enzyme to make it even faster and keep it active at higher temperatures.

“The first time I saw carbon capture with the enzyme my jaw just dropped because the catalyst is magic” says Richard Surprenant who came to Saipem from CO 2 Solutions and is now commercial manager for carbon-capture technologies.

Any industrial or postcombustion application is fair game for the firm’s technology Surprenant says and anywhere with low-grade waste or geothermal heat is an opportunity because it doesn’t need the high-grade heat a resource many plants already use in other ways. The firm is in the midst of restarting CO 2 Solutions’ first commercial plant a 30 t per day facility in Quebec that extracts CO 2 from a paper mill and sells it to a nearby greenhouse.

Chart Industries an energy and industrial gas equipment firm is also moving into carbon capture through acquisition and investment. In late 2020 Chart acquired Sustainable Energy Solutions a start-up making cryogenic carbon-capture systems for combustion flue gas. In June of this year it invested in Earthly Labs which uses cryogenics to capture CO 2 from breweries.

In the simplest terms both cryogenic systems chill their target gas streams until the CO 2 condenses into a solid or liquid. Nitrogen still a gas at those temperatures is pumped off. The basic process often called cryogenic distillation is already used to purify other industrial gases such as oxygen and nitrogen.

The challenge for flue gas is in the engineering not the chemistry according to Chart CEO Jill Evanko. If water and CO 2 freeze in the wrong places they can clog pipes and block heat exchangers. But with clever heat management system design and integration with the rest of the equipment Chart and its partners can deliver carbon capture of flue gas at half the cost of conventional amines Evanko says and make brewery carbon capture profitable enough to pay off the equipment in 18 months.

Several other technologies are in early-stage development. Solvents that use less water or no water at all including organic solvents and ionic liquids could reduce the amount of mass that needs to be heated to release the purified CO 2 . Allam cycle power plants burn hydrocarbons in a mix of O 2 and CO 2  sidestepping the need to separate CO 2 from nitrogen. And FuelCell Energy is commercializing its molten carbonate fuel cell which can capture flue gas carbon while generating additional electricity from natural gas.

It’s an exciting time for technology development the ITC’s Morris says. “Decarbonization is going to be very very difficult and it’s probably not going to be possible without technologies that are currently in the development stage.”

State of play



Direct air capture

Point-source carbon capture won’t be enough. The technology still lets 2–10% of the carbon through. And it’s hard to deploy on sources with diffuse or mobile emissions such as airplanes sprawling petrochemical plants and wide-open wastewater treatment facilities. Besides the atmosphere has too much carbon already. The goal of net-zero CO 2 emissions will require methods to remove carbon from the air.

This direct air capture or DAC works on chemical principles similar to those for point-source capture. The big difference is that our ambient air although overloaded is still only 410 ppm or 0.041% CO 2  much lower than even the most dilute industrial point sources. And that changes a lot about the devices and their economics.

Because flue gas and other point sources are releasing new carbon into the atmosphere the goal is to capture as much of it as possible—90% is a common target. In DAC the amount of carbon left behind isn’t important; it’s all about how much CO 2 can be removed per dollar spent. “My goal is not to make CO 2 -free air. My goal is to take CO 2 out of the air and I can choose where the optimal efficiency is” says Lackner the Arizona State engineer who is also developing DAC technology.

But however you look at it DAC is expensive. Carbon capture at an ethanol plant can cost as little as $10 per metric ton. At a coal-fired power plant the cost is around $60. DAC companies don’t like to talk about their costs but industry insiders estimate they are around $500 per metric ton. Lackner and other experts generally peg $100 as the point at which DAC will become cost competitive with other decarbonization methods.

Oxy Low Carbon Ventures a carbon-reduction subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum thinks it can reach that level in partnership with the start-up Carbon Engineering. The firms plan to build in the southwestern US what they say will be the world’s first commercial-scale DAC plant. It will capture 1 million t of CO 2 per year to be used mainly to boost production in Occidental’s oil wells in the region. The largest existing DAC plant captures a mere 2000 t per year according to Ryan Edwards low-carbon policy adviser for Oxy Low Carbon.

Carbon Engineering uses chemical looping to capture carbon from the air. In its process intended to run on renewable energy giant fans blow air over plastic surfaces that have aqueous potassium hydroxide flowing over it.

The KOH reacts with CO 2 to form potassium carbonate K 2 CO 3  which then flows into a pellet reactor containing aqueous calcium hydroxide Ca(OH) 2 . The calcium and potassium switch places to form CaCO 3  which precipitates out as solid pellets as well as KOH which is ready to cycle back to the plastic surfaces. The pellets then pass into a calciner a heater that decomposes the CaCO 3 into solid CaO and pure CO 2 . The CO 2 is cooled and pressurized and the CaO heads back to the pellet reactor where it mixes with water and re-forms Ca(OH) 2 .

The system sounds complicated but it’s built mostly out of reactions and equipment already in use in industry. The pellet reactor is adapted from papermaking. Calciners running the same chemical reaction are central to cement production and other versions come into play in glass uranium petroleum coke and gypsum processing.

Carbon Engineering published its process in 2018 projecting costs between $94 and $232 per metric ton (Joule DOI: 10.1016/j.joule.2018.05.006). CEO Steve Oldham says the firm is “extremely confident” its costs will be in that range and expects that second and third generations will ensure a cost of $100 or less. “As we deploy more plants costs will come down just as they have done in every other sector” Oldham says.

Mosaic Materials a developer of MOFs and one of C&EN’s 10 Start-Ups to Watch in 2019 pivoted to DAC from point-source capture 2 years ago according to CEO Thomas McDonald. In the past 3 months McDonald says he’s seen a sharp increase in interest in DAC.

The firm’s MOFs use a flavor of CO 2 -amine chemistry that McDonald calls cooperative binding in which the CO 2 inserts itself between a magnesium ion and an amine ligand. The mechanism gives the material high capacity and fast kinetics and it reverses at relatively low temperatures to release the CO 2  according to McDonald.

MOFs are more expensive than other solid sorbents such as silica or activated carbon. Mosaic researchers are working to improve the materials’ capacity and stability to reduce operating costs McDonald says. But the firm is focused more on lowering manufacturing costs and optimizing complete systems around its materials.

Mosaic worked with ExxonMobil on flue gas capture in 2017 and 2018 and has some ongoing work in that area along with collaborations with NASA and the US Navy on life-support systems McDonald says. But he sees DAC as the best way to build his company. “We see the fastest least-capital-intensive least-risky path is by achieving early scale on projects through direct air capture.”

We will require something roughly the size of the current oil and gas industry but with the molecules going in reverse. Syrie Crouch vice president for carbon capture and storage Shell

Lackner says DAC is a good fit with renewable energy. If a natural gas power plant is off because of low demand so is any point-source carbon-capture device attached to it. DAC on the other hand can run on renewable energy and stabilize electricity prices by being a customer of last resort.

In addition to his academic work Lackner is working to commercialize his own DAC concept which he calls MechanicalTrees. The “trees” eliminate the cost of running fans by relying on wind to move air across sorbents loaded onto disks arranged in a tower. When saturated with CO 2  the towers drop into a chamber where heat and vacuum remove the CO 2 at roughly 95% concentration.

Paying for it

All cool ideas but who’s putting up the cash? A provision of the US tax code called 45Q offers tax credits for capturing carbon. When the provision is fully in place in 2026 carbon that is captured and sequestered will be worth $50 per metric ton. CO 2 used to extract more hydrocarbons a widespread and controversial practice called enhanced oil recovery gets $35.

That $35 credit plus the $40 per metric ton that enhanced oil recovery operators pay for CO 2 on average make that market the most profitable for non-food-grade CO 2 even with the lower credit (Front. Clim. 2019 DOI: 10.3389/fclim.2019.00005).

That makes the economic rationale for carbon-capture products dependent on the price of oil. That dynamic is what doomed the Petra Nova carbon-capture facility when the price of oil got too low during the pandemic. Still Oxy Low Carbon executives are prepared to depend on enhanced oil recovery for their southwestern US DAC project.

Despite such bumps carbon capture offers a way to decarbonize combustion and other CO 2 -emitting processes so they can remain part of a net-zero world. That’s both a selling point and a point of criticism. Critics such as Greenpeace say carbon capture diverts resources away from renewables and keeps polluters in business.

Your societal license to dump CO 2 into the air will go away. You need to figure out how to operate without needing that license. Klaus Lackner engineer Arizona State University

Critics also point out that almost all the CO 2 captured to date has been used in enhanced oil recovery. In the best cases enough CO 2 stays permanently in the ground after such oil extraction that the resulting fuel has net-negative CO 2 emissions. But many enhanced oil recovery projects don’t meet that goal (Energies 2019 DOI: 10.3390/en12030448).

“To put it very brutally in the beginning I don’t care” where the captured CO 2 goes Lackner says. The technology needs to start scaling up now. He points to a recent report from the International Energy Agency detailing a path to net zero by 2050. In that scenario point-source capture has to scale up from about 40 million t per year today to 6.6 billion t in 2050 and DAC has to grow from a few thousand metric tons per year to almost 1 billion t in 2050.

If enhanced oil recovery operators are willing to be early adopters that get carbon capture down to a cost that the market will bear Lackner says that’ll have to do. “The only way you get there is by learning. Most industries gain 10–20% in cost reduction for every doubling of cumulative output” he says. “If we follow normal learning curves I’m allowed to be optimistic. If it turns out we derail from that the sooner we know the better off we are.”

Shell’s Crouch agrees that industry needs to start deploying carbon capture now to reach the necessary scale. “We will require something roughly the size of the current oil and gas industry but with the molecules going in reverse” she says.

Building all those plants will cost $655 billion to $1280 billion over the next 3 decades according to a recent analysis by the GCCSI. That’s a lot of money but Brad Page CEO of the GCCSI points out in a press release that “investing around one trillion dollars over almost 30 years is well within the capacity of the private sector which invested almost two trillion dollars in the energy sector in 2018 alone. Government decisions hold the key to enabling the requisite private sector capital being allocated for [carbon capture and storage] deployment.”

One proposal the US Congress is considering now would add a higher credit for carbon captured from the air. The idea has broad bipartisan support according to Oxy Low Carbon’s Edwards. At a recent panel discussion hosted by the nonprofit OurEnergyPolicy he expressed confidence that enhanced incentives R&D and deployment support and funding for infrastructure for CO 2 transport and storage could all become law in the current session of Congress.

Jeremy Harrell the managing director for policy at the energy-transition nonprofit ClearPath and another OurEnergyPolicy panelist said he expects the Biden administration to launch a 50:50 cost-sharing initiative to deploy a first wave of carbon-capture facilities. “We think that sends a really important market signal to the private sector as they look to invest in these technologies” he said at the event. “The politics here are going to play out well over the next 18 months and people should stay tuned.”

The administration’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year includes a 61% increase in spending at the Department of Energy on carbon capture use and storage though the $368 million total is far short of what many climate activists would like to see.

Edwards says 45Q has opened the door to commercial-scale carbon-capture projects. Since Congress extended 45Q in 2018 and removed the cap on the number of credits available 30 to 40 new projects have been publicly proposed he says which would more than double the global number. Between projects that are being kept quiet for now and new ones that will be unlocked if Congress expands 45Q that increase is “just the tip of the iceberg” Edwards says.

It’ll need to be. Right now 28 point-source capture and DAC plants are active including at Boundary Dam and nonpower installations according to the GCCSI. The world will need 2000 large facilities by 2050 along with transportation and storage infrastructure to reach net zero by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Der8auer a popular YouTuber and overclocker made a visit to Caseking (a german PC hardware retailer) who has an interesting program called ‘Kill my case’. This program is basically what Pimp my Ride was except for PCs. The company decided to acquire a PC that was in a flat that burned down. This PC was then was inspected by Der8auer who has extensive knowledge of electronics including their modifications.

Before he got to the GPU he quickly discovered that the processor (AMD Ryzen 7 2700X) has survived. The processor was well protected by a large AIO pump so the fire did not directly affect the CPU. Things weren’t so lucky for other components the memory power supply and motherboards were clearly destroyed. In fact one of the fans has completely melted.

Surprisingly though the graphics card still appeared to be in one piece without much physical damage to the plastic shroud. Graphics cards were designed for higher temperatures after all so Der8auer decided to check if the graphics card was able to survive the fire.

The graphics card needed to be taken apart and comprehensively cleaned. This took some time but eventually the graphics card appeared to be ready for testing.

After checking the card with a multimeter and plugging in the DisplayPort cable to one connector that still looked good der8auer put a liquid nitrogen pot on the GPU and tried to verify if the graphics card will run. As it turns out it did and you can see the result below.

There was little hope for the cooler but the internals which were sandwiched by multiple support and heat-dissipating brackets have survived. This endeavor just proves how well new PC components are designed for extreme temperatures. Der8auer joked that no one should complain about high GPU temperatures after seeing this video.

Furthermore while in other games the difference between DLSS Performance Mode at 4K and native was almost indistinguishable the same can't be said for F1 2021.

F1 2021 also supports ray tracing technology on next-gen consoles (PlayStation 5 Xbox Series S|X) and PC as the developers had revealed in a recent interview with Wccftech. Specifically the game uses raytraced reflections and shadows to further improve its visuals in cut scenes replays Photo Mode and within the front end

For Codemasters the application of reflections and shadows have been particularly important with significant resources invested in higher-quality effect presets and custom-made techniques. Now they’ve taken the next logical step and upgraded to ray tracing adding real-time reflections and shadows. With ray tracing all surrounding detail is accurately reflected on each car and on windows water surfaces and other metallic game elements which previously lacked reflections or featured simple cube maps. Now all reflect the world around them improving fidelity and realism. And with ray-traced shadows existing shadows are enhanced with more accurate detail that naturally softens and sharpens and many more smaller game elements now cast shadows further enhancing the realism and quality of circuits cars and other game elements.

AMD FSR has just been added to Necromunda Hired Gun a fast-paced first-person shooter. Although this game is relatively new it already offers support for NVIDIA DLSS as well as AMD FSR being one of the first games to do so.

By offering DLSS and FSR support there is finally a way to compare both technologies side by side to determine which technology is better. This was partially done by Back4BuckPC Gamer who compared both technologies at 4K resolution when using their best quality profiles. This part is certainly important as DLSS has always been known to do wonders at lower resolutions it is where machine learning upscaling algorithms show their true potential reconstructing images from much fewer pixels.

On the other hand there is AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) which is now confirmed to be an implementation of Lanczos resampling that preserves edges. AMD themselves confirmed this by going open source with FSR. The source code samples and documentation are now all available to the public.

What is important to note is that NVIDIA DLSS Quality preset upscales the output image from 1440p resolution while AMD FSR Ultra Quality uses 1662p image. Both upscaling techniques were compared side by side by Back4BuckPC Gamer in Necromunda Hired Gun. He used 4K resolution and the best quality presets. The higher the quality the fewer pixels super-resolution algorithms need to reconstruct thus they are expected to perform similarly.

Overall impressions from Bang4BuckPC Gamer are that FSR is a very compelling alternative to DLSS at this resolution and at the highest quality settings. The FSR has a slight advantage in both the performance and image quality in motion. After all this algorithm does not use motion vectors or history buffers.

1440p & 1080p comparison in Marvel’s Avengers shows slightly different story

Another game that supports both technologies is Marvel’s Avengers. Screenshots showing both technologies at 1080p and 1440p resolutions were shared by @KanaSaber on Twitter. Judging from the screenshots AMD FSR clearly has some problems reconstructing the cables supporting the bridges while DLSS actually adds more fidelity than native 1080p. Do note that KanaSaber is using FSR Quality mode here not Ultra Quality like in the comparison above.

The same applies to 4K quality DLSS preset and AMD FSR Quality. The FSR is simply upscaling 1440p image here which does a great job in comparison to native 4K quality however in this case DLSS clearly adds more fidelity by reconstructing hair in greater detail. In this instance DLSS image quality is actually better than native.

Maria held the woman’s head above water until her mother Jennifer Burlingame a physician could help get the woman into their boat and begin resuscitation efforts.

On Saturday the family of the woman — Tina Krause 51 of Twin Lakes — the Twin Lakes Police Department and Twin Lakes Fire and Rescue thanked the Burlingames in town from Bloomfield Hills Mich. to attend Country Thunder for their “selfless and courageous acts.”

“We are here today to recognize some true heroes who did a very brave and heroic thing in our community Thursday afternoon” Twin Lakes Police Chief Adam Grosz said at a ceremony Saturday held outside the police department at which the Burlingames were presented with plaques and police and fire patches.

“If it wasn’t for the actions of Jennifer and Maria this probably would have been a much different outcome. It would have been a tragedy in our community.”

Gary Krause Tina’s husband cried as he hugged each of them calling them “angels.” Debra Taylor Tina’s niece who was kayaking with her that day and also responded to her aid also cried as she offered her gratitude.

Debra who was also treated at the scene said she had been paddling ahead of her aunt when looked back saw Tina had capsized and paddled back to help.

On pontoon nearby

At about the same time Jennifer was on a nearby pontoon boat with her children Maria Colin 9 and John 4 and their nanny Terry LaPointe.

LaPointe herself a kayak enthusiast said she could tell the kayakers were in distress and knows how easy it is to get fatigued while attempting to get back into a kayak.

“When we headed that way we noticed that (Tina) was floating in the water completing unresponsive and close to going under” Jennifer said.

Maria said she could tell as she swam closer that the woman was in trouble.

“I lifted her head out of the water” Maria said. “It was a little bit scary. I saw that her lips were blue and there was foam coming out of her mouth.”

Jennifer also jumped in to help get Tina onto the pontoon boat.

“I started CPR right away” Jennifer whose husband Bret’s family lives in Fort Atkinson and also has family from Spring Grove Ill. said.

Grosz said police were called to the lake at 3:10 p.m. Thursday for a report of a possible drowning. Rescue personnel met the pontoon boat at Lance Park and transported Tina to Aurora Medical Center in Burlington where she was treated and released. Debra was evaluated and released from the scene.

Tina’s family said she wanted to be at the recognition ceremony Saturday but she is still recovering at home. She is expected to make a full recovery.

“I am so happy that she’s better now” Maria said.

Jennifer said she is planning on enrolling her children in CPR classes when they get back to Michigan.

“It is something everyone can learn to do” she said.

Earth is a wet rock floating through space; it doesn’t care if we drown our coastal cities or turn our farmland into desert. Rather carbon capture is one of the technologies we will need if we want Earth to continue to be a tolerable place for humans to live.

In brief The carbon-capture chemistry we have today is too expensive. It works and it makes economic sense in a few settings. But to meet the global-consensus goal of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and dodge the worst consequences of climate change we need to deploy more than 150 times as much carbon-capture capacity as we have now. That means reducing costs and making more options available for a wide range of CO 2 emission sources. Read on about the growing number of businesses government labs nonprofits and academic researchers racing to bring the next generation of carbon-capture technology up to scale and into the market.

In 2020 we sent 40 billion metric tons (t) of carbon dioxide into Earth’s atmosphere. We need to cut that number to 0 by 2050 if we are to avoid the worst consequences of climate change according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If we don’t the natural systems that keep Earth’s climate relatively peaceful and comfortable will start to tip. The shift will be chaotic and the new normal might not be conducive to life as we know it.

To reach net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 we need an all-of-the-above approach. Efficiency improvements can reduce our energy needs and renewable and nuclear power may eventually be able to supply enough electricity for our homes offices and cars. But nuclear power is expensive and lacks public support and renewables are struggling to find the land they need to be deployed at scale. On top of that activities such as aviation and iron smelting are currently impossible to carry out commercially without releasing CO 2 .

That’s where carbon capture comes in. Removing carbon dioxide from point sources such as the flue gas of power plants and locking it away underground can be a big part of the path to net zero. Related technologies known as direct air capture can remove CO 2 that is already in the ambient air. But all of it depends on carbon capture getting a lot bigger cheaper and more efficient—and doing so quickly.

Slow start

Capturing the CO 2 from power plants’ flue gas is where most of the action is. “Decarbonization of the power sector becomes the backbone that the decarbonization of the rest of the economy happens on” says John Northington director of the National Carbon Capture Center a research facility near Birmingham Alabama.

What’s your gas stream? Different emission sources require different carbon-capture methods. Ammonia ethanol natural gas processing: Emit gas streams with more than 80% CO 2 . The CO 2 is captured with compression and dehydration membranes or physical solvents. Chemical plants iron steel and paper mills: Emit gas streams with 15–80% CO 2 . The CO 2 can be captured with physical solvents solid sorbents or membranes. Coal and natural gas power plants and boilers: Emit gas streams with less than 15% CO 2 . The CO 2 can be captured with chemical solvents. Ambient air: Has a CO 2 concentration around 0.041%. The CO 2 can be captured with metal-organic frameworks or chemical systems. Sources: Global CCS Institute National Petroleum Council.

But just one commercial power plant has carbon capture: the coal-fired Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan which captures 1 million t of CO 2 per year on one of its four generators. Carbon capture elsewhere on other industrial processes such as natural gas production adds another 27 plants and gathers 25 million t per year. Not nearly enough.

The people developing the technology that will make capturing carbon practical have gained unlikely allies in the past couple of years: the oil and gas companies responsible for the lion’s share of CO 2 emissions. Though these firms have had their eyes on carbon capture for some time Northington says they’re investing serious money in it now.

Data from the patent research firm Patent Seekers bear that notion out. Oil companies have gotten the largest number of carbon-capture patents in recent years followed by government agencies and research institutes universities and engineering and technology companies.

Klaus Lackner an engineering professor working on direct air capture at Arizona State University says the change in attitude is a result of pressure from two directions: competition from cheap renewable energy and public demand for low-carbon options. Major changes are coming to the energy market Lackner says. “The question isn’t ‘Will we have a transition?’ We will. The Exxons and Shells and other companies have to figure out how to make it through that transition. Their business model falls apart if you can’t have liquid fuels.”

Lackner says he’s been pushing fossil fuel companies on this point for years telling them “Your societal license to dump CO 2 into the air will go away. You need to figure out how to operate without needing that license.”

Matt Steyn a senior adviser with the advocacy wing of the Global CCS Institute (GCCSI) a carbon-capture-and-storage think tank says the change is also driven by the scientific consensus expressed by the IPCC and the International Energy Agency. “The target has been set; the timeline has been set” he says. The conversation has shifted from “What do we do?” to “How do we do it?”

As we deploy more plants costs will come down just as they have done in every other sector. Steve Oldham CEO Carbon Engineering

Carbon capture of all types is a gas-separation problem. The goal is pure CO 2  ideally at high pressure so it can go into a pipeline and be injected safely underground. For some industrial processes the capture technology available today works fine. In ammonia and corn ethanol plants for example the gas exiting exhaust pipes is 80% or more CO 2 and just needs to be dried and compressed for transport.

As the CO 2 in emissions gets more dilute the energy required to extract it rises. The emissions coming from steel plants and many chemical processes tend to be between 15 and 80% CO 2 . The flue gas from fossil fuel combustion in air such as in coal or natural gas–fired power plants is generally less than 15% CO 2 .

Capture with solvents

Ironically oil companies are some of the biggest practitioners of carbon capture today because they use solvents membranes and other technologies to remove CO 2 from natural gas deposits found in locations such as Russia and west Texas. When they use or sell that CO 2 instead of venting it that counts as carbon capture. That’s why ExxonMobil can claim to capture more CO 2 than any other company even if it uses most of that to push more oil out of the ground.

Amine-based extraction systems developed for natural gas processing have been adapted for other CO 2 sources such as the power plant in Saskatchewan but the energy cost of using such systems on more dilute streams is crushingly high. Second-generation solvent systems are poised to come to market next followed by membranes and solid sorbents. And numerous innovative and experimental approaches are racing to catch up.

Syrie Crouch vice president for carbon capture and storage at Shell which built the Saskatchewan plant says deploying capture where it’s simple is an important start. US ethanol makers for example capture only 3 million t of the 43 million t of CO 2 their plants produce each year. “The key is to capture that lowest-hanging fruit first and then work on down the cost curve” she says.

Incumbent amines

The most mature carbon-capture technologies today use solvents. These systems pump emissions through a solution that absorbs CO 2 but lets through other gases such as nitrogen. The CO 2 -rich solvent then flows into a boiler where heat drives the pure CO 2 back out of solution. That stripping step is the energy hog.

Though the terminology is harsh to a chemist’s ears carbon-capture solvents are considered either chemical or physical. Chemical solvents mostly amines such as the industry standard 30% monoethanolamine in water get a CO 2 -solubility boost through reversible chemical reactions with water and CO 2 that form carbonates bicarbonates and carbamates.

Physical solvents such as methanol rely on intermolecular interactions to dissolve CO 2 . Companies including Linde Air Products and UOP offer such systems commercially. They use less energy than chemical solvents but require high pressures and low temperatures. They’re not suitable for combustion flue gas but have been used for many years to remove CO 2 from natural gas.

Amine solvents have the advantage of being mature technology. The systems are well understood with well-characterized economics and risk profiles that investors know how to analyze. Dow Shell Fluor and others offer monoethanolamine solutions for carbon capture. Boundary Dam Unit 3 uses amines as did NRG Energy’s Petra Nova plant in Texas which captured more than 1 million t of CO 2 per year from 2017 until NRG shut it down in 2020.

BASF Linde General Electric and the start-up Carbon Clean are among those working on advanced amines. These systems use chemicals such as piperazine alongside or instead of monoethanolamine to get better stability kinetics and thermodynamics. The US Department of Energy recently awarded Linde and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign $47 million to build a 200 t per day pilot facility using an advanced amine solvent from BASF at a coal-fired power plant near Springfield Illinois.

But capturing CO 2 with amines comes at a steep cost. Fitted onto a power plant’s systems they consume 30–50% of the plant’s energy output. Most experts including Shell’s Crouch expect that amine systems can get only 10–20% more efficient. At the same time amines can seem like a safe bet compared with a next-generation technology. “If you’re making your first investment in carbon capture and storage you don’t necessarily want to be taking massive risks on something new and untested” the GCCSI’s Steyn says.

The next generation

At the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) and the Wyoming Integrated Test Center (ITC) two next-generation carbon-capture technologies that look promising are solid sorbents and membranes.

The NCCC and ITC sites are essentially coal-fired power plants that can pipe their flue gas into a series of testing bays. The NCCC tests systems at scales from less than 1 t per day up to about 25 t per day; tests at the ITC run between 25 and 450 t per day. The sites which use a combination of public and private financing serve as technology development bridges between lab-scale carbon-capture concepts and pilot-scale tests on commercial power plants.

The NCCC’s Northington says the incumbent amine systems can capture carbon at a cost of $60–$65 per metric ton. Advanced amines and other second-generation solvents are about $40 per metric ton. A handful of commercial installations that will use advanced amines are in early-stage engineering now he says. Solid sorbents membranes and other transformational technologies will reach $30 or less per metric ton he predicts.

“We want choice in the marketplace” says William Morris technical director of the ITC. “People are really trying to figure out what works for them not only in their industry but in their specific circumstance.”

Solid sorbents include zeolites metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) activated carbon and porous silica particles. They’re often functionalized with amine groups to increase their activity and make them more selective for CO 2 .

Generally solid sorbents have faster absorption kinetics than amines and require less energy to release the CO 2 again. They can also hold more CO 2 per unit volume than most solvents. That means that solid-sorbent systems can be smaller reducing capital costs and can be stripped of their CO 2 using vacuum or modest heat.

The start-up Svante forms solid sorbents into large nanoporous disks divided into slices like a pizza. On a giant turntable the disk slowly rotates each slice through a flue gas stream a CO 2 -stripping module and one or two sorbent preparation stations. The firm has a 10000 t per year demonstration plant on a natural gas–fired boiler in Canada. It raised $75 million in February to advance a design for cement plants.

In addition to Svante ExxonMobil Kawasaki Heavy Industries TDA Research and others are testing solid-sorbent systems for flue gas capture. Shell which is shifting its R&D to solid sorbents tested a system that uses amine-functionalized solid sorbents on a wood-burning power plant in Austria; it is now readying a scaled-up test at a manure-to-power plant in the Netherlands. After these trials Crouch says Shell will offer the technology on the open market.

Membranes are even further along than solid sorbents Morris says. Membrane systems use selectively permeable materials that exploit the small chemical and physical differences between CO 2 and the rest of a gas mixture to achieve separation. Like amines membranes are already being used in natural gas processing and other areas where CO 2 pressure and content are high.

“The next technology outside of amines that will deploy will be membranes” Morris predicts. He says membranes are coming fast for capturing CO 2 from flue gas at power plants. And Northington expects membranes will play a big role in carbon capture for the chemical industry and heavy manufacturing which have moderate to high CO 2 concentrations.

Getting any new carbon capture technology to market won’t be cheap. Morris says getting a robust set of data from testing at the ITC can cost seven figures. One membrane maker Membrane Technology and Research (MTR) won $52 million in funding in May from the US Department of Energy to do just that. MTR ran a 20 t per day version of its system for 1400 h at the NCCC in 2015 and will use the funds to scale it up to 150 t per day in Wyoming. The company expects to demonstrate capture at less than $40 per metric ton.

MTR’s membrane polymers are isoporous meaning their pores are uniform in size and arranged geometrically unlike the randomly arranged multisize pores in most gas-separation membranes. The regular pore pattern lets molecules flow more smoothly through the material lowering the amount of pressure needed relative to conventional membranes. And a tighter distribution of pore sizes increases selectivity for CO 2 .

Another membrane maker Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) also seeks to decrease costs by reducing pressure. CMS uses facilitated transport membranes which are specialized fluoropolymers coated onto a porous substrate. CEO Erica Nemser likens the mechanism to Tarzan swinging through the jungle on vines. The CO 2 is Tarzan and fluoropolymers decorated with activating groups act as the vines passing CO 2 along with minimal pressure needed.

The firm’s systems are already being used to separate olefins from paraffins and to remove water and dissolved gases from solvents oils and lubricants. The system that will capture CO 2 in flue gas will be a modification of one that’s in field trials now for removing CO 2 from biomethane. Chemical changes to the fluoropolymer make the membrane selective toward different chemical species Nemser says.

CMS’s units are built around membrane cartridges about twice the size of a can of spray paint—hence the “compact” in the company’s name. The bigger the gas stream to be treated the more cartridges the system uses. Chief Technology Officer Hannah Murnen says such modular systems will make carbon capture accessible for a wide range of CO 2 point sources. In contrast the towers needed to mix amine solvents with a gas stream and strip the CO 2 out later make economic sense only at enormous scales she says.

CMS says it will be able to deliver carbon capture for as little as $20 per metric ton. “It’s time for membranes. It’s membranes’ day in the sun” Murnen says.

Tomorrow’s tech

Amines may dominate carbon capture today and membranes and solid sorbents may be right on their heels but a need this serious—and a market this big—is attracting plenty of other contenders. And a good-enough concept could leap ahead if the people behind it can show it works and is scalable.

Saipem and Chart Industries both hope to adapt technology and equipment already in use in other chemical processes.

In January 2020 Saipem an energy technology and engineering firm acquired CO 2 Solutions a start-up that is using enzymes to boost the carbon-capture kinetics of aqueous potassium carbonate. K 2 CO 3 reacts with CO 2 and water to form potassium bicarbonate KHCO 3 . The bicarbonate solution releases its CO 2 at relatively low temperatures—around 75 °C under reduced pressure—meaning it can tap low-grade heat that most industrial processes would waste.

That chemistry has been used to scrub CO 2 from the air in submarines and other closed environments and in some high-CO 2 -concentration settings. The trouble is that the absorption kinetics are too slow for it to work well at flue gas concentrations and pressures; the contact towers would have to be even bigger than those used with amines.

To solve that problem Saipem catalyzes the reaction with the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Natural carbonic anhydrase is already one of the fastest enzymes speeding up the formation of HCO 3 – by a factor of 107. The team at CO 2 Solutions modified the enzyme to make it even faster and keep it active at higher temperatures.

“The first time I saw carbon capture with the enzyme my jaw just dropped because the catalyst is magic” says Richard Surprenant who came to Saipem from CO 2 Solutions and is now commercial manager for carbon-capture technologies.

Any industrial or postcombustion application is fair game for the firm’s technology Surprenant says and anywhere with low-grade waste or geothermal heat is an opportunity because it doesn’t need the high-grade heat a resource many plants already use in other ways. The firm is in the midst of restarting CO 2 Solutions’ first commercial plant a 30 t per day facility in Quebec that extracts CO 2 from a paper mill and sells it to a nearby greenhouse.

Chart Industries an energy and industrial gas equipment firm is also moving into carbon capture through acquisition and investment. In late 2020 Chart acquired Sustainable Energy Solutions a start-up making cryogenic carbon-capture systems for combustion flue gas. In June of this year it invested in Earthly Labs which uses cryogenics to capture CO 2 from breweries.

In the simplest terms both cryogenic systems chill their target gas streams until the CO 2 condenses into a solid or liquid. Nitrogen still a gas at those temperatures is pumped off. The basic process often called cryogenic distillation is already used to purify other industrial gases such as oxygen and nitrogen.

The challenge for flue gas is in the engineering not the chemistry according to Chart CEO Jill Evanko. If water and CO 2 freeze in the wrong places they can clog pipes and block heat exchangers. But with clever heat management system design and integration with the rest of the equipment Chart and its partners can deliver carbon capture of flue gas at half the cost of conventional amines Evanko says and make brewery carbon capture profitable enough to pay off the equipment in 18 months.

Several other technologies are in early-stage development. Solvents that use less water or no water at all including organic solvents and ionic liquids could reduce the amount of mass that needs to be heated to release the purified CO 2 . Allam cycle power plants burn hydrocarbons in a mix of O 2 and CO 2  sidestepping the need to separate CO 2 from nitrogen. And FuelCell Energy is commercializing its molten carbonate fuel cell which can capture flue gas carbon while generating additional electricity from natural gas.

It’s an exciting time for technology development the ITC’s Morris says. “Decarbonization is going to be very very difficult and it’s probably not going to be possible without technologies that are currently in the development stage.”

State of play



Direct air capture

Point-source carbon capture won’t be enough. The technology still lets 2–10% of the carbon through. And it’s hard to deploy on sources with diffuse or mobile emissions such as airplanes sprawling petrochemical plants and wide-open wastewater treatment facilities. Besides the atmosphere has too much carbon already. The goal of net-zero CO 2 emissions will require methods to remove carbon from the air.

This direct air capture or DAC works on chemical principles similar to those for point-source capture. The big difference is that our ambient air although overloaded is still only 410 ppm or 0.041% CO 2  much lower than even the most dilute industrial point sources. And that changes a lot about the devices and their economics.

Because flue gas and other point sources are releasing new carbon into the atmosphere the goal is to capture as much of it as possible—90% is a common target. In DAC the amount of carbon left behind isn’t important; it’s all about how much CO 2 can be removed per dollar spent. “My goal is not to make CO 2 -free air. My goal is to take CO 2 out of the air and I can choose where the optimal efficiency is” says Lackner the Arizona State engineer who is also developing DAC technology.

But however you look at it DAC is expensive. Carbon capture at an ethanol plant can cost as little as $10 per metric ton. At a coal-fired power plant the cost is around $60. DAC companies don’t like to talk about their costs but industry insiders estimate they are around $500 per metric ton. Lackner and other experts generally peg $100 as the point at which DAC will become cost competitive with other decarbonization methods.

Oxy Low Carbon Ventures a carbon-reduction subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum thinks it can reach that level in partnership with the start-up Carbon Engineering. The firms plan to build in the southwestern US what they say will be the world’s first commercial-scale DAC plant. It will capture 1 million t of CO 2 per year to be used mainly to boost production in Occidental’s oil wells in the region. The largest existing DAC plant captures a mere 2000 t per year according to Ryan Edwards low-carbon policy adviser for Oxy Low Carbon.

Carbon Engineering uses chemical looping to capture carbon from the air. In its process intended to run on renewable energy giant fans blow air over plastic surfaces that have aqueous potassium hydroxide flowing over it.

The KOH reacts with CO 2 to form potassium carbonate K 2 CO 3  which then flows into a pellet reactor containing aqueous calcium hydroxide Ca(OH) 2 . The calcium and potassium switch places to form CaCO 3  which precipitates out as solid pellets as well as KOH which is ready to cycle back to the plastic surfaces. The pellets then pass into a calciner a heater that decomposes the CaCO 3 into solid CaO and pure CO 2 . The CO 2 is cooled and pressurized and the CaO heads back to the pellet reactor where it mixes with water and re-forms Ca(OH) 2 .

The system sounds complicated but it’s built mostly out of reactions and equipment already in use in industry. The pellet reactor is adapted from papermaking. Calciners running the same chemical reaction are central to cement production and other versions come into play in glass uranium petroleum coke and gypsum processing.

Carbon Engineering published its process in 2018 projecting costs between $94 and $232 per metric ton (Joule DOI: 10.1016/j.joule.2018.05.006). CEO Steve Oldham says the firm is “extremely confident” its costs will be in that range and expects that second and third generations will ensure a cost of $100 or less. “As we deploy more plants costs will come down just as they have done in every other sector” Oldham says.

Mosaic Materials a developer of MOFs and one of C&EN’s 10 Start-Ups to Watch in 2019 pivoted to DAC from point-source capture 2 years ago according to CEO Thomas McDonald. In the past 3 months McDonald says he’s seen a sharp increase in interest in DAC.

The firm’s MOFs use a flavor of CO 2 -amine chemistry that McDonald calls cooperative binding in which the CO 2 inserts itself between a magnesium ion and an amine ligand. The mechanism gives the material high capacity and fast kinetics and it reverses at relatively low temperatures to release the CO 2  according to McDonald.

MOFs are more expensive than other solid sorbents such as silica or activated carbon. Mosaic researchers are working to improve the materials’ capacity and stability to reduce operating costs McDonald says. But the firm is focused more on lowering manufacturing costs and optimizing complete systems around its materials.

Mosaic worked with ExxonMobil on flue gas capture in 2017 and 2018 and has some ongoing work in that area along with collaborations with NASA and the US Navy on life-support systems McDonald says. But he sees DAC as the best way to build his company. “We see the fastest least-capital-intensive least-risky path is by achieving early scale on projects through direct air capture.”

We will require something roughly the size of the current oil and gas industry but with the molecules going in reverse. Syrie Crouch vice president for carbon capture and storage Shell

Lackner says DAC is a good fit with renewable energy. If a natural gas power plant is off because of low demand so is any point-source carbon-capture device attached to it. DAC on the other hand can run on renewable energy and stabilize electricity prices by being a customer of last resort.

In addition to his academic work Lackner is working to commercialize his own DAC concept which he calls MechanicalTrees. The “trees” eliminate the cost of running fans by relying on wind to move air across sorbents loaded onto disks arranged in a tower. When saturated with CO 2  the towers drop into a chamber where heat and vacuum remove the CO 2 at roughly 95% concentration.

Paying for it

All cool ideas but who’s putting up the cash? A provision of the US tax code called 45Q offers tax credits for capturing carbon. When the provision is fully in place in 2026 carbon that is captured and sequestered will be worth $50 per metric ton. CO 2 used to extract more hydrocarbons a widespread and controversial practice called enhanced oil recovery gets $35.

That $35 credit plus the $40 per metric ton that enhanced oil recovery operators pay for CO 2 on average make that market the most profitable for non-food-grade CO 2 even with the lower credit (Front. Clim. 2019 DOI: 10.3389/fclim.2019.00005).

That makes the economic rationale for carbon-capture products dependent on the price of oil. That dynamic is what doomed the Petra Nova carbon-capture facility when the price of oil got too low during the pandemic. Still Oxy Low Carbon executives are prepared to depend on enhanced oil recovery for their southwestern US DAC project.

Despite such bumps carbon capture offers a way to decarbonize combustion and other CO 2 -emitting processes so they can remain part of a net-zero world. That’s both a selling point and a point of criticism. Critics such as Greenpeace say carbon capture diverts resources away from renewables and keeps polluters in business.

Your societal license to dump CO 2 into the air will go away. You need to figure out how to operate without needing that license. Klaus Lackner engineer Arizona State University

Critics also point out that almost all the CO 2 captured to date has been used in enhanced oil recovery. In the best cases enough CO 2 stays permanently in the ground after such oil extraction that the resulting fuel has net-negative CO 2 emissions. But many enhanced oil recovery projects don’t meet that goal (Energies 2019 DOI: 10.3390/en12030448).

“To put it very brutally in the beginning I don’t care” where the captured CO 2 goes Lackner says. The technology needs to start scaling up now. He points to a recent report from the International Energy Agency detailing a path to net zero by 2050. In that scenario point-source capture has to scale up from about 40 million t per year today to 6.6 billion t in 2050 and DAC has to grow from a few thousand metric tons per year to almost 1 billion t in 2050.

If enhanced oil recovery operators are willing to be early adopters that get carbon capture down to a cost that the market will bear Lackner says that’ll have to do. “The only way you get there is by learning. Most industries gain 10–20% in cost reduction for every doubling of cumulative output” he says. “If we follow normal learning curves I’m allowed to be optimistic. If it turns out we derail from that the sooner we know the better off we are.”

Shell’s Crouch agrees that industry needs to start deploying carbon capture now to reach the necessary scale. “We will require something roughly the size of the current oil and gas industry but with the molecules going in reverse” she says.

Building all those plants will cost $655 billion to $1280 billion over the next 3 decades according to a recent analysis by the GCCSI. That’s a lot of money but Brad Page CEO of the GCCSI points out in a press release that “investing around one trillion dollars over almost 30 years is well within the capacity of the private sector which invested almost two trillion dollars in the energy sector in 2018 alone. Government decisions hold the key to enabling the requisite private sector capital being allocated for [carbon capture and storage] deployment.”

One proposal the US Congress is considering now would add a higher credit for carbon captured from the air. The idea has broad bipartisan support according to Oxy Low Carbon’s Edwards. At a recent panel discussion hosted by the nonprofit OurEnergyPolicy he expressed confidence that enhanced incentives R&D and deployment support and funding for infrastructure for CO 2 transport and storage could all become law in the current session of Congress.

Jeremy Harrell the managing director for policy at the energy-transition nonprofit ClearPath and another OurEnergyPolicy panelist said he expects the Biden administration to launch a 50:50 cost-sharing initiative to deploy a first wave of carbon-capture facilities. “We think that sends a really important market signal to the private sector as they look to invest in these technologies” he said at the event. “The politics here are going to play out well over the next 18 months and people should stay tuned.”

The administration’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year includes a 61% increase in spending at the Department of Energy on carbon capture use and storage though the $368 million total is far short of what many climate activists would like to see.

Edwards says 45Q has opened the door to commercial-scale carbon-capture projects. Since Congress extended 45Q in 2018 and removed the cap on the number of credits available 30 to 40 new projects have been publicly proposed he says which would more than double the global number. Between projects that are being kept quiet for now and new ones that will be unlocked if Congress expands 45Q that increase is “just the tip of the iceberg” Edwards says.

It’ll need to be. Right now 28 point-source capture and DAC plants are active including at Boundary Dam and nonpower installations according to the GCCSI.

We're all going to die. Black or white rich or poor religious or not it doesn't matter. We're all mortal.



Even though we know that universal truth laying a loved one to rest is always heartbreaking especially if he or she was as faithful kind and caring as was Vanessa Hudson.



I think it's best if possible to reflect on the good times when we're saying good bye to someone we dearly loved. So I will start this column about Vanessa with something humorous.



If you knew Vanessa you knew she was a constant presence at Old Dominion University athletic events. She was the younger sister of Carol Hudson the former longtime ODU sports information director and when she wasn't working or volunteering at her church she was at ODU.



""My first two years at ODU"" said former basketball star Kenny Gattison ""I thought Vanessa worked for ODU. She was always there.""



Several years ago when I was covering ODU football for The Virginian-Pilot I spied Vanessa on the other side of the press box at Foreman Field. It had been months since we'd seen each other so we hugged (she was a great hugger) and kissed each other on the cheek and then talked for a few minutes.



Just friends saying hello but it could have easily been misinterpreted as something more for those who didn't know us.



Then I looked into the TV monitor just a few feet away and saw that our hugging and kissing was being broadcast (with a seven-second delay) on national TV.



Later she said she got messages from people wanting to know if she had a new boyfriend. When I sat back down on press row I had text messages and emails from friends who wanted to know who that beautiful woman was.







Beautiful? Yes that described Vanessa both inside and out. She may be the sweetest person I ever met.



And did she ever love her brother. They were young when their parents died and lived together ever since in a modest home close to Norfolk State.



I've never seen a brother and sister who did more to take care of each other. It is impossible to describe how close they were.



She was younger than Carol but fussed over him like his Mom. Ken Samet who worked with me at the Mace and Crown student newspaper when we attended ODU recalls one time when Carol was taking a train to come see him.



Ken by the way is President and Chief Executive Officer of Medstar Health a $5.8 billion healthcare system. He made a donation that made it possible for the press room at Chartway Arena to be named for Carol.



Vanessa called Ken not once but twice to make sure he knew when and where to pick up Carol.



""Vanessa you know he's a grown-up man don't you?"" Samet asked.



She laughed and said she knew that. But it didn't matter. She ran the household. She took care of her brother. And when she wasn't busy at her job with a local bank she helped the hungry and homeless while working for her church.



Both Carol and Vanessa are faithful Catholics graduates of old Norfolk Catholic High School and members of the Basilica of St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception in downtown Norfolk. It is a beautiful church whose congregation is majority African American.



The last few years it was Carol's turn to take care of his sister. She came down with cancer and although there were times when she looked like she might have beaten the odds the cruel beast that kills so many good people eventually took her life.



Vanessa was 61 when she died on July 3.



You may have read me write this before but I'll say it again: Old Dominion University's athletic department is a family. We care about each other. It's something you can't appreciate unless you work here.



That was apparent at Vanessa's visitation at the Paul Riddick Funeral Home on July 12 and her funeral on July 13. The Riddick building was full of ODU officials coaches athletes and so many other ODU friends most of the day.



Athletic Director Wood Selig cut his vacation a day short to attend her funeral. Most people who work in the Jim Jarrett Athletic Building joined him as did a host of former players coaches and fans.



Former ODU basketball coach Paul Webb who is 92 years old was driven by his son Eddie Webb to the graveside service at Forest Lawn Cemetery and Carol hugged him like he was his father.







This has been such a difficult year for Carol. His best friend long-time ODU supporter and Chesapeake Sheriff Claude Stafford died just three months ago.



Although she was weakened by cancer and knew that if she was exposed to COVID that it would be deadly Vanessa insisted on attending Claude's funeral to say good bye to her friend.



It has been a difficult year for ODU athletics in general. In the last year we lost former head basketball coach Sonny Allen former baseball coach Mark Newman Annette Finwood the wife of baseball coach Chris Finwood and former field hockey All-American Maaike Hilbrand.



Last week the fragile nature of life was exposed again when Grant Gardner ODU's associate director of communications lost his uncle David Jones and Jones' dear friend Jennifer O'Connell.



They were killed by a Chesapeake man who while trying to elude the police crashed into their car. I met David Jones and few loved ODU football and basketball more than he did.



The entire ODU basketball coaching staff was on the road recruiting but everyone called and texted Grant.



Vanessa was eulogized by the Father Jim Curran during a Catholic funeral at the Basilica. And as a good priest should do he gave the believers in the crowd inspiring words of comfort and left many in tears.



Frankly the few quotes below don't do justice to his powerful and emotional message.



""Vanessa had the kind of faith when things were not going the way she wanted them to when things were not going the way they should when she felt the pain she felt sadness she felt the disappointment she felt the fear she always trusted in the steadfast love of God"" he said.



""Because faith in that steadfast love of God is what gives us the strength and courage to endure the trials that life throws at us. And life threw some at Vanessa.



""I didn't know Vanessa her whole life but I knew her for nine years. It was impossible to be a member of this church and not know Vanessa. She was always here always here.



""And when I went to visit her and she was struggling with this cancer there were times when she got good news and times when she got bad news from the doctors.



""But always always regardless of what news the doctors said her faith in God was steadfast. She knew whatever way this was going to end for her that the ultimate story is going to be God's love cannot be defeated.



""God's presence is so steadfast that there is not a power on heaven earth or in hell that can separate us from him. Vanessa faced her death with that kind of faith.



""She knew when the Lord wanted her to work and when the Lord just wanted her to sit and 'let me feed you sit at my feet and let me fill you with grace and power.' And the wonderful thing about Vanessa is that she chose that every time.



""She chose to let Jesus comfort her to let the steadfast love of Jesus guide her life.



""We are saddened by the death of our friend and our sister. We are sad that a light in our life has been taken out. But we are not without hope and we are without faith. Our faith is in a love of Jesus that not even death can take away from us.""



Roger Chesley a former Virginian-Pilot columnist who writes for the Virginia Mercury often served as an ecumenical minister with Vanessa. And he confirmed what Father Curran said that she was steadfast in her love of Christ and was at the church almost daily.



""She's at peace now. There's no more pain no more sadness"" he said.



""But I think a lot about brother because it was just the two of them.""



It was just the two of them.



But ODU is a family and we're going to take care of Carol.







Carol is a living legend among those who know ODU athletics. He joined the ODU basketball team as a manager in 1974 and was there when the Monarchs won the 1975 Division II national men's basketball title.



He was ODU's sports information director for more than three decades. No one knows more about ODU's history or loves the University more than Carol Hudson.



Whenever we have a question about players or big games even from decades ago when we call Carol he has the answers.



The light blue that ODU sometimes wears the color that the University of North Carolina insists is Carolina Blue we called ""Hudson Blue"" at our University in honor of our good friend Carol.



Carol attended every home football basketball and baseball game even after he retired until the pandemic began. He stopped coming to ODU events because he knew that if he came down with COVID or the flu or even a cold it could be deadly for his sister.



It was difficult for him to miss watching ODU's best baseball team ever win 44 games this season. But like I said it's difficult to express how much Carol and Vanessa loved each other.



Carol we can't wait to see working again in the football press box along press row at Chartway Arena or at Bud Metheny Stadium keeping score for the baseball team.



If you know Carol reach out to him. If you want to send him a message email it to me and I'll make sure he gets it.



His sister was part of our family.



""Vanessa was an insititution at Old Dominion"" Selig said. ""She's been a part of the family here for decades.""



If nothing else we owe it to her to take care of her brother.

It's a trope at this point but it's been done right several times in recent memory by clear fans of Alan Jackson (he couldn't water ski in the ""Chattahoochee"" video without a boat after all) and his ""It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere"" collaborator Jimmy Buffett.

A boating playlist not limited by genre or time frame could include everything from Styx's ""Come Sail Away"" and the Hues Corporation's ""Rock the Boat"" to Lyle Lovett's ""If I Had a Boat"" Sheryl Crow's ""Soak Up the Sun"" Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat (Day-O)"" and the Beach Boys' version of ""Sloop John B."" But for the sake of brevity and to keep the focus on country music we selected these six boating songs that'll be stuck in your head the next time you party at a lake house or order a frozen concoction from Margaritaville.

""Knee Deep"" ""Zac Brown Band (with Jimmy Buffett)

The Zac Brown Band never stays in a particular musical lane gifting us on occasion with such nautical-themed songs as this Buffett collaboration. ZBB tracks with similar vibes range from fan favorite ""Toes"" to the more recent allegory ""Same Boat.""

""Boats"" Kenny Chesney

Quite a few Kenny Chesney songs from the past 20 years qualify for this list with ""No Shoes No Shirt No Problems"" being the obvious choice. Yet we decided to go with this sentimental slow-burner about ""vessels of freedom"" co-written by Chesney Scotty Emerick and George Strait's go-to songwriter Dean Dillon.

""Buy Me a Boat"" Chris Janson

Wanna-be boat owners can relate to Chris Janson's daydream about inheriting enough from a relative to trade in working 9-to-5 for a carefree life. It's a diamond from a time (2015 to be specific) some write off as offering nothing more than ""bro-country"" coal.

""Pontoon"" Little Big Town

The vocal group that steals the show on most awards shows and televised specials celebrates country folks' typical weekends on the lake not nautical getaway fantasies with this No. 1 hit from 2012. Like many of the better country hits from the past 15 years or so it connects with a broad audience because it deals with the simple pleasures of life.

""Redneck Yacht Club"" Craig Morgan

Craig Morgan followed Travis Tritt's lead and shared his club membership situation in song back in 2005. One of catchiest country hits from the early aughts brought us one of the few music videos that compares favorably to the visual accompaniment for Jackson's bottomless source of memes ""Chattahoochee.""

""I Was on a Boat That Day"" Old Dominion

The freshest cut on our list deserves consideration as one of 2021's songs of the summer along with Willie Jones' ""Down By the Riverside"" and its boat-themed music video. It's a healthy mix of fun in the sun vibes and biting post-breakup sarcasm reminiscent of Brad Paisley's ""I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song).""

Honorable mention songs: ""Boat Names"" by Brian Kelley and ""For a Boat"" by Luke Bryan",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpbG90b25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzE3L2FuLW9jZWFuZnJvbnQtY29uZG8tY29sbGFwc2VkLWluLWZsb3JpZGEtY291bGQtdGhhdC1oYXBwZW4tYWxvbmctdmlyZ2luaWFzLWNvYXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An oceanfront condo collapsed in Florida. Could that happen along Virginia's coast?,"On the last Wednesday in June residents of a 12-story oceanfront condo in Surfside Florida went to bed with no reason to believe the building would crumble to the ground. Then it did.

Now questions abound: Why did the collapse occur could it happen to buildings along the Virginia coast and should we be worried?

Building collapses are very rare and if they occur there likely will be warning signs.

Still in Virginia like states across the country few mandates exist when it comes to proactive inspections and making sure condominiums have money on hand for repairs. Once construction is complete maintaining structural integrity of a building falls to those who own and live in them — a fact that has come under more scrutiny since the Florida collapse.

Building owners in Virginia are required to have periodic inspections of certain systems — such as elevators and fire protection systems — but there are no requirements to regularly inspect building structure.

“Outside of the rental inspection program there are no state mandated requirements in the USBC for ‘routine checks’ of a building’s facade and exterior walls” said Alexis Carey public relations director of the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development.

After final inspection approval or certificate of occupancy there is no general requirement for the reinspection of buildings in the state unless there’s a change in occupancy or alterations that require inspection.

In Miami-Dade County where Surfside is located all buildings except single-family residences duplexes and minor structures that are 40 years or older must be recertified by the county’s building official.

In Virginia Beach once construction is complete “our authority is limited to responding to complaints or addressing maintenance code violations observable from a ‘windshield’ inspection — things inspectors find while driving around” city spokeswoman Julie Hill said in an email to The Pilot.

The Virginia Department of Health inspects hotels motels and bed-and-breakfasts annually for compliance with the Sanitary Regulations for Hotels. These regulations include standards for general sanitary living conditions pest control bathroom cleanliness and trash removal.

If structural concerns arise during those annual checks the department of health would relay that information to the city’s code enforcement division. There are provisions in the Virginia Maintenance Code that address buildings deemed to be unsafe or improperly maintained.

Virginia is one of nine states that requires a visual assessment of the communal components of condominium buildings such as the roof or pool area according to the Community Associations Institute.

The studies which must happen at least once every five years allow associations to try to determine how long it will be before any such components need repair or replacement and to estimate the cost of such upkeep.

“We can never determine when exactly something will fail” said Peter Miller a reserve specialist at Miller Dodson Associates a capital reserve consulting firm headquartered in Annapolis Maryland. “But we can say for example based on the current condition of the roof we think you should have the funding available for repairs in the next five years.”

The cause of the Surfside condo collapse remains unknown. A host of concerns have emerged in the weeks since the tragedy focusing fresh attention on regulations for high-rise and coastal properties.

A 3-year-old report from a consultant documented “major structural damage” to the concrete below the building’s pool deck as well as cracks in parts of the parking garage.

Rescue crews have recovered 97 bodies from the rubble with a handful still unaccounted for as of Friday morning.

Across Hampton Roads seaside apartments and hotels are aplenty.

Virginia Beach Hotel Association President John Zirkle did not respond to repeated requests for comment about how local hotels are approaching building safety and whether the Florida tragedy has spurred owners to make sure their buildings are structurally sound.

Regulations requiring ongoing inspections and maintenance vary from state to state and sometimes city to city and different parts of the country face different challenges.

Shahin Nayyeri Amiri a lecturer in Old Dominion University’s Civil Engineering Department said residents and building owners should always be on the lookout for warning signs in buildings tall and short. “Structural integrity generally will not depend on building height” he said.

These signs include cracked or crumbling concrete uneven or bowing walls diagonal cracks at the corners of windows and doors wall rotation sagging floors and excessive snow or water on a roof.

“Often simple timely repairs can prevent thousands of dollars in damage” he added. And maybe lives too.

This can also apply to the various components working to fix problems as difficult as board simplification to as seemingly simple as brightness. One component that recently showed a rush of releases is LED drivers.

Recently LED driver releases from leading electronic component manufacturers Maxim Integrated STMicroelectronics and ON Semiconductor promise greater performance in various electronic applications. These products offer advanced functionalities and application-sensitive dimming capabilities a potential industry standard in future driver releases.

This article aims to explore these recent releases their similarities and key applications in LED lighting.

Uninterrupted Brightness with Maxim's Integrated LED Driver

The MAX25512 a new LED backlight driver from Maxim Integrated promises uninterrupted brightness for in-car displays. This recent announcement noted its simple design amidst its advanced capabilities as well as some of its key advantages:

High component integration

Low cold crank and start-stop voltage

Small size

High component integration

This driver integrates a boost converter and current sense resistor. Although it removes the external MOSFET that supports automotive displays it further integrates an I2C communication interface to display diagnostics and settings and a hybrid dimming function to limit electromagnetic interference.

The exclusion of the external MOSFET and high integration of its components makes the MAX25512 a small-sized LED backlight solution.

Another key feature of this driver is how it retains thorough round-the-clock in-car display brightness during extreme start-stop and cold crank conditions.

This feature is achieved because of its low input voltage (3 V) and its ability to operate efficiently at a switching frequency ranging from 400 kHz to 2.2 MHz. The driver also ensures a safer and higher-quality display by featuring advanced diagnostic functions. One such function is short to ground which is on its current sinks with state-of-the-art alert capabilities

The ability of such a design to withstand cold crank conditions allows for a wide range of applications. Its availability in a compact TQFN package claims to reduce board space up to 30% in addition to lowering the bill of material (BOM) costs. Additionally it circumvents the need for a pre-boost converter while protecting the displays from power disruptions.

Though Maxim created an innovative way to free up board space the next LED driver attempts to provide constant brightness.

STMicroelectronics’ LED Driver Targets Constant Brightness

The ALED6000 LED driver recently released by STMicroelectronics is suitable for both interior and exterior LED lighting. The design is a mix of high component integration and flexibility. Being a single-chip automotive LED driver with an integrated DC-DC converter provides consistent brightness regardless of the vehicle's electrical conditions.

This driver can also drive a single string of LEDs in automotive stoplights headlights turn signals rear lights daytime running lights and interior lights. It has an extensive input voltage range from 4.5 to 61 V. STMicroelectronics also claims to have equipped it with a dedicated pin to apply pulse width modulation (PWM) control signals and advanced digital dimming capabilities.

The design flexibility that the LED driver offers could be beneficial in powering LED strings with voltage requirements above or below its input voltage. It also claims to efficiently handle voltage supply fluctuations. Other specifications of this LED driver include:

Its adherence to the AEC-Q100 standards

A DC output current of up to 3 A

Switching frequency range of 250 kHz to 1.5 MHz

Low quiescent current: 2.4mA during operation and 11µA at shutdown

A ~3.2% accuracy level of its output current

The ability to adjust its current limitation

This LED driver's flexibility could provide useful depending on the design; however what if your design is RF-sensitive?

ON Semiconductor Targets RF-sensitive Applications

Following the wakes of the last two releases two new LED drivers have also recently been released by ON Semiconductor namely the NCL31000 and NCL31001. Both drivers aim to be suitable for lighting up airports warehouses supermarkets hospitals and more. These new releases could add accurate positioning and data intelligence to lighting solutions and OEMs can also now incorporate visible light communication and light-based positioning technologies into their LED lighting designs.

A few specifications of ON Semiconductor’s new LED drivers include:

Switching frequency ranges from 44.4kHz to 1MHz

A 21.5V to 57V input voltage range

Linear dimming to zero current with 0.1% accuracy

A 48-pin 7-by-7 QFN package

Simple design and high efficiency

I2C/SPI interface

−40°C to 125°C junction temperature

Accurate current/voltage measurements with diagnostic functions

Typically RF-based LED solutions can be inappropriate in many RF-sensitive applications (such as those related to lighting mines aerospace and hospitals). Despite this the NCL31000 and NCL31001 LED drivers could be beneficial because they claim to ensure accurate linear dimming as an alternative to RF-based solutions.

Being able to dim down to zero current can help eliminate ghost light in the lowest dim settings. These drivers simplify designs and boost efficiency by incorporating a 3V3 fixed DC-DC converter and a DC-DC (2.5 to 24 V) that is adjustable.

After covering these three new LED driver solutions let's see how they stack up to one another.

Similarities Between Maxim STMicro and ON Semi’s New LED Drivers

As all three of the above companies released a new LED driver recently the below list covers some similarities between what each manufacturer claims to have achieved:

A low bill of materials

Constant brightness

Accurate dimming capabilities

Efficient power fluctuation handling

The application of the I2C communication interface

High component integration

The manufacturers’ LED drivers do however differ in the following areas from field application to temperature.

While the MAX25512 is appropriate for in-car displays the ALED6000 is well suited for interior and exterior automotive LED lighting solutions. The NCL31000 and NCL31001 on the other hand were designed for non-automotive applications altogether: supermarkets warehouses hospitals airport lighting and more.

When it comes to input voltage ranges Maxim STMicro and ON Semi’s products all have different input voltage ranges respectively: 3 V for the MAX25512 4.5 to 61 V for the ALED6000 and 21.5 to 57 V for the two ON Semiconductor LED drivers.

As for switching frequency each of the three manufacturer’s LED drivers possesses varying switching frequencies: notably the MAX25512 has the highest at 400 kHz to 2.2 MHz.

Finally as for operating temperature Maxim’s MAX25512 and STMicro’s NCL31000 and NCL31001 devices share an operating temperature range of −40°C to 125°C; however the ALED6000 is notably higher at −40°C to 150°C.

By looking at these stark differences it is important to consider the design requirements. OEMs EEs and other designers must consider factors such as the above areas particularly regarding the differences that occur from one device to another. For instance when a manufacturer attempts to select the most efficient LED solution for their design goals one LED driver may have a unique feature that will prove valuable: for example ON Semi’s advanced diagnostic capabilities.

LED Driver Trends

Intuitive designs and dimming features are the new trends in the latest LED drivers. Companies such as Maxim Integrated STMicroelectronics and ON Semiconductor have promoted simplicity by eliminating the need for an external MOSFET and high component integration while boosting their technological capabilities. Plus all four LED drivers claim to incorporate advanced dimming functionalities that offer several benefits in a wide range of applications. And in the near future these trends could even become a type of standard in the industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIxLzA3LzE3LzIwMDM3NjA5NzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel exploring potential deal for GlobalFoundries,"Intel exploring potential deal for GlobalFoundries

Bloomberg





Intel Corp is exploring a deal to acquire semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries Inc the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.

Closely held GlobalFoundries controlled by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Co could be valued at about US$30 billion the report said.

The deal is not guaranteed and GlobalFoundries might continue to pursue an initial public offering the paper said adding that the talks do not appear to include GlobalFoundries itself.

A spokesperson for Santa Clara California-based Intel declined to comment on the report and GlobalFoundries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Any bid for GlobalFoundries would buttress Intel’s ambitious plan to regain its once unmatched lead in chip production. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger who took the top job in February has pledged to restore the company to its dominant role in manufacturing and computer processors after losing ground to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) and others.

He is also moving to take on those rivals directly by opening the doors of Intel’s plants to other chipmakers including competitors and has said he would spend heavily to build new factories specifically to serve as foundries for others.

“We’re going to be leaders in the market and we’re going to satisfy the new foundry customers” Gelsinger told journalists after taking over as CEO. “Because the world needs more semiconductors and we’re going to step into that gap in a powerful and meaningful way.”

Intel with a market value of more than US$225 billion had US$22.4 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the end of the first quarter.

GlobalFoundries has been planning an IPO that could value the chipmaker at about US$30 billion Bloomberg News has reported.

GlobalFoundries was created when Mubadala bought Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s manufacturing facilities in 2009 and later combined them with Singapore’s Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.

Contract chipmakers like GlobalFoundries TSMC and Samsung fabricate semiconductors for large tech companies such as Apple Inc Nvidia Corp and Amazon.com Inc. GlobalFoundries in April said it is moving its headquarters to Malta New York the site of a major chipmaking plant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLmNvbS9lbGVjdHJvbmljcy9nbG9iYWxmb3VuZHJpZXMtc2V0LXRvLWFubm91bmNlLW55LWZhYi1leHBhbnNpb24tYXMtaW50ZWwtYnV5b3V0LXJlcG9ydHMtc3dpcmzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GlobalFoundries set to announce NY fab expansion as Intel buyout reports swirl,"Intel’s reported interest in acquiring GlobalFoundries comes as the Malta-NewYork-based company has embarked on a multi-billion-dollar program to expand its foundry capabilities on multiple continents.

The latest step in that expansion may be announced Monday. A report from the Albany Business Review suggested that GlobalFoundries is due this week to announce a major expansion of its New York facility. The company also said in an email to Fierce Electronics this weekend that on Monday it is making “a significant announcement about GF’s global expansion plans and commitment to addressing the imbalance between supply and demand in the semiconductor industry.”

GlobalFoundries moved its headquarters from Santa Clara California to Malta in New York’s Saratoga County the site of one of its existing foundries just a few months ago.

This announcement looms after GF last month announced it is investing $4 billion to build a new factory in Singapore according to a Bloomberg report which also stated that the company was planning similar investments in sites in the U.S. and Germany.

If GF announces the U.S. expansion Monday the news will come just a few days after The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel is interested in acquiring GF for around $30 billion which is roughly the same amount of money GF owner Mudabala Investment Co. has been hoping to raise through a planned IPO.

Both the GF expansion program and Intel’s reported acquisition interest come against the backdrop of geopolitics becoming a larger factor than ever in the semiconductor manufacturing landscape.

Last week during a SEMI virtual event the group’s research director said that “geopolitics” had become with unexpected quickness a major factor in the investment of manufacturing facilities. The pandemic-influenced worldwide chip shortages dating back to early 2020 highlighted how a semiconductor industry filled with fabless chip companies had become increasingly dependent on manufacturers clustered in Asia such as Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung as well as a rapidly growing number of Chinese firms.

As a result and as concerns about China’s influence technology markets have continued to grow the U.S. federal government the European Union and other individual countries have expressed desires to see semiconductor manufacturing become more geographically diversified. In the U.S. case Congress and the Biden administration have made it clear they want the U.S. to once again become a leading base of operations for chip foundries and other elements of the manufacturing process after watching the nation’s influence in that arena wane over the last three decades.

The latest move in GF’s expansion program directly answers that call as would an Intel acquisition of GF as it would take GF’s ownership out of the hands of an investment fund of the government of Abu Dhabi. Intel could be a more engaged owner willing to invest in further manufacturing upgrades and innovations.

“With so much criticism of foreign dominance in this space anything the [U.S.] government could do to show they are ‘bringing tech back home’ would be good” added Jack Gold principal analyst at J. Gold Associates via email. “That could certainly play in Intel’s favor as well as it looks to get more government help… I guess almost everything in tech these days has some political ramifications.”

“The combination of Intel’s immense resources and extensive expertise in this space in conjunction with GlobalFoundries existing business and established global presence could be a significant boon for both entities and disrupt the semiconductor foundry market” said Marco Chiappetta principal analyst HotTech Vision And Analysis.

Intel already has set itself on a course to grow its own manufacturing capacity. The company earlier this year announced it would invest $20 billion in two Arizona fabs for example. “This is about Intel going back into the foundry business wanting to increase its capacity” said Ben Sheen Research Director Enabling Technologies: Networking & Communications Infrastructure at IDC “GlobalFoundries is very global but a New York-based fab is what Intel probably wants the most to help them meet this growing demand for more on-shore sources of wafers.”

Turn! Turn!” didn’t sound like anything else on the radio when it hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts in 1965.

For starters the lyrics came from the Book of Ecclesiastes noting “there is a season and a time for every purpose under Heaven. A time to be born a time to die. A time to plant a time to reap. A time to kill a time to heal. A time to laugh a time to weep.”

What critics failed to realize said Byrds co-founder Chris Hillman was that covering the Pete Seeger classic was a logical move for musicians steeped in American roots music. Songs about struggle glory sacrifice and faith were common in early ’60s folk concerts.

“Where did all of our music come from? Blues and gospel. … White church Black church the music all came from church” said Hillman in a recent interview. “With the Byrds we went right to that well. We didn’t think twice about it. We didn’t say ‘We can’t do a Christian song.'”

Hillman’s musical roots became more obvious as the Byrds ventured into what many started calling “country rock” especially with the landmark “Sweetheart of the Rodeo” album in 1968. Bluegrass country and gospel themes played a larger role as Hillman began writing songs for the Byrds and his later bands.

While the Byrds put him in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame it was Hillman’s grassroots connections that made history according to the legend who produced his “Bidin’ My Time” solo project in 2017. The late Tom Petty said: “Chris was a true innovator – the man who invented country rock. Every time the Eagles board their private jet Chris at least paid for the fuel.”

That musical and spiritual journey is clear in Hillman’s recent autobiography “Time Between” with its mix of rock lore and personal reflections. Rather than offering a tell-all about sex drugs and rock ‘n’ roll Hillman focuses on lessons he learned along the way and his love for the musicians who flaws and all helped him.

Hillman grew up near San Diego in an interfaith home – Jewish and Presbyterian – in which strong values were important but not organized religion. Then his father’s suicide rocked their world and forced the family’s move to Los Angeles. That’s where Hillman’s emerging bluegrass skills led to an unlikely audition at age 19 with the folk group that became the Byrds. The rest is music history.

Eventually Hillman’s demons attacked his life and music. By the late ’70s he notes in the book: “I couldn’t outrun or bury my own pain. My long-held internal anger was reaching its highest point as my father’s suicide continued to haunt me. … I was making choices that contributed to my restlessness and unhappiness. So much of that self-destructiveness I now realize was rooted in anger.”

In one 1977 song “Clear Sailin’” he sang: “Yes I’ve turned my back on you Jesus and I hope you understand. Seems like everybody’s got an answer and nobody’s got a plan. ‘Cause I felt buried buried alive. Satan I sure know your sign and this feeling deep inside makes me wanna shrivel up and die. And I still find myself asking why.”

Hillman wasn’t a Christian at that time but found it natural to use religious language when asking big questions since that was normal in bluegrass and country culture. At the same time he was surrounded by talented Christians including pedal-steel maestro Al Perkins Eagle Bernie Leadon songwriting partner Steve Hill and Byrds co-founder Roger McGuinn who had become an evangelical Christian. Hillman also met music-business professional Connie Pappas who he married in 1979. After becoming an evangelical Hillman joined his wife in Orthodox Christianity in 1997.

“Time Between” opens with a scene connecting these themes when their California home was threatened by a 2017 brush fire. With minutes to pack Hillman grabbed two beloved musical instruments family photos crucial papers the family dog Daisy and Orthodox icons from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and Mount Sinai.

UNFORTUNATELY scam emails are becoming common place in inboxes and some are much harder to spot than others.

Below is an example of a scam PayPal email and how you can tell that it's fake.

2 The name of the scammer's account has been changed to ""PayPal Service"" but the actual email address is not associated with PayPal

2 The scam email tries to make victims panic so they give away their details Credit: Charlotte Edwards

The above scam looks very convincing but there are a few ways to tell that it's fake and you shouldn't click the link it directs you to.

Suspicious email address

Firstly the phishing email hasn't been sent from an official PayPal email account.

The name of the scammer's account has been changed to ""PayPal Service"" but the actual email address is a Google Groups one and it's full of odd letters and numbers.

You can check the email address associated with an account name by hovering over the account name at the top of the email or clicking on it.

Anything other than an official email address is a red flag.

Attempt to make you panic

A lot of phishing emails include an attempt to make the victim panic.

The above email states in bold ""Your PayPal account has been temporarily restricted"" and goes on to claim you won't be able to receive and make payments or take funds.

This is an attempt from the scammer to try and make you give away your details quickly before you've had time to think.

PayPal has previously said that you'd be told about any problems with your account via the message centre in the website and app.

The company would not email you asking for ""documents confirming your identity"".

If you want to check if there has been a problem on your account go to the official PayPal website login and check.

Poor phrasing

Poor phrasing is another good way to spot an email scam.

Watch out for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.

The fake email example above is concerning because it looks very official and doesn't appear to have mistakes.

However PayPal has said it would never address you as ""Dear Customer"" or ""Dear"" and then your email address.

Instead it would address you by the name associated with the account.

If a scammer gets your name wrong that could be a big giveaway sign so they tend to go for a more general greeting.

PayPal told us: ""At PayPal we go to great lengths to protect our customers but there are still a few simple precautions we should all take to avoid falling victim to scams.

""All communications from PayPal to account holders would be sent to the secure message centre within their PayPal account. You will have a secure message waiting if PayPal does need you to take any action.

""A genuine PayPal email will only ever address you by your full name – anything that starts differently should immediately raise your suspicions. Look out for spelling mistakes which are a common tell-tale sign of a fraudulent message.""

Tips

Remember to never click a suspicious link in an email or give your personal details away unless you're 100% sure it's to an official source.

You can report any scam PayPal emails you receive to spoof@paypal.com and the company will investigate.

If you have accidentally given away login details go to your account immediately and change your password and security questions.

Contributing to a Roth IRA (individual retirement account) might not seem like a surefire way to wealth until you take a peek at Peter Thiel's portfolio.

Last month ProPublica released Roth IRA data for the tech entrepreneur and uncovered a $5 billion balance. The report revealed that Thiel only started with a $2000 contribution in 1999 which was the annual limit at the time. He used his contributions to buy 1.7 million shares of PayPal Holdings (a company he co-founded) for $0.001 per share bringing his total purchase to $1700. Because of the Roth IRA's incredible tax-free growth and withdrawal feature he'll be able to tap into his $5 billion Roth IRA balance 100% tax-free if he doesn't touch his investment until after age 59 1/2.

Building a billion-dollar Roth IRA is no easy feat for the average person but learning about Thiel's Roth IRA strategy can help you tap into some benefits that you might have neglected. Here's a glimpse of what you can do to maximize your Roth IRA success.

How a Roth IRA works

Let's start with the basics. The Roth IRA was started in 1997 and named after one of the co-sponsors of the law that created them Sen. William Roth (R-Del.). The purpose of the Roth IRA was to encourage average working Americans to stash cash away for retirement. The incentives are attractive boasting tax-free growth and withdrawals during retirement for those who contributed after-tax dollars to fund the account.

As alluring as the Roth IRA features appear there are a few items to watch out for. First you have to make sure your income doesn't exceed the annual thresholds. For example single filers are not eligible to make direct contributions to a Roth IRA once their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $140000.

Also be aware of the contribution limits. Since the Roth IRA was designed to give more individuals a helping hand during retirement you can tuck away a large chunk of money into this account every year. For 2021 contributions are capped at $6000 for those under 50 and $7000 for those 50 or older.

Thiel's secret to success

One overlooked feature of the Roth IRA is the ability to choose your favorite assets (within the constraints of the IRS rules) to put your contributions to work.

Thiel was among a select group with exclusive access to shares of PayPal before the company went public. This deal gave him a leg up. Unfortunately most traditional brokerages will limit your purchasing power to assets that are held at their company such as publicly traded stocks bonds and mutual funds. If this is what you are comfortable with then keep collecting these assets in your portfolio. In 2019 the S&P 500 delivered an impressive 31% return. Although those strong returns don't come around every year the stock market is a great way to build wealth over time.

However if alternative assets are more your style you can work with a trust company to diversify your portfolio mix. Thiel worked with a trust company to invest in private company shares. He invested in assets within his circle of competence and allowed the power of time and growth to deliver explosive returns over the long term. Again you just have to know the rules and ensure that the assets you select meet the parameters of a Roth IRA.

Unlock your Roth IRA riches

Let's be clear: There's a high probability that you won't wake up with a billion-dollar Roth IRA by investing in traditional assets alone. But that shouldn't stop you from using the Roth IRA to build wealth. It's possible to reach the million-dollar mark if you start early contribute consistently and invest in high-quality assets.

For example if you commit to contributing $6000 to a Roth IRA every year for 40 years you could turn $240000 into more than $1 million. You just need to shoot for a 7% annualized rate of return which isn't unreasonable over the long term. Even a 10% return is feasible and could get you to your million-dollar tax-free treasure in approximately 30 years. This all assumes that the Roth IRA contribution limit remains at least $6000. If that increases and you qualify to contribute the maximum amount you can accelerate your financial goals.

The way to wealth

Building wealth in a Roth IRA is not as challenging as it might sound. To sum it up start contributing as much as possible so you can invest in assets that can help your portfolio explode in value. Enjoy tax-free gains forever (as long as you follow the rules) and use proceeds to invest in other assets that can supercharge your portfolio.

Here's the catch: You have to start strategizing now so you can tap into Thiel's ultimate Roth IRA secret. The secret sauce is being able to use the power of time growth and information to earn enough compound returns to fund your retirement lifestyle 100% tax-free.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L2Jpei8yMDI0LzAxLzYwMl8zMTIzMzYuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTMxMjMzNg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kakao Bank KakaoPay face bumpy road ahead in IPOs,"Seen above is Kakao's signature character Ryan.

FSS Yuanta Morgan Stanley raise questions about valuation



By Park Jae-hyuk



Kakao's ambitious plans to list Kakao Bank and KakaoPay on the benchmark KOSPI market in August are facing growing doubts recently from financial regulators and securities analysts who regard the valuations of the IT firm and its financial subsidiaries as overestimated.



On Friday the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) asked KakaoPay to correct its prospectus submitted July 2 saying that the document may hinder reasonable investments or cause a serious misunderstanding for investors.



""As a result the overall stock issuance schedule may change so we hope investors take this into account"" KakaoPay said in its regulatory filing.



The mobile payment service provider was planning to go public on Aug. 12.



Selecting three foreign financial platform operators ― America's PayPal Square and Brazil's PagSeguro ― as its comparable companies it has sought to price its stock at somewhere between 63000 won ($55) and 96000 won so that its market capitalization can reach up to 12.5 trillion won.



The FSS declined to disclose which parts were specifically problematic in KakaoPay's prospectus but its request has been interpreted by many as an order to lower the target price range given that Krafton and SD BioSensor both of which had also selected firms based abroad as their comparable companies lowered their target price ranges after the financial watchdog asked them to correct their prospectuses.



KakaoPay has yet to confirm whether it will lower its target price range and delay its initial public offering (IPO).

The title was:

“ Buy now pay later platforms face a day of reckoning says Humm CEO Rebecca James”

The article quotes the Humm CEO as saying “We are going to start to see – especially if these market conditions remain – the pointy end of this BNPL run.” This comes from the head of the only BNPL company on the ASX to reach profitability. Two months later on 14 July the largest corporation on the planet by market cap announced it was getting into the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) space. Apple.

Although Australian fintech companies are often given credit for creating the BNPL business the truth is the digital world has opened the doors for software engineers to create web and app based platforms that add value to an age old buying strategy – installment plans.

A US company called Cowperthwaite and Sons is credited with creating the first installment plan for the furniture it sold in 1807. In 1850 the Singer Sewing Machine Company introduced installment plan buying for its sewing machines.

The basics have not changed. Consumers walk out the door with their goods and pay for them in timed installments instead of at the time of purchase.

What changed over time and is still changing with the massive number of companies now competing in the space are the credit standards purchase limits and number of installment payments among other digital “bells and whistles.”

The US trails Australia in the adoption of BNPL arrangements by a wide margin and it is cracking the US market that is driving the growth plans of many of the top players on the ASX. Led by market darling and industry favoring Afterpay Group (APT) share price appreciation reached lofty levels raising concerns among many analysts and market experts over valuations of companies yet to produce a profit.

The “bubble” word began to appear in the financial press in 2020 with some cautioning the BNPL bubble was approaching the level of the tech bubble in the early 2000’s.

Most investors ignored the concerns and the sector remained hot with multiple new companies getting into the BNPL sector popping up on share markets here and in the US and elsewhere. The “excessive valuation” argument appears when investors bid up the price of a company based on the promise of growth the company has yet to deliver.

Analysts looked at the business models noting multiple threats including loan defaults regulatory oversight low margins and increasing competition. The stock price performance in the two years since those bubble articles began appearing shows investors initially ignored the risk warnings as four of the five top players on the ASX by market cap did not see “air begin to escape” from the bubble until early 2021.

Afterpay Zip Co (Z1P) and Sezzle Inc. (SZL) have all seen deep drops with Humm Group (HUM) spared much of the pain.

It seems nervous investors are hitting the sell button at anything negative and even some positive signs from capital raises to disappointing growth results to acquisitions. But none compared to the devastating impact of the news of a well-known company getting into the market.

The latest is the hint of the Apple entry a move reportedly intended to boost adoption of the company’s Apple Pay mobile app. Apple is one of the recognisable brands in the world with legions of “fanboys” everywhere eager to adopt any new entry in the vaunted Apple ecosystem.

A commonly accepted reason to ignore the warnings of competition in the sector was the belief the addressable market was large enough to sustain multiple players. The potential market is indeed huge. A 2021 Global Payments report from the Worldpay division of FIS a financial technology research and consulting firm forecasts the BNPL market to increase 181% by 2024. BNPL transactions increased 78% in 2020.

In the early days there was a good bit of hype about BNPL providers sounding the death knell of credit cards. However financial institutions involved in consumer retail quickly caught on to the need to compete with the early BNPL movers of which Afterpay was one offering their own point of sale (POS) flexible payment plans.

Yet Apple is only the latest in a continuing stream of heavy hitters jumping into the market. All have a competitive advantage not only in name recognition but also in established connections to existing businesses.

Visa announced its own BNPL platform in July of 2019 launching in the US in July of 2020 and in Canada in June of 2021.

Mastercard is offering “installment offerings” through its global partnerships.

Amazon Pay Later launched in India April of 2020 and reached 10 million transactions from 2 million customers by the end of June this year.

PayPal in 4 launched in August of 2020.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced its own BNPL service StepPay on 17 March of 2021.

The Apple BNPL offering is being developed in conjunction with global investment bank Goldman Sachs.

At the core of all these platforms lies a consumer in purchase mode. Most are available regardless of the point of sale (POS) – at a retail outlet online or via a mobile app.

There are differences serious investors need to consider. Concerns about upcoming regulatory risk of a sector that is in essence lending money but not regulated like traditional lenders are real. Credit approval from some providers is more rigorous for risk averse investors. The number of installments varies with Mastercard providing the consumer the option to choose their own up to 12 months. Amazon is looking to differentiate itself from the competition with its 5 payment option. PayPal is taking aim at a primary source of revenue for Afterpay – late fees. PayPal in 4 will not charge late fees. Some have upper limits of the dollar amount of a purchase.

How BNPL earn revenue also varies although analysts appear uniformly of the view margins are small and may not be able to sustain long term growth.

Risk averse investors have one choice among the top ten ASX BNPL players that is making a profit – Humm Group – and one nearing profitability Afterpay Group.

Afterpay provides a lesson for investors considering some of the ASX BNPL companies in the early stages of entering the sector. Afterpay has posted increasing revenues in excess of $100000 in each of the last three years capping at $450 million in FY 2020 with the pandemic propelling revenues to more than double from FY 2019. Yet potential profits are devoured by the capital expense associated with first entering a market and then expanding into other markets.

In contrast with PayPal Amazon Apple and Commonwealth Bank BNPL providers like Afterpay that rely on retailers must absorb the cost of integrating with each retail outlets existing systems. PayPal Amazon Apple all have millions of customers on which to build. PayPal Credit has been a dominant payment system adopted by many online retailers for decades allowing customers to defer interest on large dollar purchases for six months or longer without a set number of installments. If the balance is not paid by the allotted time the customer is charged the interest. PayPal customers now have the option of Paypal in 4.

The outcome is far from determined as ASX companies like Sezzle Splitit (SPT) and Zip Co have a global presence along with Afterpay as seen in this pictogram from UK fintech consulting firm Penser showing UK and European providers.

The ferocious race for market share is on with competitors like Afterpay and Zip spending like wild dogs to add retailers and users. Afterpay appears nearing the finish line of profitability at least in the short term.

In FY 2020 the company reported a loss of 5.2 cents in earnings per share which is expected to drop further in FY 2021 to 5.6 cents per share in the red. But in FY 2020 the long awaited day may arrive with analysts forecasting positive EPS of 40.3 cents.

The company has repeatedly reported blockbuster numbers in sales and user growth. As most players in the space are doing Afterpay is looking to differentiate itself from the competition. The latest enhancement in its US business is the addition of access to major US retailers including CVS and Walgreens pharmacies Target and Amazon. Users will access the service via the Afterpay app exclusively. Details remain sketchy as the media release referred to “select customers” who can use the service by checking their favorite brands on the app and then purchasing from the retailer using a “one-time card.”

Despite the competition Afterpay remains the “hare” in the race but watch out for the “tortoise” – Humm Group.

The company went through a “rebranding” changing its name from Flexigroup and its business model in response to the changing competitive landscape slimming down from 23 loan platforms to just 4.

The strategy was to build an ecosystem of financial products to meet not only the needs of shoppers and retailers but small and medium sized businesses as well.

Humm group makes the bold claim it has built platforms for buying or leasing everything.

The company’s first consumer oriented BNPL platform – Humm – has unique features that could separate it from the competition. The purchase price ranges from $1 dollar to $30000 dollars for major purchases with repayment installments from ten months to sixty months. This opens the doors to major buys for the consumer.

HUMM is available through more than 56000 retailers and the company established a strategic partnership with BPAY for expenses like utility bills and school fees. HUMM launched in the UK on 30 June of 2021.

HUMM Pro offers businesses flexible repayment options for up to $30000.

BUNDL is for purchases up to $1000 with up to 14 days to repay anywhere Mastercard (a strategic partner with HUMM) is accepted. This platform offers budgeting tools a differentiating factor with Afterpay and others.

HUMM 90 is a credit platform similar to PayPal Credit with the difference it has no purchase limits and offers 110 days interest free.

The company’s Half Year 2021 Financial Results continued its profitable trend reporting a 25.8% increase in NPAT.

On 3 June the company announced the launch of Humm/Tapp. With a digital card for tapping a digital wallet consumers can make a purchase at any Humm merchant bypassing the instore sales system.

On 14 July Humm Group announced an arrangement with Westpac NZ to introduce the BUNDL platform in that country.

Humm will be entering the Canadian market later this year.",,,

But a joint investigation published this week by the Guardian and Food and Water Watch showed how this choice is largely an illusion. In fact a handful of mega firms dominate every link of the food supply chain: from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to cereals and beers.

And that is not good news for consumers in terms of choice and real competition on prices or for small and medium-sized farmers given little choice on what they grow or which animals they raise while food industry workers face low pay and high risks.

The planet also loses out when industrial agriculture is focused on extracting maximum profits for minimum costs – an exploitative model with grave consequences for animal welfare water land and global heating.

“It’s a system designed to funnel money into the hands of corporate shareholders and executives while exploiting farmers and workers and deceiving consumers about choice abundance and efficiency” said Amanda Starbuck a policy analyst at Food & Water Watch.

Here are some of the key figures and charts from our deep analysis of sales data from thousands of supermarkets across the US:

1. Almost 80% of dozens of everyday grocery items are supplied by just a handful of companies

Our research started by identifying dozens of different key grocery types that Americans buy every day including different kinds of veggies fruits and grains prepared foods beverages and animal products.

We then studied the scanner sales data from thousands of US stores that is compiled by market research firms for these products.

And our analysis revealed that a shocking 79% of the groceries in a basket of 61 everyday types of food and drink are being sold by a small amount of the top companies which we defined to mean four firms or fewer.

It’s widely agreed that consumers farmers small food companies and the planet lose out if the top four firms control 40% or more of total sales.

2. PepsiCo has a huge grip on the market for dips with 88% of market share

Our analysis showed that the consolidation of the food system runs deep: four firms or fewer controlled at least 50% of the market for 79% of our 61 types of groceries. For almost a third of shopping items the top firms controlled at least 75% of the market share.

The market for dips is a good example.

PepsiCo controls 88% of the dip market as it owns five of the most popular brands including Tostitos Lay’s and Fritos.

Snacks and condiments – market share for top three or four companies

3. Ninety-three per cent of the sodas we drink are owned by just three companies

In the carbonated soft drinks category of our research the power of just three firms was overwhelming accounting for 92.9% of sales in our analysis.

Coca-Cola has 42.4% PepsiCo has 27.4% and Keurig Dr Pepper has 23.1%.

This kind of dominance is not good news if you are a smaller operator of a drinks company trying to get a toehold in the market.

Across all types of food and drink the big firms are helped by so-called category captains in stores who represent leading brands or manufacturers and work with major retailers to decide which products get prominent spots on our supermarket shelves. This makes it very hard for new independent brands to get a break.

When they do get a tiny foothold it rarely lasts. Take craft beers a booming market thanks to hipsters and old-school beer enthusiasts which is why new brands are quickly acquired by mega breweries. It’s not clear from the labels but the Belgian beer giant Anheuser-Busch owns more than 600 brands including mainstream favorites like Budweiser and Beck’s.

Beverages – market share for top three or four companies

4. Just three firms dominate sales of 73% of the breakfast cereals we eat – despite shelves stacked with different boxes

We have all stood in front of a wall of cereal boxes in a supermarket and felt dizzy at the options. But really there is far less choice than you might think when you are deciding what cereal to have for breakfast.

Our research showed three firms dominate: General Mills with 27.9% market share Kellogg Company with 26.8% and Post Holdings with 18.1%.

5. More than 80% of beef processing and 70% of pork processing is controlled by four multinational giants

A spate of mega-mergers means that meatpacking plants are now controlled by just a handful of multinationals including Tyson JBS Cargill and Smithfield (now owned by the Chinese multinational WH Group).

Forty years ago only a third of the beef and pork processing industry was controlled by the top four firms.

But after a spate of mega mergers 80% of beef processing and 70% of pork processing is controlled by four multinational giants. In 2017 these top firms had a combined revenue of $207bn.

Portion of meat market controlled by the Top 4 companies

Meanwhile farmers and consumers lost out. In the last 40 years these huge corporations have been paying farmers less and less for beef and selling it to consumers at increasing prices.

How much farmers are paid for beef and how much distributors sell it for

Pork prices have stayed steady for consumers but farmers have been getting paid less and less.

How much farmers are paid for pork and how much distributors sell it for

So what can be done?

Last week Joe Biden signed an executive order to tackle the rampant concentration across the US economy – including food and farming. Biden called on government agencies to enforce existing anti-trust laws and consider rolling back recent mega-mergers which boosted profits and power for a handful of corporations while hurting the rest of us. The order specifically directs the USDA to take swift action to protect farmers including by making it easier for them to sue meat processors for alleged abuses.

But the problems in the current system run deep.

“From farm to fork America’s food system has been rooted in the exploitation of women Native Americans and people of color. This is at the heart of capitalist food politics – big corporations taking as much as they can and paying as little as possible for it” said Raj Patel an academic and the author of Stuffed and Starved: Markets Power and the Hidden Battle for the World’s Food System.

In addition to executive actions which could be overturned by the next president such deep-rooted injustices need sweeping reforms by Congress. But bills banning new mega-mergers and factory farms currently lack bipartisan support despite public opinion supporting them.

It’s time to support small-scale regenerative farmers regional food hubs and grocery co-ops according to Starbuck the policy analyst at Food & Water Watch. “Alternatives already exist. We just need to boost public funding and resources to help sustainable affordable more equitable food systems take root.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZnR2b2ljZS5vcmcvZm9yY2VkLXRvLXdvcmstODAtaG91cnMtYS13ZWVrLWZyaXRvLWxheS1mYWN0b3J5LXdvcmtlcnMtYXJlLW9uLXN0cmlrZS1mb3ItdGhlaXItbGl2ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forced to Work 80 Hours a Week Frito-Lay Factory Workers Are on Strike for Their Lives,"More than 500 workers at the Topeka Kansas Frito-Lay factory who make dozens of varieties of snack chips have walked off the job and onto the picket lines. Their biggest grievance: for more than a year they have been forced to work as many as 12 hours a day sometimes seven days a week to meet pandemic-fueled demand for the comfort foods they produce. Workers on the picket lines say that they are being “worked to the bone” and want their lives back. They want to be able to celebrate their children’s birthdays and spend time with their families and friends but face losing their jobs if they refuse to work overtime. If this wasn’t bad enough already wages at the plant have stagnated over the last several years despite the company’s record profits. Earlier this month in fact workers overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer that included a measly two percent per year raise. That offer which amounted to as little as 32 cents per hour for the lowest paid workers at the plant would have actually been a pay cut and not a raise since it is less than half of the expected rate of inflation for 2021.

Meanwhile PepsiCo — the corporation that owns Frito-Lay — thanks to both the pandemic and rising prices has made a killing off of these workers and the 70000 others they employ worldwide. In fact PepsiCo’s total revenue for 2020 rose more than 20 percent compared to 2019. Both sales and profits have far exceeded investor forecasts and reported operating profits for 2020 were a whopping $3.1 billion. Despite these incredible profits — and despite the company already having increased prices by five percent last quarter and expecting to make similar increases this year — PepsiCo announced a $1 billion cost cutting plan in an effort to extract even more profits out of its already overworked employees.

The strike was called by Local 218 of the Bakery Confectionary Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union and began on Monday July 5th. Since then the company has cut off employee health insurance — a nasty but all too common practice — and has attempted to bring in scabs to end the strike. So far those attempts have failed however and the union says that production at the plant has ground to a halt. This seems to be in large part due to the fact that Frito-Lay actually can’t seem to find many workers in Topeka willing to cross the picket line for such low wages. The company even went so far as to hire buses to bring in scabs directly from town but workers say that the buses are mostly empty.

“Most of these buses are completely empty or have one to three people not counting the driver” one worker told Labor Notes. “It’s psychological warfare” he added. “They’re trying to demoralize and dispirit the men and women of the union in the hopes we’ll come groveling back for whatever crumbs they offer us.”

It has been almost two weeks since the strike began and negotiations between the company and the union are not expected to resume until Monday July 19th at the earliest. This suggests that the strike will last at least several more days or longer if an agreement is not reached on Monday. Already some of the workers who went out on strike are finding work at other nearby factories many of which pay significantly more than Frito-Lay. In a tight labor market it’s unclear how long the company is willing or able to stall production in order to defeat the strike. Indeed their unwillingness and inability to hire more employees is precisely what led to the strike in the first place.

However the low pay and exploitative use of overtime are also key to the company’s massive profits last quarter. Frito-Lay’s deplorable treatment of its workers is just another example of how the profit imperative inevitably trumps the needs and demands of ordinary working people both at work and as consumers. Rather than investing in expanding manufacturing capacity and hiring more full-time employees as every economic textbook claims is supposed to happen when sales increase Frito-Lay chose instead to run the factory at an increased pace with as few employees as possible working as many hours as possible to meet the demand created by the pandemic. In other words the company is increasing production and prices bringing in billions in profit without having to spend a dime to hire more workers or invest in new productive infrastructure. Sure Frito-Lay winds up having to pay employees more per hour for all of this overtime but because employees are working more hours and earning time and half for many of those hours it’s easier for the company to pay a lower base salary and disguise the actually deteriorating value of those wages over time which is exactly what has happened.

Now as expectations of inflation take hold across the economy Frito-Lay is using this moment to raise prices even further in order to make even more profits in the short term. Last week PepsiCo vice chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston told Yahoo Finance that they had raised prices five percent during the pandemic and were expecting to raise prices even more this fall. The company claims that increases in the prices of its products are the result of increased labor and transportation costs but as the situation at the Topeka plant —- where employees are being offered a measly four percent wage increase over two years — makes painfully clearthey are charging more not because of increased costs but simply because they can get away with it because it is “what the market will bear.” And yet not a single Frito-Lay employee will see a dime of those additional profits. On the contrary these employees that are already hyper-exploited by PepsiCo are going to see the real value of their wages decrease even further because of inflation. Meanwhile the Democratic Party despite promises made on the campaign trail is doing absolutely nothing to address the abysmally low national minimum wage which remains as low as $7.25 an hour in many parts of the country.

In this way the struggle at Frito-Lay is really a sign of the times and a testing ground for how the working class can fight back in the post-pandemic economy; a victory for these workers would be an inspiration to working people everywhere. To win however will require more than just fortitude determination and a good negotiating team. Frito-Lay has factories across the country and billions in profits to draw upon. To defeat such power and wealth will require solidarity and action from Frito-Lay and PepsiCo workers across the country and the world who are willing to link their struggles in order to increase their strength. In the long term this also means building an independent rank and file labor movement capable of taking radical strike action that is allied in common struggle with the entire class including the unemployed immigrants and oppressed people everywhere.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbWlzYmFyLmNvbS9lbi9mYWN0Y2hlY2svMjAyMS8wNy8xOS90aGVyZS1hcmUtbm8tYWJvcnRlZC1mZXRhbC1jZWxscy1pbi1wZXBzaWNvLWRyaW5rc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There Are No Aborted Fetal Cells In PepsiCo Drinks | Misbar,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbGFib3Jub3Rlcy5vcmcvYmxvZ3MvMjAyMS8wNy9mcml0by1sYXktZm9yY2VkLW92ZXJ0aW1lLWZydXN0cmF0aW9ucy1ub3QtbGltaXRlZC1zdHJpa2luZy10b3Bla2EtcGxhbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frito-Lay Forced Overtime Frustrations Not Limited to Striking Topeka Plant,"UPDATE Friday July 23: Union members at the Topeka Frito-Lay facility are voting all day today on a new tentative agreement. Union leaders say they are not recommending a yes vote since the company ""did not move on the economics"" as Bakery Workers Local 218 president Brent Hall told the Topeka Capital-Journal. Frito-Lay is still only offering a 4 percent raise over two years although under the latest offer workers would receive a 3 percent increase in the first year and a 1 percent raise in the second year. The previous agreement which workers rejected before the strike included 2 percent annual raises in each year.

On forced overtime the contract offer would guarantee workers at least one day off per week on either the sixth or seventh day of their work week—provided they haven’t used any previous time off that week including sick days floating or regular holidays FMLA or unpaid funeral leave.

The offer eliminates the 60-hour a week cap on the amount of time workers can be forced to work. Some union members had expressed concerns that that cap would mean higher seniority workers would end up being forced to work on their weekends after lower seniority workers reached the 60-hour limit—although there are concerns that this new offer does not stop the company from imposing 72-hour weeks. The new agreement would also eliminate the hated “suicide shifts”—when workers are forced to stay over an extra four hours after their normal eight-hour shift and then forced in four hours early before their next shift leaving them just eight hours between shifts.

Voting ends tonight at 10 p.m. CT.—Eds.

Frito-Lay workers in Topeka Kansas have been on strike since July 5 demanding wage increases and an end to the company’s reliance on forced overtime which has seen some of them forced to work 12-hour days seven days a week for weeks on end.

But frustrations over forced OT aren’t limited to Topeka. Below we publish a letter from the wife of a Frito-Lay warehouse worker at another of the company’s 30 U.S. manufacturing facilities who said she feels like a “single married mom” because of the way the snackmaker’s abuse of mandatory overtime has upended her family life. (We are publishing the letter anonymously at her request.)

Dear Labor Notes

I want to thank you for your recent article ‘We Want to See Our Families: Frito Lay Workers Strike Over 84-Hour Weeks Meager Raises.’ As a spouse of a Frito-Lay warehouse employee [at a different facility] everything in your article hit home to me. I really hope that your article can help draw national attention to how Frito-Lay treats their employees. I do believe that a lot of families of Frito Lay employees are caught in the same situation as we are.

When my husband started working there nearly 10 years ago the wages were competitive. As you mentioned the raises since then have been least to say minimal despite the growing costs of housing and living expenses. When PepsiCo is banking billions of dollars their employees are stuck earning the same wages and working non-stop.

As a family we can never plan anything. Our daughters and I constantly go places without him because there is never any stability in knowing his schedule. Oftentimes only hours before we expect him home he will text me to let me know he has been forced over. I have joked that I'm a single married mom.

I could go on and on! It's a frustrating situation that has felt like it will never change. I only hope that with the strike happening and more attention being brought to the situation to the media such as your article that things will change for the better for all Frito-Lay employees.

Kindly

The spouse of a Frito-Lay warehouse worker

TOPEKA STRIKE UPDATES

Bakery Workers (BCTGM) Local 218 heads back to the bargaining table with Frito-Lay on Monday July 19. (See the update above for details of the tentative agreement reached this week.)

Striking workers have been maintaining a picket line outside the facility and posting photos of all the community and union support they are receiving on the Topeka Frito-Lay Union Members Appreciation Page on Facebook.

Frito-Lay has been touting the offer that workers overwhelmingly voted down before the strike highlighting that it included a 60-hour a week cap on the amount workers can be required to work eliminated mandatory “suicide shifts” (“squeeze shifts” in company lingo in which workers only have eight hours off—these will now supposedly be voluntary) and included 2 percent annual wage increases for each year of the two-year contract. But as workers have pointed out a 60-hour week still means they routinely could be forced to work:

five 12-hour days

six days a week including three 12-hour shifts or even

seven days a week with one 12-hour shift.

And the 2 percent increases are a pittance given that wages have been stagnant for most classifications for over a decade with small lump sum bonuses instead of increased wage rates most years.

Workers say that if the plant doesn’t significantly raise wages—and improve working conditions including by reducing forced overtime—it won’t be able to attract more workers meaning that 60-hour weeks will be the norm even for the highest-seniority workers. Workers who have been at the plant for 20 or 30-plus years worry they could be forced in on their weekends if lower-seniority workers hit their 60-hour cap earlier in the week.

PEPSI PROFITS WHILE WORKERS SUFFER

Meanwhile PepsiCo which owns Frito-Lay raised its profit forecast earlier in the week projecting earnings per share of 11 percent this year. The company also announced it will raise its prices. Pepsi shares are now trading at record highs—as workers toil away 84 hours a week in the company's plants.

Max Alvarez did an hour-long interview with Topeka Frito-Lay striker Cheri Renfro on the Working People podcast. Given the 84-hour weeks Frito-Lay has subjected workers to I particularly appreciated Renfro’s description of anti-union right-to-work laws as “right to work you to death.” Kansas is a right-to-work state; about 600 of the 850 workers at the Topeka Frito-Lay facility are union members. Find it on your podcast app or at In These Times.

Lauren Kaori Gurley of Vice published an interview with Mark McCarter a shop steward who has been working in the Topeka plant for 37 years. It’s titled “I'm a Frito-Lay Factory Worker. I Work 12-Hour Days 7 Days a Week.” As McCarter says “This job wears you down it tires you and makes you mentally exhausted. It plays with your mind. Some of these guys who work 12 hours a day everyday are destroying their marriages. They're destroying their families. My wife passed away and I don't have a wife to go home to to say 'Hey babe I'm only working eight hours tomorrow’ but a lot of these guys come in with the understanding that they'll be here for eight hours but then they got to call their wives and kids and say ‘Guess what? It's not eight hours. It's 12 hours and then I have to go back to work at 3 a.m.’”

A local magazine 785 has set up a fund to help Topeka strikers pay their water bills. Strikers are also urging supporters to boycott Frito-Lay and Pepsi products. Supporters can also call the PepsiCo Board of Directors mailbox (1-866-626-0633) and leave a message demanding that they settle a fair contract.

Elsewhere truck drivers at a Pepsi facility in Muncie Indiana have been on strike since Monday over the company's effort to jack up health insurance premiums from $14 a week to $81 a week. (PepsiCo owns Frito-Lay.) ""We shouldn't be paying for it in the first place. This is a multibillion-dollar company"" driver Tom Albano a member of Teamsters Local 142 told The Times of Northwest Indiana. ""And the raises the company is offering is not going to cover or barely cover what your increase is going to be in your health insurance.""

Finally 250 New Jersey workers who bottle drinks including Tropicana juices and Gatorade (both Pepsi-owned brands) voted to join the United Electrical Workers (UE) in the largest union election victory among blue-collar workers so far this year. The workers largely Latin American immigrants fought off an intense anti-union campaign by their employer Refresco the world's largest bottling company. According to the UE ""Workers began their union organizing campaign in 2020 after years of abusive treatment by supervisors low wages paltry benefits sexual harassment an unforgiving attendance system that penalizes workers for getting sick and constant schedule changes. The organizing campaign was temporarily suspended as dozens of workers fell ill with COVID-19... The company's careless handling of the pandemic last year turned out to be one of the main reasons workers succeeded in winning over a majority for the union this year."" Now they're on to the fight for a first contract.

She spoke about the budget initiative pertaining to the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City and reiterated the government’s commitment towards developing it into a globally competitive hub for innovation and financial activities to serve the Indian economy and the region as a whole it said.

Sitharaman said there is a sharp decline in new Covid infection with ramping up of the vaccination programme and India has witnessed continued macro-economic stability and resilience in economic recovery in the recent months. India has a “strong track record” towards reform implementation in the last six years the statement said quoting her.

In her concluding remarks Sitharaman assured her audience of India’s “consistent and continuous productive reforms” that make the country an investor-friendly destination.

Vaccination and infection provide two different pathways to immunity

Since the COVID-19 outbreak first began in December 2019 in Wuhan China intense global efforts to rapidly develop effective vaccines against the causative agent SARS-CoV-2 have led to the emergency use authorization of several vaccines.

These include the messenger RNA- (mRNA) based vaccines developed by Pfizer (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273). Findings from clinical trials indicated that a 95% maximal protection is achieved within 1 to 2 months following the second dose of either vaccine including protection against several circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

However the mechanisms by which these vaccines elicit long-lasting cellular immune responses to the virus remain poorly understood.

Natural infection and vaccination provide two different pathways to immunity which studies have previously shown to be characterized by distinct T and B cell responses.

“Additional studies that integrate functional transcriptional and repertoire analysis of the memory immune cell response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination are needed” writes Messaoudi and colleagues.

What did the researchers do?

The team used single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays to assess humoral (antibody) and cellular responses to two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine (14 days following a second dose) in four individuals. The results were compared with the immune responses observed in three convalescent individuals who had experienced asymptomatic or mild infection.

What did the study find?

Both infection and vaccination induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies.

These antibodies were detected as early as two weeks following a first vaccine dose with levels increasing several-fold after a second dose.

While neutralizing antibody titers following the first vaccine dose were comparable to those among convalescent individuals significantly higher levels were observed in the vaccinees following the booster dose.

However several important B cell adaptations were shared between vaccinees and convalescent individuals.

Analysis by flow cytometry revealed a reduction in the level of naïve B cells but an expansion of memory B cells in both groups.

Additionally single-cell RNA sequencing showed a reduction in IgA+ memory B cells following vaccination a finding that has recently been described for convalescent individuals.

Immunological changes with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination (A) Experimental design for the study. Blood was collected from SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects before vaccination 2 weeks post dose 1 and 2 weeks post prime boost vaccination (VACC group) or in SARS-CoV-2 exposed but asymptomatic individuals (CONV group) before and after convalescence. Immune phenotypes of PBMC and antigen specific T and B cell responses were measured using multi-color flow cytometry. Longitudinal serological responses to the vaccine were measured using ELISA and neutralization assays. Memory T and B cells from a subset of PBMC samples (n=4/group for vaccine volunteers n=3/group for convalescent health care workers matched) were profiled using scRNA-Seq at the baseline (pre-vaccination or and post-vaccination time points. (B) UMAP projection of 32867 memory T and B cells with major subsets annotated. (C) Violin plots of key gene markers used for cluster annotations. Normalized transcript counts are shown on the Y-axis.

Vaccination appeared to establish durable memory and potential recall responses

Importantly the team observed a modest expansion of plasmablasts and a significant increase in spike-specific B cells just two weeks following a second vaccine dose indicating the establishment of durable memory and potential recall responses to infection.

Single-cell analyses also revealed an expansion of activated CD4+ T cells and robust spike-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cell responses following vaccination.

Frequencies of activated CD8 T cells were comparable between the vaccinated and convalescent groups. However natural infection induced the expansion of larger CD8 T cell clones including distinct clusters.

This is likely due to the recognition of a broader set of epitopes presented by the virus that is not found in the mRNA vaccines say the researchers.

“Our study highlights a coordinated adaptive immune response where early CD4 T cell responses facilitate the development of the B cell response and substantial expansion of effector CD8 T cells together capable of contributing to future recall responses” concludes the team.

The finding strongly supports the view that the second shot should not be skipped.

“Despite their outstanding efficacy little is known about how exactly RNA vaccines work” said Bali Pulendran PhD professor of pathology and of microbiology and immunology. “So we probed the immune response induced by one of them in exquisite detail.”

The study published July 12 in Nature was designed to find out exactly what effects the vaccine marketed by Pfizer Inc. has on the numerous components of the immune response.

The researchers analyzed blood samples from individuals inoculated with the vaccine. They counted antibodies measured levels of immune-signaling proteins and characterized the expression of every single gene in the genome of 242479 separate immune cells’ type and status.

“The world’s attention has recently been fixed on COVID-19 vaccines particularly on the new RNA vaccines” said Pulendran the Violetta L. Horton Professor II.

He shares senior authorship of the study with Kari Nadeau MD PhD the Naddisy Foundation Professor of Pediatric Food Allergy Immunology and Asthma and professor of pediatrics and Purvesh Khatri PhD associate professor of biomedical informatics and of biomedical data science. The study’s lead authors are Prabhu Arunachalam PhD a senior research scientist in Pulendran’s lab; medical student Madeleine Scott PhD a former graduate student in Khatri’s lab; and Thomas Hagan PhD a former postdoctoral scholar in Pulendran’s Stanford lab and now an assistant professor at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta.

Uncharted territory

“This is the first time RNA vaccines have ever been given to humans and we have no clue as to how they do what they do: offer 95% protection against COVID-19” said Pulendran.

Traditionally the chief immunological basis for approval of new vaccines has been their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies: individualized proteins created by immune cells called B cells that can tack themselves to a virus and block it from infecting cells.

“Antibodies are easy to measure” Pulendran said. “But the immune system is much more complicated than that. Antibodies alone don’t come close to fully reflecting its complexity and potential range of protection.”

Pulendran and his colleagues assessed goings-on among all the immune cell types influenced by the vaccine: their numbers their activation levels the genes they express and the proteins and metabolites they manufacture and secrete upon inoculation.

One key immune-system component examined by Pulendran and his colleagues was T cells: search-and-destroy immune cells that don’t attach themselves to viral particles as antibodies do but rather probe the body’s tissues for cells bearing telltale signs of viral infections. On finding them they tear those cells up.

In addition the innate immune system an assortment of first-responder cells is now understood to be of immense importance. It’s the body’s sixth sense Pulendran said whose constituent cells are the first to become aware of a pathogen’s presence. Although they’re not good at distinguishing among separate pathogens they secrete “starting gun” signaling proteins that launch the response of the adaptive immune system — the B and T cells that attack specific viral or bacterial species or strains. During the week or so it takes for the adaptive immune system to rev up innate immune cells perform the mission-critical task of holding incipient infections at bay by gobbling up — or firing noxious substances albeit somewhat indiscriminately at — whatever looks like a pathogen to them.

A different type of vaccine

The Pfizer vaccine like the one made by Moderna Inc. works quite differently from the classic vaccines composed of live or dead pathogens individual proteins or carbohydrates that train the immune system to zero in on a particular microbe and wipe it out. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines instead contain genetic recipes for manufacturing the spike protein that SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 uses to latch on to cells it infects.

In December 2020 Stanford Medicine began inoculating people with the Pfizer vaccine. This spurred Pulendran’s desire to assemble a complete report card on the immune response to it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9oZWFseC1yYXJlLWRpc2Vhc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Viagra can teach us a lot about treating rare diseases,"In June 1993 David Brown was exasperated. For eight years he had been developing a drug that was supposed to treat angina but early clinical trials showed it wasn’t having enough of an effect to make it into a commercial success. His employer Pfizer gave him three months to turn the project around. A few weeks later Brown heard some unusual news from a group of Welsh men involved in a clinical trial of the drug: they were experiencing more erections than usual. Realising that it could have a huge blockbuster on its hands Pfizer switched its clinical trials to focus on erectile dysfunction. “It went from dead to number one in the Pfizer portfolio in the space of two weeks” Brown says. Approved in the United States in 1998 Viagra went on to sell more than $400 million (£237m) in its first three months alone.

Now Brown wants to repeat this trick to find new treatments for rare diseases with his startup Healx. Co-founded in 2014 with Tim Guilliams the Cambridge-based startup uses artificial intelligence to identify existing drugs that have already been through clinical trials and then repurposes them as treatments for rare diseases. Over 400 million people worldwide live with such diseases but because each one affects a small number of people pharmaceutical firms don’t have the financial incentive to develop new drugs to treat them. “The quickest and safest and most cost-effective way of inventing a new drug is to start from an old drug” says Guilliams Healx’s CEO.

The idea for Healx came from a conversation Guilliams and Brown had in a Cambridge pub with Nick Sireau whose two sons have a rare genetic disease called alkaptonuria. Although there are around 7000 rare diseases 95 per cent of them lack any treatments. When treatments are developed they can be extremely expensive. Zolgensma a drug approved in the US to treat spinal muscular atrophy costs $2.1 million (£1.5m) for a single one-time infusion. The huge failure rate when it comes to developing new drugs drives up the cost. According to one estimate only four per cent of drugs developed manage to make it all the way to approval.

Guillams and Brown want to massively improve these odds. At the heart of Healx’s approach is Healnet: an AI platform that finds links between drugs and diseases. Using natural language processing the platform mines data from clinical trials patents electronic health records genomic datasets and scientific papers to find drugs or combinations of drugs that match a particular disease profile. At the same time Healx scientists are creating and curating new datasets to fill in knowledge gaps about new diseases. “You put that human mind alongside a computer and the computer helps the human mind be more effective and the human mind helps the computer be more effective” says Brown.

One rare disease Healx is working on is called fragile X syndrome; one of the most common causes of inherited learning disability. In 2017 it started identifying a number of repurposed drug combinations that showed promise in mouse trials and now has plans to start clinical trials in 2021. The firm is also searching for treatments for other rare diseases including Pitt-Hopkins syndrome Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and some rare cancers. Eventually Brown hopes that Healx’s work won’t just find new treatments for rare diseases but completely overhaul how the industry finds new drugs. “I think we can transform the whole drug discovery process as well” he says.

Updated 19.07.21 13:25 BST: An earlier version of this article stated that Healx's fragile X trial would start in 2020. This has been corrected to 2021.

Updated 21.07.21 10:35 BST: The article has been updated to clarify that a course of the drug Zolgensma is only given once.



Updated 18.08.21 11:00 BST: The article has been updated to clarify that Healx is currently working on Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy not Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

It was the first Covid-19 vaccine to roll out in the UK but shortly afterwards it was joined by the Oxford vaccine and months later by the Moderna vaccine. All three have contributed to the UK's successful vaccination programme which in turn has allowed for the lockdown roadmap to go ahead as planned. At the moment there are no warnings that we'll go back into lockdown later this year - although there have been discussions over a potential circuit breaker lockdown in the future.

At the time of writing over half (54.0%) of the UK population have had both doses of the jab. So where did the Pfizer vaccine come from? Who's next on the list to receive their vaccine? And importantly is the Pfizer vaccine effective in combating new Covid-19 strains like the Delta variant? These are all questions people have been asking as more information around the Pfizer vaccine comes up.

Who made the Pfizer vaccine and in which country?

An American corporation called Pfizer in New York and BioNTech a German biotechnology company based in Germany developed the Pfizer vaccine.

Pfizer is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Over the years millions of people have used some of the essential medicines that the company creates. One of their most famous inventions is the EpiPen which is used to treat allergic reactions while anxiety sufferers might be familiar with Xanax another of their medications.

However BioNTech are the originators of the vaccine. Founded by two German scientists the company normally develop cancer immunotherapies but during the pandemic they have turned their attention to Covid-19.

How long does the Pfizer vaccine last?

The Pfizer vaccine produces a strong immune system response in the body that may protect against Covid-19 for years according to a new study.

The research published in the Nature science journal discovered that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine offer long-lasting protection against the virus. This adds to the expanding evidence suggesting that those who received a mRNA vaccine may not need a booster dose. However this is depending on whether the variants evolve again beyond their current condition.

Dr Ali Ellebedy an immunologist and lead author of the study said that the findings were a ""good sign for how durable our immunity is from this vaccine"".

Dr Ellebedy and his team also previously conducted a study on immunity levels in people who had recovered from Covid-19. They found that similar to the vaccine those who have contracted the illness previously may not need boosters. Based on these study results scientists are now saying that immunity to Covid-19 from the combined protection of the vaccines and previous infection could last for years - and possibly even a lifetime.

To work out whether the vaccine alone could produce this long-lasting effect the research team looked at the body's lymph nodes. This is where immune cells train to recognise and fight off the virus. Four months after the first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine they discovered that the body's lymph nodes showed high levels of germinal centre B cells. These suggest long-lasting protection from the virus.

However experts have warned against getting the second Covid vaccine early as this may decrease the levels of protection.

How effective is the Pfizer vaccine?

Public Health England (PHE) confirmed in May that the Pfizer vaccine is 97% effective in preventing death from Covid-19. After the first dose protection sits at 80% and rises to 97% following the second vaccination.

The vaccine's success was consistent across age gender race and all ethnicity demographics and across participants with a variety of underlying health conditions.

Another report directly from Pfizer confirms this statistic. It also proves that the vaccine is successful in preventing asymptomatic coronavirus infection as well as symptomatic and those without the vaccine are 44 times more likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 than those who had been fully vaccinated. Those who haven't had the vaccine are also 29 times more likely to die from Covid-19. It comes after final data was recently released from a Phase 3 study of more than 12000 who were followed-up with at least six months after their second dose.

The proven effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines is one of the reasons why some countries now require proof of Covid-19 vaccine status before allowing travellers from the UK to enter. With proof of double vaccination countries such as France are allowing visitors to enter without the mandatory quarantine period.

Is the Pfizer vaccine effective against the Delta variant?

A new study from Public Health England (PHE) confirms that the Pfizer vaccine is effective against the Delta variant (first identified in India) after the two doses.

Two jabs of the Pfizer or Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine offer a good level of protection against symptomatic Covid-19 as a result of the new variant. However they only offer 33% effectiveness against the Delta variant three weeks after the first dose compared to 50% effectiveness against the Alpha variant (first identified in Kent).

Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock followed up this news at the time saying he was ""increasingly confident"" that the final stage of lifting lockdown in England could go ahead as planned. This did not happen in the end and lockdown restrictions ended on July 19.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) have also confirmed that the Pfizer vaccine along with the Moderna vaccine is effective in protecting people against the new strain of Covid-19.

The European regulator reviewed data on the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine on this newer variant and vaccine strategy manager Marco Cavaleri said at a press conference recently that the results were ""encouraging"" and ""rather reassuring"" as the vaccine would work ""at least to an extent that will guarantee sufficient protection"".

It's for this reason that the Pfizer jab will be offered to those eligible for a third vaccine before the end of the year. From September 2021 those vulnerable to Covid will be invited to book a booster jab for added protection.

Is the Pfizer vaccine effective against the South African variant?

New research has revealed that the Pfizer vaccine is 100% effective in preventing Covid-19 cases in South Africa where the South African variant - known as B.1.351 - is dominant.

In a study of 800 participants the nine cases of Covid-19 that were diagnosed were all in the placebo group. This means that those diagnosed with Covid-19 during the study did not receive the vaccine at all so everyone who did receive the Pfizer vaccine was effectively protected against the South African variant.

This is comforting news amidst the current panic surrounding the Omicron variant. With parents worrying if schools will close again due to the newly detected strain. Yet for now the government have confirmed that schools will stay open and that the public should carry on with Christmas as normal.

Is the Pfizer vaccine effective against the Kent variant?

The Pfizer vaccine is effective against the Kent variant and is cutting community infections according to research from both Pfizer and PHE.

Various other studies have now also confirmed this finding as this variant - otherwise known as B.1.1.7 - is considered to be the dominant strain of Covid-19 around the world.

However it's vital that those currently being immunised against the virus take up their two doses. Scientists from Israel's Ministry of Health revealed that two doses of the vaccine was more than 95% effective in preventing hospitalisation infection and death from the Kent variant. This compared to the results from just a single jab where the one dose was only effective in preventing infection by 58% hospitalisation by 76% and death by 77%.

When will the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine be given?

The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be given 8 to 12 weeks after the first dose now.

Many people are now able to book their second Covid-19 vaccine dose just 8 weeks after their first as the government aims to fully vaccinate as much of the population as possible.

Originally Pfizer suggested that the space between doses should be 21 days. At the beginning of the roll out the government said they would deliver second doses 12 weeks after the first. This strategy was developed so that in the general population more people could be vaccinated with the first jab rather than giving a small number of people total immunity.

After the UK's death toll hit a heartbreaking 100000 deaths in January the hope was that this method will save more lives.

To find out when you're set to receive the second dose of your Pfizer Oxford or Moderna vaccine use the Covid-19 vaccine calculator. It takes into account your age vulnerability and other factors to produce an earliest and latest possible date for your second jab.

Will there be enough Pfizer vaccine for the second dose?

Former Matt Hancock confirmed that there will be enough Pfizer vaccine available to give everyone their second dose.

A spokesperson for the health secretary told the i paper at the time ""Everyone will receive their second dose and this will be within 12 weeks of their first.""

Credit: Getty

Officials have urged people who received their first dose to keep an eye open for their invitation to receive their second - but keep an eye out for vaccine scams.

Speaking at a press conference on February 1 Matt Hancock also told the public that other vaccines were on the way. ""I also want to let you know some good news on vaccine supply. Today we’ve ordered another 40 million vaccine doses from Valneva.

""As we have all along we’ve invested early and at risk before we know for sure if it will come good because from the start we’ve taken a no regrets attitude to backing vaccines. We’ve tried to leave nothing on the table.

""If this gets regulatory approval the Valneva vaccine like many others will be made right here in the UK.

""The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is made in Oxford and Staffordshire and Wrexham. The Novovax vaccine is being manufactured on Teesside. And if approved this Valneva vaccine will be manufactured in Livingston in Scotland.

""We didn’t start this pandemic with a large-scale on-shore vaccine manufacturing capability so we’re building one all across the United Kingdom. The vaccine programme just goes to show how important it is to have the UK working as one together.""

We now have over 400 million doses of vaccines on order."" He said ""This is obviously more than the UK population needs. And my attitude has always been we protect every UK citizen as fast as we can. And at the same time we’re generous around the world.""

How much does a dose of the Pfizer vaccine cost?

All the Covid-19 vaccinations including the Pfizer vaccine are completely free to the general public. The NHS is offering the vaccine at no cost to anyone who has been invited to receive it and currently it's not legally possible to pay for a private Covid-19 vaccination in the UK.

However the government are paying for everyone to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Per dose the Pfizer vaccine costs the government $20 (£15). It's much more expensive than the Oxford vaccine at £3 per dose but cheaper than the Moderna vaccine which comes in at $38 (£28).

It's thought that this is one of the reasons why the roll-out of the Oxford vaccine which has come from Oxford University and is being produced largely in the UK has been hailed as such as success.

Is the second vaccine dose the same as the first?

The first and second doses of the vaccine are similar but they work in different ways. The first dose of the Pfizer vaccine will help the immune system crease a response to the virus that causes Covid-19 while the second dose acts as a 'booster' for this protection. The break between the two doses gives the body a chance to create the immune response before the second jab works to deliver another spike in Covid-19 antibodies.

Both the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines require two doses to make the receiver immune to Covid-19.

Who is a priority for the Covid-19 vaccine in the UK?

Age is the biggest risk factor for Covid 19 so older people such those in care homes and their carers were the first priority for the Pfizer vaccine. All priority groups should now have been offered their first dose of the vaccine and currently the vaccine is being offered to everyone over the age of 18.

The government recently confirmed that all those eligible for a dose of any Covid-19 vaccine will be offered an appointment by the end of July this year with second doses coming 8 to 12 weeks after that date.

A prioritisation list published by the government confirms this as ""older adults’ resident in a care home and care home workers"" were first on the list followed by ""all those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers"". After that the priority list works in this order...

All those 75 years of age and over

All those 70 years of age and over

All those 65 years of age and over

High-risk adults under 65 years of age

Moderate-risk adults under 65 years of age

All those 60 years of age and over

All those 55 years of age and over

All those 50 years of age and over

Rest of the population (priority to be determined)

Currently those under 16 years of age are not eligible to receive any of the Covid-19 vaccines in the UK - except in exceptional circumstances.

Will children be offered the Pfizer vaccine?

For now it looks as though that children under the age of 16 will not receive the vaccine unless they are extremely vulnerable due to other conditions. However this decision is still currently under review.

This is because children are at risk of catching the virus but the symptoms of coronavirus in children are famously less severe and damaging than in adults.

What are the side effects of the Pfizer vaccine?

About one in three people report side effects of the vaccine including: soreness at the site of the injection fever aches and chills.

Credit: Getty

This comes from a recent report by the Zoe app a team at King's College London. They found that from those who had received the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine in early January this year 51% of people reported one of these side effects but none were serious. The most common one at 37% was pain or swelling near where the jab was given after both the first and second injections.

None of the side effects reported in the study which used the experiences of around 40000 people who were mostly healthcare workers were serious at all and went away within just a few days.

The side effects are caused by the injection itself or the body's process of building protection against the virus rather than the virus itself. None of the Covid-19 vaccines use the live virus and none can give people the illness. To combat the virus the vaccine uses a harmless element of coronavirus to teach the body to recognise and fight Covid-19 if it comes into contact with it.

In fact recent findings from the MHRA the UK's vaccine regulator has found that both the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are ""extremely safe"". In their study only 3 in 1000 people were affected with any side effects at all from the vaccines. These were the same side effects recorded by the King's College report with mild cases of sore arms tiredness and flu-like symptoms topping the list.

The Pfizer vaccine and heart inflammation

A new study on the Pfizer vaccine from researchers in Israel has uncovered a smaller number of heart inflammation cases mainly among young men which they believe could be associated with the Pfizer Covid vaccine.

Heart inflammation also known as myocarditis was reported in their study for 275 out of roughly 5 million people who had received the first vaccine in the last six months. The reported symptoms of this heart inflammation were only mild and mainly affected those under the age of 30 with the condition most frequently seen in those male patients aged between 16 to 19 years old.

Symptoms of myocarditis include:

Tightness of the chest

Shortness of breath

High temperature

Tiredness and fatigue

Palpitations

Most of those who experienced this particularly rare side effect spent fewer than five days in hospital. 95% of cases were only considered to have mild symptoms according to the study produced by multiple teams of experts on behalf of Israel's health ministry.

However Pfizer have said that they have not seen a higher rate of heart inflammation than would normally be expected in the general population. The creators of the vaccine confirmed that they were aware of Israel's study but that no direct link to its vaccine had been established yet.

The Pfizer vaccine and allergic reactions

At the beginning of the vaccine rollout two NHS workers had serious allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine. In response the UK regulator issued a general warning to those with a long-term history of serious allergic reactions against having the jab.

The two staff members suffered from an anaphylactoid reaction with symptoms including a skin rash breathlessness and a drop in blood pressure. It was very different from a potentially fatal anaphylaxis allergic reaction so the warning simply serves as a precaution.

The advice only applies to those who have had reactions to medicines food or vaccines in the past the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has said.

""As is common with new vaccines the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely"" Professor Stephen Powis medical director for the NHS in England said.

In the days following the news NHS GP Dr Ellie Cannon told BBC Radio London that allergic reactions and side effects are still not that common. Those administering the vaccine are also more than equipped to deal with any adverse reactions. “We always check before we give people vaccination."" Dr Cannon said ""It’s a rare side effect and it’s unfortunate that it’s happened in the last couple of days.”

“Talk to your GP about it or talk to the practice nurse whoever is doing the vaccination in the hospital. We’re quite used to this because we have this every year with the flu vaccination and with other vaccinations. So we are used to it and we will decide whether or not your level of allergy is enough that you can’t have the vaccination.”

“I would personally advise my patients to go [and have the vaccine] because it’s only patients with the most severe allergies that wouldn’t have it and if you do want to have the vaccination…we do give vaccinations to people with allergies and we do it in a safe hospital environment and we do that every year so I would go to your appointment if called.”

“This will affect very few people. It doesn’t feel like that now because obviously we’ve had these two cases but from what the MHRA has published it should only affect very few people.”

Immunology expert Prof Peter Openshaw from Imperial College London has also said ""The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well.""

Which countries have approved the Pfizer vaccine?

The UK was the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine for effective and immediate use. This was shortly followed by Bahrain and then the 27 member states of the EU.

The US was going to be one of the first countries set on rolling out the vaccine due to their record-high levels of coronavirus. Although the vaccine was approved for emergency use the Food and Drug Administration have now fully approved the Pfizer vaccine for those 16-years old or more.

Other countries set to approve the Pfizer vaccine in the coming months are those in Asia and Australia. But officials have confirmed that they won't be rushing into anything. Head of the Australian regulator Professor John Skeritt told ABC that Australia was on a different timeline to the UK and the US and wouldn't be pressured to approve the vaccine earlier than January 2021.

Speaking to the news site he said this was because the UK and the US are in a different situation with coronavirus. “They're not approvals that those two countries are talking about they're emergency use authorisations and they're really reflecting the desperate situation of those countries” he said. “We have to remember on many days day after day the US is having more deaths than we've had in the whole year of the pandemic here in Australia.”

While professor of infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore Dale Fisher said that countries who had the virus under control didn't have to issue emergency authorisations. He said they were able to learn lessons from the rest of the world such as how long immunity lasts with the Pfizer vaccine.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The first thing Hidalgo was asked elicited some laughter from the live audience to nobody’s surprise.

Hidalgo is appointment viewing on and off the court.

“My teammates call me a gnat because I’m all over them” Hidalgo said when asked if she has a go-to nickname.

There were a couple other quick-hitting questions thrown Hidalgo’s way. She said the high point of her career so far was Notre Dame winning the ACC Tournament in March. The low point was Notre Dame losing to Oregon State in the Sweet 16. She gave props to her parents and coaches for getting her to where she is today.

Here’s everything else Hidalgo said at the summit.

On arriving at Notre Dame and becoming one of the best players in the country as a true freshman…

“I know what God instilled in me. I know the gifts that he’s placed in me even from a young age. I’m big on my faith. I know God as blessed me with a talent so it’s so easy to be able to just go out there and just play my game. Also I have coaches and teammates that have so much confidence in me. When they tell me to go score the ball we need you to score we need you to play defense like you do it just makes everything so easy to just go out and do it when they give you the keys to do so.”

On Notre Dame head coach Niele Ivey being a players’ coach…

“It’s definitely a blessing to be able to have that connection with your coach to be able to go to her and say ‘This isn’t working’ or ‘What do you see? I don’t know what to do in this situation.’ It just makes the game so much easier and it makes me as a player want to run through a wall for a coach like that who gives everything and instills everything in you. It’s truly a blessing to be able to have that connection with her.”

On Notre Dame’s chances of winning the national title in the next few seasons…

“Absolutely. Absolutely. Not to be cocky but we have a lot of talent. Women’s basketball in general has a lot of talent. You can find it all over. But we have a lot of injuries coming back and transfers especially players like Olivia Miles coming back. A lot of people might have forgotten but she’s going to come back and shock the world with the talent she has. Emma Risch Cassandre Prosper. We just have so much firepower coming back. It’s going to be exciting.”

On someone she looks up to…

“[Skylar Diggins-Smith] for sure. Obviously she went to Notre Dame but she is just a dog on the court. Her being a smaller guard and just the defensive firepower that she brings I’m able to look at that and kind of model my game after that.”

More on what Ivey means to her…

“Just to persevere. Obviously Coach Ivey went through some stuff during the season and just to be able to see her come out on the court with all the stuff that she had gone through and was still going through and still to be able to come to practices and talk to recruits even through everything that she had been through it was amazing to see. I saw how much she persevered through all the stuff she was going through.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

BPS Athletic/Activities Director Thad Dilbeck confirmed Wednesday that last year's boy' head ninth grade basketball coach Justyn Shaw has been offered and accepted the head coaching position for the Lady Bruins.

Shaw whose hiring still has to be formally approved by the Bartlesville Board of Education has worked in the Bruin boys' program since 2018.

""I'm very impressed with Coach Shaw's professionalism and his work ethic"" Dilbeck said. ""Most important is watching him interact with our students to where he seems to get the best out of our athletes certainly.""

His full time job is as a category specialist/lead buyer for Phillips 66 which he has held since 2016. Prior to that Shaw worked as an inside sales rep for MRC Global.

Right out of college Shaw made his living in manual forge operations for Norris Sucker Rod.

Shaw's association with local basketball extends more than a decade.

From 2010 to 2016 he coached with the Bartlesville Bruins Association summer basketball program.

Frontier Valley Conference hardwood competition is nothing new for Shaw — he is a graduate of Jenks High School.

Coming out of high school Shaw played four years 2001-to-2005 at McPherson (Kan.) College and earned a degree in business administration.

BPS hired Shaw in 2018 as the boys' head eighth-grade coach a position he held for two seasons.

He moved up in age group to coach the ninth grade boys' team in 2020-21.

Shaw and his wife Holly have been blessed with a four-month old child.

Shaw takes the place of Talby Justus who never coached one season game for Bartlesville.

Justus came on board in the spring as the new head coach but resigned in late June in order to become an assistant women's basketball coach at the University of Tulsa. Justus had served for one season (2020-21) as the Pawhuska High School head boys' basketball coach.

Prior to Justus' hiring by Bartlesville Donnie Martin guided Lady Bruin basketball for three seasons (2018-2021). He recorded nearly 30 career wins dialing in his best season in the program in the 2018-19 campaign (18-8).

Prior to Martin Krista Binam served a few years as the Lady Bruins' head coach including the historic campaign of 2017-18 when Bartlesville surged through the regular season at 23-0 and finished 26-2 overall including the program's first state tournament appearance in 25 years.

The last Lady Bruins' head basketball coached hired in-house was Gerald Thompson in the late 1990's. Thompson had served for many years prior to that as an assistant to Rod Berger.

Shaw is set to become the 10th head coach in Lady Bruin basketball history since the modern Bartlesville High School began in 1982.

Scotts Bluff and South Bluff are the two bluffs located within Scotts Bluff National Monument. NPS Bluff Five to ten million years ago the last great uplift of the western region of North America occurred. The steeper terrain now forced streams to cut into and excavate the sediments they had formerly deposited. However the original seabed still lies 250 ft (77 m) below ground level. As the sedimentary layers were carved out harder cap rock resisted this erosive action. Four to five million years of this weathering carved out the prominent landscape visible today at Scotts Bluff National Monument. In their diaries the early pioneers referred to them as sand hills mounds or bluffs. Indeed the steep cliffs of the hills are bluffs but in geographical terms the bluffs are only a part of much larger formations.

The steeper terrain now forced streams to cut into and excavate the sediments they had formerly deposited. However the original seabed still lies 250 ft (77 m) below ground level. As the sedimentary layers were carved out harder cap rock resisted this erosive action. Four to five million years of this weathering carved out the prominent landscape visible today at Scotts Bluff National Monument. In their diaries the early pioneers referred to them as sand hills mounds or bluffs. Indeed the steep cliffs of the hills are bluffs but in geographical terms the bluffs are only a part of much larger formations. The Colorado Plateau covers an area of approximately 390000 square kilometers (150580 square miles) in the Four Corners region of the Southwestern United States. NPS Plateau Plateaus are an extensive raised flat-surfaced area extending for many miles with little relief. About two million years ago great ice sheets advanced southward from Canada into the United States traveling as far south as Montana and the Dakotas. This area is a glacial-stream carved landscape modified by glaciers and covered by glacially transported mineral debris. Subsequent stream action has not had a significant role in further shaping the landscape. The unglaciated Missouri Plateau however stretching south from western Nebraska and east into Texas was shaped by the cutting action of rivers and streams primarily the Missouri River and its tributaries. Plateaus are usually exposed to more erosion than other landforms because of their high elevation and flatness. As water coursed over the plateaus the loose sandstone was gradually carved out and carried away. Plateaus are an extensive raised flat-surfaced area extending for many miles with little relief.

The solitary butte known as Dome Rock is one of the most distinctive geologic features of Scotts Bluff National Monument. NPS Butte Smaller mesas that stand conspicuously alone but were once part of a larger mesa before erosion separated it are known as buttes. They are typically capped by a horizontal hard rock that protects the lower layers from erosion. Dome Rock (pictured right) just south of Scotts Bluff is a good example of a butte and now stands apart from its parent South Bluff. Bear Butte near Sturgis South Dakota is another type of butte. However it was formed from ingneous intrusion rather than erosion. Smaller mesas that stand conspicuously alone but were once part of a larger mesa before erosion separated it are known as buttes.

NPS/Brian Poffenberger Pillar If we take the ever-present erosion process a step further the butte continues to be worn down until only a narrow pinnacle or pillar is left standing atop a wider base. A classic example of a pillar is Chimney Rock 23 miles to the east of Scotts Bluff on Highway 92. Of all the landmarks along the Oregon Trail Chimney Rock received more mention than any others in the pioneer diaries. Its spire could be seen from a distance of thirty miles by travelers anxious for some visual relief after traversing the Great Plains. It not only marked a good camping site with good water but also the end of the monotonous flat terrain they had spent the last two months crossing. Although diminished in stature since the covered-wagon emigrants passed by today the column still towers nearly 500 feet above the North Platte River. As the various processes continue to wear down the ancient rock material the existing formations so familiar to even modern day travelers will continue to change shape over the next hundreds and even thousands of years.

When you are talking about small city governments the two don’t always converge into a cohesive logical whole. Cities try hard but the solutions are not always an improvement on the problems they’d hoped to resolve.

And once in place good luck getting rid of them. An example would be small city-run police departments. Sensible souls would opt for the services of a regional Sheriff’s Department since they’re already paying much of the taxes required.

Funding a largely redundant city agency is no cheap trick either. Currently the Sierra Madre PD streets 16 officers on a yearly total budget of $3300000 or $207000 per blue guy. Significant chunks of that being evergreen taxpayer contributions to CalPERS.

The dream may have been to place peace officers in town to help residents cope with the riskier aspects of our imperfect world. However a more pressing consideration today has become funding it. Begging the question: Does a PD exist to fight crime or coerce rubber-spine townie pols into enhancing their cheddar?

At times Sierra Madre’s City Council was composed entirely of folks elected on promises of not raising taxes and rates. None of them once elected honored that. One obstreperous soul John Capoccia rose to the purple by freeloading onto a then trendy tea party taxpayer revolt. Two terms later John has yet to oppose a single tax increase.

In the city manager game a brave new look has emerged. Signing on for relatively short periods of time today’s modern executive wants to “save cities.” Which is a nice way of saying to accommodate the desires of spendthrift boutique communities and maintain their illusions of being self-contained pockets of privilege. Despite the absurd costs.

Gabriel Engeland who has been Sierra Madre’s new wave city manager for nearly five years typifies this trend. Deciding now is a best moment to move on Gabe will begin serving the troubled city of Los Altos soon fifth wealthiest per capita in America.

However Sierra Madre wasn’t the first city Gabe saved. That honor goes to Trinidad Colorado. Having lost all meaning in life upon surrendering its “Sex Change Capital of America” crown along with becoming the former home to Pioneer Natural Resources this mountain-high border burgh needed cash assistance pronto. They hired Engeland.

The solution? Marijuana. Located near the New Mexico line not far from Oklahoma’s panhandle Trinidad became an accessible mecca for groovy heads hoping to enjoy Colorado’s newly libertarian pot laws the first of their kind anywhere. So pronounced was that success CNN did a feature report on T-Dad’s economic miracle.

Sierra Madre was a different kind of woe. With city fathers unwilling to manufacture bank selling ganja to the neighborhood adolescents Gabe had to come up with a different source of quick cash. That solution? The city’s few remaining open spaces. Housing developers practically cocoon at City Hall these days with this opportunity for millions of dollars in fresh tax cash and fees keeping the “full service city” dream alive and employees smiling.

For this Engeland became known as the man who saved Sierra Madre.

Los Altos? They just recently fired their city manager for working some kind of Lone Ranger development side deals. Done without stakeholder approval or involvement. Unauthorized competition you might say. Home as the bucolic city is to Silicon Valley billionaires once this scandal became known the anger was profound. Lawsuits are on the way.

They need someone to save their city. Los Altos could become Gabe’s hat trick.

Luke Bryan sang a “Down To One” duet with his biggest little fan Darci Claire on Saturday (July 17) when his headlining Proud To Be Right Here Tour stopped in Bristow Virginia.

After spotting Darci in the front row singing along to “Waves” the superstar invited her to join him on stage.

“That was awesome” he told her. “Come here!”

Darci who was sporting a homemade “Country Girl Shake It For Me” t-shirt then joined him to sing “Down To One” as he asked her “Do you know this one?”

As thousands of fans watched on Darci belted out the lyrics to the chart-topping hit with the ACM Entertainer of the Year’s arm around her.

After stealing the show with her adorable performance the 7-year-old returned to her seat as Bryan shouted “Y’all give it up for Darci!”

Bryan’s show in Bristow was a memorable one as he celebrated his 45th birthday with his family on the road. He received a special custom cake backstage with his wife Caroline and children by his side.

Caroline even brought a piñata and sported a “halfway to 90” shirt to celebrate Bryan’s big day.

From creating housing units for industrial sector employees in Canada’s north to affordable housing units and custom cottages in Simcoe County Northern Shield Development Corporation is putting a unique twist on the conventional construction market.

The company which specializes in building modular and container buildings initially got its start building housing units out of shipping containers for the oil and gas power and mining marketplace explained owner and president Steve Marshall adding the company then bought back a large quantity of those containers and began turning them into a variety of different affordable housing options.

Northern Shield he continued was born out of a joint venture with Cree First Nations for a power project where Northern Shield supplied the camp. The focus then shifted to creating housing in Indigenous communities and over the years Marshall said they’ve been slowly bringing their unique housing concept to more southern areas - including affordable housing projects in Orillia and Barrie.

An affordable housing solution

While Marshall couldn’t disclose the location of the Barrie site he did say it is part of the County of Simcoe and the City of Barrie’s affordable housing strategy. Container homes he explained offer a unique - and often more affordable - building option.

“The answer a year ago would be different from the answer today. The bottom line is shipping containers is an alternative to conventional construction"" said Marshall.

""There have been a whole bunch of adaptive technologies that people have worked with to try to figure out other ways to supply housing. The mission behind looking at these other options is really trying to find ways to lower the overall cost of construction"" he explained.

""New builds cost of real estate and costs of existing homes has far surpassed people’s ability to pay for construction.”

The conventional marketplace he added is extremely taxed right now.

“We have a labour shortage. There are so many housing starts so many condo projects and so much construction work that anyone who is in the industry can barely keep up” he said.

“Manufactured modular housing is a different process because you’re not necessarily relying on the same construction trades that the conventional building market relies on"" Marshall said. ""You’re in a manufactured setting and while the people you’re hiring are very knowledgeable about construction it’s more of a manufacturing environment which allows us to tap into a different employment pool than conventional construction.”

Being able to build in a controlled environment also allows for a little bit more cost certainty and cost control as you don’t have to worry about the same delays and headaches that conventional construction projects typically run into with weather issues.

The overruns and the unknowns of labour costs are mitigated by manufactured housing explained Marshall.

“You’re building a shell and the frame of your building is now a steel framed container. You’re not into that whole wood rat race right now with wood costs just going absolutely bananas"" he noted.

Marshall said prior to the meteoric jump in the cost of lumber due to the pandemic he would have estimated the cost of using a shipping container (based solely on materials) would have netted out roughly the same as a traditional build. Where you end up saving money he noted is your speed to delivery.

“With conventional construction you’re waiting for each step of the construction to be completed and pass (inspection) before the next phase can start.

""Quite often their best laid plans are usually out the window in the first 30 days of construction and you’re chasing the eight ball right from the get go whereas in a manufactured environment there is some sort of security and a different build process” he said. “The cost of all construction materials are on the rise and the goal is to remove as many cost variables that you possibly can to try and keep the build price as low as possible.”

Northern Shield is currently in the process of building bachelor-style transitional housing units that will be located in Barrie which Marshall said will help fill a gap in the marketplace for housing that desperately needs filled.

“There are a lot of people in rental units or in that first layer of emergency housing that can’t get out of the shelter or supportive housing because the product is not available for them in the market"" said Marshall.

""The goal of this is to provide in a small way another little blip of units to alleviate some of the pressure to Barrie’s housing crisis really starting at the hardest to house level.”

Expanding their horizons

The demand for the style of housing the company offers has grown significantly over the last few years so Northern Shield has begun to expand their horizons to include single-family residential and custom-built housing/cottages - starting with a shipping container cottage that was completed last summer on his family’s property in Tiny Township.

“You see it on Pinterest and you see it on all different facets of social media but there’s not a lot of people who do it like us locally"" he explained. ""There are only a handful of people that do shipping container homes in a meaningful way” said Marshall noting on an average week the company would typically get about four inquiries specific to their custom container houses.

During the pandemic that number has continued to grow and as people have seen Marshall’s cottage listed to rent on Airbnb. “We really built that cottage as a show piece to show some of the things that are possible using this style of build.”

A multifaceted approach

The business explained Marshall is split into a few different facets. While there is still a focus on the multi-residential marketplace - which includes mainstream units as well as affordable housing units they are also looking to create a place for themselves in the regular housing market.

“We are very passionate and vocal about building affordably ... and we really try to service that market but on the other side of it we have the custom units (such as) your accessory dwellings like Granny suites backyard units bunkies modular offices and pods and pool bars. We have even built COVID isolation units” said Marshall.

Another project currently on the go at their Barrie manufacturing site is a floating shipping container that could serve as a floating bunkie or a dockside pool bar. Most recently Northern Shield has located an 8x53 foot container in the main wharf in Gravenhurst which will serve not only as a temporary office space for Muskoka Steamships as their office undergoes renovation but also a showpiece for visitors to the wharf to see what Northern Shield does.

Focused on a solution

With affordable housing in the city being such a big issue Marshall said they are extremely focused on trying to help create a solution and are putting out a call to individuals who might have land - or even different concepts and ideas - that could allow for this type of construction to happen on their property.

“We’re very active in trying to find a few other locations to try to replicate building opportunities. We are looking for locations that have an existing house on it … that has a big yard. We have a concept and have modules that we’ve specifically designed that meet requirements of the city and all things affordable under requirements for housing here in Barrie” he said. “So we are trying to find people to partner up with to use their existing space to put our units on.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmNlc3Rlcm5ld3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy8xOTQ0NzA5Ny53b3JjZXN0ZXItc3VtbWVyLXN3aW1taW5nLXBhc3Qtd2VudC1kaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Worcester summer swimming in the past: Where we went for a dip,"But a century ago as you might expect things were rather different. Then it was either Park’s Baths in Sansome Walk or the river. The Severn of course has always been a magnet albeit a rather dangerous one for anyone brave/daft enough to jump in. Its cold water and strong currents making a particularly toxic mix for sweaty bodies during a heatwave.

The bathing barges at Worcester. One for boys and one for girls

In an effort to make river bathing a safer business the Victorians sank a couple of large old barges into the water near the Grandstand on Pitchcroft. The hulls were then removed to allow the river to flow through leaving what were in effect two wooden cages within which it was possible to splash about. Amazingly they didn’t cease use until after the Second World War.

Although rather primitive affairs they became very popular in an era when by and large it was either that or the open water. Being as society then viewed mixed bathing as one pleasure too many for the hoi polloi boys were restricted to one barge and girls to another.

Ensuring it stayed that way was Albert Webb the waterman who although a great character had a very Victorian approach to public bathing.

Maybe as another of his official duties was to recover drowned bodies from the Severn he didn’t want to fish out any unnecessary victims of larking about.

The alternative to the bathing barges were the privately owned baths in Sansome Walk. These opened in the 1850s and followed the style of the more exotic baths on the Continent. They had an entrance porch supported by two splendid carved stone pillars identical to those seen in Cheltenham.

Park’s Baths in Sansome Walk Worcester’s swimming rendezvous for more than a century

Indeed rumour had it they were leftovers from work done there. Inside were brilliant-coloured fine glass panels supposedly creating a Turkish atmosphere and a maze of rooms in which different kinds of baths could be taken – sulphur iodine salt calomel and others.

In 1890 William Park took over and eventually became owner. As the fashion for exotic baths died out the business ran Turkish baths and slipper baths and had the only genuine swimming pool in Worcester with generations of city school children learning to swim in what became known as “Park’s Puddle”.

As the decades rolled on the facility began to appear ever more dated but for quite some time Mr Park successfully managed to fight off any plan to build a municipal bath which would have put him out of business. However progress could not be denied not even in Worcester and in the 1970s all of a sudden the city had two decent swimming pools when a local authority one rose from the ashes on the old Park’s site and a community project bath opened on the other side of the river at Lower Wick.

The plans by Rothelowman and landscape firm Form show each tower would be targeted to a separate demographic and built in separate stages.

Tower one the smallest is aimed at young people and families with a main pool lounge pool and bar dining areas gym and daycare centre.

Tower two would cater for families with a kids’ zone sky lounge and gym while the third and tallest tower is aimed at “mature lifestyle buyers” with library meeting rooms and the suspended lap pool.

The 103 Ferny Avenue block with frontage on Surfers Paradise Boulevard and Pandanas and Ocean avenues was last sold by Hyundai in 2014 for $21 million.",,,

The Mahtomedi native served as captain of the University of North Carolina's national champion soccer teams in 1999 and 2000 and played professionally before going into financial services with Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.

She believes that Bell Bank — family- and employee-owned and one of the country's largest privately held banks with more than $10 billion in assets — can compete with big publicly traded banks.

She takes over as the Fargo-based Bell pursues further growth in the Twin Cities and Phoenix areas.

Cogswell got her start as a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs then was responsible for marketing strategy for J.P. Morgan's asset management business before heading up product marketing at Providence Equity Partners.

Cogswell most recently was managing director head of product marketing and global insights at Principal Global Investors the asset management division of Principal Financial group.

Cogswell moved back to Minnesota four years ago with her husband.

She has a bachelor's degree in communication studies from the University of North Carolina and after college she played on the U.S. Women's National Soccer team from 1998 to 2003 and for the Boston Breakers of the Women's United Soccer Association.

Cogswell is ""a respected and transformative leader who will help us connect with customers in core and new markets and continue to build our brand in regions across the country"" Michael Solberg Bell's president and CEO said in a release.

Q: What brought you to Bell Bank?

A: I spent 17 years a large part of that in New York City working at larger banks and asset managers. I had always hoped that I would land someplace smaller and take the knowledge and apply it to an organization that was a little earlier in its growth trajectory. Bell's strategy is that they've always put their customers and employees first and that if they do the right things they'll grow the right way and that's what's happened.

Q: How will your work support growth in new markets?

A: One thing from the top down is building greater awareness of our brand. We have a great opportunity especially in these newer markets because when you look at the landscape competitively we have a good story to tell. From a bottom-up perspective it gets back to the customers and understanding those touch points. When you're in an industry that's highly commoditized it's really important that every single touch point is good.

Q: How has your athletic experience influenced your career in business?

A: You learn how to operate on a team; you learn how to compete and have high expectations but without being a jerk. You learn about accountability and time management. All these have served me well whatever I'm doing. I realized early on that if you work really hard at something and differentiate yourself there will be opportunity and your world becomes a little bit wider than it was every time you do that.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

At Mike's request there will be no service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vZGF0YS1uZXdzL3Byb2N0ZXItZ2FtYmxlLWNvLXN0b2NrLW91dHBlcmZvcm1zLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWRlc3BpdGUtbG9zc2VzLW9uLXRoZS1kYXktOWMwYWRkOTgtYjg0ZTA3ZmVlMGI10gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvZGF0YS1uZXdzL3Byb2N0ZXItZ2FtYmxlLWNvLXN0b2NrLW91dHBlcmZvcm1zLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWRlc3BpdGUtbG9zc2VzLW9uLXRoZS1kYXktOWMwYWRkOTgtYjg0ZTA3ZmVlMGI1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter & Gamble Co. stock outperforms competitors despite losses on the day,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/data-news/procter-gamble-co-stock-outperforms-competitors-despite-losses-on-the-day-9c0add98-b84e07fee0b5 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vZGF0YS1uZXdzL3Byb2N0ZXItZ2FtYmxlLWNvLXN0b2NrLW91dHBlcmZvcm1zLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWRlc3BpdGUtbG9zc2VzLW9uLXRoZS1kYXktOWMwYWRkOTgtYjg0ZTA3ZmVlMGI10gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvZGF0YS1uZXdzL3Byb2N0ZXItZ2FtYmxlLWNvLXN0b2NrLW91dHBlcmZvcm1zLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWRlc3BpdGUtbG9zc2VzLW9uLXRoZS1kYXktOWMwYWRkOTgtYjg0ZTA3ZmVlMGI1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

I really looked forward to the fun of making sense of a radically titled work by a conservative no a reactionary who not only decries the powers and profits of Facebook Twitter Google Amazon and Apple but also proposes breaking them up.

I figured the only hard part would be to fit in all the pieces: Hawley's rightwing politics his well-known political ambitions his outrageous efforts to bolster Trump's coup attempt his book's publishing story and of course what he had to say.

I was wrong. It was not fun it was unnerving. Not simply because I kept encountering sympathetic historical references to strikes and campaigns that I never anticipated in a book by a rightwing politician but even more so because in Hawley's penultimate chapter I ran right into--boom--paragraphs that truly threw me for a loop. Three paragraphs that rendered both a narrative of America's democratic promise imperative and struggles and a call for democratic action which I could readily imagine having written myself.

He writes of a radical-democratic class-struggle narrative that politicians such as socialist Bernie Sanders and progressive Elizabeth Warren indeed every self-professed progressive Democrat should have been articulating and cultivating for years but to my persistent exasperation and the left's persistent failings had not. And yet hell here was Josh Hawley doing so.

Consider the paragraphs. Read them aloud as if they were the words of a campaign speech (which they may end up becoming):

Big Tech looms as large as any corporate power in American history as large as the railroads from a century back as large as the steel trust and the oil trust and the money trust from the height of the Gilded Age. Its sway is prodigious; its reach is wide. And yet like those earlier monopolies Big Tech's power is ultimately precarious because Americans are never long contented to be ruled over by barons. They agitate they protest. They rebel against it. That is what is happening now. And that is why there is cause for hope... It is possible to imagine a future beyond corporate liberalism. That political economy has dominated American life for a century now... but it has not served America well. It has steadily eroded the power and standing of the working class. It has steadily widened our class divisions and installed a professional elite at the prow of society an elite that grows further removed from the lives and aspirations of working people with every passing year. Corporate liberalism turns out to be a political economy of aristocracy very much of the kind the founders feared and warned against of the kind Populists remonstrated against and Theodore Roosevelt resisted and it has been with us now for a century too long. The battle to end the tyranny of Big Tech is ultimately a battle to break the hold of corporate liberalism.

Those words are engaging even encouraging--right? But what are we to make of the fact that Josh Hawley wrote them? That question obsessed me and I only finally came to see what they portended when I turned away from current events and thought about them in terms of the past forty-five years of corporate and conservative class-war and culture-war campaigns.

Hawley is smart. Indeed dangerous. He may act like Trump's apprentice. But I have come to realize that his real inspiration probably is Ronald Reagan: The Reagan who recognized that American working people for all their fears and frustrations in the face of the manifold crises of the late 1970s continued to believe in the nation's promise to feel the imperative that it engendered and to yearn for action.

This is the Reagan who fashioned a strange-bedfellows ""New Right"" coalition of corporate executives Main Street businessmen Christian evangelicals conservative neoconservative and free-market intellectuals and single-interest groups such as the NRA to win the Republican nomination. The Reagan who shocked conservatives when he accepted the nomination by quoting the words of popular heroes of the left and working people--Thomas Paine Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt.

The Reagan who hijacked the Founders the Stars and Stripes and (don't flinch) the idea of American exceptionalism stripped them of their revolutionary and radical lives histories and meanings and refashioned them as the champions symbol and vision of limited government private enterprise and a faith-based nation. The Reagan who called on Americans to join him in a ""crusade to Make America Great Again (yes he said it before Trump) and went on to win the presidency in 1980 by defeating the unpopular neoliberal Democratic president Jimmy Carter.

You get where I'm going?

Senator Hawley wants to be president. In fact by most accounts he was looking forward to succeeding Trump in the White House--though who knew his vision-quest was so powerful it would lead him to do whatever it might take to try to guarantee that Trump himself would be handing over the keys to him.

Seriously who could imagine that Hawley would embrace the ""Big Lie"" that Trump not Joe Biden actually won in November turn out in Congress on January 6 to formally challenge the Electoral College ballot count and help to turn the crowd massing outside the Capitol into an angry destructive murderous mob? Remember his encouraging fist pump as he headed into the building? Not long after he joined 34 fellow Republicans to block a bill launching a Congressional investigation into the terrible events of that day. Still given that the GOP has become a party of reactionaries it is impossible to say whether he has disqualified himself from a presidential bid.

Hawley evidently wrote The Tyranny of Big Tech to prepare the groundwork for an eventual run. And his book makes clear that despite his banker parentage and elite education at Stanford and Yale Law School he is determined to distinguish himself as the populist among Republicans. (Even at this distance from DC I can hear Thomas Frank shouting ""There is no such thing as a rightwing populist!"").

Originally contracted by Simon & Schuster (which happens to be one of my own publishers) Hawley's book ended up at the conservative publishing house Regnery after Simon & Schuster cancelled the contract in reaction to Hawley's actions on January 6. Unfortunately this served Hawley well for it helped turn the book into a national bestseller and bolstered his own efforts to portray himself as a champion of the people versus the powers-that-be corporate or political.

The preface is usually the last thing an author writes. Hawley opens his with ""This is a book the corporate monopolies did not want you to read. Corporate America tried to cancel it just as they have tried to cancel me and to cancel or control the speech the communication even the ideas of millions of Americans.

In Part One of his book Hawley starts by resurrecting the Founders' anti-aristocratic vision of a Republic governed by the ""common man and woman."" He then moves on to recall the diverse campaigns and initiatives of populists labor unionists and progressives--most notably ""Trust-Buster"" Theodore Roosevelt--to sustain that vision against the expanding power wealth and ambitions of the Robber Barons of the Gilded Age. Finally he recounts how President Woodrow Wilson (supposedly) rescued the corporate titans from TR's trust-busting politics by transferring anti-trust questions to a new Federal Trade Commission ""corporatizing"" government itself ""along the lines of the modern and progressive corporation"" and creating an elite of experts who would not just regulate business to assure prosperity for all but liberate citizens from their democratic labors of self-government in favor of them pursuing self-empowerment through consumption.

In Part Two Hawley critically surveys and damningly decries the powers practices and profits of today's corporate trusts--Facebook Twitter Google Amazon and Apple--and their ""robber baron"" bosses' (Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Jeff Bezos most readily come to mind) voracious ambitions to ""control everything"" from politics and ideas to personal behavior. These chapters are not exactly original but they do present a powerful indictment of not only Big Tech's corporate operations but also the role of Republican and Democratic politicians in licensing them.

In Part Three propelled by the Founders' vision and the threat to it that the Big Tech corporations represent Hawley proposes breaking up those corporate trusts and aggressively regulating the new smaller companies.

The book clearly distinguishes Hawley from his fellow Republicans. And yet as much as his references and proposals smack of populism and progressivism they do not in the end make him a populist progressive or radical. Note his historical assertions and omissions: While the Founders crafted world-historic revolutionary documents projecting an unprecedented republic they hardly envisioned one--as Lincoln would put it decades later--of by and for the People. Just as our rulers and governors today do they feared the democratic spirit and energy of the common people in all their diversity that Thomas Paine's Common Sense unleashed. They accepted slavery and marginalized women. They also set up significant federal and state constitutional barriers to contain the democratic aspirations of white workingmen.

Hawley fails to mention that the Populists' envisioned plans to end the robber barons included nationalizing the railroads creating a cooperative financial system and ultimately transforming the United States into a cooperative commonwealth. He also makes no reference whatsoever to Eugene Debs whose Socialist Party at the time arguably was the party most committed to the vision of an American republic of by and for the common people. Finally he celebrates Teddy Roosevelt for busting some trusts but neglects to mention that TR protected others. And though I hate to defend Woodrow Wilson I must note that Wilson addressed the problem of trusts and monopolies too by signing into law the Clayton Antitrust Act and yes creating the Federal Trade Commission in 1914.

Conveniently Hawley cuts off his historical narrative in 1920. I suspect he does so to avoid acknowledging how Franklin Roosevelt and the New Dealers not only subjected capital to democratic supervision and regulation but also democratically empowered farmers and workers to stand up to corporate bosses.

Ironically enough however when Hawley points to an example of how Congress might legislatively block Big Tech from pursuing say ""conglomerate mergers"" that enable companies to ""reach-[their]-tentacles-into-every-conceivable-market"" he cites the Glass-Steagall Act. That's the law enacted by FDR and the Democrats early in the New Deal to protect account holders by dividing commercial from investment banking (Bill Clinton signed an end to it in 1999 paving the way for the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2008). But most of Hawley's enthusiasts and boosters such as Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance could probably care less about the details of his work.

To be sure Hawley's book may seem radical. But for all his supposed concern about the erosion of ""the power and standing of the working class"" and America's ""widening class division"" he doesn't even give a nod to the possibility of taxing the billionaires (presumably soon to be trillionaires) out of existence empowering labor to organize and fight back against the corporate bosses and turning the Big Tech behemoths into truly public enterprises.

That said in The Tyranny of Big Tech Hawley has definitely thrown down the gauntlet to Big Tech and in fact to his fellow Republican presidential aspirants as well. Perhaps even more critically and broadly speaking in hijacking America's radical-democratic story as he has Hawley also has thrown down the gauntlet to politicians activists and intellectuals of the left.

World Emoji Day 2021: What do the emojis we use on social media actually mean?

These days emojis are a part of everyday life. Almost no conversation is complete without at least a few emoticons being exchanged. They are the simplest way to express your feelings without having to use words.

Every year on July 17 World Emoji Day is observed. Emojis can be seen on everything from WhatsApp to Instagram Twitter to Facebook. In reality the market is brimming with emoji-themed products such as cushions blankets coffee mugs t-shirts and more. Many new emojis have been created over the years and are widely used.

These little yellow graphic cartoons on the other hand are also misinterpreted. We frequently make assumptions about the meanings of these emojis and use them in ways that aren't intended. Let's take a look at some of the emoticons used on social media platforms and examine their actual meanings on World Emoji Day 2021.

Hearts on a smiling face

This emoji depicts a spectrum of pleasant and affectionate feelings with its yellow face smiling eyes rosy cheeks and numerous hearts floating around its face. ""In love"" it says.

Face of Desperation

While this yellow face appears to be on the edge of tears it instead represents begging. It's also known as 'puppy dog' eyes. The emoji could also be used to express admiration or being moved by a love act.

Black-Horned Dancing Twins

This sign is used by a group of girls to express their excitement. This emoji's true meaning on the other hand is quite different. Moreover the black horns are bunny ears! Bunny Girls are frequently used in cosplay because they represent sex appeal in Japanese culture.

A man arrested Saturday afternoon by Redondo Beach Police on charges of attempted murder arson and possession of improvised explosive devices was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison for possession of eight pipe bombs.

Redondo Beach Police arrested Robert Colt Wilson Saturday afternoon following an investigation early Saturday morning into a residential fire in the 200 block of Torrance Boulevard.

Wilson was arrested on similar charges in May 2013 following a traffic stop in Marina Del Rey. Los Angeles police found a pipe bomb a loaded gun and drugs in his car. During a subsequent search of his West Los Angeles apartment police found 17 more pipe bombs leading the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Bomb Squad Unit to order the neighborhood evacuated according to a May 17 2013 LA Weekly story by reporter Dennis Romero.

In an Oct. 9 2013 follow-up article the Los Angeles Times reported Wilson pled no contest to illegal possession of explosives and a gun. “Police described him as a ‘lone wolf’ who was intrigued by explosives but said he had no connection with terrorist acts or groups” the Times reported.

Wilson’s arrest on Saturday followed a fire he allegedly started at the home of an acquaintance in the 200 block of Torrance Boulevard in Redondo Beach.

Police and fire were called to the residence shortly after midnight Saturday morning.

“I heard large explosions. It sounded like fireworks. But then I saw so many police cars flying down the street” neighbor Sheri Carrier told CBS reporter Hemara Aregali.

Occupants of the residence were safely evacuated and the fire was quickly extinguished. Neighboring residences were not damaged. But while investigating the cause of the fire Redondo police discovered “improvised explosives” and called the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Bomb Squad Unit for assistance in defusing them according to Redondo Police Sergeant Mark Valdivia.

Investigation of the fire also prompted police to obtain search warrants for storage units at a nearby public storage facility on Francesca Avenue and for an apartment building in Rolling Hills Estates. Police have not disclosed the results of those searches.

During the searches police cordoned off Catalina Avenue between Herondo and Gertruda avenues until early Saturday afternoon. The cordoned off area included the Redondo Beach main post office on Catalina Avenue and the public storage facility on Francesca Avenue.

The Redondo Beach Fire Department responded to the scene and were able to extinguish the fire.

""...large explosions but it sounded like fireworks to me"" Sheri Carrier a Redondo resident said. ""I thought it was fireworks but then there were so many police cars flying down the street.""

Due to what authorities referred to as ""circumstances surrounding the ignition source"" police called in a sheriff's Bomb Squad Unit while several streets were cordoned off ""to ensure that there is no further danger to the public.""

Investigators pinpointed two other locations a Public Storage facility where officials appeared to be removing items and then to an apartment complex in Rolling Hills Estates where LA County Sheriff's officials including some in armored vehicles were on the scene.

""So I'm looking around and there's a policemen here policemen there tactical gear about 15 police officers and then at least...counted at least 12 police cars"" Rolling Hills Estates resident Kathi Cupery said.

He said the standing Holiday Market will be the anchor of the project.







Altogether he said the various businesses will be renamed the Holiday Marketplace.

KRCR asked Holiday Market shoppers what they were most looking forward to and if they believe the new marketplace will be beneficial to the area.

""Oh definitely yeah yes absolutely cause we love Starbucks too"" shopper Nedalyn Bennett said. ""So we don't have to go to two different places if we need to go grocery shopping and we can go get Starbucks.""

Miller said they hope for the project to be completed by sometime next summer.

There Is Some Confusion,"Samsung has long been selling two variants of its smartphones one powered by its homegrown Exynos chips and the other powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipset. Devices powered by the Snapdragon chip are generally considered to be better. However when it comes to the Galaxy S10’s dual-GPS support there seems to be some confusion.

What’s the confusion?

No Galaxy S10 models currently show support for dual-frequency GPS. However many believe both the Exynos- and Snapdragon-powered Galaxy S10 models do have the capability to support it. The confusion is that if the devices are capable of dual-GPS support then why is Samsung holding the feature back. Moreover some have found the feature to be up and running in one region where Samsung sells its devices.

Before we move further it would be better to understand what dual-GPS is and why it is important.

Difference between single and dual frequency GPS

As PiunikaWeb explains GPS (Global Positioning System) is not the only satellite-based radio navigation system currently in existence. In fact GPS is only the U.S. version of the technology. Similarly Russia has GLONASS (Global’naya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema) while the European Union has Galileo. There are also other less-popular satellite-based radio navigation systems such as China’s BeiDou and India’s NAVIC. Together all of them are called Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).

With Android 7.0 Nougat Google started supporting multiple-frequency GNSS. Use of multiple-frequency GNSS enhances positional accuracy while single-frequency GNSS can often give an inaccurate result of your location.

In the case of dual-frequency GNSS the device is assisted by an additional radio signal from each satellite unlike single-frequency GNSS which uses only one signal. A single-frequency GNSS smartphone gets a signal by the name of L1 for the GPS satellite and E1 for the EU’s Galileo.

However a dual-frequency GNSS smartphone receives one more signal — L5 for GPS and E5a for Galileo. It means a dual-frequency GNSS smartphone will receive both L1 and L5 signals from the GPS satellite.

In case of single-frequency GNSS the signals from the satellite are susceptible to multi-path errors such as signals bouncing off a building. Such an issue is pretty common in congested areas resulting in inaccurate readings. As signals bounce off structures they produce echo signals that could mislead any devices that are picking them up.

In addition to the satellite signal the quality of the antenna in the smartphone is also crucial for accurate results. However the antenna is secondary to the satellite signal.

To overcome multi-path errors use of a dual frequency GNSS is gaining in importance. It has been observed that the second signal is less prone to multi-path errors and brings the margin of error down from 5 meters in the case of single-frequency GNSS to just 30 centimeters.

What’s happening with the Galaxy S10’s dual-GPS support?

Broadcom introduced a receiver for dual-frequency GNSS (labeled as BCM47755) in September 2017 but the first smartphone featuring this receiver the Xiaomi Mi 8 didn’t land on the market until late last year. The Mi 8 does support dual-frequency GPS.

Samsung is often among the first to support new technologies but it seems to have blocked dual-frequency GPS on the Galaxy S9 series. Interestingly Samsung uses GPS chips from Broadcom in the Exynos-powered models.

Several users believe the Exynos-powered Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S9 use a variant of Broadcom’s dual-frequency GNSS chip. Specifically both models feature the BCM47752 chip. There is no information on if this BCM47752 chip which is very close to the BCM47755 chip supports dual-frequency GPS or not.

The Snapdragon-powered variant on the other hand uses Qualcomm’s integrated GNSS receiver which is itself capable of receiving dual-frequency GPS signals according to PiunikaWeb. The specs of the Snapdragon 855 which powers U.S. variants of the S10 list “Satellite Systems Support: GPS GLONASS Beidou Galileo QZSS SBAS Dual frequency GNSS.”

Although there is no confirmation from Samsung Broadcom or Qualcomm about the Galaxy S10’s dual-GPS support so far only the unlocked Snapdragon models in Hong Kong are reported to be getting dual-frequency GNSS signals.

“I can unfortunately confirm no L5 signals on a US AT&T Galaxy S10+ SM-G975U. Holding out hope that a software update enables it in the near future!” one user said in a post on Medium.

Google also maintains a list of devices that support dual-frequency GNSS and that list also doesn’t feature the Galaxy S10 line-up.

As of now there is no clear reason why the Galaxy S10’s dual-GPS support is enabled only for the Hong Kong variants. Samsung could probably enable the feature on all Snapdragon-powered Galaxy S10 via a software update but it hasn’t. This is what is intriguing developers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L1JlYWxtZS1HVC01Ry1TbWFydHBob25lLVJldmlldy1TdHJvbmctYWx0ZXJuYXRpdmUtdG8tdGhlLVBvY28tRjMuNTUxMzIxLjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Realme GT 5G Smartphone Review - Strong alternative to the Poco F3,"The realme GT 5G is an exciting budget flagship smartphone.

TCL is ramping up its 2021 smartphone range with the TCL 20 range. This review covers the TCL 20 L+ 4G (Lite+) and the 5G that apart from the processor camera set-up and battery size share the same parentage.

First let me assure you that the TCL 20 L+ 4G and the 5G are high-quality phones. Neither is class-leading but you can’t make a mistake with either. There is a little too much marketing hype on the website (but that is a universal problem) and in both cases they are not exploiting the full capabilities of the excellent Qualcomm System-on-Chip (SoC) under the bonnet.

We are reviewing both models together and will show the different results from over 70 tests. Their ratings and explanation in detail are at the end of the review or just click here to skip all the technical stuff. Hint: 5G for $100 more – it wins hands down but not without caveats.

Update: TCL 20 Pro 5G here now

During the review period TCL launched the TCL 20 Pro 5G website here. It has an AMOLED screen Qualcomm SC750 5G quad-camera (OIS and 4K video) and later specifications. But the cost is $799 so it has some pretty stiff competition in that segment. We hope to review it soon.

TCL – the little engine that is trying

TCL is probably better known for its TVs. It had a relatively late entry to the Australian smartphone market – the TCL 20 series is Gen 2 under its brand. It also owns the long-standing Alcatel brand that recently launched the entry-level 2021 1-series. You mainly find these as <$200 pre-paid phones at Big W and Bing Lee. Aussies embraced Alcatel once a proud NRL Rabbitohs sponsor. TCL wants to occupy both spots.

TCL’s smartphone global market share less than the double digits of Samsung BBK (OPPO realme vivo etc.) and Xiaomi and single digits of Nokia and Motorola. However we expect to see it grow as more products enter the market.

2020 TCL 10 Gen 1

We reviewed the 2020 TCL 10 Pro last year and while it was a reasonable phone the custom TCL Launcher lack of the RCM C-Tick (still an issue on the TCL 20 5G) no Australian website (at that time) and too many UI (user interface) quirks meant a pass mark. We were also concerned that the price was not competitive with other better-known offerings from OPPO vivo realme Samsung Motorola Nokia etc.

It is nice to see the TCL 20 series has addressed most of those issues. The generational difference is tangible. The TCL UI V 3.0.1.AFD (Android 11 on the L+) is smoother and better than the TCL V2.0.1.A.2.P (Android 10 on the 5G) and streets ahead of the V1.0 on last year’s TCL 10. But there is still room for improvement in comparison to the mature OPPO ColourOS or Samsung One UI.

First impression – glass slabs with painted backs

The ostensible twins have a conventional flat slab design with a centre o-hole selfie and coloured plastic frame and back. Essentially the same size at 166.2 x 76.9 x 9.1 mm the L+ is 199g and the 5G is 7g heavier. There is an integrated Goodix fingerprint sensor in the power button. But that is where the twin analogy ends.

Now a lecture. The consumer sees the TCL 20 model name and has a reasonable expectation that they share similar characteristics. A quick call to Officeworks confirmed that they thought both were essentially the same. “The decision is 4G or 5G for an extra $100”. That may be the sales truth however we do the technical truth. It was clear during testing that apart from the external look these are two very different phones.

Screen – Big difference #1

Both have a 6.67” 2400×1080 20:9 339ppi 60Hz 8-bit 16.7 million colour IPS display. While they are ostensibly the same at 1500:1 contrast the L+ has a 500nit/SDR peak screen compared to the 5G at 450nit/HDR. Tests show typical nits at 350 and 333 respectively.

The 5G looks brighter and more colourful due to better colour accuracy and a warmer white temperature. The image below uses identical settings – the L+ screen has a distinct cool blue cast and not as bright. However TCL has a NXTVISION setting and you can adjust image enhancement (contrast) and video/game (HDR).

TCL 20 L+ (L) and TCL 5G (R)

The L+ claims a 92% NTSC colour gamut which ‘theoretically’ should be well over 100% sRGB. NTSC is a really outmoded measurement – nearly all other phones quote % sRGB or % DCI-P3. Our tests show about 84% of sRGB (low) with a Delta E of 8 (<4 is accurate). While the website claims HDR enhancement it does not appear to have this.

The 5G also claims 82% NTSC and adds a Delta E claim of <1.0. Our tests show the 5G has 89% sRGB (average) and Delta E of 2.5 (<4 is excellent). That is not quite the wide colour gamut that it suggests but again it is fit for purpose. It will play Netflix 1080p HDR10/+ content downscaled to what the screen can handle and should look quite good.

There is a Day Light readability switch – which will make the screen brighter so it can be seen in a sunny environment. However we found that it makes little difference as all IPS-type screens have struggle in direct sunlight.

TCL 20 L+

TCL 20 5G

Screen summary: Fine for the price bracket but the 5G model has a better screen.

Processor – Big difference #2

The L+ has a Qualcomm SD662 11nm and the 5G has a Qualcomm SD690 5G 8nm. The SD662 is an early-2020 release with the typical Big:Little – 4×2.0GHz and 4×1.8 GHz cores. Its Gen 3 AI reflects the tech of that time – Wi-Fi 5 AC 1×1 stream X11 Modem and Adreno 610 GPU. Many competitors offer the latter SD670 or SD675. But no matter – it is fit for purpose. Its closest chip competitor is a MediaTek Helio P65.

The 5G has a Qualcomm 690 5G chipset released mid-2020. It has a new more energy-efficient design – 2×2.0GHz and 6×1.7 GHz its Gen 5 AI is vastly superior and it supports Wi-Fi AX 2×2 stream (not implemented on this phone) X55 Modem Adreno 619L GPU and QC 4.0 charging. It is more competitive with current lower-cost 5G offerings.

L+ Geekbench 5 single/multi-core scores are 293/1250 which is average.

5G Geekbench 5 single/multi-core scores are 610/1853 roughly equivalent to a 2018 SD845.

GPU – not for gamers

Neither the Adreno 610 nor 619L GPU are for intensive mobile gaming (scores respectively) but can handle occasional gaming alongside other tasks.

Open CL 376/972

Vulcan ?/933 (the L+ was unable to complete the Vulcan test)

CPU throttle 15-minute test

L+ 147021 GIPs max average 125849 97° and 28% throttling.

5G 182804 GIPs max average 175857 93° and 11% throttling.

The L+ reached 97° CPU temp after 8 minutes after which it dropped nearly 50% speeds. This is not a heavy-duty device. The 5G fared better but its not for continuous load either. These are both within what you can expect for the price.



TCL 20 L+ (L) and TCL 20 5G (R)

Ram and Storage

Both have 6GB of LPDSDR4X and that is about average for this price bracket.

L+ has 256GB (220GB free) UFS 2.1 (slower data rate but expected) and can support up to 1TB microSD.

5G has 128GB (101GB free) UFS 2.1 and supports up to 256GB microSD (less capacity than expected).

Androbench test – sequential read/write MBps

L+ 515/204

5G 963/211

Speeds although on the slower side are acceptable given that it exceeds the maximum write of 1080p@60fps video. The USB-C 2.0 interface is 2.0 means a maximum of 480Mbps/60MBps half-duplex OTG external backup to a maximum of 1TB.

Comms

L+ Wi-Fi dual-band 1×1 with -41dBm (lower is better – most recent phones are -<-33dBm) and 433Mbps (higher is better)

5G: Wi-Fi AC dual-band 1×1 streams. -39dBM and 433Mbps maximum at 2m from Netgear Nighthawk RAX200 AC1100 router

Both have NFC PayWave

L+ has a single band GPS accurate to 12.4m. 5G has a dual-band accurate to 4m.

BT 5.1

Sensors include combo accelerometer/gyro e-Compass ambient light proximity

The 5G SD690 SoC has far greater capability than has been implemented.

4G/5G – We test using a Boost Mobile SIM on the retail Telstra network.

Both have a Dual hybrid sim (both active but only one in use at a time or one sim and one microSD) and VoLTE (Voice over 4G) depends on the carrier. Read more here.

L+

4G bands 1 3 5 7 8 20 28 38 40 41 – fine for Australia – not a world phone

Signal strength -102dBM (lower is better) and 63fW (higher is better)

DL/UL 25.3/3.7/45ms – average

The signal strength is acceptable for the city/suburbs. Not finding adjacent towers means you may experience call issues in 4G 1-2-bar or 3G only locations.

5G

4G bands same as L+

4G Signal strength -103dBM (lower is better) and 50.1fW (higher is better) Next tower -106dBm and 39.6fW

DL/UL 36.6/8.6/43ms – good

5G n1 3 5 28 41 78

The 5G can find an adjacent tower but it is still a city/suburbs phone. To suit regional or rural use you need to have a signal strength over 100fW.

It is timely to mention that Australian Telcos are repurposing low bands (3G and some 4G) to 5G and to receive these; you will need at least n5 n28 n40 and n78. We can’t verify that anything more than n78 is currently enabled.

Battery

L+ has a 5000mAh battery and comes with a 5V/2A/10W charger. TCL’s website claims it supports 9V/2A/18W (QC 3.0) but we could not get it to charge at that even using the TCL 5G charger (3.0) or several other PD chargers.

Charge 0-100% using supplied charger 2hours 20 minutes.

TCL 20 5G has fast 9V/2A charge

And it is exhausted at 100% load in 3.5 hours

Battery summary: Neither gives class-leading battery life but again they are fit for purpose. I expect you will need to charge both daily. But using a USB-C PD charger on the 5G should reduce charge time a little.

Sound – average

L+

The L+ has dual speakers – a top/forward earpiece and bottom-firing and two Awinic AW882XX 5W/1%THD amps (also used in the Moto 9 series). Our tests show a distinct volume bias towards the bottom speaker (mismatch) shifting the sound stage that way and skewing the left/right separation.

We tested the TCL 20L+ Super Bluetooth which provides you a “…seamless connection across four devices.” Apart from the fact that we count not get it to work the ‘four devices ‘has a disclaimer which says that it: “Supports two devices when connected to a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network.” We are unclear what Wi-Fi has to do with BT however perhaps a simultaneous Wi-Fi connection limits its use.

The L+ provides the system default SBC codec – it does not support the full range of Qualcomm codecs. The music via the 3.5mm jack (analogue) and BT earphones fares a little better – 16-bit 44.1kHz music (CD quality) with adequate volume and good L/R separation.

5G

The 5G uses the standard Qualcomm Aqstic amplifier with similar speakers to the L+. The 5G supports a broader range of Qualcomm codecs – SBC AAC aptX aptX HD aptX Adaptive LDAC and TWS audio at up to 32-bit/96kHz sample rates (Hi-Res via headphones only). If you want good music the 5G is the one to go for.

Volume

Neither are loud scoring below the competition.

dB at 300mm distance L+ 5G Ring tone 67.3 65.2 Notifications 67.9 70 Media (music) 71.4 74.4 Alarm 66.7 71.7 Hands-free volume (adequate) 55 57 Decibels

How do they sound?

We tried various tracks from R&B Vocals and Synth – you can try these tracks and read more about Sound signatures here. While both have a similar sound signature the 5G sounds slightly more balanced.

L+

No low-mid-high bass at all and reasonably flat 300Hz to 6kHz. There is almost no treble from 6KHz and a volume mismatch between the top and bottom speaker. It is called Bright Vocal and it is acceptable for a hands-free speakerphone but the music is harsh and dull.

The divergence between the gold and white lines represents the mismatch

5G

No low-mid-high bass but then builds to solid mid and treble. There is almost no treble from 6kHhz but less of a volume mismatch between the top and bottom speaker. It is called Bright Vocal and it is acceptable for a hands-free speakerphone but the music is harsh and dull.

Much better speaker match except past 6kHz

Build

Front glass (scratch resistance not specified) with a pre-fitted screen protector

Rear – painted Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) also known as acrylic glass

Frame: panted PMMA

No IP rating (not expected)

The L+ has Milky Way Grey (a nice textured fingerprint resistant non-slip finish) and North Star Blue (ditto). The 5G has Placid Blue and Mist Grey with a glossy finish – an amazing fingerprint magnet.

Android – something old and something new

L+ has Android 11 TCL UI V3 security patch 1 March 2021 security updates to April 2024

5G has Android 10 TCL UI V2 security patch 5 March 2021 security updates to November 2023

It is a shame that the 5G does not ship with Android 11 and TCL UI 3 – it would have made quite a difference as there are still quite a few rough edges on V2. We understand that Android 11 is coming. But other brands now offer at least two if not three OS upgrades and longer security patch updates.

Other software includes Google app alternatives (mostly removable) plus Facebook Bookings.com and TCL+ – all removable. Netflix is not un-installable.

Cameras – Chalk and cheese

Again we have two entirely different camera setups. The L+ uses the 64MP (binned to 12MP). The wide-angle is user-selectable from the preview screen – it does not match the primary lens for colour or AI. The Macro and Depth sensors help there but most 2021 cameras realise that four lenses are just about bragging rights.

The 5G is technically a lower specified camera yet it produces better images courtesy of the Qualcomm AI Gen 5 (versus Gen 3 on the L+) and uses the 8MP as a depth/macro camera. If you want an ultrawide shot it shoots 48MP crops it and processes it using the same AI to get over the L+ colour variations and detail issues.

L+ – quad

Primary 64MP binned to 16MP .8μm (binned to 1.6) AF 6P F/1.79 FOV 79.4° (68.7°) 8X digital zoom OmniVision OV6B40. Can shoot at 64MP without AI. Video maximum 1080p@30fps with EIS (Claims 60fps – no). No night mode (despite the website advertising Super Night Mode 2.0)

Features: 2x zoom face detection Google Lens in-recording snapshots Light Trace Mode low-light video Panorama Mode Portrait Mode Pro Mode Scene Detection 2.0 Slow-Mo Video Mode Stop-Motion Video Mode Super Macro Mode Wide-Angle Mode.

The website claims Super Night Mode (no) and 4K video (No). This and many other claims reflect a lack of attention to detail in copying TEXT AND IMAGES from other TCL 20 model pages.

5G – tri

Main 48MP binned to 12MP .8μm (binned to 1.6) PDAF 6p f/1.79 FOV 79° (61.5°) 10X digital zoon Samsung S5KGMN1. Can shoot at 48MP without AI. Video maximum 4K@30fps with EIS (Claims 60fps). Super Night mode.

Front 8MP FF 4p f/2.0 1.120 μm FOV 78° (72.8°) OmniVision OV8856 screen fill light

(Note are the sensors are on the 5G review unit – some may have a 48MP Sony IMX582 and 8MP Samsung S5K4H7). It is a far better set-up than the L+.

Features: 10X digital zoom Google Lens EIS HDR in-recording snapshots LED flash Light Trace Mode Panorama Mode photo filters Panorama Mode Portrait Mode Pro Mode real-time bokeh scene detection Slo-Mo Mode Super Macro Mode Stop Motion Mode Super Night Mode Super Steady Mode Wide-Angle Mode.

The images below are TCL 20+ (L) and TCL 20 5G (R)



1X – 5G has better detail and natural colour



2X – 5G the AI has over compensated on colours – otherwise a good shot



Ultra-wide – the L+ looks quite muted – the 5G has better detail but over-saturated colours



The 5G macro is far superior – it uses an 8MP sensor

Slight pinkish cast

More natural

Pinkish cast

More natural Bokeh

TCL 20 L+ <40 lumens. Struggling for detail and colours. Despite advertising a Night mode – it does not have one.

TCL 5G – good <40 lumen photo but lacks details (L). Slide to see Night Mode 2 in action – its very bright but introduces a lot of noise

Gadget Guy’s take

They are both TCL 20-series look the same and should have more than a familial resemblance. But these are not twins. As I said initially there is nothing fundamentally wrong with either – they get to the pass mark.

The competition

The TCL 20 L+ at $399 competes with an awful lot of phones including some well under its price. Vivo Y20s (128GB $249); Samsung Galaxy A12 (128GB $299); Nokia 5.4 (128GB $299); Motorola G30 (128GB $299); vivo X50 Lite (128GB $329); Samsung A23S (128GB $349); OPPO A74 (128GB $369); and vivo Y70s (128GB $399). Throw in the OPPO A74 5G (128GB $449) and realme 7 5G (128GB $449). The TCL’s main advantage is its 256GB storage but is outclassed in many other areas.

The TCL 20 5G at $499 competes against other 5G phones including OPPO A74 5G (review $449 9.8/10) realme 7 5G (review $449 9.7/10) and the runout OPPO Reno 4Z 5G (128GB $499 review 8.9/10). Having reviewed all of these the TCL is strong but not the class leader so it comes down to personal preference.

Rating explanation

Both phones reach the pass mark of 8/10 in part that reflects TCLs late entry to the market. It is paddling in the same pool as major players who have had a lot longer time to ‘get it right’.

It does not help that retails sales are only via Officeworks or Harvey Norman (retail). To complete it needs to outclass or offer more than all comers. Had TCL done so we would have shouted that to the heavens – as it is they are both solid performers.

TCL 20 L+ has 256GB (more than its competitors) NFC adequate camera decent warranty and Android 11 so it earns extra points. Its comparatively slow 10W charge loses points.

TCL 20 5G has a better camera processor colour screen and fast charge to earn more points. But shipping with Android 10 in 2021 and no RCM C-Tick mark detracts from its overall score. Overall we rate these as 8.1 each. Yes TCL 20 5G is worth the extra $100 because it is better all around.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbGlmZS1zdHlsZS9zY2llbmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvMTQ2MzYzNS9SZWFsbWUtR1QtcmV2aWV3LVF1YWxjb21tLVNuYXBkcmFnb24tODg4LUFuZHJvaWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Realme GT review: Premium Android specs on budget what's the catch?,"Realme GT review

With so many Android devices filling stores shelves it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. However that's exactly what brand Realme has managed to do with the launch of its new GT smartphone. How has Realme managed this feat? Well the Shenzhen-based firm has stuffed some serious specs into their latest Android handset at a price that's genuinely hard to believe. At time of writing you can pop one of these smartphones into your online shopping basket for as little as £332 making this one serious bargain.

So is the Realme GT worth considering or has the Chinese firm cut some corners to hit that ludicrously good price tag? Express.co.uk has been putting this phone to the test and here's our full review. There's no denying that the Realme GT is incredible value for money. For less than half the price of a Samsung Galaxy S21 you'll be treated to a device that includes the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor – the fastest chipset you'll find inside any Android smartphone right now. While it's true that Qualcomm is launching its new 888+ chip soon no devices are currently using that slightly upgraded chip so the budget Realme GT can still gloat about packing one of the best processors available. Most handsets with the flagship Snapdragon series cost in excess of £700 and it's incredible that Realme has managed to squeeze the 888 into a smartphone that's so ludicrously cheap.

The Snapdragon 888 is packed inside this phone

Realme GT review

READ MORE Virgin Media and BT eclipsed by hyperfast broadband at a low price And it's not only that pricey processor that makes the smartphone feel fast and insanely underpriced. The Realme GT also includes a 6.43-inch Super AMOLED display which is not only sharp and bright but also silky smooth thanks to its fabulous 120Hz refresh rate. Not even the £999 iPhone 12 Pro can top that as Apple is still shipping phones with a measly 60Hz refresh rate. You'll also find a reliable fingerprint scanner tucked under that slick display which can unlock the device in a flash. Hiding the fingerprint scanner under the glass screen means Realme can push the screen to the very edge of the case meaning there are minimal bezels. Elsewhere there's a 4500mAh battery which just about lasts a day but users can refill it to 100% in around 30 minutes thanks to the nifty 65W SuperDart charging. Realme includes the fast charger you need while other brands including Apple don't even include any mains charger.

The Realme GT can be charged in around 30 minutes

Realme GT can take advantage of the latest and greatest 5G data speeds enabling downloads to be blasted onto the device at speeds in excess of 300Mbps. That's almost five times faster than the average home broadband speeds across the UK right now. Flip over the Realme GT there's a triple rear camera system that features lens technology from Sony. This set-up includes a 64MP main lens along with an 8MP Ultra-Wide camera and Macro option for close up shots. Overall the photography experience is pretty good with pictures looking bright and full detail. There's also a bunch of fun effects filters and all the usual settings such as manual mode and AI Scene Enhancement. Videos can be shot in 4K quality and image stabilisation keeps your home movies looking shake and wobble-free. It's a solid camera but it's by no means the best and it can struggle at times especially when the lights get low. In fact during our tests we found the Night Mode is pretty much useless especially when compared to more expensive rivals which can make gloomy night shots look as bright as day without the flash blinding everyone in the photo.

The camera is one area where the Realme GT's bargain price tag starts to show as it's definitely not one of its strongest points. And it's not the only niggle we have with this phone. From head-to-toe the overall case design does pretty plasticky and unless you opt for the bright yellow model it all looks pretty bland too. Realme also bundles way too much bloatware on the GT which means you'll have to spend quite a lot of time deleting the endless selection of pointless apps pre-loaded on your new phone during the set-up process. While the high refresh-rate screen might be stunning to look at it's marred by a weird auto-brightness setting that has a weird habit of being way too dim. Not only that but there's no wireless charging which isn't a surprise considering the price which some may find annoying. If none of that bothers you then you're going to be seriously impressed with your new purchase ...although buying the GT is a bit of an odd experience. Right now the only place to grab one right now is from a site called AliExpress which is an online retail service based in China. It's been around since 2009 and is clearly an official store but it's simply not as easy as popping one in your Amazon basket which is where most other Realme phones.

Ralph Lauren has built a personal air-conditioning system into a roomy white jacket to be worn by the yet-unannounced athletes who will have that honor during opening ceremonies for the Olympics and Paralympics the company said Wednesday.

The technology disperses heat from the wearer's skin through a fan device at the back of the neck with a lightweight personal battery controller stashed inside. It's akin to how large computers are kept cool.

""The more we can think about our personal space and personal thermal dynamics that's the future that we're all going to have to think about"" said David Lauren Ralph Lauren's son vice chairman of the company's board and chief branding and innovation officer.

The rest of the team will walk in tailored navy blazers made of U.S.-grown wool a red Olympic patch on one breast and the company's Polo Pony emblem on the other.

They'll wear a horizontal blue-and-white-striped T-shirt dyed in a process that uses less water chemicals and energy slim blue denim pants and a flag-print scarf.

Recycled plastic in belts

The athletes' striped belts are made of recycled plastic water bottles. A patch on the back of the pants is a nod to leather alternatives this one made of plant-based materials and agricultural byproducts free of synthetic plastics.

And Ralph Lauren didn't forget the masks. They'll be solid navy in cotton with a tiny American flag on one side.

The company went for crisp white looks with red and blue accents for closing ceremony uniforms to be worn by more than 600 Olympic athletes along with the Paralympians.

Team USA organizers wanted the athletes to ""feel red white and blue"" at the world's coming-out party Lauren told the AP ahead of the formal unveiling.

The sentiment comes amid growing concern over the spread of COVID-19 just days before the Games open July 23. The Paralympics are to begin August 24.

""They wanted products that were completely sustainable completely future-oriented and completely about innovation"" Lauren said via Zoom.

The parade uniforms were made in the United States. Ralph Lauren has been outfitting Team USA since 2008.

At a downtown Polo Ralph Lauren store in New York City Olympians Daryl Homer and Peter Westbrook recently showed off the Tokyo looks for the AP stressing comfort and recalling the thrill of their past marches with the American teams during the Parade of Nations.

Homer a silver-medal-winning sabre fencer will be making his third Olympic appearance in Tokyo. In 1984 Westbrook was the first African American to win a medal (bronze) in the sport and served as flag bearer. He now trains Olympic fencing hopefuls.

Westbrook recalled his Olympic walk as an overwhelming feeling of unity and pride.

""And then the creme de la creme you have to fight one another. With love"" he said. ""It's the most beautiful thing one can experience.""

'Very comfortable'

Homer called the uniforms ""very comfortable very breathable"" though the much-discussed beret each American athlete received for the London Opening Ceremony in 2012 was one of his favorite Olympic pieces.

""I think this is my second favorite"" he smiled.

It was at the London Games where Ralph Lauren took some heat for decking out the U.S. athletes in uniforms made in China.

Team attire — but not the cooling element in the flag bearer jacket — is available at select Ralph Lauren stores and department stores and online at RalphLauren.com and TeamUSAShop.com.

Homer tried on the flag bearer jacket and loves the concept.

""If you can cool yourself why cool a room? I think that's a really cool thing"" he said.

The five-year stretch rather than the usual four between Olympics has been challenging for Homer along with the pared-down fanfare and pandemic protocols planned for Tokyo he said.

""Everyone's really anxious to get out there to compete"" he said. ""One of the positives is the next Games in Paris is three years in 2024. But right now I just want to be present where I am.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians admits his job is to remind the 2021 team that they have not “done crap.”

“We know what it takes to come to work every day” Arians explained in an interview with the Bucs’ official website. “I think our players know the level of competition at practice every day. I don’t think I’m going to have to say much about it except we’re not anywhere near where we were last year. Just knocking ’em down a peg and making sure this team doesn’t think they’re last year’s team because last year’s team won the Super Bowl. This team hasn’t done crap.”

Arians had a similar message heading into the offseason and the Bucs coach has not changed course with training camp around the corner. With the exception of the team’s Wild Card win over Washington the Buccaneers were underdogs in every playoff game including the Super Bowl at Raymond James Stadium. The Bucs enter the upcoming season just behind the Chiefs in the Super Bowl odds at +650 per USA Today.

Arians on Keeping the Bucs Core: ‘The Guys Wanted to Stay But They’re Not Going to Stay for Free’

Arians went on to praise Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht and the front office staff for their ability to keep the team’s core group together. The Bucs coach emphasized the money had to be right for the players to stay in Tampa even if their preference was to return.

“The guys wanted to stay but they’re not going to stay for free” Arians explained. “You know they all got paid. They did an unbelievable job of meeting everybody’s needs. They wanted to stay but they weren’t going to take a hometown discount either. Yeah it was great watching them [front office] work and do their thing.”

Brady Is Optimistic That He Can Be Even Better in His Second Season with the Bucs

Tom Brady appears to be excited to be entering this season fully healthy. Brady revealed this offseason that he dealt with a knee injury throughout 2020. Even before the Super Bowl Brady was talking about performing better in 2021.

“As long as I’m playing I want to improve and get better and I think next year is going to be a lot better than this year” Brady explained in February. “I feel like I’ll be in a much better place mentally. I’m going to train a lot better. Physically next year I’ll be in a better place. I know as soon as this game [Super Bowl] ends we’re on to next season. So we’ll get ready for this season and then start thinking about next year.”

If anyone knows how to avoid a championship letdown it is Brady. This will mark the seventh time Brady has entered an NFL season as a defending champion. All indications are Arians will be even tougher on Brady and company in 2021 as the team looks to keep its foot on the gas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vbmZsLW5ld3MtYXJlLXRhbXBhLWJheS1idWNjYW5lZXJzLXRvbS1icmFkeS1hbmQtcGV5dG9uLW1hbm5pbmctZnJpZW5kcy1hLWxvb2stYXQtdGhlaXItY2xvc2UtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLWRlbnZlci1icm9uY29zLWluZGlhbmFwb2xpcy1jb2x0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Tom Brady and Peyton Manning friends? A Look at Their Close Relationship - EssentiallySports,"There are a handful of quarterbacks who deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as 7-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady. The California-born quarterback led Bruce Arians-coached Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the Super Bowl LV title earlier this year. The veteran QB turned back the clock with some eye-catching displays throughout the 2020 NFL season.

This was his first Super Bowl win just a year after parting ways with Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. During his time in Massachusetts Brady had some memorable moments. But one that stood out was his fiercely competitive rivalry with former Denver Broncos and Indianapolis Colts QB Peyton Manning.

The Tom Brady–Peyton Manning rivalry existed between a span of 15 years between 2001-2015. Brady featured for New England while Manning played for Denver Broncos and Indianapolis Colts winning Super Bowl titles with both teams. 1998 first-overall NFL Draft pick Peyton Manning still holds the record for single-season passing yards (5477) and single-season passing touchdowns (55) which he set while playing for the Broncos in 2013.

Tom Brady and Peyton Manning – Two of the greatest QBs to ever do it

Here’s what Peyton Manning said about Brady’s ongoing stint with the Buccaneers.

“I don’t have any special insight. He’s done a great job adjusting. It’s been a challenging offseason with the pandemic. He has found a way to get on the same page with his receivers. They’ve improved throughout the season.”

“It’s something I can relate to. It wasn’t all smooth in my first year and it wasn’t all smooth for Tampa. But they had a good team in place. It took a while to form their chemistry and he deserves all the credit for his hard work and adaptability and his leadership. His stamp is all over that team” Manning told 9News.

Despite their on-field battles Brady and Manning share a cordial camaraderie off the football field. The two veteran quarterbacks most recently featured in Capital’s The Match 2020 along with Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. The golf tournament for charity saw Brady and Manning go up against each other but this time for a noble cause.

Catch the highlights and hilarious banter between both these stalwarts in the video below. They might not just be the greatest quarterbacks to play in the NFL but also the funniest.

It might be because I'm 32 and my formative years ran concurrently with Mike Jones' rise to prominence (""WHO?"") but I still remember a lot of what made him great. I also remember the phone number: 281-330-8004. If you don't know what I'm talking about don't worry about it.

In high school I was always looking for a dime; that was top of the line. What I'm trying to say is I like a lot of kids in Lubbock rocked with Mike Jones.

Now when this TikTok video popped up in my twitter feed I was unprepared for what was going to happen next. For what it's worth the video is NSFW.

In a video where the interviewer is asking people how to get out of the hood when a gentleman who didn't grow up in the hood stumbles by. ""I don’t know I didn't grow up there"" the man says before some bystanders tell him to visit the hood. ""I'm down"" he responds. ""Like I like Mike Jones f***ing I’ll get down.”

The man who's rocking a Texas Tech polo then proceeds to rap Jones’ second verse from the 2000s hit ""Still Tippin"" featuring Slim Thug and Paul Wall.

Word. For. Word.

Mike Jones saw the Red Raiders fan murder the verse and wanted to find the man.

""Can somebody find the dude that spit my verse & have em DM me gotta show em love on LIVE or something cuz that was 💯 & came out of no where!” he wrote in the caption. “Let’s me kno and hopefully let y’all kno that real music can’t & wont die!”

Of course Mike Jones isn't the only rapper ever caught in a Red Raider uniform. Probably the most famous is rapper Ali who rocked a Kliff Kingsbury jersey in the 2002 video for one of the most popular songs of the year that dropped in November of Kingsbury's senior season Nelly's ""Air Force Ones.""

Der8auer a popular YouTuber and overclocker made a visit to Caseking (a german PC hardware retailer) who has an interesting program called ‘Kill my case’. This program is basically what Pimp my Ride was except for PCs. The company decided to acquire a PC that was in a flat that burned down. This PC was then was inspected by Der8auer who has extensive knowledge of electronics including their modifications.

MSI RTX 2070 SUPER GAMING from a house fire Source: Der8auer

Before he got to the GPU he quickly discovered that the processor (AMD Ryzen 7 2700X) has survived. The processor was well protected by a large AIO pump so the fire did not directly affect the CPU. Things weren’t so lucky for other components the memory power supply and motherboards were clearly destroyed. In fact one of the fans has completely melted.

Surprisingly though the graphics card still appeared to be in one piece without much physical damage to the plastic shroud. Graphics cards were designed for higher temperatures after all so Der8auer decided to check if the graphics card was able to survive the fire.

The graphics card needed to be taken apart and comprehensively cleaned. This took some time but eventually the graphics card appeared to be ready for testing.

After checking the card with a multimeter and plugging in the DisplayPort cable to one connector that still looked good der8auer put a liquid nitrogen pot on the GPU and tried to verify if the graphics card will run. As it turns out it did and you can see the result below.

This graphics card was MSI RTX 2070 SUPER from the GAMING series which is a large triple-slot and triple-fan design. There was little hope for the cooler but the internals which were sandwiched by multiple support and heat-dissipating brackets have survived. This endeavor just proves how well new PC components are designed for extreme temperatures. Der8auer joked that no one should complain about high GPU temperatures after seeing this video.

This allows the case to open a gap in this area which is supposed to draw in more fresh air. Is this useful and what are the drawbacks?

4 Reviews

Cooling powerful hardware in thin laptops like the Zephyrus S17 continues to be problematic. The Asus ROG gaming device that we just reviewed is running an Intel Core i9-11900H and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 laptop GPU both high-end components that require a lot of fresh air to reduce waste heat.

Some desktop gaming PCs tend to open up their tower cases in order to give their systems more fresh air and Asus seems to have had a similar idea for laptops. On the ROG Zephyrus S17 the keyboard is lifted up from the rest of the case creating a gap into the interior and allowing fresh air to be drawn in more easily. Does this work?

Yes and no. The S17's big advantage over most 17-inch competitors is actually its quiet operation - apart from some irritating noise - even when it's under strain. The high-end gaming device is quieter than the competition with the same graphics performance.

But it's still far from cooler as a result. On the contrary it gets a bit warmer but by no means to a critical degree. At the same time a question that is difficult to answer in the test remains: Is the potential access for dust and dirt a negative factor for longevity?

There might be a positive effect behind the exotic design since it makes the Asus laptop run more quietly. Details regarding the unusual design and all other advantages and disadvantages of the very good gaming laptop can be found in our in-depth review.

For a complete review of the game check out Chris's opinion; here though we'll focus on the PC performance boost enabled by NVIDIA DLSS for all gamers that use a GeForce RTX GPU.

According to NVIDIA frame rates improve by up to 65% when playing at 4K resolution. From the RTX 3070 GPU upward all graphics cards allow for more than 60FPS with maxed settings.

NVIDIA also shared a brief video gameplay comparison of F1 2021 with NVIDIA DLSS enabled and disabled. For some reason though the implementation of NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling technology in this game leaves a lot to be desired; to begin with it's not possible to select different DLSS presets from the options and the official benchmark linked above suggests F1 2021 has DLSS locked at Performance Mode with an output resolution of 4K. Furthermore while in other games the difference between DLSS Performance Mode at 4K and native was almost indistinguishable the same can't be said for F1 2021.

F1 2021 also supports ray tracing technology on next-gen consoles (PlayStation 5 Xbox Series S|X) and PC as the developers had revealed in a recent interview with Wccftech. Specifically the game uses raytraced reflections and shadows to further improve its visuals in cut scenes replays Photo Mode and within the front end

For Codemasters the application of reflections and shadows have been particularly important with significant resources invested in higher-quality effect presets and custom-made techniques. Now they’ve taken the next logical step and upgraded to ray tracing adding real-time reflections and shadows. With ray tracing all surrounding detail is accurately reflected on each car and on windows water surfaces and other metallic game elements which previously lacked reflections or featured simple cube maps. Now all reflect the world around them improving fidelity and realism. And with ray-traced shadows existing shadows are enhanced with more accurate detail that naturally softens and sharpens and many more smaller game elements now cast shadows further enhancing the realism and quality of circuits cars and other game elements.

Did you get F1 2021 yet? If so are you enjoying it?

(pic: YouTube)

A reader has some very specific ideas about the follow-up to the Switch and it involves a graphics technique that seems very un-Nintendo.

Unless Nintendo pull another Wii U and flop their follow-up to the Switch I think I’ve got a really good idea for what they could do next that ticks all of Nintendo’s own boxes.

I feel pretty confident those boxes Nintendo love to tick are:

Not giving too much care for high end specs in terms of raw horsepower (too expensive). Some novelty unique aspect solely to them and Resisting costly Western norms like games as a service demand meeting supply amounts of DLC etc. (because you know I’m trying to be realistic here).

So what’s the unique novelty I hear you ask?

Hear me out here: ray-tracing.

Let me explain my thinking. Nintendo could chuck an established cheap three-year-old Tegra type system-on-a-chip like with the Switch but get Nvidia or AMD to include a top-of-the-line ray-tracing chip and maybe one of those physics sub-chips to boot for extra novelty.

Let’s be real here ray-tracing makes even old games look gorgeous.

That remake of Quake 2 shows this off the most.

You don’t need raw polygons and power (I’m led to believe) but if Nintendo could chuck in Nvidia’s next RTX chip I think every gamer would be sold.

From what I understand the ray-tracing in Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 appears to be modest in capabilities.

If Nintendo really went to town on this alone the results would be stark by comparison.

It’ll be a unique selling point solely to them on the console front and beyond that anyone who can afford a £2000+ PC.

Okay so next you might ask how would Nintendo use this to great effect?

Well recently I saw a video where some talented persons had injected that Super Mario 64 PC port with ray-tracing and had a top RTX card run it.

The results are incredible.

Metal Mario now looks how Metal Mario looked in the pre-renders you would see in magazines circa 1995.

Now ask yourself ‘How many gamers would pay to play Super Mario 64 RTX or Mario Kart 64 RTX?’

Who needs a ridiculous amount of polygons when you can just have say double what the Switch has and make it look gorgeous with ray-tracing lights and a ton of physics boxes to mess about with.

I’d rather see Mario fly with real-time cloth physics that it seems only tech demos seem to ever use.

It’ll be glorious and it’ll be relatively cheap.

Music to Nintendo’s ears.

In terms of fresh new ideas this could give their development teams a whole new world to use their talents.

Reflection based puzzles shadow Mario and actual shadow water monsters for Zelda… who knows maybe even a new F-Zero with pretty neon lights. It opens creative doors my brain can’t comprehend but that I’m sure they could go to town on.

Slightly appease disgruntled gamers and give it at least a 1080p screen.

Chuck in one of those DLSS sub-chips and you could tick the 4K output box without actually having the guts to do it natively. Add some Joy-Cons that work and it’s complete.

So there we have it. Hey presto say hello to the Nintendo Sparkle sold out everywhere Christmas 2023 for £399.99.

Super Mario 64 Ray-Trace Edition for a Nintendo-usual-remake price of £49.99.

Maybe Wii Sports 2: Sun Glare edition as a pack-in and Nintendo have done it again!

ELSA releases its new ERAZOR based on GA104 GPU.

The graphics card has officially been introduced last week but the ERAZOR RTX 3060 Ti LHR is only available starting from July 16th. This model is based on the Lite Hash Rate model which offers a reduced hash rate in Ethereum mining. What might be interesting is that ELSA never released RTX 3060 Ti model until now it’s almost as if they knew they would have to launch a new model eventually.

The ERAZOR RTX 3060 Ti is a custom model with two large 90mm fans. This card is actually based on INNO3D Twin X2 in fact it still has the same backplate with INNO3D logos although the fan stickers are clearly missing.

In terms of clocks this model is actually slightly overclocked to 1680 MHz (the same frequency as the INNO3D model). There are no changes to the TDP values though and ELSA does not provide the maximum power adjustment values. The RTX 3060 Ti is equipped with GA104-302 GPU with 4864 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR6 memory.

The packaging artwork with Project Cars 3 does not mean that the card comes with the game sadly. Instead ELSA collaborated with PC3 developers to offer special in-game challenges and car stickers.

The graphics card is now available in Japan at a price of 95300 yen (866 USD) still much higher than the RTX 3060 Ti MSRP (399 USD)."

John Cena has finally returned to WWE.

Tonight's WWE Money In the Bank pay-per-view saw Cena return after the main event which ended with WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns retaining his title over WWE Hall of Famer Edge.

The brutal main event saw Edge and Reigns go back & forth for most of the bout. Referee Charles Robinson went down at one point and new SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos tried to interfere but were attacked and chased away by the former champions The Mysterios. Edge looked to put Reigns away with the Crossface at one point until Seth Rollins hit the ring and broke the hold with a kick to the face.

Rollins made his exit with a smile on his face as the match continued. Edge turned it back around and was about to finish Reigns off when Rollins returned to the apron. Edge kicked him to the floor but Reigns took advantage of the distraction and hit Edge with a Spear for the pin to retain.

After the match Rollins hit the ring and snapped on Edge beating him up before facing off with Reigns. Rollins ranted to Reigns about how he should've been in the match not Edge but Edge then attacked and they tumbled to the floor. The Edge – Rollins brawl continued through the crowd as Rollins treated to the back. Reigns then took the mic and announced that the whole world can acknowledge him now. That's when Cena's music interrupted and out came the veteran WWE Superstar to a major reaction from fans at the Dickies Arena in Fort Worth Texas.

Cena rushed the ring as fans continued to cheer him on. He met Reigns in the middle of the ring and they faced off until Cena delivered his ""you can't see me"" taunt in Reigns' face which caused the crowd to explode once again. Heyman watched from the apron as Cena then posed in the corner while Reigns stared him down from the mat. Money In the Bank went off the air with Cena facing the crowd from the turnbuckles while Reigns watched from behind.

Cena is now expected to challenge Reigns for the title at SummerSlam on August 21 in Las Vegas while Rollins vs. Edge is also expected.

The two top feuds will continue this Friday during SmackDown on FOX as Cena makes his return to the blue brand. Friday's show will air from two locations – the Rolling Loud rap festival in Miami and the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland Ohio.

Cena has been away from WWE since losing to ""The Fiend"" Bray Wyatt in the Firefly Fun House Match at WrestleMania 36 in 2020 focusing on his acting career.

Stay tuned for more on Cena's WWE status. Below are several shots of tonight's main event and Cena's big return at the Dickies Arena in Fort Worth Texas:

Belfast doesn't get many visitors as big as Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas.

At 11 times the length of a 30m blue whale - which is the world's largest animal and as almost tall as the Statue of Liberty at it's highest point - it really is a site to behold.

Belfast Harbour group says that at 1141 feet long it is the biggest ship to arrive at Belfast Port in 35 years.

The luxury liner was captured on camera sailing into Belfast harbour around 4.45am on Saturday morning by eagle-eyed snapper James Maxwell coxswain on Belfast pilot boat 'Madigan'.

Onboard the ship has everything from dodgems and a bionic bar to cabaret shows pools diners surfing their very own Giraffe [not real] called Gigi an X-box installation at its Seaplex and you can even take a 'skydive' in its RipCord by iFly.

Those on the sailing will have plenty to keep them occupied - but what's a cruise without a visit to Belfast!

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

""Smoking Joe Biden. Cadaver Joe Biden. I never thought I would say this. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

Laturnus Obituary 2024,"Peter S. (Pete) Laturnus

December 30 1934 – May 09 2024

Peter S. Laturnus 89 of Munich ND passed away on May 09 2024 at CHI St Alexius Health Devils Lake Hospital.

Mass of Christian Burial for Pete will be held on Tuesday May 14 2024 at 10:30 a.m. at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich ND with Father Brian Moen celebrating the Mass. Burial will be at the St Boniface Catholic Cemetery. Visitation will be at the church one hour prior to the funeral Mass.

Peter Sebastian was born on December 30 1934 in Wilkin Saskatchewan Canada one of 13 children of Sylvester and Gunda (Steffan) Laturnus. He was the third youngest of the family. In 1945 the family moved to a farm near Starkweather North Dakota and later to Cando North Dakota where Pete attended Metcalf County school through the 8th grade. Several years later the family moved to a farm near Clyde North Dakota. Pete obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1960.

Pete worked with his brother-in-law Elmer Mueller for many years doing plumbing and heating work. When Elmer retired Pete started his own plumbing and heating business along with farming for many years at Calio N.D. He so loved the farm and could build and fix almost anything. He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Pete is survived by his beloved wife of 67 years Donna their children and spouses Dean (Kim) Laturnus Munich Daryl (Sandy Hendrickson) Laturnus Munich Dennis (Lori) Laturnus Grand Forks Steve (Donna) Laturnus Grand Forks and Bonnie (Alvin) Wald Bismarck along with 11 grandchildren; Deanna (Jeff) Heidi (Troy) Kayla (Brant); Amanda (Tyler); Justin (Jessica) Rebecca (Justin) Matthew (special friend Emily); Mitchel Conner Emma Dominic and 14 great grandchildren sister-in-law Helen Laturnus and many nieces and nephews.

Like many other companies Salesforce is embracing a hybrid mindset post-pandemic and will give employees the option to work remotely part time and expects to increase its number of permanently remote workers too.

That flexibility is opening up new talent pools for the company.

Last August the company said it was planning to add over 12000 new jobs over the next year and chief people officer Brent Hyder recently told The San Francisco Chronicle that Salesforce's hiring spree this year will exceed 15000 new employees (it had 60000 workers total as of the first quarter).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvZW1ja2VuZHJpY2svMjAyMS8wNy8xOC9zdXBlcmlvci1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLW9ubHktcG9zc2libGUtdGhyb3VnaC1zdXBlcmlvci1lbXBsb3llZS1leHBlcmllbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Superior Customer Experience Only Possible Through Superior Employee Experience,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2021/07/18/superior-customer-experience-only-possible-through-superior-employee-experience/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvZW1ja2VuZHJpY2svMjAyMS8wNy8xOC9zdXBlcmlvci1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLW9ubHktcG9zc2libGUtdGhyb3VnaC1zdXBlcmlvci1lbXBsb3llZS1leHBlcmllbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FsbGNsb3VkLWFjcXVpcmVzLWludGVncmVzcy10by1ib29zdC1kYXRhLWFuYWx5dGljcy1mb3ItY2xvdWQtc2VydmljZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AllCloud acquires Integress to boost data analytics for cloud services,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/business/allcloud-acquires-integress-to-boost-data-analytics-for-cloud-services/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FsbGNsb3VkLWFjcXVpcmVzLWludGVncmVzcy10by1ib29zdC1kYXRhLWFuYWx5dGljcy1mb3ItY2xvdWQtc2VydmljZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGVjaHMtdW5pY29ybi1zdGFydHVwcy1yZWFkeS1ob3QtdmF4LXN1bW1lci0yMDIxLTfSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3RlY2hzLXVuaWNvcm4tc3RhcnR1cHMtcmVhZHktaG90LXZheC1zdW1tZXItMjAyMS03P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tech's unicorns are ready for a hot vax summer,"Hello and welcome to this week's edition of the Insider Tech newsletter where we break down the biggest news in tech including:

This week: The hot unicorn summer is here

Once upon a time a startup that attained a $1 billion valuation was a rare feat – rare enough that those that achieved it were called unicorns. Today unicorns are seemingly everywhere and new ones are being created all the time.

In the second quarter of 2021 there were 136 new unicorns created. That's more than all the unicorns created in 2020. Is it the pent-up enthusiasm for re-opening? The ongoing result of low interest rates? A sign of trouble ahead? Check out the list of the 136 new unicorns and see if you can discern any pattern.

Deal Watch…

Here's a wild deal to ponder: Amazon Web Services buys Salesforce.







Impossible right? After all Amazon is currently facing the most intense antitrust scrutiny in its nearly three decades of existence. And the FTC's new chairwoman Lina Khan is an avowed Amazon skeptic (so much so that Amazon is trying to force her to sit out any proceedings involving the company).

But… If Amazon were to spin off its AWS cloud computing business the latter could potentially acquire Salesforce some analysts reckon.

Spinoffs and acquisitions are all just hypotheticals of course. Far less speculative is a stronger alliance between AWS and Salesforce building on their 2016 partnership. That's because each party provides something the other doesn't currently have in their product offerings. Together (particularly once Salesforce's acquisition of Slack closes) they can offer a more well-rounded alternative to their mutual enemy: Microsoft.

The availability of large 3D seismic surveys (i.e. greater than 10000 km2) offers unprecedented and challenging opportunities for multi-scale seismic characterization as they are likely to sample a representative amount of various tectono-stratigraphic features from different tectonic events. While manual and semi-automated structural interpretation of large seismic datasets is a very time-consuming task often leading to a simplified fault model a geology-driven machine-learning workflow can significantly improve the turnaround time and accuracy of seismic fault mapping and characterization. We successfully applied this novel workflow on a 20000 km2 seismic survey with depths up to 10 km capturing a variety of fault signatures seismic signal-to-noise ratios and frequencies (data courtesy of CGG and OMV Norge). Our approach enables the 3D fault interpretation process to be performed in a matter of hours compared to days while being geologically and mechanically realistic (Figure 1).

Generating a Fault Baseline Map with a Convolutional Neural Network

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and using data and is considered a part of artificial intelligence. ML algorithms build a model based on sample data known as ‘training data’ to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. The proposed approach combines two training strategies of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN): a ‘global’ scheme based on the generation of thousands of synthetic seismic volumes with labeled faults and a ‘local’ scheme trained using fit-for-basin high-resolution 3D fault labels generated using automated deterministic solutions. The full workflow covers data audit; prediction of a first fault framework (baseline) by applying a 3D CNN trained on synthetic data; baseline quality assessment and identification of missing structures; baseline refinement by retraining locally the 3D CNN; structural analysis of the predicted faulting pattern; and fault network classification based on relative timing of faulting.

First we collect and integrate geological knowledge to allow for the assessment of the seismic data quality in the area of interest in this case the North Sea. The North Sea rift system is characterized by a variety of faulting patterns in terms of geometry and size cutting through the thinned crust. The rift system is interpreted to have migrated northward since its initiation in the Late Permian – Early Triassic period (Phillips et al. 2019). In this study the area of interest captures three main tectonic events with a given stress regime for each one. Firstly a rifting phase one in Late Permian – Early Triassic with N–S striking faults and reactivation of Devonian shear zones. Secondly a rifting phase two in Late Jurassic – Early Cretaceous with NE–SW striking faults and lastly a Late – syn to post rifting phase with N–S striking faults.

To address the 3D multi-scale faulting patterns and to optimize the dataflow pipeline for machine learning we use a laterally equally sampled (50 × 50 meters) seismic volume with a vertical sampling of 20 meters. Then we deploy a ‘global’ 3D CNN over the full survey (Wu et al. 2019 Sarajærvi et al. 2020) to obtain a baseline map of the fault network. The training is based on a collection of 6000 synthetic seismic volumes (128 × 128 × 128 samples) with various resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios that contain labeled faults. We evaluate the baseline and validate the consistency and completeness of the predicted fault traces in 3D over the full survey focusing on fault termination connectivity and continuity. This way structures not completely detected or missing in 3D are identified to be further improved in the next steps of the workflow. Then we adopt a fit-for-basin approach aiming for a local enhancement of the fault network map. The enhancement is performed using deterministic solutions in selected sub-areas capturing the region’s main fault signatures from which and when needed 3D labeled training data are generated to retrain the 3D CNN (Figure 1).

Quality Assessment of the Global Machine Learning Baseline

The primary goal of the proposed iterative ML approach is to honor the geological context and principles while capturing the local tectonic variability with a high level of detail and in 3D. To achieve this level of accuracy and to ensure that geological rules are respected we consider key structural mapping concepts where the domain expert has a major role to steer and validate in the sub-areas. These include the type and location of the detected seismic discontinuities the seismic horizons displacement along the discontinuities the relationship between the detected discontinuities and the 3D consistency of the fault geometry.

In the sub-areas we optionally combine the baseline map with a set of advanced seismic attributes (Figure 1 option 1). For example first an amplitude-based approach with edge detection attributes can improve the continuity and connectivity of the fault network (Etchebes et al. 2019). And second the strata indicator that can highlight stratified from unstratified chaotic areas. Defining contrasts may be used to identify structural discontinuities such as low-angle fault planes (Bounaim et al. 2019). If the baseline map does not require local improvement then we proceed with option 2 (Figure 1).

Improving the Fault Map by Retraining the 3D CNN Locally

At this stage of the workflow we proceed with a structural analysis that consists of a detailed study of the seismic signature across the mapped discontinuities. From our fault sub-cubes structural properties such as fault azimuth dip angle and planarity indicator are computed in a set of property volumes (Figure 1). These properties are used to assist the geoscientist in the structural interpretation as well as to condition the input fault volume for the subsequent fault extraction. Faults are extracted as point sets at the seismic resolution (Bounaim et al. 2013; Etchebes et al. 2019). Thereafter the extracted and verified faults are transferred into triangulated meshes to obtain closed planes. These fault planes are then populated into labeled fault cubes and used as training data in the local 3D CNN (Figure 1). Subsequently we run the trained network over the full survey. Finally we validate the predicted faulting pattern by combining the refined set of structural properties with the strata indicator vector attribute map over the full survey (Figures 2 and 3).

Figure 2: Object-based structural analysis applied on the full survey.

The fault network map resulting from our workflow can be then used as an input for various applications. One of them is the paleo and present-day stress analysis which consists of combining the fault network analysis with stratigraphy sequence boundary analysis enabling the classification of faults following their relative timing (Figure 3). The latter provides an indication of the evolution of the stress regime through time. The understanding of the paleo-stress regime and the present-day maximum horizontal stress (S Hmax ) direction can help to assess the potential conductivity of faults under a particular S Hmax  as the strike azimuth of conductive faults should coincide with the direction of S Hmax .

In summary the combination of ML deterministic methods and domain knowledge applied to seismic structural interpretation increased the confidence in detecting geologically sound faulting patterns from seismic. Structural interpretation of large surveys by selecting key smaller areas of interest and ideally capturing the main regional faulting patterns is an appropriate starting point to ensure that the 3D CNN training is as representative as possible. Our approach of validating the consistency of the detected faulting patterns through analysis of automatically extracted structural properties (azimuth dip planarity depth) and selected seismic tectono-stratigraphic attributes is unique and allows the application of a time-efficient fit-for-purpose approach on a very large-scale survey.

FAYETTEVILLE — Quarterbacks can’t be hit during practice at the University of Arkansas so true freshman Lucas Coley didn’t have some rock-your-world collision that let him know he had entered the realm of SEC football during spring drills.

Coley’s welcome to the SEC moment came in a more cerebral format that signifies the challenges faced by quarterbacks running modern read-option schemes like that of Arkansas offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Kendal Briles.

“My welcome to the SEC moment was one day in meetings we’re going over plays and they were just not clicking for me” Coley said late last month. “I’m a competitor so it pissed me off.”

Lucas Coley file Class Freshman Position Quarterback Height/weight 6-2 217 pounds Age 17 (Born Sept. 19 2003) Hometown San Antonio High School Cornerstone Christian Noteworthy Rated the No. 9 dual-threat QB in the nation the No. 59 player in Texas and a 4-star prospect by ESPN. … Three-star prospect by 247Sports and Rivals. … Passed for 1100 yards 13 TDs and 1 INT in 10 games as a senior and rushed for nearly 500 yards and 11 TDs. … Amassed 3000-plus yards of total offense and 30 TDs as a junior. … Chose Arkansas over Central Florida Tennessee Virginia Tech Houston Louisville Vanderbilt Yale and others.

Instead of backing away to clear his head and attacking it fresh the next day Coley kept his nose to the grindstone.

“I stayed three hours after the meetings and just studied and studied and studied” he said. “Then I went home and studied and studied and studied for another two hours. I came back the next day and really had it all down pat.”

Coley an early enrollee from San Antonio’s Cornerstone Christian School has a welcome ear in his mother and greatest supporter Deborah and he leaned on her that long night a few months back.

“After leaving the facilities about 10 p.m. that night I called my mom and kind of vented to her” Coley said. “That was my welcome to the SEC moment. It’s a different breed. It takes a level of work day in and day out.”

Coley wants to compete for the starting quarterback job right now for the Razorbacks and to do that he’ll have to show a strong grasp of the system to challenge redshirt sophomore KJ Jefferson and redshirt freshman Malik Hornsby. Jefferson ran with the starters throughout the spring and Hornsby got most of the work with the second unit.

“I come in here every day and work like I’m the starter” Coley said. “That goal never changes. Even when I’m the starter I’ll come in here and work the same so this 2021 season I’m aiming to be the starter in Game 1.”

The 6-2 217-pound Coley followed a growing trend as one of 10 Razorback signees who enrolled in January to go through spring drills. He called the decision amazing.

“Early enrollment was like the best thing I decided to do as far as learning from the vets KJ” he said. “Coming in here and learning a whole new system and getting it down pat in six months it’s been very fun yet very challenging.

“I just learned how to work again. It’s a different level in college especially in the SEC. Everybody’s bigger faster stronger. Just catching up gaining a few pounds and just working and being consistent.”

Coley described Jefferson as an awesome teammate.

“We compete every day during workouts” he said. “We’re always running alongside each other working and lifting next to each other. In the meeting rooms doing actual work and stuff. KJ has been a good role model as far as on the football field and even off the field since I’ve been here.”

Cornerstone Coach John Bachman calls Coley a better person than a football player.

“Most people don’t know this the things he would do off the field” Bachman said. “He worked as a side job with our custodial staff. Most kids run from things like that.

“With our school naturally being a ministry there’s hundreds of things going on every weekend. Lucas would take that as an opportunity to make some money but that’s not just why he was out here. You could catch him out on the football field with the youth and continuing that leadership phase of his life.

“I know that’s coach speak but that’s really him. He’s a great football player and an even greater person. I can’t say enough good things about him.”

Coley is especially close to his special-needs nephew JJ who would come down to the sidelines during games and celebrate on the field after them.

“Not being able to see take care and help him every day I feel like that was the biggest challenge” Coley said of being away from home since January. “Then like going to my mom she’s always been like right beside me. I could just go home and vent to her about practice and stuff like that so those two things were definitely the biggest changes.”

Bachman said one of his best stories involving Coley was how he bounced back from a mistake.

“Our first game his senior year … we take on opponents and punch above our weight class a little bit and we’re at [Corpus Christi] Calallen” Bachman said. “We’ve got the ball and we’re trying to run out the clock. He makes a mistake. He throws the football and it’s an incomplete pass. He does the one thing you can’t do in that situation: He kills the clock.

“Naturally he sees me on the sideline and I’m frustrated and I’m looking at him. He just looks at me and says ‘Chill Coach I got you.’ And I laughed and I didn’t know what to say. It got me back in the moment and all I told him was ‘You better.’ And he did.”

The Warriors picked up a first down and ran the clock out in a 24-20 road win.

“That’s just who he is” Bachman said. “It’s a huge moment in the game and he knows how big it is knows he made a mistake and he immediately went about fixing it the next play and told me to calm down in the process.”

Coley said his head was spinning for just a while during his first college spring.

“I feel like I’m a quick learner and I just came in with an open mind and tried to flush away all the past knowledge of the systems I’d been in and I feel like my head maybe it was spinning to a certain extent” he said. “I feel like I was thinking a little too much on the field instead of playing with instinct. But that comes with time and confidence with the offense and everyone around me.

“We’ve got guys up here that can make plays at every position so just kind of being dependent on them instead of being very independent as I was in high school has been a very big learning experience.”

Briles a Texas native himself was Coley’s lead recruiter.

“Coach Briles is a hard-nosed coach” Coley said. “He’s going to try and drill the information in your brain as much as possible but … if you don’t learn it you just won’t play so that’s what I like about him. It kind of forces you to spend all those hours of free time and kind of dedicate it toward being a quarterback.”

Coley said the word “relentless” encapsulates his game.

“I just want to attack every game the same way” he said. “I want to attack the first game against Rice as it’s against Bama.

“You don’t want to play down to the workout just because it wasn’t hard. You never want to slouch. If there’s one word to describe me it would be relentless.”

Coley said he’d like to report to camp about 220 pounds a few pounds more than his current weight and have a productive summer.

“Really just stay consistent in the playbook stay consistent with my teammates off the field” he said. “Just kind of building that chemistry that it takes to be a successful SEC quarterback. Those are two of the main things.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay90di8xNTYxNjIzNi9yaG9uai1tZWxpc3NhLWdvcmdhLWFjY3VzZWQtYmFkLXBob3Rvc2hvcHBpbmctYmlraW5pLXNuYXAtdGVyZXNhL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay90di8xNTYxNjIzNi9yaG9uai1tZWxpc3NhLWdvcmdhLWFjY3VzZWQtYmFkLXBob3Rvc2hvcHBpbmctYmlraW5pLXNuYXAtdGVyZXNhL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RHONJ’s Melissa Gorga accused of ‘bad photoshopping’ in new bikini snap of star and sister-in-law Teresa Gi...,"'HORRIBLE' RHONJ’s Melissa Gorga accused of ‘bad photoshopping’ in new bikini snap of star and sister-in-law Teresa Giudice

REAL Housewives of New Jersey star Melissa Gorga was accused of “bad photoshopping.”

Fans rushed to the comments section of the Bravo star’s recent bikini snap with sister-in-law Teresa Giudice to slam the editing.

7 Many agreed the editing was 'not needed'

Melissa 42 shared two photos on Instagram of herself posing in a yellow bikini and jean shorts on the beach.

Meanwhile Teresa  49 wore and patterned one-piece swimsuit and black skirt coverup.

The RHONJ star captioned the post: “Sista Sista 💛 @envybymg #beachinit #rhonj.”

FANS SLAM MELISSA

While many fans took to the comments section to praise the sister-in-laws others accused Melissa of photoshopping the picture.

While referencing the wooden pole behind Melissa one person pointed out: “The wood is crooked… that’s how you tell Melissa made her waist smaller with photo editing… it was not need… she already has a great body.”

Another RHONJ fan said the editing was “so bad” with a following person writing: “It’s beyond noticeable in both photos. Wood above their heads has different placement as well.”

A following Bravo fan commented: “It is pretty bad … as tiny as she is .. her waist is visibly thicker than that … her boobs are enhanced too.. I’m kind of embarrassed for her… I have seen it in a few if her pics where objects are warped around her body.”

Alongside crying-laughing emojis one person said: “It’s a horrible photoshop one side of her waist is WAY smaller than the other side.”

Another added: “Yes MG sucked in and Tree looks like she thick waisted...double the size of MG...”

An additional person commented: “I didn't notice photo editing Melissa 's legs look thinner than Teresa's too.”

Others said Melissa has photoshopped her past Instagram posts as one fan noted: “he did it on the other pic too with the jumpsuit in front of window 🤣”

A following fan agreed by replying: “I just noticed that! The window is blurred.""

SISTA SISTA?

While the RHONJ stars appear to be getting along in the new post things haven’t always been easy for the sister-in-laws.

Melissa is married to Teresa’s brother Joe Gorga.

Both Teresa and Melissa are set to star in the Bravo spin-off Real Housewives All Stars though RHONJ star Jennifer Aydin divulged the mom-of-four would have preferred to film the new show alongside a different franchise costar.

Back in June Jennifer told the Slut Pig podcast: “The way that I saw that they casted I was under the assumption that they picked the ones that had the most longevity on the show so actually it made sense to me that it was Melissa and Teresa.”

Jennifer revealed of Teresa's hope for casting: “I mean Teresa did say ‘I wish I was going with you or Dolores [Catania].

""What am I gonna do with her [Melissa]?’

""But I was like ‘No you guys will have fun!’ And she’s like ‘It is what it is.’”

The Love Island beauty 27 shared a jaw-dropping picture with her 1.5million Instagram followers flaunting her figure in a lilac bikini with the caption 'hot girl summer is thirsty work'.

But not long after she took to her story sharing a before and after version of the original snap - stating that she had not altered how her body looks.

Setting the record straight: The former Love Island star denied claims that she edited her latest bikini snap on Sunday - assuring fans she 'meant it' when she said zero editing from now on

The notable difference in the before and after versions was the use of a filter but Shaughna also detailed another change she had made.

'Just a lil message to the people saying I've photoshopped my last picture. My body is not edited I'm pretty sure the sleuths that look for dodgy lines in the background will tell you [laughing emoji]' she explained.

She continued by admitting which part of the picture she had tweaked.

'I've deffo edited out the massive spot I've inherited on the side of my face though. I said a few weeks ago that there will be zero editing of my body from that moment on and I meant it x'.

Explaining: The notable difference in the before and after versions was the use of a filter but Shaughna also detailed another change she had made - removing a spot

The catalyst for Shaughna explaining herself could well have been a follower's comment which had suggested her use of Photoshop.

'We just saw u on live t.v. on after sun u don't need the Photoshop pics. Ur beautiful in ur own skin' they wrote.

Shaughna responded by calling it 'the best compliment ever' because the picture is '10000% not photoshopped'.

Defending herself: The catalyst for Shaughna explaining herself could well have been a user's comment which had suggested her use of Photoshop

This is not the only Photoshop accusation the star has received as last month fans began to notice a wonky building in the background of one of her pictures.

They then accused the reality star of altering her pictures unleashing Shaughna's rage.

As one follower commented: 'Photoshopppppppppppppppp' Shaughna replied 'Jesus Christ judging by your pictures you should try it'.

'Judging by your pictures you should try it!' Shaughna furiously hit out after she was accused of 'Photoshopping' pictures with wonky buildings in the background last month

Another concerned fan penned: 'I hope one day you’ll be confident enough to uploaded a true photo where you haven’t manipulated your body. You should be proud of how you actually look'.

Scott Disick has been enjoying some family time as of late.

And the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was joined by his girlfriend Amelia Hamlin 20 and his kids - Mason 11 Penelope nine and Reign five who he shares with his ex-girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian - on a holiday getaway.

Scott kept it casual in a white t-shirt and a pair of camo print shorts whilst Amelia flung her arm around her boyfriend.

She was wearing white skinny jeans which she partnered with a intricately designed crop top whilst Scott's son Mason showed his love for his favourite sports team by wearing a Lakers basketball vest.

Alongside the snap Scott wrote: ""Great night just a little smelly for Reign out on the old docks.""

Amelia's family are not so keen on the romance - or the 18 year age gap between the pair.

""The issue that’s most enduring is the age difference which to me is odd"" her dad Harry Hamlin recently said on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

However he doesn't think he can complain because there was a 14 year age gap between him and his ex Ursula Andress.

""I was 14 years younger than she when we had Dimitri. So I can’t really complain right?"" he added.

Amelia's mum Lisa Rinna is also ""nervous"" about the couple's blossoming romance.

She said: ""My daughter is linked to a guy named Scott Disick. And I was like OK come on right? Like come on. A couple days ago Amelia sends me a video of her and Scott on the beach.

""There's nothing you can do. And the more you push the bigger deal it becomes.""

Whilst their age gap might not be that popular with her parents Scott and Amelia aren't worried about it.

Khloe 37 showed off her toned tum and shapely body in the string two-piece.

Khloe - who is mom to three-year-old True her daughter with ex Tristan Thompson - captioned the post: ""Still posting my favorite neon collection 🍋.""

The mom-of-one's fans rushed to comment that the star looked ""insane"" ""beautiful"" and ""so amazing.""

Launching the items from her Good American line earlier this week Khloe has been sharing a range of raunchy snaps to her Instagram profile.

But some critics claimed she looked ""fake"" and ""completely different"" in the colorful promo shots.

'NICE PHOTOSHOP'

""Nice photoshop"" one critic wrote.

Another added: ""Her entire face is completely different than it was. Face and body totally paid for. Why would you want such a fake role model?""

A third posted: ""New face every post. LOL For all we know this could just be another girl that looks like Khloe.

""I mean I don’t think @khloekardashian even knows what she herself looks like anymore.""

'COMPLETELY DIFFERENT'

Khloe - who recently confirmed she's had a nose job - has been coming under fire for months from fans claiming she is altering her social media snaps.

The reality star admitted herself earlier this week that she ""looks a little fake"" sometimes while playing around with Snapchat filters with her model friend Alexis Warren.

And it comes days after fans claimed Khloe appeared to have six toes in a photo of her posing in a pink bandeau bikini.

Back in April an unedited bikini shot of Khloe leaked online in which she looking stunning while posing in leopard-print swimwear.

Despite receiving plenty of compliments over her figure her PR and legal teams went on a rampage to ""scrub"" the photo from the internet to no avail.

Khloe later came out to share her truth about the image pleading with fans to understand the turmoil she's experienced over the years.

Posing topless to show off her ""unretouched"" and ""unfiltered"" body she revealed she has ""struggled with body image her whole life.""

Khloe penned: “When someone takes a photo of you that isn’t flattering in bad lighting or doesn’t capture your body the way it is after working so hard to get it to this point.""

The “Building to Net-Zero” blueprint appears to be quietly gaining momentum within the Energy Department where a top official has discussed ways to put elements into action using the agency’s existing powers.

The pipeline network would be twice the size of the current U.S. oil pipeline network by volume according to the blueprint released by a recently formed group calling itself the Labor Energy Partnership. Backers say the proposed pipeline network — including CO2 “hubs” in the Gulf Coast the Ohio River Valley and Wyoming — would help reduce climate-changing pollution by transporting captured carbon dioxide to either the oil industry which would undo some of the climate benefits by using the CO2 to revive aging oilfields or to as-yet unbuilt facilities for underground storage.

The blueprint however leaves open many questions about how the carbon would be captured at the source — a process that so far has proved difficult and expensive — and where it would be sent focusing instead on suggesting policies the federal government can adopt to boost CO2 pipeline construction.

Climate advocates fear that building such a large CO2 pipeline network could backfire causing more greenhouse gas pollution by enabling aging coal-fired power plants to remain in service longer produce pipes that could wind up carrying fossil fuels if carbon capture efforts fall through and represent an expensive waste of federal funds intended to encourage a meaningful energy transition.

In March over 300 climate and environmental justice advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress arguing that subsidizing carbon capture “could entrench the fossil economy for decades to come.”

The AFL-CIO and the Energy Futures Initiative which jointly produced the blueprint did not respond to questions about concerns over their proposals.

Proponents of carbon capture usage and sequestration (CCUS) often highlight ways that it could be used for sectors like steel and cement whose carbon pollution is generally considered “hard to abate.” Yet the pipeline network envisioned by Moniz would be capable of carrying over 10 times as much carbon dioxide as the steel and cement industries emit in total nationwide according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2019. In fact it could transport more CO2 than the entire industrial sector emits in the U.S. leaving the rest of the pipeline network’s capacity available for carbon from fossil fuel-fired power plants or from “direct air capture” technologies that would remove ambient CO2 but don’t currently exist at a commercial level.

“Even the advocates of direct air capture technology acknowledge that they don’t anticipate that it would be at a scale to make any meaningful reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels until 2060 2070 and beyond” said Carroll Muffett president of the environmental law nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law. “When we’re dealing with a world where we need to cut emissions in the next decade direct air capture just has no meaningful place in that conversation.”

Instead the proposed CO2 pipeline network would be used to offer a lifeline to existing fossil fuel power plants. In Appalachia for example 90 percent of the carbon emissions the plan seeks to capture would come from existing coal-fired power plants in the Ohio River Valley. Those plants none of which are currently outfitted with the costly upgrades needed for capture carbon are already facing difficult questions about their ability to compete economically with wind and solar energy.

Nonetheless momentum behind the project appears to have been gathering behind the scenes in Washington D.C. particularly inside the Department of Energy (DOE).

“It’s a great pleasure to have our first kind of public interaction with our good friend Dave Turk” Moniz said of Biden’s Deputy Secretary of Energy at the blueprint’s online launch on July 1.

“It’s incredible the volume and quality of the thought-leadership that you all are behind” Turk who is second in command to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Moniz. “And I think the report that you all have put together is incredibly helpful to show that we need to do more from the DOE side other agencies and Congress” he added describing the blueprint as “actionable.”

Figuring the Federal Funding

A day before the blueprint launch event the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) sent a report to Congress on carbon capture and its associated infrastructure.

“CO2 pipelines are critical to the future nationwide deployment of CCUS” the CEQ wrote leaving open the question of just how large of a CO2 pipeline network the White House supports.

The report calls carbon capture “especially important for decarbonizing the industrial sector where high-temperature heat can be difficult and expensive to electrify” and carbon pollution difficult to avoid. The CEQ was less sure about the role carbon capture should play in electricity generation writing that it “may also play an important role in decarbonizing the global power sector.” It also highlights the possibility that future technologies that could draw carbon dioxide from the air might use the same kinds of underground storage infrastructure.

Building a national CO2 pipeline network to support CCUS would be extremely expensive. The pipelines themselves could cost between $170 and $230 billion to build the CEQ noted citing an estimate from Princeton’s Net-Zero America study. That’s roughly the net worth of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — or twice the $100 billion that Biden has proposed spending to upgrade the nation’s electrical power grid.

The CEQ’s memo was greeted with enthusiasm by Moniz’s Energy Futures Initiative (EFI) a co-author of the gigaton pipeline blueprint.

“I would also like to give a big shout out to the Biden administration and its CEQ for the CCUS report they released yesterday” said Melanie Kenderdine a principal of EFI. “There are many similar thrusts between that report and ours.”

Discussion at the blueprint’s launch suggested that higher-ups within DOE are focused on how exactly to move forward on CO2 pipeline construction.

“So we do have authorities right now as you certainly know from the DOE side” Deputy Secretary Turk explained at the blueprint’s launch. “Our Fossil Energy and Carbon Management office has authorities has funding we’re trying to move various programs along in that way.”

He also discussed the controversial tax credits for carbon capture known as 45Q. “And then there’s some significant money billions of funding being proposed by the President through the American Jobs Plan that Congress is deliberating right now that could be hugely hugely important on the CCUS side” he went on. “So we’ve got some tools on the table right now at the Department of Energy but we’re really hoping and it’s encouraging to see the bipartisan support for CCUS up on the Hill increasing the tools that we have and the size of those tools so that we can really get at the gigaton opportunities as you all lay out incredibly well in your actionable report.”

The Department of Energy also did not respond to questions about the blueprint or how often Deputy Secretary Turk has met with Ernest Moniz the Energy Futures Initiative or the Labor Energy Partnership this year.

An unnamed White House official told Bloomberg Law that the approach in the CEQ report remains open to modifications. “It should be interpreted as ‘Here are the areas in which the administration plans to act. Here is how they might act in those areas. That is subject to refinement and change as the agencies carried out the more detailed process that’s necessary under their statutes’” the unnamed official said.

Pipelines to Nowhere?

It’s not clear that carbon capture is remotely ready for prime time particularly on a gigaton scale. “The world has been experimenting with [carbon capture] since the early 1970s” Wood Mackenzie noted this month. “Around 68 projects started and terminated primarily because the projects are super-expensive.”

Right now all of the world’s existing CCUS projects combined have the capacity to remove just 37 million metric tons of carbon per year — a tiny sliver of the 1000 million metric tons (or one gigaton) that the EFI blueprint for a U.S. CO2 pipeline network proposes.

There’s a long list of reasons that CCUS — despite decades of public subsidies and numerous high-profile pilot projects and “demonstration” plants — has floundered commercially.

First adding carbon capture equipment to existing coal or natural gas power plants for example fundamentally adds costs — and today those fuels are already under significant cost pressure as the price of renewable energy continues to fall.

The engineering side of capturing carbon can also be very difficult particularly for some industries. When researchers who included representatives from academia and a Chevron official studied the costs of adding CCUS to U.S. industrial sites they found 656 sites which they considered “suitable” for carbon capture retrofits — roughly two out of every five sites in the country.

There’s also the question of what to do with the carbon after it’s captured. Most CCUS projects right now sell carbon to the oil industry which uses it to produce more oil from aging oil fields — not exactly a climate-friendly solution.

While backers of CCUS often focus on its role in capturing carbon not from electrical power plants but instead from industry a one gigaton pipeline network would dwarf the size of the carbon emissions produced from “hard to abate” industries in the U.S.

For example the EPA’s greenhouse gas inventory lists 41.3 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2 from iron steel and metallurgical coke production in 2019 and a nearly equal amount 40.9 MMT from cement production. That’s a huge amount of greenhouse gas — but it’s only enough to fill 8.2 percent of a one gigaton pipeline network. All told the entire U.S. industrial sector emitted 822.4 MMT of CO2 that year EPA reported — far short of the gigaton that Moniz’s organization proposes.

“What you see in that report is a demand for a colossal expansion of CO2 infrastructure” Muffett said “even while acknowledging that it’s fundamentally not economic to build it even with the massive federal subsidies that are already flowing into it.”

Fossil fuels have powerful backers in Congress including at least one senator who has suggested he might spike Biden’s climate proposals if carbon capture is not included as a way to preserve the fossil fuel industry. “I told him that I was concerned about some of the language I’d seen to move us away from fossil” Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) said he told President Joe Biden on July 14. “I said if you move our country away from fossil and there won’t be another country that will step to the plate to do the research and development that will fix the emissions that are coming.”

A senior ExxonMobil lobbyist recently named Manchin as “crucial” to the oil giant’s lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. in secretly recorded remarks made to an undercover representative of Greenpeace UK and reported by the UK’s Channel 4 News adding that the Exxon lobbyist met with Manchin’s office weekly.

Prolonging ‘Negative Attributes of Fossil Fuels’

The blueprint itself carries a long list of warnings about carbon capture’s uncertainties and flaws. “Public perceptions that contribute to negative opinions of CCUS include hesitancy about technology risks limited track record cost and investment tradeoffs compared to other emissions abatement options” the blueprint notes. “Worries about the risk of geologic CO2 leakage are also common.”

“Other concerns about CCUS include its perception as a ‘delaying tactic’ that forestalls other climate change mitigation actions such as improved energy efficiency or transition to non-fossil fuels” it adds. “There are also concerns that CCUS prolongs negative attributes of fossil fuels such as pollutants environmental disruptions and negative community impacts.”

Fossil fuel power plants with CCUS can also remain highly polluting beyond greenhouse gases — and existing plants are often located within communities of color. “Energy and industrial infrastructure is disproportionately located in or near neighborhoods of lower-income households and with larger minority group populations” the blueprint notes. “The environmental impacts of these facilities have contributed to negative health outcomes and lowered property values in the adjacent communities.”

“I’m concerned about federal funding to support pipeline and hub construction when the feasibility of CCUS remains extremely unclear” Megan Hunter a senior attorney with the environmental group Earthjustice told DeSmog.

And while carbon might be captured with CCUS technology there are many other pollutants released by fossil fuels.

“It’s also important to note that these plants petrochemical facilities and the other sites mentioned in this report emit more than just carbon dioxide; they emit harmful particulate matter hazardous Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other toxic pollutants that severely threaten the health of nearby communities” Hunter added. “The Ohio River Valley is already burdened by significant legacy pollution and experiences intense subsurface and surface activity — including underground and surface mining pipelines hydraulic fracturing injection wells and solution mining.”

“I’m also deeply concerned about the potential for federal funds to be directed towards a buildout of natural gas and petrochemical infrastructure under the guise that this infrastructure will one day be repurposed for CO2 or hydrogen” Hunter added.

For example utility Southern Company sank $7.5 billion into attempting to build a coal-fired power plant that would capture carbon in Kemper County Mississippi before abandoning those efforts amid cost overruns and increasingly evident design flaws.

The pipeline that Southern originally built to carry captured CO2 won’t be torn down however as the company had previously contemplated. Instead it will be converted from a CO2 pipeline into a natural gas pipeline Southern reported in its annual SEC filing for 2020 and used to fuel a gas-fired power plant.

Before he joined the Obama administration Moniz pushed natural gas as a solution to climate change arguing in 2010 that the fossil fuel “truly is a bridge to a low-carbon future.” The following year Cornell professors Robert Howarth Renee Santoro and Anthony Ingraffea published their landmark paper showing that natural gas-fired electricity may be twice as climate-altering as coal-fired electricity — or worse depending on just how much climate-warming methane escapes from the nation’s gas infrastructure.

During his time at DOE Moniz continued to push natural gas as a way to curb the country’s CO2 emissions despite growing evidence that the fossil fuel’s methane leaks are very damaging to the climate. In 2020 methane levels in the atmosphere reached a record high prompting urgent warnings from the United Nations.

Prior to the 2020 election Moniz’s name was rumored to be among those that Joe Biden considered for Energy Secretary — but under pressure from green groups Biden ultimately passed him over opting instead for Granholm a former Michigan governor.

In November 2020 Little Sis a Public Accountability Initiative project highlighted the number of Moniz’s associates that played a role in Biden’s transition team including Turk who had served under Moniz in the Obama administration. “All this raises concerns about Moniz’s influence over the policy direction and staffing decisions within Biden’s DOE and suggests that — even if Biden rejects Moniz himself — Moniz’s network could play a critical role in setting energy policy in the Biden administration” Little Sis wrote.

“Moniz also launched two projects — the for-profit consulting firm EJM Associates and the non-profit think tank Energy Futures Initiative — intended to shape the policy debate around energy issues” it added. “The Energy Futures Initiative is advised by a board chaired by former BP CEO Lord John Brown Madingley and includes former CIA director and Cheniere Energy board member John Deutch and J. Todd Mitchell whose family fortune comes from the fracking company Devon Energy.”

Erratic Track Record

Previous attempts to use carbon capture have largely run aground amid technical and financial issues.

“The costs of carbon capture have decreased by 35% between a first-of-a-kind power plant with carbon capture and the second facility using the same technology” the White House CEQ wrote in the memo’s executive summary citing a report that details the costs of Saskatchewan’s Boundary Dam project in 2014 and Texas’s Petra Nova plant in 2017 — with no mention of Southern Company’s failed attempt at carbon capture in Mississippi.

Also not mentioned: NRG’s Petra Nova project doesn’t actively capture carbon despite its $1 billion price tag. “Petra Nova has been mothballed since May 2020 because it is uneconomic” POWER Magazine a trade publication reported in late June. “Even before the plant was mothballed NRG had taken three impairment charges totaling $310 million against the project.”

“What they’re ignoring in this report are the massive risks that are entailed in dramatically expanding pipeline infrastructure.” Carroll Muffett President Center for International Environmental Law

Even before the full effects of the pandemic unfolded in the U.S. the DOE itself warned that carbon capture projects aren’t financially competitive. “Additionally as is the case for the [Petra Nova] Project the economics of large-scale carbon capture facilities are challenging” DOE wrote in a March 31 2020 final scientific and technical report on Petra Nova.

That makes the Boundary Dam project in Canada the world’s only operating coal carbon capture project. The project made headlines in March when it announced it reached its 4 millionth metric ton of CO2 captured a lifetime total equal to what one coal-fired power plant emits in one year EPA estimates. The company was originally slated to reach this milestone by October 2018. “The carbon capture facility at Boundary Dam was designed to capture 3200 metric tons of CO2 daily or slightly more than 1 million metric tons annually” the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote in April. “It has barely achieved that goal on any single day and has never done so over any extended period.”

“From a purely economic perspective [carbon capture and sequestration] does not make sense” the Center for International Environmental Law wrote in a recent report. “The simpler surer and cheaper solution is to end this and similar subsidies for the fossil fuel economy and invest the savings in accelerating the transition to clean energy.”

“What they’re ignoring in this report are the massive risks that are entailed in dramatically expanding pipeline infrastructure” Muffett told DeSmog describing both the physical risks borne by people living near CO2 pipelines and the financial risks of investing in carbon capture rather than renewable energy. “These are communities that have dealt with the impacts of environmental injustice and environmental racism for decades and that’s laid the foundations that leads to them being targeted for the build-out of these pipelines.”

“At its heart the conversation about CCUS has never been about addressing the climate crisis or about reducing CO2 emissions” Muffett added. “At its heart the thing that has always driven this conversation is how do we deal with the problem of stranded assets what can we do to go on burning coal natural gas and oil into the indefinite future?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vcmFpbGZhbi5jb20vbWVyZ2VyLW1hbmlhLXByZWRpY3RpbmctdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merger Mania: Predicting the Future,"Looking back at the proposed 1983 merger between Southern Pacific and Santa Fe executives had no idea that the Interstate Commerce Commission (predecessor to the U.S. Surface Transportation Board) would respond with a big fat “no” to their application. Given more recent drama over a possible merger of Kansas City Southern with either Canadian Pacific or Canadian National one thing remains clear — almost four decades after SPSF we’re still not good at predicting the future.

Naturally I took this as a challenge. What might we see in the next 50 or so years? I talked with the greatest minds in railroading and then came up with some predictions of my own.

2022: Having lost its bid for KCS a desperate Canadian Pacific merges with Genesee & Wyoming. It clears the regulatory hurdles at the Surface Transportation Board when lawyers argue that the entire CP system will be converted into nine separately managed regional railroads so it’s “not really a Class I.”

2023: Amtrak reintroduces hot meals on its trains. Flavors include “Chicken Egg Noodles and Vegetables in Sauce” and “Vegetable Crumbles with Pasta in Taco-Style Sauce.” For extra convenience meals are pre-packed in weatherproof bags and are easily made hot thanks to the included heater element. Cost savings abound since Amtrak and the U.S. Army both use the same supplier for Meals Ready to Eat™.

2024: BNSF declares its entire locomotive fleet will consist of heritage units. Every locomotive will wear a one-off historically inspired paint scheme. While this may cause some marketing confusion it also cuts down on legal bills as any time there is an accident nobody knows what railroad to sue.

2026: In a bid to lower operating costs Norfolk Southern institutes one-horse crews on all trains.

What's trending this morning:

Dubbing themselves ""digital nomads"" expats are moving to some of the world's most remote places where they can live and work in paradise. But many don't stick around long enough to reckon with the long-term effects of their lifestyle:

Many places desperate to revive their COVID-ravaged economies have gone to extraordinary lengths to welcome the nomads. Countries from Barbados and Aruba to Estonia and Georgia are offering special work visas that permit foreigners to stay for as long as six months often with an option to renew. Tulum according to Lonely Planet is the ""hotspot for digital nomads.""

But as more and more foreigners settle in for a year-round Burning Man Tulum is starting to look more like the next Fyre Fest. The troubles already plaguing the town – shoddy electricity a crappy sewer system polluted waters – are exacerbated by the flocks of Bluetoothed boobies.

Unlike the hordes of tourists who come and go for a few days nomads create a permanent strain on local infrastructure. They enjoy all the benefits of life in the tropics but they don't pay taxes.

Under the private-equity firm 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz was supposed to be a powerhouse in the food world – but so far it hasn't gone as planned:

Current and former employees said 3G-approved executives and a maniacal focus on cutting costs have hobbled the two historic brands. Many are leaving and fear for the company's future especially as a sales boost from eating at home fades post-pandemic.

While other food companies such as General Mills and Kellogg risk a similar slowdown as society opens up Kraft Heinz is in a more dire place analysts said.

Insiders said that 3G's cost-cutting has left the company unable to introduce new products such as plant-based meat. They also said the deep cuts have caused morale to plummet and turnover to soar.

Here's what else employees said about the merger:

Amazon



The goal is to deliver packages to customers' doorsteps using fully electric drones. The problem is that Amazon's Prime Air team is seeing internal conflict high turnover and launch delays that threaten the project's success:

The tensions came to a head at an all-hands meeting in March where Prime Air's leadership answered questions that employees submitted and voted on. Questions zeroed in on these contentious issues including those between longtime employees and new hires who the former accuse of moving too slowly. They also brought up the division's high turnover rate which was 20% in 2020.

The question that received the most upvotes pointed to a cultural clash between the new executives and existing company structure according to a transcript of the meeting obtained by Insider.

""One peer remarked that in the last year all four of the individuals in his leadership chain have been replaced by Boeing expats"" the inquiry said referring to the multiple executives who joined Amazon from Boeing in the past year. ""What are we doing to preserve Amazon's unique culture and principles within Prime Air while building out our org with established industry leaders?""

""With evolution and more women going into the investment field those numbers have begun to change. But the whys of how we got here I think everyone knows it.

""Are we prepared to change it? I think it depends on who you talk to. I view this issue as turning a 757 aircraft in slow-course fashion versus just hooking a right in a Dodge minivan. It's a tremendously large industry. It's not going to make huge strides in a year or two or three. But we should make meaningful change.""

KINSHASA July 18 (Xinhua) -- In Kolwezi in southern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) beyond counting are drilling rigs and dump trucks coming back and forth on mine after mine.

But on the outskirt of this world-class mining hub one particular mine stands out from the others with greenery sprawling its mining dumps where a lot of dust are always supposed to be in the air.

After years of green mining practice Chinese mining company Zijin Mining the owner of this green mine has won praise from the local community by constantly reducing the footprint on the environment caused by mining activities.

Zijin Mining owns and operates here the 4th largest copper company in the DRC a country that harbors vast reserves of copper gold and many other valuable minerals.

As the mining deposits keep cashing in the Chinese company has always put sustainability a priority with its green mining practice that brings real benefits to the local community.

In 2018 the company started afforestation and revegetation work on its waste dump. However the efforts went in vain at the initial stage as less than 10 percent of the first batch of green plants survived due to the poor soil condition.

""Because of the soft soil and the rainy season during construction transport trucks often sank in the mud. We had to rely on shovels or manual force leading to slow and painstaking progress at work"" Lin Weifa who was in charge of the greening operation recalled.

After repeated tries the company finally managed to armor the waste dump and slopes of the tailings dam with nearly 400000 square meters of vegetation cover winning praises from local residents close to the mine.

""The gree works in recent years have effectively improved air quality and successfully protected surrounding residents from many infectious diseases. This is what I have never seen in other companies around Kolwezi"" local resident Biladi Cooper said.

The vegetation cover also turns the mine into a paradise for migratory birds. During the rainy season in 2019 about 50 African little egrets arrived out of blue to the mining area. Every rainy season ever since it becomes a hot ticket for wilds birds of various kinds.

However going green in mines is also about realizing ecological transition that makes mining activates as much sustainable as possible. In late 2018 the company launched a program to treat waste gas from its smelter making the gas much less polluting. It also built solar lighting systems and used more clean energy in recent years.

According to Albert Yuma President of the DRC's state-owned mining company Gecamines the partnership with the Chinese company is ""a model for Sino-Congolese joint ventures"" for its efficiency demonstrated throughout the construction and operation process.

""Zijin Mining is a company that embodies a high sense of duty and responsibility and it has indeed carried out mining for the benefit of the Congolese people through its practices"" said Dany Banza ambassador-at-large of the President of the DRC.

By this spring air travel had bounced much of the way back: TSA screeners were checking more than 1.5 million people a day in April 2021 with the trend line pointing sharply upward.

That lift hints at a bright future for flying in the U.S. and beyond. Here's a closer look at what's in store.

Enjoying New Planes

Delta Air Lines JetBlue and Southwest Airlines are all flying two new aircraft types the Airbus A220 and Boeing 737 Max; United Airlines has the Max too. (The Boeing jets are flying again after a nearly two-year safety review by the FAA.) Both models are more fuel-efficient than older jets making it economically feasible for carriers to open up new routes that would otherwise go unserved. The onboard experience has also improved: these planes have larger overhead bins and better entertainment systems and they deliver smoother rides.

Flying for Fun

New jets aren't the only thing prompting airlines to take another look at route networks. Because we're taking fewer business trips American Airlines has added flights to vacation destinations like Orlando from cities including Birmingham Alabama; Dayton Ohio; and Indianapolis. American has also increased service to Jackson Hole Wyoming and Kalispell Montana — both gateways to national parks.

United meanwhile launched 26 new domestic routes linking many Midwestern cities including Milwaukee and Columbus Ohio to coastal escapes such as Hilton Head South Carolina and Portland Maine. JetBlue announced expanded service from its Boston and New York hubs to locations including Puerto Vallarta Mexico; San Antonio Texas; and in 2022 Vancouver.

Going Farther

Qatar Airways was one international airline that actually broadened its footprint in the U.S. during the pandemic adding new flights between Doha and both Seattle and San Francisco. The airline also forged a partnership with Alaska Airlines: customers can now make a seamless single booking that starts with an Alaska flight and connects to an international trip operated by Qatar.

JetBlue has announced its first-ever transatlantic flights with service to London Heathrow from both Boston and New York. The airline will have 24 brand-new Mint business-class suites aboard the Airbus A321LR jets on that route. (Seats in the first row known as Mint Studios give passengers even more space.)

Two carriers are betting on an uptick in ""diaspora travel"" where people in the U.S. travel specifically because of family or ancestral connections. Last fall United launched nonstops from Washington D.C. to both Accra Ghana and Lagos Nigeria. American will link Miami and Paramaribo Suriname this summer and its flights between Seattle and Bangalore India are slated to start in the second half of 2021.

Taking on the Competition

The pandemic saw the end of some struggling low-cost carriers including Norwegian and Wow Air but newcomers are ready to take on the biggies. Avelo Airlines debuted in April with flights from Burbank California to various cities in the western U.S. ""Honestly there could not be a better time for us to launch"" says Andrew Levy the airline's founder chairman and CEO.

He promises that Avelo's flights to smaller airports within major markets will be cheaper than those offered by legacy carriers. Breeze Airways from JetBlue founder David Neeleman is also coming soon with a similar bang-for-your-buck model.

New low-cost airlines are taking off in Europe too. Italy-based Ego Airways launched in March with flights serving 11 cities including Bari Catania and Florence. And this summer the Norwegian upstart Flyr plans to expand from its home country with flights to Spain and France.

The head of a key congressional committee overseeing the aviation industry is pushing six US airlines to explain worker shortages flight cancellations and delays after the government supplied billions in federal aid to the airline industry amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Sen. Maria Cantwell a Democrat from Washington and chair of the Senate Commerce Committee wrote Friday to the CEOs of American Delta JetBlue Southwest Republic and Allegiant airlines asking them about reports of pilot flight attendant and worker shortages and to account for the use of the $54 billion in federal relief to keep workers employed that was contingent on no layoffs.

Cantwell wrote that she is “concerned that at best” the airlines “poorly managed its marketing of flights and workforce as more people are traveling and at worst it failed to meet the intent of tax payer funding and prepare for the surge in travel that we are now witnessing.”

The senator also requested a staff briefing from each of the airlines by the end of the month.

The airline industry was hit hard during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year as travel restrictions were enforced and Americans were encouraged to stay home to slow the spread of the virus. Airlines significantly cut their flight schedules due to the drop in travel demand essentially at zero.

At the industry’s request Congress created the Payroll Support Program to provide loans to airlines to support the pay and benefits of workers. The three rounds of billions in federal payroll support for the airline industry barred layoffs involuntary furloughs or pay cuts for employees.

Airlines however furloughed employees during lapses in the federal aid. To further cut costs airlines offered voluntary buyout and early retirement packages and requested that workers take voluntary unpaid or low-paid leaves. The airline industry still ended the year with huge record losses.

Now with majority of Americans vaccinated and the country reopening leisure flights and bookings are returning to pre-pandemic levels and airlines have begun calling back workers who had been on voluntary leave.

American announced in late June that would trim 1% of flights from its schedule through mid-July citing bad weather and staffing shortages.

Southwest last month canceled or delayed thousands of flights – the most of any US airline – saying that its schedules and staffing have also been thrown off by the growing demand and weather.

“This reported workforce shortage runs counter to the objective and spirit of the (Payroll Support Program) which was to enable airlines to endure the pandemic and keep employees on payroll so that the industry was positioned to capture a rebound in demand” Cantwell wrote in her letters. She added that the “disruptions in air travel have harmed U.S. consumers just as the American economy is rebounding and the existing airline workforce is being placed under immense pressure to meet demand.”

CNN has reached out to the airlines for comment on the letters.

In a statement to CNN Southwest said it is “staffed for what we’re flying and we’re flying for what we staffed.”

Southwest was able to avoid involuntary layoffs and furloughs that other airlines imposed last year after some of its employees took unpaid voluntary leave buyouts and early retirement packages. As bookings and travel ramp up Southwest in April recalled all flight attendants and some pilots who were on voluntary leaves to return to work this summer.

“We’re fortunate to be the only major airline to maintain service at every U.S. airport we served prior to the pandemic and to have utilized Congressional Payroll Support to maintain staffing (continuing a 50-year history of no layoffs no furloughs) to support both that continual service and the flight schedule we built for the summer of 2021” the company said.

The company reiterated that last month’s “unusually high number” of flight delays and cancellations was due to “prolonged and widespread thunderstorms infrastructure challenges and unrelated challenges with technology.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi8yMDIxLzA3LzE4L2FpcnBsYW5lLWZpZ2h0LWJlaGF2aW9yLWZhYS1hcnJlc3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unruly airplane passengers are straining the system for keeping peace in the sky,"After consuming several beers and a couple of shots before takeoff a miner started urinating near his seat on an Alaska Airlines flight an FBI special agent recounted.

What brands does Black Rifle Coffee have a business relationship with?

Black Rifle Coffee Company sells its products in Bass Pro Shops

BRCC has sponsored episodes of the ""Slightly Offensive"" podcast hosted by Elijah Schaffer an employee of the right-wing media publication The Blaze.

BRCC came under fire from some members of the far-right following an episode of the podcast titled ""Kyle Rittenhouse: Homicidal Maniac or American Hero?""

Rittenhouse a teenager who killed two protestors in Kenosha Wisconsin wore a Black Rifle Coffee Company T-shirt in a photo posted by ""Slightly Offensive."" The show's host also attached a discount code for BRCC merchandise to the photo of Rittenhouse.

Hafer said in a statement that BRCC does not sponsor or have a relationship with Rittenhouse but the company believes ""in the integrity of the legal justice system"" and supports law enforcement officials. Supporters of Rittenhouse have since turned on the coffee company for its position on the teen.

What are Black Rifle Coffee Company's ties to Donald Trump?

Hafer told The New York Times he voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 election but a BRCC spokesperson said the company is not affiliated with any campaign or political party.

Donald Trump Jr. endorsed Black Rifle Coffee Company in 2017 and said he met with the company's leaders.

""Great coffee great guys and great Americans"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted in November 2017. ""I've had the chance to meet and hang out with them. Try it.""

Though Hafer told The Times he disagreed with the mob who stormed the White House over Trump's baseless claims of election fraud a photo circulated depicting an insurrectionist carrying zip tie handcuffs wearing a BRCC hat.

""How do you build a cool kind of irreverent pro-Second Amendment pro-America brand in the MAGA era without doubling down on the MAGA movement and also not being called a [expletive] RINO by the MAGA guys?"" Hafer told The Times.

The video posted by barista @sarai.camp0s has been viewed 1.5 million times. Comments are turned off which suggest some hate likely leaked into the discussion. The caption says “Oh just a regular day working at Starbucks #starbucks #wequit.”

“I guess Karen’s little sister ordered today” she wrote on the overlay showing the first of a 22-drink order for a “Katie.”

Per the drink stickers the order is an Uber Eats delivery from late June from a Starbucks in Hayward California.

In the overlay she wrote that 18 of the 22 drinks are strawberry acai lemonades. They were small drinks suggesting the beverages are likely for a group of children. In that case there were probably easier less expensive ways to satisfy the kids’ collective thirsts.

“We used 3 big bags and 2 regular ones to hold all the drinks” she said.

“Katie you made us all quit” she finished.

At least they completed the order without issue versus doing what another TikToker did and eliminate options from the Starbucks app to make their shift easier to manage.

Fact-Check The Verdict False Starbucks has confirmed that it does not lend any support to Israel or the Israeli army. Claim ID f762636f

Starbucks has confirmed that it does not lend any support to Israel or the Israeli army.Human rights groups campaigners and governments have expressed mounting concern over the worst violence seen in Israel and Palestine in several years. In response to Israel's military actions which have resulted in at least 150 deaths since May 2021 pro-Palestine campaigners have called for consumers to adopt a form of direct action known as the Boycott Divest and Sanction movement (BDS). Part of BDS involves boycotting companies and institutions deemed to support Israel through investment financial support or producing goods on settlements on Palestinian land. The BDS website states that these efforts are concentrated on a small number of companies including Puma HP AXA and Sabra. There is no mention of Starbucks providing support to Israel nor do any other reputable news sources mention that Starbucks funds Israel. in 2014 Starbucks issued a statement to confirm that the company does not send any of its profits towards Israel or the IDF. This was updated in 2021 in light of false information arising again in the current crisis. Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson told CNN in 2014 that neither the company or its then chair Howard Schultz direct any funds towards Israel or the army: ""Starbucks does not support any political or religious causes and that holds true for Howard as well. There's no financial support from Howard or the company to the Israeli government for any purposes."" Olson added that Starbucks shut down their stores in Israel in 2003 but said that this was due to operational difficulties rather than political differences. Schultz stepped down from the company in 2019. Schultz is Jewish and once described himself as an ""active Zionist"". He once received an Aish Hatorah in Israel in 1998 to mark the contribution he had made to ""Jewish heritage and American society."" Schultz himself has rejected claims that he or Starbucks have donated to Israel. Recently several news outlets and social media users have incorrectly stated that Starbucks and other companies fund Israel. while others claim that all brands are directly linked to Israel in some form. This is not true. A list of organizations lending financial support to Israel is available on the BDS website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNhc2gtcmVnaXN0ZXItZ2xpdGNoLXVuY29udHJvbGxhYmxlLXN0cmVhbS1idXR0ZXItcmVjZWlwdHMtMjAyMS030gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9zdGFyYnVja3MtY2FzaC1yZWdpc3Rlci1nbGl0Y2gtdW5jb250cm9sbGFibGUtc3RyZWFtLWJ1dHRlci1yZWNlaXB0cy0yMDIxLTc_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks register glitch led to uncontrollable stream of 'butter' receipts,"A TikTok user and apparent Starbucks workers posted the clip showing the malfunction.

A cashier who appeared to work for Starbucks posted a clip of an unusual cash-register glitch.

The video shows a continuous stream of receipts flowing from the machine.

It racked up more than five million views as TikTokers sympathized with the cashiers' predicament.

A TikTok video that apparently showed a bizarre cash-register glitch at Starbucks has garnered more than 5 million views.

Initially posted on July 12 by TikTok user and apparent Starbucks employee @themondanadiaries the video has now gone viral. It shows a malfunctioning register after a customer ordered a bagel with butter.

But a glitch in the system caused a seemingly endless stream of receipts printed with the word ""butter"" to flow out of the register.

In the video @themondanadiaries and her colleagues watch in disbelief. Another video shows one of the workers turning off the machine – but the glitch just shifted to another register.

Text on the video says: ""He broke it. It won't stop printing this."" The user added in a caption that the event left her colleague ""panicking.""

TikTokers mostly found the video comical as In The Know via Yahoo News reported. Others said they could empathize with the Starbucks employees' stress.

One joked: ""I think the bagel is supposed to have butter but idk I'm not sure."" Another said they would have had a breakdown.

Starbucks did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Earlier this month Starbucks workers told Insider they're flooded with orders for TikTok-inspired ""secret-menu"" drinks.







One barista in Tennessee said he makes ""at least 15"" TikTok iced white mochas each day. But staff told Insider's Grace Dean they were feeling the strain of making so-called ""TikTok"" drinks which are inspired by viral trends. One worker said customers get ""very mad"" if their drinks are not made perfectly – making staff feel like they are ""coffee-making robots.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2plcnNleWV2ZW5pbmdwb3N0LmNvbS9tb3JlbmV3cy91a25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy8xOC9rZmMtbGVhZHMtb24tY2hpY2tlbi13ZWxmYXJlLXdoaWxlLXN1YndheS1hbmQtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWxhZy1iZWhpbmQtcmVwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KFC leads on chicken welfare while Subway and Starbucks lag behind – report,"KFC is leading UK fast food chains in the welfare of chickens raised for their meat while Subway Starbucks Domino’s and McDonald’s fall far behind according to an annual ranking by charity World Animal Protection.

The league table ranks fast food restaurants globally and locally on their commitment ambition and transparency around the welfare of chickens in their supply chain.

In the UK KFC was the only brand to achieve “leading” status with an overall score of 92% followed by Nando’s on 78% to reach a level of “good”.

Burger King and Pizza Hut were both assessed as “making progress” with scores of 70% and 67% respectively.

Starbucks and Subway ranked at the bottom of the table with 0% and a “very poor” assessment.

(World Animal Protection/PA)

Nando’s Burger King and Pizza Hut also scored high points for signing up to the BCC in the UK unlike Starbucks Subway Domino’s or McDonald’s.

The charity said most chicken meat served up by the major fast food chains still came from from birds living in cramped and barren environments with no sunlight with many suffering from lameness and skin lesions.

Intensive farming methods also often relied on routine antibiotic use as a “quick fix” to keep stressed and sick animals alive it said.

WAP global campaign head Jonty Whittleton said: “Many big brand restaurants are denying billions of birds the chance to see sunlight grow at a healthy rate or behave naturally.

“Covid-19 has taught us that the welfare of animals and human health is interlinked – there should be no business as usual. Commercial motives are driving cruelty and suffering and this needs to end.

“KFC once again has shown leadership in the UK and Europe since they signed up to the Better Chicken Commitment in 2019 which will improve the lives of millions of chickens. But it is disappointing that companies such as Starbucks Subway McDonald’s and Domino’s are refusing to change for the better.

“As more people take an active interest in the ethics of their food more companies are willing to act. Now is the time for real change to happen and companies that fail to move with the demands of the market are not only causing misery to millions of animals but are also risking their reputation.

“World Animal Protection is calling on these global companies to lead and ensure that any chickens that are being served at their restaurants are guaranteed a life worth living.”

Peter Trundley supply chain director at Domino’s Pizza Group said: “We support the aims of the BCC and many of the processes we currently have in place meet and in some cases exceed the requirements of the BCC as well as the regulations for chicken welfare in the UK and Europe.

“We are pleased to see the report acknowledges our efforts to provide environmental enrichment are in line with BCC standards. In addition all our broiler chicken is 100% cage-free and we require all suppliers to demonstrate they are continually striving to enrich the living environment for the birds including providing suitable pecking objects perches and natural daylight.”"

Performances are 7 p.m. Friday July 23 and Saturday July 24 with a 2 p.m. performance Sunday July 25.

“Little Shop of Horrors” is a horror comedy rock musical about a floral shop worker Seymour Krelbourn (played by Brady Waibel) who finds a mysterious plant that thrives on human blood. He names the plant Audrey II after his crush Audrey (Annaliese Emmons).

As the plant grows in size Seymour and the little shop grow in popularity. Unfortunately the plant’s appetite also grows and the plant begins making verbal demands for blood. Seymour is conflicted as to whether to feed the plant or risk losing his newfound fame and a chance at the heart of his dream girl Audrey.

“Little Shop of Horror” is loosely based on a low-budget film from the 1960s. The musical is a send-off of old science-fiction B-movies. It is a unique production for SST.

Producer Christina Koester said this production was planned before the COVID pandemic. The idea was to appeal to a different audience.

Koester said typically the cast of SSTC has a mixture of young and veteran performers but Little Shop of Horrors’s cast is mostly college students and older.

“This is a very mature cast” she said. “There is a lot of experience here.”

The production has attracted several actors who have not previously performed at SST.

Annaliese Emmons who plays Audrey said she was a big fan of the musical and had been waiting for a chance to audition for production near her.

Over a year ago she did a Google search of “Little Shop of Horror” productions and found the SSTC production but it was postponed a year because of COVID. Emmons waited a year for auditions to start and was able to secure the female lead.

Director Lolly Foy is also new to SSTC but she has previous experience directing “Little Shop of Horrors.” She previously directed the musical for Mankato’s Merely Players. Foy jumped at the chance to direct the musical again.

“I love the play” Foy said. “It was easy to get me to do it again which is surprising because it is a busy summer.”

Foy lives in the Twin Cities but has been housed at The Grand Center For Arts and Culture as the guest artist. Despite her busy schedule Foy said she had no regrets about taking on the task of directing.

“This is an amazing cast” she said.

Asked about her favorite part of the musica Foy said she is delighted by the show’s camp sensibilities and lampooning the mid-20th-century horror stories that took themselves so seriously.

“We can’t help but love them now” she said.

As a parody of older B-movies the play features a throwback aesthetic. The entire cast will be dressed in costumes out of the early 1960s. Costume designer Molly Smith has pulled together a lot of 60s looks. This includes a lot of stylish shoes and bow-ties. Smith said even with the ’60s setting she tried to throw in a few styles from the ’40s.

“If it is a classic style it will work” Smith said. The idea is to make the production larger than life and colorful.”

Despite some of the horror elements of the musical the show is still upbeat and fun.

The upbeat and fun attitude is especially true of the music.

Foy described the music of Little Shop of Horrors as infectious. Nearly every member of the cast and crew has a different song they cite as their favorite. Foy said “Little Shop” is probably the biggest earworm but “Suddenly Seymour” is a close second.

Several other cast and crew members said “Skid Row” was their favorite. Brady Waibel liked the last song “Finale Ultimo (Don’t Feed the Plants).”

Michael Bovée who serves as one of the puppeteers of Audrey II likes the song “Suppertime” even though it is relatively short.

Christian Hanel who voices the man-eating Audrey II couldn’t decide which song was the best.

“All the songs in this are the bop” Hanel said.

The Audrey II character is the most unique character in “Little Shop of Horrors”. Koester said the Audrey II puppet comes in three stages.

The first stage is a hand puppet. Then it is placed on a table. The last is a massive human-sized puppet. Koester explained that since the puppet needs to eat people it has to be large enough for a person to fit inside. The puppet is being rented out from a company that loans out their Audrey II to other productions.

Since the character is a giant man-eating plant no single actor can play the character. The last phase of Audrey II is a large puppet that is operated by Bovée and Elissa Ries and voiced by Hanel.

Bovée and Hanel will be working together to make sure the puppet’s mouth movements match his voice. It requires plenty of rehearsal to sync the performance with the vocals.

The Audrey II plant does require some logistical planning but director Foy said the greatest challenge with this production was finding the balance between intimacy and distance in staging it.

The COVID pandemic raised lots of questions about live theater. They want to make sure actors and audience remain healthy but remain honest. COVID restrictions have been lifted in Minnesota but after a year away it takes time to relearn how to stand together again. This is a challenge facing all musical theater.

Foy said the cast has stepped up to the plate and is giving it their absolute all.

“There is a real talent in this cast. It is a joy to listen to them sing” she said. “I wanted to them all on stage and we found a way. If nothing else this will be a treat for the ears.”

Audiences will be able to see and hear for themselves next week. Performances are 7 p.m. Friday July 23 and Saturday July 24 with a 2 p.m. performance Sunday July 25.

PETERSBURG — As Red Tide washed tons of dead fish upon Tampa Bay shores Aimee Conlee grew concerned.

Conlee had to cancel summer camp and other activities at her business Urban Kai Stand Up Paddle Board Shop and recalled how just last weekend she hosted a Yoga on the Water class in the morning near clear waters. By the afternoon dead fish had begun to invade the area.

So Conlee decided to act and reached out to Suncoast Surf Rider a nonprofit focused on beach and ocean conservation. Together with the Suncoast Sierra Club they organized a protest on Saturday at the St. Petersburg Pier calling for measures to address and prevent Red Tide.

“This is not political” Conlee told a crowd of at least 100 people who showed up to the event. “This is life. This is water and water is life.”

Protesters had several demands listed by Suncoast Surf Rider chair Thomas Paterek: declare a state of emergency for Tampa Bay; create a plan for closing Piney Point’s facilities; implement policies recommended by expert groups; stop phosphate mining in Florida; fix Florida’s infrastructure; move to clean energy; and make polluting companies pay for clean up.

The crowd marched from the pier to the Vinoy Park beach volleyball courts and back shouting “Save our Bay Make Polluters Pay.”

“Thank you” the protesters shouted to people who were cleaning up dead fish from a boat. A man on the boat netted a mass of rotting fish flesh into a trashcan on deck swarmed by flies. A stench hung in the air and worsened as protesters approached the volleyball courts.

Angela Chang 35 and her boyfriend Nick Sierra 34 of Longboat Key heard about the protest through Instagram. Sierra said he’s seen how states in the Pacific Northwest have addressed environmental disasters and feels Florida is behind in its response to Red Tide. Chang said the couple spends many of their weekends out on the water or at beaches.

“I can see fish dying everywhere which is really sad” she said. “So we are here to support.”

Red Tide is a collection of harmful algae and the algae feast upon nutrients regularly found in Tampa Bay such as nitrogen. Excess nitrogen enters the water in many ways including through fertilizer runoff and wastewater released from land.

This year scientists say the Red Tide is almost certainly finding more fuel because more than 200 million gallons of polluted water was dumped into the bay between late March and early April off the grounds of the old Piney Point fertilizer plant in Manatee County.

The state allowed the release by property owner HRK Holdings because regulators feared a large leaking reservoir was about to collapse and send a devastating flood into surrounding neighborhoods and businesses. That wastewater was dumped into the bay at Port Manatee and carried a lot of nitrogen with it.

Piney Point is owned by HRK Holdings. When a Times reporter called the cell phone number of HRK Holdings principal owner William “Mickey” F. Harley and identified herself on Saturday the man who answered hung up.

Protesters drew attention to the Piney Point release as they marched Saturday. Neighbors Kathleen Bohrnsen and Aldo Della Sera both 57 came from the Coquina Key waterfront neighborhood in St. Petersburg to show their support. Bohrnsen held a sign that said “Declare a State of EMERGENCY!!” while Della Sera held a sign that read “Prioritize the Health of Tampa Bay.”

“Red Tide is a natural occurrence” Bohrnsen said. “But not this kind of Red Tide. Not this early not this degree.”

Sergeant Vickers was a leader within the patrol and his troop and served as a Field Training Officer training and mentoring new troopers. He was a graduate of the 131st FHP Recruit Class and served central Florida and the state for just over 4 years. He was also a Navy Veteran.

The crash took place just before 6 am in September 2019 as Vickers was on his way back home after working a night patrol shift. His vehicle struck a construction truck parked along the left shoulder of the roadway. At the time of his death he was 31 years old.

“The brave men and women of the Florida Highway Patrol put themselves in harm’s way on a daily basis to keep our roadways and those who travel them safe. I was proud to sponsor legislation honoring our fallen troopers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty” said Senator Lauren Book. “With these designations our first responders will know that their sacrifice and heroism will never be forgotten by Floridians.”

Representative Chuck Brannan said “It was my privilege to sponsor this legislation so that we can permanently honor those troopers who have given their lives in defense of all we hold dear. It is my hope that the motoring public will always remember their sacrifices as they pass by these markers on our state highways”

“Paying honor to Sergeant Vickers by designating a portion of S.R. 408 in his name is a great tribute” said Colonel Gene S. Spaulding Director of the Florida Highway Patrol. “I would like to thank the Florida Legislature and Governor Ron DeSantis for ensuring the sacrifices of our fallen heroes are memorialized.”

The roadway dedication ceremony was held today at the Florida Highway Patrol Troop D Headquarters in Orlando Florida. Leaders and members from FHP Orlando Police Department Orange County Sheriff’s Office North Collier County Fire Florida House District 10 Florida Department of Transportation and the Brotherhood Ride were all present at the ceremony including Sergeant Vickers’ loved ones.

In a ceremony in San Diego Calif. the Navy christened the future USNS John Lewis (T-AO-205) the first ship in the service’s new class of oilers.

“Leaders like Representative Lewis taught us that diversity of backgrounds and experiences help contribute to the strength of our nation. There is no doubt that the future Sailors aboard this ship will be galvanized by Lewis’ legacy” Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Harker said in a Pentagon news release.

Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) died last July after serving in Congress for more than 30 years. Today’s christening ceremony took place on the anniversary of his passing the Pentagon noted.

General Dynamics-National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) builds the oilers in its San Diego yard. The ships will fall under Military Sealift Command.

“The John Lewis-class ships are based on commercial design standards and will recapitalize the current T-AO 187-class fleet replenishment oilers to provide underway replenishment of fuel to U.S. Navy ships at sea. These ships are part of the Navy’s Combat Logistics Force” the Pentagon news release reads.

House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was the ceremony’s main speaker while several Navy officials – including U.S. 10th Fleet commander Vice Adm. Ross Myers Military Sealift Command chief Rear Adm. Michael Wettlaufer and James Geurts who is currently performing the duties of the undersecretary of the Navy and previously was the service’s acquisition chief – also spoke at the event according to the Defense Department release.

NASSCO began building the oiler in September 2018 USNI News reported at the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Port Chester ...,"WHITE PLAINS NY — Patrick Onogwu 64 and Asanimo Riesa 38 both of the Bronx pleaded guilty today for their part in a more than yearlong scheme that included using fraudulently obtained credit cards to steal from several Westchester County retailers owned by TJX Companies Inc. including TJ Maxx Marshalls and Home Goods.

The conspiracy carried out from June 13 2018 through Aug. 14 2019 focused on a number of TJX Companies Inc. stores including TJ Maxx Marshalls HomeGoods and HomeSense in Yorktown Heights Yonkers New Rochelle Port Chester Hartsdale the Bronx and elsewhere.

Onogwu and Riesa and their associates stole more than $50000 opening TJX Rewards credit cards by using victims’ personal identifying information including Social Security numbers forging victims’ signatures on credit applications and presenting forged United States passport cards and driver’s licenses as identification. The defendants then used these fraudulently obtained credit card accounts to purchase merchandise and then returned some of the stolen merchandise to other TJX stores to obtain cash refunds.

“This fraud scheme was detailed and extensive” DA Mimi Rocah said. “But thanks to our law enforcement partners from the Westchester Department of Public Safety the U.S. Department of State U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the victim’s retail crime investigative team the fraud scheme was stopped.”

Onogwu and Riesa have been ordered to pay restitution to the TJX Companies and Synchrony Bank and forfeited a 2013 Mercedes-Benz SUV that was used to travel from store to store committing the fraud as well as various electronic devices used to commit the fraud and monies in bank accounts that were used in connection with the scheme.

Patrick Onogwu and Asanimo Riesa were arraigned in Westchester County Court before Judge David S. Zuckerman on November 4 2020. They were released from jail at the end of last year due to the bail reform law. Donald Ilo was never arrested and there is a warrant out for him.

In the same case defendants Hassan Miller 47 and Dawn Anderson 50 were sentenced in September 2020 to 1.5 to 4.5 years each in state prison after pleading guilty in November 2019 to Criminal Possession of a Forged Instrument in the Second Degree a class D felony.

The case was before Judge David S. Zuckerman AJSC in Westchester County Court and was prosecuted by Senior Assistant District Attorney Stefanie DeNise.

With Rich Call Data (RCD) the idea is to provide more information about a caller through Caller ID. This way even if an incoming call appears to have come from a local number or a number that looks familiar you'll know whether you should answer it or not.

T-Mobile and partners make an historic phone call to test Rich Call Data (RCD)







Yesterday T-Mobile and its partners like First Orion CTIA Everbridge iconectiv NetNumber Numeracle and Twilio completed what is believed to be the first wireless call to combine authenticated Caller ID Rich Call Data (RCD) and the FCC's STIR/SHAKEN system. RCD is designed to make phone owners feel comfortable answering an incoming call by including a brand logo and other information including a reason for the call.





The nation's second-largest carrier points out that Americans are on pace to receive a mind-blowing 52 billion robocalls this year. As a result as many as 80% of mobile calls are left unanswered as important calls from banks schools pharmacies and other places that show up as unknown numbers are not picked up.





T-Mobile states ""With RCD you will get a consumer-friendly recognizable display on the Caller ID - in most cases a brand’s logo – that indicate the call is from a trusted source. You know if it’s your bank your pharmacy or your doctor’s office calling and can decide when to pick up. When widely used RCD will empower consumers with more call information so they can make the right choices in the moment stay safe from spam and scammers and still get important calls.""





The carrier's Chief Technical Officer Abdul Saad added that ""The ability to deliver RCD to mobile devices is a key tool in the battle against scammers as it increases consumer trust in knowing who is calling them and why. This proof-of-concept shows that by working together as an industry we can make sure that legal critical and wanted calls are delivered with a high level of consumer confidence.""

80% of calls go unanswered which leads consumers to miss important phone calls







While information used for Caller ID is taken from third-party databases RCD comes directly from the company/organization that is calling. And as part of the STIR/SHAKEN system the information cannot be displayed unless properly authenticated. Companies and organizations have more control over branding and consumers will feel more confident about who will be at the other end of a phone call.





Because 100% of calls that originate on T-Mobile's network are authenticated by STIR/SHAKEN the carrier is in a good position to deliver RCS to its subscribers. Tom Sawanobori CTO of CTIA (Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association) says ""We congratulate T-Mobile on the successful proof-of-concept which relies on the industry-backed centralized registry Registered Caller. By working together to enhance caller identification the wireless ecosystem can ensure consumers get the communications they want while stopping bad actors.""





Jeff Stalnaker President and Founder of First Orion states ""Imagine a future where all phone calls will be delivered with RCD providing complete transparency and protection in every call for every consumer enhancing the way businesses connect with their customers. Working with T-Mobile and other industry leaders to deliver this first-ever mobile call with RCD and authenticated Caller ID is an important step in making Enhanced Caller Identity a reality.""

T-Mobile says that it is currently verifying 257 million calls a day to keep customers safe from getting spoofed. If the testing continues to garner positive results we'd expect RCD to give the wireless provider's customers the confidence to answer a higher percentage of phone calls.

It has completely overshadowed the regular OnePlus 7 which received only minor upgrades. The 7 Pro introduced a new bezel-less design with a pop-up selfie camera a gorgeous display with 90Hz refresh rate and other improvements. The Chinese company is now preparing to launch the OnePlus 7T Pro later this year.

OnePlus launches the ‘T’ variants of its flagship models in November. So we can expect the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro to arrive during the holiday shopping season. A OnePlus 7T Pro prototype has been leaked on Chinese microblogging site Weibo and SlashLeaks. The leak should be taken with a bit of skepticism but it could also shed light on what we can expect from the OnePlus 7T Pro.

No major design changes

The leaked image gives us a clear look at the front panel of the upcoming flagship. The device is placed in a case to hide its design but it’s clear from the image that it would have a bezel-less display without a hole-punch or a notch similar to the current OnePlus 7 Pro. The case is thicker at the top to hide the pop-up selfie camera.

#OnePlus – #OnePlus7T – oneplus 7t pro Real Device Leaks https://t.co/EQlye52G9S pic.twitter.com/pKg66wWt53 — /LEAKS (@Slashleaks) August 4 2019

The cutout for the mic on the ‘T’ model appears to be larger than that of OnePlus 7 Pro. Visually it doesn’t look all that different from the current Pro model.

The OnePlus 7 Pro lacks water resistance and the 3.5mm headphone jack. OnePlus is unlikely to bring back the audio jack with the upcoming model but water resistance is a possibility. The 7 Pro features curved glass panes on the front and rear supported by a metal frame in the middle. It uses a motorized pop-up mechanism to accommodate the selfie camera.

The current OnePlus flagship sports a gorgeous 6.67-inch Fluid AMOLED display with QHD resolution of 3120 x 1440 pixels and 516ppi of pixel density. It has a blazing fast 90Hz refresh rate which enables a faster and smoother gaming experience. The screen is protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5.

Under the hood improvements

The leaked image didn’t reveal the specs of the upcoming device but we can expect the OnePlus 7T Pro to bring under the hood improvements. It could run Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 855 Plus processor which is a minor upgrade over the Snapdragon 855 that runs the OnePlus 7 Pro. The Snapdragon 855 Plus has a faster clock speed and better GPU performance than its predecessor.

We expect the 7T Pro to offer similar RAM and storage configurations as the 7 Pro. The OnePlus 7 Pro comes in three different configurations of 6GB RAM+128GB storage 8GB RAM+256GB storage and a top of the line model with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.

The RAM is more than sufficient to handle any task you throw at it so a higher RAM in the upcoming model would be nothing more than a gimmick. But the 256GB storage is not sufficient for some people especially considering OnePlus devices don’t support external storage. So we wouldn’t be surprised to see a 512GB or 1TB storage variant of 7T Pro.

The device would run OxygenOS software on top of Android Q out of the box. The experience on OxygenOS is pretty close to stock Android. It has features like Gaming Mode and Smart Boost to offer better performance while preserving battery life. It also features background optimization to keep the phones running fast even as they age.

According to the rumor mill the OnePlus 7T Pro could pack a bigger battery and support wireless charging. The OnePlus 7 Pro lacks wireless charging even though most other flagship phones support the technology. OnePlus would want to catch up. The 7 Pro packs a 4000mAh battery with the company’s proprietary Warp Charge 30 technology.

Camera upgrades on the cards

The OnePlus 7 Pro is one of the world’s best smartphone cameras according to DxOMark. It sports a triple camera setup on the back consisting of a 48MP primary sensor with OIS a 16MP ultra-wide angle lens and an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. For selfies it gets a 16MP pop-up camera.

OnePlus has admitted that the 7 Pro camera isn’t where the company wants it to be. It wants its cameras to take photos with more “natural” colors with “emotions.” Even if the company chooses to keep the OnePlus 7T Pro’s megapixel count the same as 7 Pro it would make under the hood improvements to achieve its objective.

OnePlus needs to up its camera game further with the upcoming model. That’s because the OnePlus 7T Pro will be competing with the Galaxy Note 10 iPhone 11 and Google Pixel 4 each of which will be pushing the limits of smartphone photography.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hcnRpY2xlMjUyNzc2Nzg4Lmh0bWzSAT1odHRwczovL2FtcC5uZXdzb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYXJ0aWNsZTI1Mjc3Njc4OC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘I don’t want to move.

The publisher hasn’t explained why it has started this sudden removal of old mods.

English view video Grand Theft Auto 6 Comments: A Dramatic Reading

Late last week players and mod creators began reporting on Twitter and the GTA Forums that old Grand Theft Auto mods on PC were being pulled. On July 17 it became clear that something was going on. Numerous mods including popular Vice City and San Andreas mods were deleted and were now no longer available on ModDB.

Some of these mods are extremely old. GTA: Liberty City a total conversion Vice City mod that ported GTA III to the Vice City engine was first released back in 2005. It has now been deleted from ModDB. GTA Underground a popular mod that was trying to merge multiple GTA maps into one massive game was also removed on July 17. Its developers confirmed via a Discord message that the mod was deleted as a direct result of a DMCA takedown notice from Take-Two Interactive.

A community manager and editor from ModDB explained in a short tweet thread that the site reached out to Take-Two and tried to start a dialogue in an attempt to find a different solution than just yanking down the popular mods. Take-Two was unreceptive and ModDB was forced to take down the content after receiving the DMCA notices. He also warned modders to “tread carefully” because more DMCA notices might be coming for old GTA mods.

Kotaku contacted Rockstar Games about the recent DMCA takedowns but the developer and publisher didn’t respond.

GTA Forums user Ash_735 has put together a comprehensive and detailed forum post listing many of the mods that have been removed and some of the reactions from the community. Many modders and players are frustrated because they feel this is Take-Two going back on its word.

Previously the publisher in 2017 had come under fire after it forced the popular GTA modding tool software Open IV to shut down. This led to a huge explosion of anger from the GTA modding community. It was so big in fact that eventually Rockstar Games and Take-Two changed its plans and allowed Open IV to return. At the time the company provided a new set of rules that modders could follow to avoid DMCA takedowns. The main text was saved by PC Gamer in an article from 2017 and could be summed as simply “Don’t mod GTA Online stick to singleplayer mods and don’t sell your mods.” Simple enough.

But in June 2019 these guidelines changed with this text being added to the rules:

This does not apply to... (iii) use or importation of other IP (including other Rockstar IP) in the project; or (iv) making new games stories missions or maps.

Now in 2021 it seems Take-Two is going after mods that violate this part of the rules. Though to be clear these rules were changed with no heads up or warning and many modders are now left scrambling as to what to do next. Though it should also be noted that the rules posted back in 2017 always stipulated that Take-Two could change the rules at any time or reject any mod for any reason at a later date. Still this sudden surge in DMCA takedowns surprised many and angered even more.

Take-Two hasn’t been a fan of GTA modders for some time. Earlier this year the publisher fought to remove Vice City and GTA III reversed engineered source code. Eventually the developers behind that code were able to get their work back online. But it’s another example of Take-Two’s continued fight against modders. This is an odd stance to take in 2021 when video game mods have become a popular way to keep old games relevant and playable long past their initial release date.

It’s not clear why Take-Two is going DMCA wild now years after these mods were first released. Some in the community have theorized it could be connected to long-rumored GTA remakes or remasters. Others have speculated that it could be a result of the still not-officially-confirmed GTA 6. But this is all speculation.

The publisher has apparently gone further in the last week or so issuing DMCA takedown notices for GTA 5 map mods like Vice City Overhaul as well as multiple popular mods for earlier games in the series.

GTA: Liberty City was a total conversion that brought the setting of GTA 3 into Vice City's engine and was first released in 2005. It's no longer available on ModDB. Vice Cry which replaced Vice City's textures and models with higher-resolution versions is also gone. So is GTA: Underground which combined the maps of not just GTA 3 Vice City and San Andreas but those of other Rockstar games Bully Manhunt and Manhunt 2 then added gang warfare. So are the mods converting San Andreas into ports of console-exclusives Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories. And that's not all.

A thread on GTAForums has been cataloguing the removals as well as noting that Rockstar's statement on singleplayer mods initially made during the back-and-forth over modding tool OpenIV in 2017 and which many modders have been assuming would protect their work was quietly updated in 2019. It now notes that it does not apply to either the ""use or importation of other IP (including other Rockstar IP) in the project"" or ""making new games stories missions or maps"". Neither of those clauses was in the original version of Rockstar's statement which has been excluded from the Wayback Machine but can still be read in our news story from the time.

As for why Take-Two has decided to go after these mods now—one of which it's worth saying again is 16 years old—the internet is currently split between two theories. One that it's because they're seen as competition for hypothetical remastered versions of GTA 3 Vice City and San Andreas. And two that it's connected to recent rumors about GTA 6.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5tZS5jb20vbmV3cy9nYW1pbmctbmV3cy90YWtlLXR3by1pc3N1ZXMtZG1jYS10YWtlZG93bnMtZm9yLXNldmVyYWwtcG9wdWxhci1ndGEtbW9kcy0yOTk2MTYy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take-Two issues DMCA takedowns for several popular 'GTA' mods,"Take-Two Interactive has issued several DMCA takedowns for popular GTA mods causing several projects to shut down.

For the second time in less than a year Take-Two the parent company of Rockstar Games has taken aim at fan-made mod projects.

The publisher served DMCA takedown notices to several projects in the past week including the Vice City Overhaul which ported the existing map’s assets into GTA V.

Other mods affected by the takedown include GTA: Underground which combined several maps from the series and other games into one place. Take-Two also took down PC ports of the PSP titles Vice City Stories and Liberty City Stories. A full list of the affected mods can be found here.

According to a post on GTA Forums Take-Two Interactive agreed to let players mod GTA games as long as they did not port old content into new games or mod online content. The post details how Take-Two supposedly went back on this agreement changing the rules around mods to include no new content.

Take-Two allegedly changed the agreement in 2019 without alerting players. The new agreement also limited modders from creating new single-player content including maps vehicles and missions.

The community is understandably frustrated considering some creators have worked on projects for over 15 years. One prominent modder has announced that he will no longer create content for the series.

Players and modders are questioning Take-Two’s motivations behind the takedowns. Some believe the developer could be preparing several remasters of older games or that the takedowns could be linked to the rumoured ongoing development of GTA 6.

""Just to make sure as many people here know as possible Take-Two have been going heavy with the DMCAs this week first starting with GTAV map mods like GTA3 Portland Vice City Overhaul etc"" writes Ash_735 on the official GTA Forums (thanks PC Gamer).

As Ash puts it an agreement to help the publisher and the modding community peacefully coexist was struck a little while back when Take-Two ""tried to make modding GTA games illegal"".

""Naturally this did not fly well back in 2017 and both gamers and the gaming media attacked Rockstar and Take-Two for this decision"" they continue. ""Now what came from this is Rockstar Games stepping up and talking to Take-Two to highlight the importance of the modding community and as such the takedowns [were] dropped but some 'rules' were put into place.

""The original [agreement] was drafted up in 2017 and can be summarised as ""Don't port maps/vehicles/content from older GTA games or other video games series to RAGE"" and 'Stay away from Online absolutely do not touch Online or anything related to GTA Online'"".

Now however Ash alleges that the agreement was ""updated without informing the community multiple changes and words were changed to pretty much add in a disclaimer that Take-Two can override any of this and well Take-Two can do what they want"". Apparently a new rule was also allegedly added that said that as well as not porting content from older games modders cannot create new content either - which means they can't do very much of anything anymore.

Vice Cry is a FULLY ORIGINAL mod not using ANY converted assets. Down.

The issue becomes particularly challenging when players discovered there was no way to compare old and new versions of the agreement as the page was seemingly ""excluded from the Wayback Machine and other archiving websites so people can no longer check what it used to say"".

Since yesterday then Take-Two has issued mass takedown orders for a number of older GTA mods including mods that have been featured on GTAF in the Modding Section such as GTA: Underground which was seemingly due a large update in the next few days and the 15-year-old project GTA: Liberty City. Even HD texture projects such as Vice Cry have been targeted too.

From what the modding community can gather it looks as though Take-Two's lawyers are scouring modding databases for terms like Liberty City Vice City San Andreas etc. And though no one's entirely sure why Take-Two has enacted this now some speculate that it's either something to do with the series' highly-anticipated next update or perhaps a remaster or remake project that will see older GTA games released on current-gen systems.

The news has seen several prolific GTA modders denounce the company for what they consider to be reneging on previous agreements and are still reeling from the company's efforts to takedown reverse-engineered versions of GTA 3 and Vice City.

In the wake of George Floyd's murder corporate America pledged to do better saying it would diversify its leadership encourage equity and take concrete actions to root out systemic racism.

But a USA TODAY analysis of previously undisclosed hiring records from dozens of top firms found that more than a year later executive roles remain overwhelmingly white and male. Black and Hispanic workers particularly women tend to be concentrated in the lowest ranks and some of the nation's most powerful brands still refuse to disclose data on the gender ethnic and racial makeup of their workforce.

The eight-part series combed the records of the Standard & Poor’s 100 some of the most highly valued companies in the stock market.

Building pipelines for diversity success Anthony D. Wilbon dean of the Howard School of Business and Charlotte Newman senior manager at Amazon talk growth strategies for diversity and equity Jarrad Henderson USA TODAY

They revealed that while Black and Hispanic employees are often overrepresented as compared to U.S. census data on the nation's workforce among the technicians administrative assistants and laborers who form the backbone of many organizations they are less likely to be found at the company's senior levels or in other professional positions.

The lack of diversity in corporate roles that pay the highest salaries offer the best benefits and provide a path to promotions influence and leadership hardens the racial and gender wealth gap that's resulted in the typical white family having eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic household.

Companies are more transparent but not all

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies have become more transparent in the 14 months since Floyd's killing when protests condemning systemic bias and calling for social justice swept the nation.

Among the S&P 100 a record 54 companies including Merck Ford Motor Co Bank of America and Target gave USA TODAY their EEO-1 forms documents detailing the gender race and ethnic breakdown of their workforces that businesses are required to provide each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Search our database of EEO-1 employment records Explore

Another 23 corporations including Home Depot Walmart and Boeing said they would publicly disclose that information this year or in 2022.

Altria Abbott Laboratories AT&T General Dynamics and UnitedHealth Group were among the companies that provided their EEO-1 reports after publication deadline.

But some of the nation’s most well-known brands such as Exxon T-Mobile and FedEx rejected USA TODAY’s requests and gave no future date when they might provide such information to the public. Amazon which last released its EEO-1 report in 2016 also would not provide the most recent demographic data of its workforce but said it would release its 2020 data in the coming months.

Federal officials will not release these demographic records to the public without companies’ permission citing privacy protections in the Civil Rights Act. A civil suit filed by Reveal a nonprofit investigative journalism outlet challenges the legality of hiding these records from the public.

Boards are largely white and male

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies often point to the diversity of their boards of directors to distract from the concentration of white men in their corporate suites. But board membership at the 54 companies examined by USA TODAY also did not reflect the racial makeup of their business's workforces let alone the nation's overall population.

While white men make up about a third of U.S. workers they held half or more of board seats at 33 of the 54 companies.

Amgen a biopharmaceutical company had the highest percentage of white men on its board – eight people or 73% – even though only 30% of the company's workers are white males. White women held two of the remaining three board seats which is almost half of their rate in the company's workforce.

Compared to their company workforces white non-Hispanic men were only underrepresented on 12 company boards almost always by just a handful of percentage points. Among the remaining corporations reviewed the share of white male board directors often was two or three times higher than their business' workforce.

The companies also appointed white women to their boards at higher rates than people of color.

White non-Hispanic women held a disproportionately large share of board memberships at about two-thirds of companies.

White women had no seats on the board of Coca-Cola despite holding 23% of all jobs. At Starbucks they held just 9% of seats while accounting for 38% of the company's workers.

About a third of companies had boards where the percentage of men of color matched or exceeded their representation in the business's workforce. Six companies did not have any men of color on their boards.

Another 19 companies did not have any directors who were women of color. They were equitably represented or overrepresented on the boards of just 10 companies. But those figures are based on counting all non-white women together obscuring the lack of Black and Hispanic women board members in particular.

“We have to move from tokenism to transformation'' says Darren Walker who is head of the philanthropic Ford Foundation and a diversity advocate. ""Having one Black on the board or the chief diversity officer three levels down from the CEO will not result in a successful strategy. There has to be genuine authenticity.”

At about half of the companies reviewed the board membership had more representation for people of color than among the business's executives although men of color were much more likely to hold those seats than women.

For instance 44% of board seats at Gilead Sciences Inc. a pharmaceutical company are filled by four men of color but no women of color. Two white men and three white women hold the rest. Yet men of color account for 20% of the company's executives and 26% of its workforce.

Women of color account for a larger share of McDonald's workforce than any of the 54 companies reviewed: 44%. None sit on the company's 13-member board.

Again these tallies lump together ethnic and racial groups that face different challenges with workplace discrimination and gaining the kind of career recognition that leads to invites for board seats. Closing the gaps will take targeted strategies experts say.

Diversity strengthens the bottom line

A diverse board appeared to help some S&P 500 companies weather the economic downturn sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic better than businesses whose boardrooms were less inclusive according to a new report.

S&P 500 businesses whose boards were more than 30% people of color experienced a 4% bump in revenue as compared to the previous year while their peers whose boards were less than 20% people of color saw their revenue dip 2.8% according to BoardReady a nonprofit focused on making boards more inclusive.

Race inequity in corporate US

And companies where women made up more than 30% of the directors outperformed those whose boards had fewer women in 11 of the top 15 S&P 500 sectors last year.

“It’s striking that so many aspects of diversity correlated with better performance” the report’s lead researcher Rajalakshmi Subramanian said in a statement announcing the findings. “No matter whether you’re looking at racial diversity gender diversity or diversity in age companies with a broader range of perspectives at the board table did better.”

The gains that have been made in some board rooms have been hard-won and companies can easily backtrack if advocates aren't vigilant says Ursula Burns the former CEO of Xerox and the first Black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company. She's been leading the charge to diversify the boards of major corporations.

“The board level in many publicly traded companies is better than the C-suite data and it’s better than the employment levels” Burns told USA TODAY in an interview. “Basically if you beat the (crap) out of them about something – I’m sorry to say it this way – they will pay a little bit of attention to it with the hope that we will forget about it after a while and they then can take their foot off the pedal.”

Mondelēz International which produces snacks like Oreos and Ritz crackers has no women of color and only one man of color on its 12-person board. Nearly 40% of the company's workers are people of color.

In an emailed statement the company said that last year it signed on to the Board Diversity Action Alliance which aims to make boards more inclusive.

""We value diversity within our board of director members as we do throughout our organization'' the company said. ""We know we can and will continue to improve in this space.""

USA TODAY's series puts a spotlight on several industries including:

Tech

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

While white employees across all U.S. industries are three times as likely as their Black or Hispanic peers to get top jobs the gap is even starker among the nation's largest tech firms.

White employees at Facebook Google Amazon Apple and Microsoft are five times as likely to be executives as their Hispanic colleagues and seven times as likely as their Black co-workers USA TODAY found.

And while women are underrepresented among managers and executives throughout corporate America – a pattern that continues in the tech world – the disparity among Black tech employees is particularly striking. In that sector Black men are twice as likely as Black women to have leadership roles.

Black and Hispanic workers have a disproportionate share of lower-level jobs in big tech. At tech companies analyzed by USA TODAY nearly half of white employees had professional positions as compared to 1 in 5 Hispanic workers and 1 in 9 Black workers. The professional gap between white and Black employees in tech was three times greater than what is seen in the overall labor force.

Banking

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Leadership of the nation's major banks has traditionally been – and continues to be – predominantly white.

White people fill 73% to 87% of all executive positions at US Bancorp Bank of America Bank of New York Mellon Citigroup Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.

Wells Fargo says that it will release its EEO-1s for 2019 and 2020 later this summer roughly a year after its CEO Charles Scharf a white man drew criticism for saying the San Francisco-based company missed its diversity benchmarks because there was a limited pool of Black executives to draw from.

Food Retail

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

At some of the nation's largest or best-known food companies and chains the diversity in top jobs is vastly out of sync with the broader population.

White workers are 64% of the nation's workforce while Hispanic workers are 16.8% and Black workers are 11.2% according to U.S. Census data.

But 87% of executive positions at Costco are occupied by white people. Meanwhile 77% of executives at Pepsi and 74% at Coca-Cola are white according to records obtained by USA TODAY. McDonald's was the most reflective of the U.S.'s racial demographics with white people filling two-thirds of executive roles. Although the company's leadership was the closest to matching the overall American workforce McDonald's still had disproportionately high rates of Black and Hispanic people particularly women in lower-paying and lower-ranking jobs.

CNT suffers RansomEXX ransomware attack

While CNT has not officially stated that they suffered a ransomware attack BleepingComputer has learned that the attack was conducted by a ransomware operation known as RansomEXX.

Security researcher Germán Fernández shared with BleepingComputer a hidden link to the group's data leak site that warns CNT that the gang would leak data stolen during the attack if CNT did not pay a ransom.

""Your time is LIMITED!

When this time will come to end there are two ways: we will RAISE the ransom amount or PUBLISH your files.

You will lose the opportunity to contact us after the data PUBLICATION.

If you REALLY WANT to prevent data leak contact us RIGHT NOW. We have downloaded 190GB+ of your files and we are ready to publish it."" - RansomEXX.

Hidden RansomEXX data leak page for CNT

This page is currently hidden from the public and can only be accessed via the direct link. These hidden pages are commonly included in ransom notes to prove that a ransomware operation stole data during an attack.

In CNT's press statement the company states that corporate and customer data are secure and have not been exposed.

However the RansomEXX gang claims to have stolen 190 GB of data and shared screenshots of some of the documents on the hidden data leak page.

The screenshots seen by BleepingComputer include contact lists contracts and support logs.

The ransomware operation originally launched under the name Defray in 2018 but became more active in June 2020 when it rebranded as RansomEXX and began to target large corporate entities.

Like other ransomware gangs RansomEXX will compromise a network through purchased credentials brute-forced RDP servers or by utilizing exploits.

Once they gain access to a network they will quietly spread throughout the network while stealing unencrypted files to be used for extortion attempts.

After gaining access to an administrator password they deploy the ransomware on the network and encrypt all of its devices.

As is becoming common among ransomware operations RansomEXX created a Linux version to ensure they can target all critical servers and virtual machines.

The RansomEXX gang's has a history of high-profile attacks including Brazil's government networks Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Konica Minolta IPG Photonics and Tyler Technologies.

The corporation has collected data about vulnerable residents and would help them get all assistance at the divisional level.

In view of the third wave the civic body also plans to start increasing ICU beds and other infrastructure.

Additionally in a bid to decongest public spaces to prevent clusters the corporation has begun sealing outlets that violate the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

Tenders for Rs 250 crore worth projects revoked

To ensure the quality of civic projects and improve competition among bidders the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has revoked tenders amounting to Rs 250 crore.

The two cancelled projects include one on stormwater drains and another on smart poles. The missing link stormwater drain project worth Rs 120 crore funded by the World Bank. The safe city project where 1600 smart poles with CCTV cameras connected to the police control room and an SOS button for women and children were planned with a budget of Rs 119 crore funded by the Union government.

Activists had expressed concerns about the stormwater drain project in 2019 stating the existing drains were rebuilt and that the linking of drains was not done in all locations.

While checking the specifications of the smart pole project the corporation engineers found it unfeasible. The alternative plan proposed at present is to develop a mobile application.

Madras HC questions corporation on Marina upkeep

Plastic waste forms a major part of the garbage dumped on Marina beach.

Madras High Court bench comprising Justices N Kirubakaran and TV Thamilselvi directed the Tamil Nadu government to consider forming an exclusive team chaired by an IAS officer and consisting of officials from Corporation PWD Police Department Councillor and environmentalists for maintaining Marina Beach.

The bench questioned the Corporation on the money being spent to maintain the beach delays in setting up a fish market near Loop Road and the lack of restrooms for visitors and other aspects of amenities and revenue.

The court ordered the State and the Greater Chennai Corporation to submit a report on the amount of garbage generated on the beach every day and the actions taken to dispose of it.

Integrated stormwater drain project kickstarted

To prevent flooding in North Chennai the civic body has kickstarted the execution of the construction of the integrated stormwater drain (ISWD) network covering 770 km under the Kosasthalaiyar Basin project at a cost of ₹3220 crore. The project is funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

After analysing the rainfall data of 46 years (1971-2016) the implementing agencies prepared a detailed project report (DPR). The plan recommends the construction of ISWD for 600 km comprising primary secondary and tertiary drains. Along with the ISWD network it suggests the renovation of the existing dilapidated drains that run for about 170 km which will prevent water stagnation in Tiruvottiyur Manali Madhavaram and Ambattur zones.

According to the DPR rejuvenating six lakes and 65 water bodies could increase the water storage capacity to 23 million cubic metres as against the present 10 million cubic metres.

Along with the package Tesla is offering a $1500 hardware upgrade for early owners who have old hardware that is not capable of full self-driving tasks.

The problem is Tesla previously told those same owners that their cars were capable of full self-driving tasks and isn’t allowing those owners to take advantage of the new subscription scheme without paying again for a hardware upgrade that they already paid for.

Update: Tesla has reduced the price of the upgrade to $1000. Which is still $1000 more than the appropriate price for something that customers already paid for.

All Teslas currently come with “Basic Autopilot” a slate of driver-assist and safety features. These include automatic lane keeping traffic-aware cruise control and other standard safety features like emergency brake assist. These can help reduce the stress particularly of highway driving and enhance the safety of the vehicle.

The “Full Self-Driving” package takes this further and adds other driver-assist features that allow the car to make more decisions on its own. These include:

Navigate on Autopilot

Auto Lane Change

Autopark and Summon

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

Eventually this package will offer full autonomy but the software is not there yet and still requires driver attention at all times.

Tesla’s Full Self-Driving package can be bought for $10000 upfront or $199/month with the new subscription scheme. It has cost less in the past but as Tesla has rolled out more and more capabilities through software updates the price has continually increased.

Since 2016 Tesla has said that all Tesla cars have Full-Self Driving hardware built in but the software is what costs the extra money. At press time Tesla’s blog where they announced this is still up on their website. In case it goes down we’ve screenshotted the contents of the blog for posterity:

Owners who bought Tesla vehicles between late 2016 and mid-2019 were sold a bill of goods that was capable of full self-driving with the hardware included in the vehicle. They were told that no further hardware upgrades would be required.

Since that post Tesla found that their previous computers designated Hardware 2.0 and 2.5 weren’t quite up to the task of full self-driving. So they designed their own chip alternately described as “Hardware 3.0” or “FSD Computer” which was more capable. Cars built since mid-2019 have this new hardware included.

As part of this change in hardware Tesla said that all owners with the old hardware could upgrade to the new hardware for free provided they had paid for Full Self-Driving. Tesla has a blog describing the process for upgrading your computer to FSD Computer/Hardware 3.0.

This was all fine and dandy – owners who would make use of the FSD Computer got a hardware upgrade along with their purchase of the software and owners without Full Self-Driving weren’t missing out on anything since they didn’t have the software anyway.

But now the much-awaited subscription scheme offers a lower barrier to entry. Tesla owners with cars from late 2016-mid 2019 might want to try out the software and see what it can do especially since it has improved since they purchased their car. Maybe they don’t know if they’ll like it enough to want to spend $10000 or maybe they don’t think they’ll have the car long enough for it to be worthwhile — any number of reasons.

But to get that subscription Tesla is demanding that those owners pay $1500 upfront for the hardware upgrade that was previously given to all Full Self-Driving purchasers for free. Remember this is an upgrade that all Tesla owners since late 2016 already paid for by purchasing a vehicle that Tesla said included Full Self-Driving hardware. Here’s the notice showing up in the Tesla app for older car owners who want to use the new subscription:

As this information has percolated through Tesla forums and by word-of-mouth many owners are showing their anger with Tesla over the changes. We’ve received several tips and messages and read lots of furious comments over this change with some comments even calling for legal action.

Electrek’s Take

This isn’t the first time Tesla has broken a promise to early customers.

Tesla told early customers that prices would gradually rise for Full Self-Driving capability and to lock in their price now before it goes up. Then before any Full Self-Driving features actually rolled out Tesla pulled a bait-and-switch and lowered the price despite the software never having been delivered yet at that time. Some might say that this is analogous to buying a product that later dropped in price but the difference is that the early purchasers here gained no benefit from owning the software early since the software didn’t do anything yet at the time.

Tesla also recently broke a promise with Tesla Solar Roof customers hiking prices on already-signed contracts after stringing along those early customers for a year or more about Solar Roof availability.

This sort of thing seems to happen a lot with Tesla. In fact even before the aforementioned events many early Model 3 owners purchased their vehicles with Full Self-Driving even though the software didn’t do anything yet because they thought doing so would obligate Tesla to upgrade their computers for free if they later found out the hardware was not capable enough. So this sort of behavior is common enough from Tesla that many owners anticipated this happening years in advance.

But despite this the company has loyal customers because they make a good product and because they truly are pushing the industry forward. Tesla has been a major cause of the shift towards electric vehicles which is necessary if we are to avoid the worst effects of the climate emergency we are all currently facing. They’re innovating a lot and the rest of the industry is finally starting to race to catch up.

The same fast-and-loose pace of innovation leads to a lot of basic errors like this. Someone within the company should have remembered that this promise was made and should have noted that it would be unethical and unwise to charge your loyal early customers $1500 for a product they already purchased. But that employee probably quit working at Tesla a while ago because the company overworks everyone which leads to high turnover and little institutional memory even for things that are still up on the website.

Tesla has gotten a certain amount of slack from owners and media. The company is a “startup” in a difficult industry and is trying to change that industry significantly and do a reasonable job of it.

However Tesla was founded in 2003 18 years ago. It’s an enormous company with over 70000 employees making ~$10 billion in revenue every quarter and it’s even part of the S&P 500. It’s not a “startup” anymore. It doesn’t get to use that excuse when it does stupid stuff like this. It needs to grow up and stop lying to its customers. And we’re getting tired of having to say this.

There is a simple solution here: remove the $1500 charge for hardware that owners already paid for. We hope this change happens swiftly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTcvdGVzbGEtZGVidXRzLWZzZC1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24tZm9yLTE5OS1wZXItbW9udGguaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzA3LzE3L3Rlc2xhLWRlYnV0cy1mc2Qtc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uLWZvci0xOTktcGVyLW1vbnRoLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla owners can now get 'FSD' premium driver assistance for $199 per month,"The interior of a Tesla Model S is shown in autopilot mode in San Francisco California U.S. April 7 2016.

Tesla just introduced a way for customers to subscribe to its premium driver assistance package for $199 a month rather than paying $10000 up front.

Marketed as Full Self-Driving capability (or FSD) the driver assistance system does not make Tesla's electric vehicles safe for use without an attentive driver behind the wheel.

One eligible owner shared a notice they received from Tesla on Friday with CNBC which said:

""Full Self-Driving capability is now available as a monthly subscription. Upgrade your Model Y ... for $199 (excluding taxes) to experience features like Navigate on Autopilot Auto Lane Change Auto Park Summon and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control. The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

While this person's Tesla Model Y possessed all components needed to start a FSD subscription other owners lamented that they would have to pay $1500 to upgrade their Tesla's computer to the Hardware 3 or HW3 version the company first showed off at its Autonomy Day event in April 2019 in order to subscribe.

Customers who previously bought Tesla's Enhanced Autopilot package which it is not selling any longer can subscribe to FSD for a lower price of $99 a month but may require the HW3 upgrade.

In a subscription agreement on Tesla's website Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker cautions that among other things:

FSD features are ""subject to change limited by region"" and can only be used on Tesla vehicles that have newer hardware and Autopilot technology installed.

Drivers are responsible for tolls parking or other traffic violations that happen in a Tesla that's operating with FSD features engaged.

Tesla can increase the price for a subscription any time but will give drivers a one-month advance notice before billing them at a new rate.

Owners can cancel FSD any time but the company won't prorate their monthly payment if they do.

Tesla can suspend or cancel a driver's FSD subscription if they use the technology ""for anything unauthorized or inappropriate"" or for non-payment.

All newer Teslas include a standard set of driver assistance features dubbed Autopilot. The Autopilot or standard features enable a Tesla to ""steer accelerate and brake automatically within its lane"" according to Tesla's website.

The premium FSD package enables more elaborate features like Smart Summon which lets a driver call their Tesla to come pick them up from across a parking lot or down a long driveway using the Tesla mobile app like a remote control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vbXVzay1wcm92aWRlcy10ZXNsYS10c2xhLWN5YmVydHJ1Y2stZGVzaWduLXVwZGF0ZXMtNTE5Mjk0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Musk Provides Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck Design Updates,"Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has provided updates on the company's Cybertruck and suggested that it could end up becoming a flop in the market.

Musk wrote on Twitter that the car's doors would not have handles and would simply ""recognize"" the owner to open the door. He also said that the Tesla team was planning to retain the same design as the one they displayed during its 2019 launch. ""Just some small tweaks here & there to make it slightly better"" he wrote.

The Cybertruck caused a splash when it was launched in 2019. It had sleek angular lines an unconventional trapezoidal design and a yoke instead of a steering wheel. The launch event also had drama: Tesla design leader Franz von Holzhausen shattered the demo Cybertruck's glass windows with a metal ball after Musk's claim moments earlier that the windows could withstand bullets from a 9-millimeter handgun.

Key Takeaways Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company's Cybertruck might turn out to be a failure because of its futuristic design.

The all-electric pickup truck was launched with great publicity back in November 2019.

It will have to contend with a market that is fast becoming crowded with startups and established carmakers.

But the public lapped up the truck's design and immediately submitted the $100 preorder amounts. Musk claimed that the number of preorders for the Cybertruck had already reached 250000 within five days of its launch. By August 2021 that figure had surpassed 1.25 million.

Despite the numbers Musk's mood was cautious. He said there is a chance that the all-electric truck may not succeed ""because it is so unlike anything else."" He wrote “Other trucks look like copies of the same thing but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future."" With a starting price of $39900 for a rear-wheel drive (RWD) model the truck is slated to start production later this year.

A market dominated by established carmakers

According to sales data from Motor Intelligence pickup trucks constituted 20.1% of total sales of new cars last year. The market for pickup trucks is dominated by established carmakers. With a 36.1% share of the overall market General Motors Company (GM) led the market and Ford Motor Company (F) was second with a 33.8% market share.

Even as Tesla is gearing up to manufacture its truck these established carmakers are already snapping at its heels. Ford plans to launch electric versions of its pickups. It plans to make an all-electric version of the F-150 its best-selling gasoline-powered truck to be released in fall 2022. General Motors has also entered the market with its GMC Hummer EV slated for delivery in 2023. Rivian a Detroit-based startup is making the R1T which will deliver a range comparable to Tesla's Cybertruck. Rivian's product also qualifies for a federal tax credit.

If Musk is worried about competition he is not showing it. ""I don't care"" he wrote on Twitter referring to the prospect of a failure for the electric truck. ""I love [the Cybertruck design] so much even if others don't."""

But of course TI are far from the only player in this arena. It’s nice for a change to see a Casio receiving some attention. The Casio fx series of graphical calculators can now communicate with the world thanks to the work of [Manawyrm] in porting a TCP/IP stack to them.

As can be seen in the video below lurking in the calculator’s menu system is an IRC client there is also a terminal application and a webserver which you can even visit online (Please be aware that it’s only a calculator though so an onslaught of Hackaday readers clicking the link may bring it down). The Casio doesn’t have a network interface of its own so instead it speaks SLIP over the serial port. In this endeavor it uses a UART driver sourced from [TobleMiner].

It’s always good to see a neglected platform get some love and also to note that this is an unusual outing for an SH4 CPU outside its most familiar home in the Sega Dreamcast. It’s a surprise then to read that the SH4 in a calculator of all products is a custom version that lacks an FPU. This deficiency doesn’t mean it can’t be overclocked though as this very old Hackaday article describes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9hbGV4YS1nb29nbGUtYXNzaXN0YW50LXNpcmktc3dlYXJpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's time for Alexa Google Assistant and Siri to swear,"I want Alexa to have a potty mouth. And Siri. More specifically I want them to swear – not at me but with me. For me natural conversation almost always involves a smattering of what most would term bad language. Unless I intend to swear through anger say or frustration I barely notice I'm using curse words. It's just punctuation emphasis.

If Amazon Google or Apple want me to feel like my digital assistant really is my personal helper then I want it to talk like me. I want Siri to engage in some social mirroring to learn and considerately use the cusses I deem acceptable such as ‘bollocks’ ‘shit’ and the most British of swears the glorious ‘wanker’.

I'd even be pleased with minor swears such as ‘bloody’ ‘git’ or ‘berk’ a curse so inoffensive it doesn't even make Ofcom’s list of naughty words. After all swearing is good for you. Even chimps do it.

Trouble is there’s a hard lock on our digital assistants getting fruity with language. Have you ever told Siri or Alexa to go fuck themselves? Not just thought about it actually said the words out loud to your smart speaker? Try it now I’ll wait. Alexa refuses to acknowledge the instruction. Siri curtly declares “I won’t respond to that.” Google Assistant is the most chipper replying “I’m sorry if I’ve upset you.” You can’t even get them to repeat a profanity parrot fashion. Siri just won’t the other two bottle it and bleep out the offending obscenity.

It’s in our nature of course to try and make our tech mimic our indecorousness. Did you spell rude words on a calculator at school? Yes you almost certainly did. There’s a long history here going back to 1978 and the Speak & Spell one of the first handheld electronic devices to feature speech synthesis. There were rumours of a magical button combination that would unlock dirty words. Or that if you repeatedly attempted to type coarse language the device would give you a dressing down for your impertinence.

But is this true? After a month of web searches and speculative emails I track down someone who might know the answer. Mitch Carr a retired radio DJ from Dallas was brought in by Texas Instruments to be the original voice of Speak & Spell. Would he be willing to talk? “Sure” comes the email reply. “S. U. R. E. You are correct.”

Carr made several trips to the Texas Instruments plant in Dallas in the late 70s to record letters and words for the first Speak & Spell. “I think the original had 200 words something like that” he says. But did he lay down any curse words? “No! If you spelled a bad word and hit the button it wouldn’t go ‘Oh no don’t do that’ like Siri does. The best you could do was just spell it out – like F. U. C. K. – but it wouldn’t say the word."" This didn’t stop many children (and adults) from trying of course.",,,,,,

The US Marine Corps has selected Textron Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems to proceed to the next phase of the service’s Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle program.

According to an announcement from the service the agreements are a pre-award and pave the way for negotiations for other transaction agreement awards of ARV prototypes.

Textron managed to proceed to the prototype phase despite not being part of the program to replace the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) currently in service from the onset. The company only revealed its bid for the ARV effort in April this year.

SAIC which received funds for full-system concept/trade studies in 2018 and funds for demonstration vehicles a year later was not selected for the program’s prototype phase.

Pending successful negotiations Army Contracting Command – Detroit Arsenal will award the ARV OTAs utilizing the Ground Vehicle Systems OTA with the National Advanced Mobility Consortium.

ARV is part of the Fleet Marine Force modernization initiative and will host a suite of C4 equipment sensors and operate both tethered and untethered UAS.

The ARV C4/UAS will employ a mix of reconnaissance surveillance target acquisition and C4 systems to sense and communicate. These systems will enable ARV to serve as the manned hub of a manned/unmanned team and deliver next-generation multi-domain mobile reconnaissance capabilities.

The Marine Corps is working to validate the ARV requirement to serve as a mobile protected hub of manned capability with the C4 to effectively operate robotic autonomous systems-enabled teams through a competitive prototyping effort with multiple industry partners.

According to the service the effort gained momentum following an industry engagement held in December 2020. PM LAV solicited proposals for prototypes through the consortium on March 30 2021. The Marine Corps received responses on May 3 and began evaluations.

In parallel to competitive prototyping the Marine Corps is also pursuing an effort to define the trade space of a government off-the-shelf solution using the Amphibious Combat Vehicle.

Port Chester ...,"WHITE PLAINS NY — Patrick Onogwu 64 and Asanimo Riesa 38 both of the Bronx pleaded guilty today for their part in a more than yearlong scheme that included using fraudulently obtained credit cards to steal from several Westchester County retailers owned by TJX Companies Inc. including TJ Maxx Marshalls and Home Goods.

The conspiracy carried out from June 13 2018 through Aug. 14 2019 focused on a number of TJX Companies Inc. stores including TJ Maxx Marshalls HomeGoods and HomeSense in Yorktown Heights Yonkers New Rochelle Port Chester Hartsdale the Bronx and elsewhere.

Onogwu and Riesa and their associates stole more than $50000 opening TJX Rewards credit cards by using victims’ personal identifying information including Social Security numbers forging victims’ signatures on credit applications and presenting forged United States passport cards and driver’s licenses as identification. The defendants then used these fraudulently obtained credit card accounts to purchase merchandise and then returned some of the stolen merchandise to other TJX stores to obtain cash refunds.

“This fraud scheme was detailed and extensive” DA Mimi Rocah said. “But thanks to our law enforcement partners from the Westchester Department of Public Safety the U.S. Department of State U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the victim’s retail crime investigative team the fraud scheme was stopped.”

Onogwu and Riesa have been ordered to pay restitution to the TJX Companies and Synchrony Bank and forfeited a 2013 Mercedes-Benz SUV that was used to travel from store to store committing the fraud as well as various electronic devices used to commit the fraud and monies in bank accounts that were used in connection with the scheme.

Patrick Onogwu and Asanimo Riesa were arraigned in Westchester County Court before Judge David S. Zuckerman on November 4 2020. They were released from jail at the end of last year due to the bail reform law. Donald Ilo was never arrested and there is a warrant out for him.

In the same case defendants Hassan Miller 47 and Dawn Anderson 50 were sentenced in September 2020 to 1.5 to 4.5 years each in state prison after pleading guilty in November 2019 to Criminal Possession of a Forged Instrument in the Second Degree a class D felony.

The case was before Judge David S. Zuckerman AJSC in Westchester County Court and was prosecuted by Senior Assistant District Attorney Stefanie DeNise.

Thousands of chickens are being raised citywide according to one estimate despite a 2004 ordinance designed to eliminate the practice.

This particular urban farming trend is becoming more popular as penned-up residents look to the unconventional pets as a diversion during the lockdown and by concerns among increasingly health-conscious consumers about the source and quality of their food.

Maureen Breen president of Philadelphia Backyard Chickens a Facebook group said her membership has leaped 21% in the last 12 months to 2700 enthusiasts. She estimates that those growing numbers translate to a climb to 12000 chickens in the area from about 10000 last year.

“Some people repurpose an old shed and some people spend thousands on a coop” said Breen a Drexel University accounting professor. “If you watch the budget on extras you can make home eggs as cost-effective as buying high-end eggs at the grocery store or farmers market.”

According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture or USDA the advertised prices for a dozen large grade A white eggs hovered about $1 nationally on June 18. That average was the same for the Northeastern states including Pennsylvania and New Jersey. A carton of large organic eggs — closer to the kind of eggs backyard chickens provide — average $3.99 nationally and $4.03 in the Northeast.

Breen said it costs about $0.10 a day to feed a chicken a diet of only chicken feed — pellets made of corn and soy similar in appearance to dry cat food. At that cost a dozen homegrown eggs would be valued at $1.20 Breen said. She added start-up costs such as purchasing an enclosure and bedding usually tacks on an additional $500. “That is if you want to keep your budget low” Breen said. “But I have fallen in love with my chickens and I buy them treats.”

For the last decade in the rear of her Fox Chase home Breen has raised a handful of chickens. She currently has five each of which produces an average of one egg a day.

“I’m a gardener and I like to grow my own food” said Breen. “Raising chickens just seemed like the perfect complement. Now I can bring protein to the food I provide for myself.”

This jump in Philadelphia’s chicken population has occurred even though raising them is illegal for most residents. The 17-year-old ordinance aimed at combating neighborhood complaints about noise and odor limits chicken-raising to properties of at least three acres. And although most municipalities ban roosters which crow loudly Philly is one of the few that also prohibits female hens.

“Females don’t make a lot of noise” said David Atkins president of the Ohio-based American Poultry Association (APA). “But when you get a male crowing in the morning it can really rile up the neighbors.”

Locally Primex Garden Center in Glenside Davis Feed in Perkasie and Tractor Supply Co. in Logan Township Gloucester County bring in chicks in the spring. One chick costs roughly $3 to $5. Chicken breeds are specialized as layers which provide eggs or broilers which provide meat while a few breeds are dual-purpose. Broilers have been bred to grow quickly to provide tender meat when slaughtered at about two months of age. Almost all backyard chickens are layers and treated as pets.

Other purchasing options can be found online at Murray McMurray Hatchery or MyPetChicken.com. The chickens are overnight mailed and the recipient is notified to come to pick them up when they arrive.

Breen has an exemption to raise her chickens because she researches the impact of the birds on the recycling of food waste. Chickens can consume food scraps including meat Breen said. Although the city has rarely enforced the chicken ban Breen and others in her group continue to lobby for a change. So far they’ve obtained 5000 signatures on a petition to repeal or revise the law.

“Having the city respond to complaints about a neighbor’s hens doesn’t seem like the best use of its resources” Breen said.

Before the pandemic city officials had planned a review of regulations as part of an effort to support urban agriculture. That initiative was paused because of the health crisis last year before recently resuming.

“The City of Philadelphia recognizes the needs of the urban agriculture community” said Maita Soukup communications director for Philadelphia Parks & Recreation. “To better meet those needs Philadelphia Parks & Recreation is undertaking a city-wide planning process to develop Philadelphia’s first-ever urban agriculture strategic plan. This includes reviewing current livestock regulations.”

Soukup added that the resulting plan was now expected to be released later this year and will provide policy recommendations to better support local farmers and growers.

Though it seems few of this new breed of chicken-keepers are interested in the meat the broader society has no such qualms. In the last year chicken sandwiches have closed the gap on burgers when it comes to America’s most popular dining-out choice. Chains such as Shake Shack McDonald’s and Wendy’s witnessing the success of Chic-fil-A’s signature sandwich have responded recently with their own premium versions.

“People just have this taste for the chicken sandwich” said Matt Fein the culinary director at Federal Donuts whose own sandwich has been a menu staple for eight years.

This increased demand for the nation’s favorite white meat and a shortage of workers at processing plants have combined to drive up the price.

“Prices are a killer right now” Fein said. “They’re astronomical the highest I’ve ever seen. The price of chicken breasts for our sandwiches is up over 30% from even six months ago.”

According to USDA data national wholesale prices for a broiler chicken have climbed 48% to $1.07 a pound in the 12-months ending on June 18.

On average chickens live about 10 years. While there are various breeds the egg layers are by far the most popular among urban farmers. “I have four Black Stars and an Easter-Egger (the shells of its eggs are blue-green)” said Breen. “But there also are breeds better for producing broilers. The broilers grow very quickly so quickly that the extra weight sometimes breaks their legs.”

No one is sure when the return to backyard chickens — a common urban practice until early in the 20th century — occurred. But Breen dates its origins to a decade or so ago when Weaver’s Way a Mount Airy-based co-op experienced a sharp rise in chicken supply sales.

“They noticed they were selling an awful lot of it” Breen said ”so they started the Facebook page. A couple of years ago I got involved with it and we’ve since had a happy separation from Weaver’s”

Not surprisingly during the pandemic many in areas surrounding the city also adopted the hobby. The lockdown for example gave Scott Harrison and Jessica Raushel scientists from Elkins Park the time to pursue a pastime they’d been pondering for years.

Still confined to the house this spring the Harrisons finally decided to raise chickens. Scott Harrison built a chicken coop in the rear of his one-third-acre lot and ordered three newly hatched chickens from mypetchicken.com. A spare bathroom served as a brooder until the birds were big enough to go outside.

“In summer we’ve been getting about an egg per bird per day” he said. “That’s more than we typically eat so we give them away pretty often.”

Harrison said that on the long walks he and his wife have taken this last year they’ve noticed that several neighbors also are raising chickens.

“I can understand because we always wanted to do this too” Harrison said. “One of the reasons we moved here was because Cheltenham Township was one of the few places that explicitly allows chickens. It’s been great. They produce eggs and if you really wanted to you could harvest them for meat too.”

There are some chicken lovers whose interest is unrelated to either eggs or meat. They groom the birds to vie in dog show-like competitions.

The APA a sort of American Kennel Club for fowl has seen a significant bump in membership in the last 18 months Atkins said.

“Our organization is for folks that are interested in breeding chickens and other birds for exhibition purposes” said Atkins who raises fowl in Lucasville Ohio. “These people go to poultry shows on the weekends and have their birds judged by licensed judges.

“And raising chickens in the backyard is how a lot of our members got started. It’s just something that becomes a lifelong obsession.”

It consists of thousands of acres of fruit and vegetable fields.

Although it is famous for its peaches and strawberries many other products are grown over all the seasons of the year. But the hidden gem at McLeod Farms is its museum. One can find 26 vintage restored cars and pickup trucks there over 20 farm tractors many farm implements and numerous nostalgic household and tool collectibles there.

The museum at McLeod Farms is open seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. -- and there is no admission charge to visit this outstanding museum. A curator is always present to help answer any questions that visitors might have.

McLeod Farms’ third-generation owner Campbell McLeod had collected many farm implements and old household collectibles over the years. About 25 or 30 years ago he decided to open a museum next to the McLeod Farms Market where hundreds of thousands of people stop by each year to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables as well as many side items. This store is especially bustling during the strawberry and peach seasons. The collections at the museum began to multiply and after a few years the building had to be doubled in size. A snack bar and restaurant soon followed the explosion in popularity of the McLeod Farms Market too.

Cars

Campbell McLeod collected 26 old cars and trucks over the years for this fantastic museum. The display includes one or more vehicles from every decade since automobiles came into being.

There are several prize cars in this fine collection. A shiny blue 1930 Lincoln was restored by a company in Lancaster County that specializes in restoring old cars. This particular car had to be built from two cars to obtain enough good parts and body sections. The rear seat area in this Lincoln is so large that there are two rows of seats facing each other there.

A black 1931 four-door Chevrolet is in pristine condition. It has been driven fewer than 100 miles over its lifetime. For most of its life it was stored in a garage at a Columbia funeral home. In 1976 this outstanding car won the Antique Car Club of America’s first prize for its restoration.

A 1955 Chevrolet in the museum was a show car and is equipped with a 327-cubic-inch Corvette engine.

Also in the collection is a 1920 McLaughlin manufactured in Canada. While four-cylinder engines were standard in that era this particular car had a six-cylinder engine thus giving it tremendously more power over other car makes.

Other outstanding cars on display are two Model T Fords; several Model A Fords of which one is a Roadster; a 1930 Ford pickup; a 1945 Army Jeep Campbell’s brother’s Oldsmobile; a Hudson; and even Campbell’s own Chevrolet pickup that was placed in the collection after his death in 2008.

Household business items

About half of the McLeod Farms Museum contains a plethora of household business and tool items. Several old-timey four-legged washing machines are on display. Back in the days when no electricity was available in the outlying areas gasoline-powered washing machines were in use. Upon electrification reaching these areas in the 1920s and 1930s the gasoline engines were replaced with electric motors. Also before electrification there were levers that had to be pumped by hand by pushing a long handle back and forth to create suction for a primitive vacuum cleaner. There is even one of these on display.

Other items in the museum collection are: old Singer sewing machines old Victrolas to play the 78-rpm records an old manual ice box with a compartment in the top to place a large block of ice old toasters that had to sit on top of a wood-burning stove to work several potbelly stoves a wide Hotpoint roller to iron sheets as well as several flat irons that had to be put on a stove to warm up. A special separate handle snapped onto these irons and when one lost its heat the handle would be unsnapped and then snapped onto another hot flat iron to continue.

Also on display are an old telephone operator’s plug-in switchboard an assortment of old churns a spinning wheel and a loom that is supplied by many cotton spindles many hand tools from bygone times women’s hair curlers which each curler was individually hooked up an electrical cord for a ladies’ hair-do old produce- and meat-weighing scales from grocery stores a barber chair with a child’s booster platform an old dental chair and even an old liquor still.

Many old tools dot the walls as well as old two-man logging saws. Farm tools also add to the collection. Also mounted on the walls are old shotguns and swords from a bygone era.

Regarding music there is an old foot pump organ and early large radios that were housed in large furniture pieces. Old bellows cameras are on display as well as old home movie cameras that had three lenses that could be rotated for the various telescopic needs.

Regarding glass there is a display case with old Coke Pepsi and Mountain Dew bottles from years past with their old logos. Back in the era of the late 1890s and early 1900s the state of South Carolina administered the dispensary system and was the only authorized source to sell liquor. Many old dispensary bottles of varying sizes and shapes line the display case.

The museum collection includes many porcelain dolls called “brides’ dolls” and are dressed in period clothing from many countries. Several horse-drawn carriages are on display -- from large ones to a small two-person carriage called a “doctor’s carriage” for house calls or also a “courtin’ carriage” which gentlemen would use to woo their intended-to-be.

Along the walls of the museum are many artwork features. Also adorning the walls are old gasoline station signs for Gulf Texaco Pure Oil and Gasoline and Quaker Oil.

Also featured is an array of old mechanical cash registers from various farm supply stores grocery stores and department stores. Some of these were even made of brass.

Farm tractor implement section

Under the outside covered area there are about 25 vintage tractors on display. One is a 1920s steel-wheel John Deere tractor. Prominent brands of tractors on display include John Deere Avery Fordson and International. Additionally many farm implements are in the collection. Among these are mule- and horse-drawn plows and planters hay balers and hand-operated cotton and corn planters that when pushed into the soil released both the seeds and some moisture to help them survive.

Summary

McLeod Farms is now owned by the fourth-generation family member Kemp McLeod who oversees the thousands of acres of fields the retail market and the Farm Museum. His sister operates the restaurant and the old-timey meat market on the premises.

McLeod Farms also has an Orangeburg connection. The food safety director and product inventory manager is Diana Dibble Todd from Orangeburg. She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Dibble of Orangeburg and has been employed there for over eight years. Diana’s father and grandfather directed the destiny of Orangeburg’s beautiful Edisto Memorial Gardens for over 45 years while serving as superintendent of parks here.

All in all visiting the McLeod Farms Museum in McBee can provide an exhilarating experience in educating everyone on how far progress and mechanization has come over the last 100-plus years. Definitely a two-thumbs-up experience!

And don’t forget to stock up on the strawberries and peaches in season plus the homemade breads and fresh vegetables not to mention having peach cobbler topped with ice cream at the snack bar. Even the restaurant and old-timey meat market there are superb pleasures. Going to McLeod Farms is certainly an outstanding road trip experience.

Peaches are in season now until early September.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoYXJvc3RyaWJ1bmUuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZV9jNjFhOGEzNC1lNTljLTExZWItYWNkYS1iNzIwYjkyMzBlNDYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Galveston farmers supply Red Gold tomatoes for ketchup sauces,"Support local journalism

Renting a 2020 Chevrolet Equinox from someone in Wicker Park cost just $250 she said.

“We’re paying $50 for the campsite. Paying $900 for the car just seemed kind of silly” she said.

Rental car companies that sold hundreds of thousands of vehicles when the COVID-19 pandemic kept people home are now struggling to bring in enough new cars leading to higher-than-usual prices and in some destinations limited options. For travelers that means planning ahead or considering alternative options from renting a stranger’s vehicle through a car-sharing service to driving a U-Haul.

“I think if you’re desperate enough you’re going to try everything” said Neil Abrams president of car rental consulting firm Abrams Consulting Group.

When the pandemic hit and travelers canceled trips rental car companies rushed to get rid of idle vehicles. Hertz which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last May got rid of about 198000 vehicles in the second half of 2020 according to the company’s annual report. Avis Budget Group said its fleet was about 31% smaller at the end of 2020 than the year before.

Just as travel started to bounce back this spring semiconductor shortages affecting car manufacturers made it difficult for rental agencies to bring in enough cars to meet the new demand.

Avis Budget Group is getting new cars every day and can keep existing cars longer since they racked up fewer miles during the pandemic but semiconductor shortages are having an impact CEO Joseph Ferraro said during an earnings call Wednesday.

In the meantime price increases have been “extraordinary” Abrams said.

The average price for a four-day rental jumped from $260 in February to $321 in March and hit $388 during the final week of April according to data from travel search tool Hopper.

While the shortage is being felt nationwide certain destinations have seen especially large spikes.

Bozeman Montana was the most expensive city to rent a car in during the final week of April with an average price of $259 per day according to travel search website Kayak. That’s up 278% compared with 2019.

Hawaii which has a tougher time bringing in new cars has also seen steep increases. Four of the 10 most expensive cities for car rentals were in Hawaii all of which saw prices more than double compared with 2019 according to Kayak.

In Hawaii at least some tourists appear to have turned to U-Haul pickup trucks and cargo vans. In April Kaleo Alau president of the U-Haul Co. of Hawaii said there had been a “considerable uptick” in visitors renting smaller vehicles for a few days to a week.

Other travelers are trying out companies that let users rent someone’s personal car.

Unlike a traditional rental car agency Turo doesn’t have a central lot at the airport so travelers either need to be able to get to the car owner’s location or rent from someone willing to bring the car to them. Owners are required to clean and disinfect vehicles before each trip focusing on frequently touched spots like the steering wheel door handles and fuel cap according to Turo’s website.

On Turo car owners set their prices and how many miles are included in the daily rate. As at traditional rental car companies insurance costs extra.

Drivers with auto insurance should check with their provider before renting but with most major auto insurance providers liability insurance will cover a driver regardless of where they rent said Laura Adams an insurance expert at AutoInsurance.org. Drivers should check whether they have collision insurance and whether it covers rental cars or only their personal car she said.

However a car owner who rents out their vehicle through a car-sharing service can’t rely on personal auto insurance said Loretta Worters spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute. Car-sharing companies provide insurance options for owners.

Adams also cautioned against relying on coverage provided by a credit card when renting a vehicle which can be more limited. Turo’s website warns users credit card companies are unlikely to cover peer-to-peer rentals.

Renting to strangers brings risks. Natanya Abraham 28 of the Near West Side started renting out her personal car on Turo in November to earn extra income when she wasn’t using it and has since added a second vehicle she bought specifically to rent.

A couple of customers have missed return deadlines and one brought the car back with a damaged rear bumper. Abraham had agreed to let the customer pay her directly to keep the car for extra time rather than paying through Turo so Turo didn’t cover the repair.

But the income which requires relatively little hands-on management is worth it Abraham said. She estimates she earned $2300 in April nearly double a typical month.

“I absolutely see myself doing this long-term” she said.

According to a company survey 73% of people who list at least three cars on Turo and treat it as a small business say they have seen an increase in bookings since the start of 2021 and 70% plan to purchase another car to list on the app within a year.

Other car-sharing companies said they think the tight supply of rental cars is giving their business a boost.

Avail which has a pickup lot a shuttle ride away from O’Hare International Airport said bookings have grown roughly 150% so far this year compared with the same period last year. Some of that is due to launching in new cities over the past year and travel recovering. But Business Operations Director Alex David said he thinks the “massive lack of cars” in the rental industry is helping. Vehicle listings were also up 150% as of March.

Avail is designed to feel more like a traditional car rental than other car-sharing services. Renters pick up cars from airport lots where cars are inspected and cleaned before being used the company said. To keep prices and fees consistent across cars Avail not the car owner sets prices David said.

The advertised rates include liability and physical damage insurance from Allstate which is an investor in Avail. Drivers found at fault in an accident have a $500 deductible.

Getaround another car-sharing company said it has seen a significant increase in demand in recent months. Most people using Getaround which rents by the hour book cars for errands or short trips so car rental shortages are just one factor driving demand Pat Notti Getaround’s vice president of marketplace and operations said in a statement. Still recent growth has been particularly strong among travelers and business in Florida has doubled since last year Notti said.

At Getaround the quoted prices include liability collision and comprehensive insurance coverage but renters are responsible for up to $3000 in damages unless they buy a protection plan that reduces that fee.

Getaround cars have a device installed that lets users unlock the car with keys inside for a contact-free pickup. As at Turo renters need to be able to get to the vehicle’s location.

Car-sharing services account for a “tiny fraction” of the overall rental market but high prices and limited availability at traditional agencies could push more consumers to give them a try Abrams said.

Explore Accord remains relevant with Hybrid offering

Still those companies may also raise prices and see more limited availability particularly in destinations where rental cars are toughest to find said Jonathan Weinberg CEO of car rental website AutoSlash.

Both Avail and Getaround said they factor expected demand into prices but Avail has imposed price caps of $125 or $150 per day depending on the type of vehicle David said. To build its pool of cars the company is also offering a $100 incentive to people who list their vehicle on Avail for the first time.

Regardless of where travelers rent it makes sense to plan ahead this year Weinberg said. It’s also worth checking off-airport rental locations or rental agencies at a nearby airport in case the price difference is large enough to cover the cost of a taxi or Uber Weinberg said.

And It Smells Like Marijuana.,"For Caitlyn Hunter’s 21st birthday trip to Las Vegas last month her mother booked spots on a “Las Vegas Cannabis Tour” a business started during the pandemic that guides tourists through marijuana dispensaries in that city. Ms. Hunter of Houston Texas expected an educational afternoon where she her mother and grandmother could smoke marijuana together and her grandmother could learn about different marijuana strains that might help her with knee pain.

What they got instead Ms. Hunter said was a “crazy experience” involving a guide in 4-inch pink stilettos cracking dirty jokes a raucous van ride around the Las Vegas Strip (with a sober driver) the consumption of multiple cannabis products a shopping bag full of decorative bongs to use as flower vases back home and at one point a grandmother unable to speak without bursting into uncontrollable laughter. In short Ms. Hunter concluded a perfect celebration.

Sharon Erick had a different experience in Vegas. Vacationing there from Atlanta in May she and her small group of friends all in their 30s had to work to find outdoor dining where they weren’t overwhelmed by the odor of cannabis. “We had no idea weed had been legalized in Nevada” she said. “We smelled it everywhere.”

So did Judi Durand on a recent business trip in Arizona. She encountered the telltale aroma outside the Phoenix airport on the shuttle bus to the rental car area and even when she checked in to her lodging. “I didn’t expect to be in a family-friendly hotel in Chandler Ariz. and get a vague waft of marijuana in the room” said Ms. Durand who was visiting from her home in North Carolina (where the substance is not legal).“People are getting bolder with it” she said. “It’s not very fair.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjN25ld3MuY29tL2hhd2FpaS13aWxkbGlmZS1oYXJhc3NtZW50LWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24vMTA4OTYyMjkv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3bmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2hhd2FpaS13aWxkbGlmZS1oYXJhc3NtZW50LWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24vMTA4OTYyMjkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaii issues stern warning to tourists after TikTok video shows woman touching Hawaiian monk seal,"Hawaii urges residents to report incidents of ""wildlife harassment"" following outrage of viral TikTok video of woman touching Hawaiian monk seal.

Hawaii urges residents to report incidents of ""wildlife harassment"" following outrage of viral TikTok video of woman touching Hawaiian monk seal.

Hawaii urges residents to report incidents of ""wildlife harassment"" following outrage of viral TikTok video of woman touching Hawaiian monk seal.

KAUAI Hawaii -- A viral TikTok video of a tourist disturbing a Hawaiian monk seal is renewing calls for the state to educate visitors.

With the islands seeing more than 30000 travelers a day on average many residents say they're fed up with what they call acts of disrespect.

The Hawaii Tourism Authority and the Department of Land and Natural Resources have ongoing education campaigns including flyers signs ads and videos to tell tourists not to trespass or touch wild animals.

But while the vast majority of visitors are respectful of protected areas and wildlife some people are still not getting the message.

When the social media post of a Louisiana woman disturbing a sleeping monk seal on Kauai went viral earlier this week the backlash was swift.

""We were outraged to see the behavior of this individual. Obviously it's a federal offense"" said HTA Chief Brand Officer Kalani Ka'ana'ana.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says it's investigating the incident.

Kauai County Prosecuting Attorney Justin Kollar said: ""Harassing a monk seal in the manner depicted in the viral video is a Class-C felony under Hawaii law (statute HRS 195D-4.5) punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10000 fine. We have reached out to our federal partners at NOAA as well as our state partners at DOCARE and the matter remains under investigation.""

Ka'ana'ana said it works with state agencies airlines advertising agencies and travel companies to distribute information urging people to travel pono.

In 2019 HTA and DLNR released a series of Malama Hawaii public service announcements. DLNR spokesperson Dan Dennison said at the time the videos were offered on airlines' in-flight entertainment systems and on hotel closed-circuit TV systems in rotation in about 35000 hotel rooms around the state. It's unclear which airlines continue to offer the videos.

A Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson confirmed it offers the DLNR PSAs on its in-flight systems. The carrier also has a ""Travel Pono"" educational program.

The issue Ka'ana'ana says is travelers are not mandated to watch any PSAs. Although they're available on airlines hotels even on ads online and on social media unless you're looking for them you won't know they're there.

""We cannot control all the bad apples but we're doing everything that we can to make sure that the message about respectfully viewing wildlife is in compliance with the law and also just supporting what's pono and what's right"" he said. ""One of the hurdles that we are facing is there's no mandatory landing video that the state requires but it's something that is available to visitors on the infotainment systems.""

""Maybe watching a video is not enough"" said state Senator Bennette Misalucha vice-chair of the Committee on Energy Economic Development and Tourism. She supported a Senate resolution last session to require travelers to sign an official document acknowledging certain rules similar to the Department of Agriculture form required on all flights.

""Having tourists do a pledge and that pledge will allow them to respect our cultural values as well as making sure that they're aware of the fragility of our surroundings"" she said.

The Senate resolution failed to pass the House but she says the latest wildlife violation could renew interest.

""Is that something that we can consider? I think the devil will be in the details"" she said.

As for the monk seal violation generating all the backlash Stefanie Gutierrez NOAA Pacific Islands Regional Office spokesperson sent this statement to KITV-4: ""We are aware of the video and have referred it to the NOAA Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement. OLE is actively investigating the incident. Anyone with information should contact the NOAA OLE hotline at (800) 853-1964.

Hawaiian monk seals are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act as well as Hawaii Revised Statute 195D. There are only about 1400 estimated alive today. Actions that harass harm pursue capture injure or kill the animals can be punishable through fines or jail time.

To view protected monk seals responsibly follow the NOAA Guidelines for Viewing Marine Wildlife in Hawai'i. Keep a safe respectful distance of 50 feet away from seals and 150 feet away from mother seals with pups. Stay behind any barriers or signs and follow the ""rule of thumb"" to determine how much space to give monk seals. Make a ""thumbs-up"" gesture extend your arm out straight in front of you and turn your thumb parallel to the ground. If your thumb covers the entire seal you are far enough away.""

Anyone who spots a seal or witnesses a human-seal interaction call the NOAA Marine Wildlife Hotline at (888) 256-9840.

CNT is Ecuador's state-run telecommunication carrier that offers fixed-line phone service mobile satellite TV and internet connectivity.

Starting this week the CNT website began displaying an alert warning that they suffered an attack and that customer care and online payment are no longer accessible.

Announcement on the website about the cyberattack

""Today July 16 2021 the National Telecommunications Corporation CNT EP filed a complaint with the State Attorney General's Office for the crime of “attack on computer systems ""so that the preliminary investigation is carried out and the responsible"" read the alert translated into English.

""This attack affected the care processes in our Integrated Service Centers and Contact Center; In this regard we indicate to our users that their services will not be suspended for non-payment.""

CNT suffers RansomEXX ransomware attack

While CNT has not officially stated that they suffered a ransomware attack BleepingComputer has learned that the attack was conducted by a ransomware operation known as RansomEXX.

Security researcher Germán Fernández shared with BleepingComputer a hidden link to the group's data leak site that warns CNT that the gang would leak data stolen during the attack if CNT did not pay a ransom.

""Your time is LIMITED!

When this time will come to end there are two ways: we will RAISE the ransom amount or PUBLISH your files.

You will lose the opportunity to contact us after the data PUBLICATION.

If you REALLY WANT to prevent data leak contact us RIGHT NOW. We have downloaded 190GB+ of your files and we are ready to publish it."" - RansomEXX.

Hidden RansomEXX data leak page for CNT

This page is currently hidden from the public and can only be accessed via the direct link. These hidden pages are commonly included in ransom notes to prove that a ransomware operation stole data during an attack.

In CNT's press statement the company states that corporate and customer data are secure and have not been exposed.

However the RansomEXX gang claims to have stolen 190 GB of data and shared screenshots of some of the documents on the hidden data leak page.

The screenshots seen by BleepingComputer include contact lists contracts and support logs.

The ransomware operation originally launched under the name Defray in 2018 but became more active in June 2020 when it rebranded as RansomEXX and began to target large corporate entities.

Like other ransomware gangs RansomEXX will compromise a network through purchased credentials brute-forced RDP servers or by utilizing exploits.

Once they gain access to a network they will quietly spread throughout the network while stealing unencrypted files to be used for extortion attempts.

After gaining access to an administrator password they deploy the ransomware on the network and encrypt all of its devices.

As is becoming common among ransomware operations RansomEXX created a Linux version to ensure they can target all critical servers and virtual machines.

The RansomEXX gang's has a history of high-profile attacks including Brazil's government networks Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Konica Minolta IPG Photonics and Tyler Technologies.

BleepingComputer has contacted CNT with further questions but has not received a response at this time.",,,,,,,,,
TSN,Tyson Foods,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc21vZy5jb20vdHlzb24tZm9vZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Foods,"Background

Tyson Foods is one of the world’s four largest meat producers producing approximately 20 percent of U.S. beef pork and chicken according to the company’s website. [1] [2]

Founded in 1935 and headquartered in Springdale Arkansas Tyson’s business divisions include breeding raising and processing of chickens cows and pigs and the production of frozen and refrigerated food products. [3]

In Tyson’s 2020 annual report the company recorded 139000 employees and $43.2 billion in sales. During the same period it recorded the capacity to slaughter 8 million cows 24 million pigs and 2 billion chickens at 204 US-based slaughter facilities owned or leased by Tyson. [4]

Since 2019 Tyson has been launching plant-based products and investing in start-ups developing meat and seafood alternatives. [5] [6]

Environmental organizations GRAIN and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) estimated in a 2018 report that Tyson’s total yearly emissions total 118.1 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). [7]

Between 2000 and 2020 Tyson Foods spent $25 million on lobbying and $3.2 million on donations to federal political candidates. During the same period Tyson frequently lobbied the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on climate-related and environmental topics issuing 114 quarterly lobbying reports filed with the Secretary of the Senate’s Office of Public Records (SOPR). [8]

As of 2021 Tyson Foods has been fined more than $58 million for environmental-related violations since 2000 according to data from the Good Jobs First non-profit organisation. [9]

Stance on Climate Change

In 2021 Tyson announced a goal of achieving net-zero deforestation by 2030 and net-zero emissions including scopes 1 2 and 3 by 2050. The company stated that its emissions reduction target had been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) a partnership between CDP the United Nations Global Compact World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). [10] [11]

The company plans to achieve its net zero goal by transitioning to 50 percent renewable energy across Tyson’s U.S. operations by 2030 encouraging grain farmers to adopt more efficient fertilizer practices and facilitating more sustainable beef production through improved grazing management. [10] [12] [13]

In 2017 Tyson Foods announced plans to reduce the company’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30 percent from 2016-2030. The company’s climate target was accepted by the SBTi in 2018. In its 2019 sustainability report it said it was “the first U.S. protein company in the food and beverage sector to receive such an approval.” [14] [15]

At the time Tyson’s climate targets included “setting facility-level energy and emissions targets and investing in a more fuel-efficient fleet.” [16]

In 2017 Tyson’s then-CEO Tom Hayes stated that the company was “committed to helping to create a more sustainable food system which involves cleaning up its factory farms and investing in more plant-based proteins.” [17]

Tyson first referred to climate change in its 2005 sustainability report stating that “greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are important due to their potential impact on the global climate.” In 2004 the company joined Climate RESOLVE an emissions reduction program developed by the Business Roundtable which represents U.S. CEOs. The same year it became an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) “Climate Leaders Partner” a voluntary program to “develop an aggressive corporate-wide GHG reduction goal to be achieved over 5 to 10 years.” [18] [19]

Livestock Emissions

The company first reported its emissions in 2007 stating that its GHG emissions during the calendar year 2004 were 5.53 million metric tonnes (Mt) referring to its scope 1 and 2 emissions. It described these as comprising “data related to facility fuel and electricity usage transportation fuels refrigeration usage and anaerobic biogas production.” [20]

In Tyson’s 2020 sustainability report the company reported 6.174 Mt CO2e in scope 1 and 2 emissions and said it was “performing at or above target” with regard to reducing its emissions by 30 percent by 2030. In its 2019 sustainability report the company reported 5.73 Mt CO2e in scope 1 and 2 emissions noting that their scope 1 emissions increased from 2018 to 2019 due to “the acquisition of new facilities.” The company did not explain the increase in emissions from 2019 to 2020. [21] [15]

According to Tyson’s 2017 sustainability report 90 percent of the company’s emissions come from its supply chain and are not owned by the company known as scope 3 emissions. [14]

In contrast to Tyson’s estimates environmental organisations GRAIN and IATP estimated in 2018 that Tyson’s total yearly emissions are 118.1 Mt CO2e using the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM) 2.0 which covers scopes 1–3 emissions. [7]

Scope 1 and 2 emissions stem from direct activities of an organisation or activities under their control and from the production of energy used by the organisation. Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions from a company’s activities originating from sources it does not own or control including emissions caused by land use land-use change and farms that supply meat companies. [22] [23]

According to a 2021 study by New York University researchers meat companies “emphasize mitigating energy use with limited focus on emissions (e.g. methane) from animal and land management and land-use change which make the biggest warming contributions in the agricultural sector” noting that “the majority of […] Tyson’s emissions are the result of land-use changes for feed production in places like the Brazilian Amazon.” [8]

Until 2017 the company refused to disclose information to the climate charity CDP stating that it had decided to communicate emissions data “through alternative but equally effective means” and prefered “to continue working with EPA regarding GHG inventory information because of the Agency’s expertise and long-term management responsibility for climate change.” In 2021 CPD gave Tyson scores of C and B- for their disclosure regarding “Forests” and “Climate Change” respectively. [24] [25]

In 2009 an investment research firm claimed that Tyson produces substantial climate-heating methane emissions. Tyson rejected this claim writing in their 2009 annual report that “manure management accounted for [only] 4.7 percent of N2O [nitrous oxide] and 7.5 percent of CH4 [methane] emissions in the U.S. during the 2007 reporting year” according to EPA figures. [24]

Key Narratives

Tyson Foods promotes a number of narratives to justify its business model. Find out more about how the meat industry is climate-washing its activities in our investigation. And you can read counter-arguments and criticisms of these narratives in our factsheet.

‘Animal agriculture isn’t a serious driver of climate change’

‘Our feed comes from responsible sources’

In Tyson’s 2020 sustainability report the company announced that its international expansion “has resulted in the need to reassess the risk of deforestation across our operations and supply chain.” According to Tyson an assessment by Proforest a sustainability nonprofit focused on the agricultural sector concluded that “94% of our land footprint is at no-to-low risk of being associated with deforestation and “approximately 3% is at medium-to-high risk” while “the sourcing origin could not be identified for the other 3%.” [21]

In 2020 Tyson announced it was partnering with the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) to purchase credits for soybean meal that “will be used to feed chickens in our supply chain in regions that typically source from high risk areas” and with the non-profit organisation Proforest to conduct a deforestation risk assessment. [26]

The RTRS has come under criticism however with a 2021 Greenpeace report describing the program’s claims of supporting responsible feed production as “misleading allowing companies a green image even if they are still contributing to human rights abuses and/or the destruction of nature.” It noted that “the vast majority of RTRS soya sales are based on credits” and that credit buyers “thus might not know whether the producers of the actual products they are buying are engaging in deforestation or other ecosystem destruction.” [27]

‘Grazing supports biodiversity’

In 2020 Tyson announced plans to start sourcing cattle from a verification program titled “BeefCARE” which includes “practices such as having a cattle grazing management plan to help promote vegetative growth and diversity.” [28]

The US-based environmental group the Center for Biological Diversity states: “The ecological costs of livestock grazing exceed that of any other western land use.” A 2020 study by researchers from the University of Alberta warned that scaling up livestock grazing to meet future food demand could threaten the biodiversity of herbivores and pollinators worldwide. [29] [30]

‘Meat is needed for a healthy diet and to feed the world’

‘Meat is needed to feed the world’s growing population’

As part of the Coalition for Global Protein an initiative launched by Tyson the company co-produced a video that states: “Research shows that the world isn’t getting enough [protein] and there are life-long consequences. That’s today. The global population is growing fast. If we can’t meet the protein demand of today it will take substantial changes to meet the demand of the future. With a challenge this big we can’t just look to one solution. A challenge this big demands we consider every option.” At this point the video displays a list of foods including chicken tofu pork seeds beef legumes and eggs. [31]

Tyson also claims during the video that inhabitants of Africa South America Asia and Europe are not meeting the dietary requirement of 52g of protein per day.

Unlike Tyson’s estimates the latest protein supply figures from FAO for 2013 recorded average protein consumption of 69.1g per capita per day in Africa 77.57g in Asia 86.09g in South America and 102.06g in Europe. The World Resources Institute (WRI) a sustainable development organisation argues that overconsumption of protein is already occurring in all of the world’s regions and particularly in wealthy countries. [32] [33]

‘Meat is an exceptional source of nutrients’

The company states that “nutritional fads come and go but most nutritionists agree that protein is an essential part of a well-balanced diet” and describes meat as “an important part of a healthy diet providing essential nutrients including amino acids vitamins and minerals.” [34] [35]

Nutrition associations including the British Nutrition Foundation approve of meat-free diets however. According to the American Dietetic Association “appropriately planned vegetarian diets including total vegetarian or vegan diets are healthful nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.” [36] [37]

‘Innovations in animal agriculture will tackle climate change’

‘We are producing less emissions-intensive meat’

Tyson reported that it had reduced its GHG emissions intensity from 190kg of CO2e emitted for every 1000 pounds of product produced in 2018 to 180kg in 2019. [15]

Environmental organizations GRAIN and IATP argue that “arguments for emissions intensity reduction in the absence of targets to reduce the livestock sector’s total emissions are dangerous” because they allow a company’s absolute emissions to continue increasing. The organizations also argue “that the large gains in ‘efficiency’ realised by industrial farming in the twentieth century will be hard to repeat without major ecological social and health impacts.” [7]

‘New grazing techniques can sequester carbon’

In 2020 Tyson announced plans to start sourcing cattle from a verification program titled “BeefCARE” designed to support carbon sequestration through a “cattle grazing management plan.” [28]

Environmental scientists from the University of Oxford have however criticised the idea of using cattle grazing to capture carbon claiming that this can only offset 20-60 percent of annual average emissions from grazing ruminants concluding that “grass-fed cattle remain net contributors to warming.” [38]

‘Technological innovations will cut emissions’

As part of Tyson’s goal to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2030 the company is conducting a pilot program to develop more sustainably-grown crops through the use of “cloud-based” agricultural technologies and transitioning to “renewable fuels like biogas from [Tyson’s] wastewater treatment operations.” [15] [39]

The arguments echo those of the pesticides industry which claims that so-called precision agriculture can be a climate solution. Critics argue they are unlikely to be sufficiently effective and can cause other problems.

Lobbying

According to a 2021 study by New York University researchers Tyson has frequently lobbied the EPA and U.S. Congress on climate-related and environmental issues since 2000 issuing 114 quarterly lobbying reports filed with the Secretary of the Senate’s Office of Public Records (SOPR) as well as contributing $3.2 million to political campaigns since 2000. The study pointed out that “taken as a share of each company’s total revenue over that period Tyson has spent double what [U.S. oil giant] Exxon has on political campaigns and 33% more on lobbying.” [8]

According to OpenSecrets.org Tyson spent $27.88 million on lobbying between 1998 and 2020. During the same period Tyson lobbied the following agencies: [40] [41]

Commodity Futures Trading Commission

Dept of Agriculture

Dept of Commerce

In 2018 Tyson contributed $299305 to federal candidates 62 percent to Republicans and 38 percent to Democrats including: [43]

In 2019 the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association an umbrella organisation Tyson is a member of successfully lobbied to disband a Maryland state committee focused on studying the carbon intensity of different foods including beef and dairy arguing that the committee was “operating with a political agenda.” [44]

In 2009 Tyson lobbied against the Waxman-Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 a climate bill approved by the House of Representatives that would have established a cap-and-trade system but failed in the Senate in 2010. According to a 2021 study by New York University researchers Tyson argued that “the bill would increase food and feed prices and reduce the international competitiveness of their businesses and successfully secured provisions that set the cap for agriculture operations lower than for other industries.” [8]

Affiliations

Tyson is a member of the North American Meat Institute a sponsor of the Animal Agriculture Alliance’s 2013 “College Aggies Online” program designed to teach college students how to advocate for the livestock sector and has co-sponsored the National Pork Producers Council’s PorkPAC since 1987. [45] [46]

In 2021 Tyson stated that its emissions reduction target had been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) a partnership between CDP the United Nations Global Compact World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It also stated that the company was collaborating with the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs and the International Poultry Welfare Alliance. [10] [11]

Tyson is a “partner” of the World Economic Forum. During the 2020 WEF meeting in Davos Switzerland the company launched the Coalition for Global Protein to “unite stakeholders across the food and agriculture sector to identify and implement new and creative solutions to sustainably feed the world’s growing population.” [47] [48]

The frozen fully cooked chicken products were produced between December 26 2020 and April 13 2021. The products that are subject to recall are listed here. View the labels here.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. P-7089” on the product bag or inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped nationwide to retailers and institutions including hospitals nursing facilities restaurants schools and Department of Defense locations.

On June 9 2021 FSIS was notified of two persons ill with listeriosis. Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health partners FSIS determined there is evidence linking the Listeria monocytogenes illnesses to precooked chicken produced at Tyson Foods Inc. The epidemiologic investigation identified three listeriosis illnesses including one death between April 6 2021 and June 5 2021. During routine sample collection FSIS collected two precooked chicken samples from two establishments that are closely related genetically to Listeria monocytogenes from ill people. One of the samples was collected at Tyson Foods Inc. FSIS is continuing to work with federal and state public health partners to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to these products.

Additional information on the investigation may be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumer and institutional freezers. Consumers should not eat these products. Institutions should not serve these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Faux fish is angling to be the next big thing in alternative protein. Alt-meat has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years as consumers have started to change what they eat for a variety of reasons ranging from concerns over climate change and sustainability to animal welfare and personal health benefits. That has led to a proliferation of products from companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Mea t across grocery stores and restaurants while traditional meat companies like Tyson Foods  Perdue Farms and Hormel are launching new entrants in the category. U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods grew 27% in 2020 bringing the total market to roughly $7 billion according to data from the Plant-Based Foods Association (PBFA) and the Good Food Institute (GFI). The global market is forecasted to grow to $450 billion by 2040 according to consulting firm Kearney which would represent roughly a quarter of the broader $1.8 trillion meat market. The market for plant-based products has largely been driven by faux milk and meat which make up 35% and 20% respectively of the total sales in the category according to GFI. Plant-based meat sales grew 45% to $1.4 billon in 2020 while plant-based milk sales grew 20% to $2.5 billion. The market for plant-based fish on the other hand has been slower to develop. While U.S. sales grew 23% in 2020 it only accounted for $12 million according to GFI and PBFA. That represents 0.1% of the entire U.S. seafood market compared to sales of plant-based meat making up 1.4% of U.S. meat sales. ""Conventional seafood really has a health halo around it; it's seen as a very healthy food that doctors often tell patients to consume more of"" Marika Azoff corporate engagement specialist at GFI said as to why alternative fish products may have lagged behind. ""The environmental impacts aren't as straightforward as they are with beef and dairy – they are a little bit more complex and kind of harder for the general public to grasp.""

Investing in faux fish

However several companies are looking to change that in an attempt to take a piece of the more than $15 billion U.S. seafood market. There were 83 companies globally producing alternative seafood products as of June 2021 according to GFI with 65 of them focusing on plant-based products. In comparison there were only 29 companies producing alternative seafood products in 2017. In 2020 more than $80 million was invested in alternative seafood companies — four times the amount invested in 2019 according to GFI.

Gathered Foods which produces plant-based seafood brand Good Catch raised a $32 million Series B funding round in January 2020 from investors including Lightlife Foods parent company Greenleaf Foods and 301 Inc. the venture arm of General Mills . BlueNalu which is focused on cultured seafood or fish produced directly from cells raised $60 million in convertible note financing in January 2021 a record deal for an alternative seafood company. To date the two giants of alternative meat products have not yet made an entry in alternative fish. Impossible Foods said in 2019 that it was working on a plant-based fish recipe but it has yet to release any products. Beyond Meat has previously stated it was focused on beef poultry and pork. ""There's no reason that alterative seafood can't or won't catch up to the other types of alternative proteins"" said Azoff. ""There is not a dominate company in plant-based seafood the way the meat and dairy categories have but we're seeing potential for that to change soon.""

Traditional seafood companies are also making their own investments in alternative fish. In September 2020 Nestlé launched Vuna a plant-based tuna alternative that is the company's first foray into plant-based seafood citing statistics that 90% of global fish stocks are now depleted or close to depletion. Thai Union Group which owns brands like Chicken of the Sea said it will launch a plant-based shrimp product by the end of this year joining its other plant-based fish and crab products already available. Tyson Ventures the venture capital arm of Tyson Foods invested in plant-based shellfish company New Wave Foods in September 2019 and joined its $18 million Series A funding round that closed in January. Bumble Bee Foods signed a joint venture with Good Catch in March 2020.

Growing concerns about the fishing industry

Virginia-based Van Cleve Seafood Company which sold traditional seafood for more than 20 years started solely producing plant-based seafood products under the label The Plant Based Seafood Co. citing issues with the fishing industry such as child labor overfishing and mislabeling. ""We wanted to do something about it and we thought if not us then who?"" Plant Based Seafood Co. chief executive officer Monica Talbert told CNBC's Kate Rogers. ""That's when we made the decision we were going to do something that would create change."" The Plant Based Seafood Co. has products like crab cakes made from artichokes and scallops and shrimp made from vegetable root starch all of which are sold out online. Concerns about the fishing industry further highlighted in the recent Netflix documentary ""Seaspriacy"" that advocates for the end of fish consumption is viewed as a driver for consumers to switch to plant-based products. A poll of 2500 Americans from Kelton Global found that reducing plastic waste in the ocean saving ocean habitats and reducing harm towards marine animals would be reasons consumers would buy plant-based fish over wild-caught fish. Gavin Gibbons vice president of communications at the National Fisheries Institute a trade group representing the fishing industry said that the organization and its member companies view plant-based products a as ""very likely part of the future of feeding a growing planet."" ""They're technologically impressive and can and should be able to coexist with real seafood as long as they're labeled accurately"" Gibbons said noting that some of NFI's member companies have made investments into alternative seafood. However Gibbons said presenting alternative seafood as either nutritionally superior to real fish or better for sustainability reasons would be wrong in his view. ""The USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans highlight that consumers don't eat nearly enough seafood and it is unarguably the healthiest animal protein on the planet"" he said. ""Few public health professionals would recommend imitation seafood over the real thing. They might make that recommendation for other products but not seafood. From that perspective these plant-based amalgams aren't really alternatives they're simply imitations."" Gibbons said that 51% of the seafood consumers eat is farmed and about 75% of commercially important marine fish stocks as stated and monitored by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are fished within biologically sustainable levels. ""There's a lot of hyperbole associated with claims about empty oceans and if that's being used to market imitation products then it's disingenuous"" Gibbons said. There is one big obstacle that could stand in the way of fake fish: taste. While 43% of respondents to that Kelton poll said they would consider purchasing alternative seafood in the future and most cited flavor as the most important factor in driving consumption 38% said they anticipate disliking the taste of alternative fish and 27% said they anticipate disliking the texture. Twenty-seven percent said they have never seen plant-based seafood at a grocery store. ""First and foremost consumers are going to purchase alternative seafood if it tastes good"" Azoff said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGFsa2J1c2luZXNzLm5ldC8yMDIxLzA3L3NvbGFyLWEtdmlhYmxlLW9wdGlvbi10by1wb3dlci1hcmthbnNhcy1wb3VsdHJ5LWZhcm1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar a viable option to power Arkansas poultry farms,"Springdale native Millard Berry had an idea that would transform the agriculture industry in the Natural State. In 1893 he bought an incubator to raise chicks. Four years later he was a founding member of the Arkansas Poultry Association and started the poultry industry in Arkansas one that pumps billions of dollars into the state’s economy and produces thousands of jobs each year according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas.

To support this expensive industry scientists are constantly finding ways to reduce costs. Solar energy net metering and grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have benefited a Cleveland County poultry grower said Yi Liang associate professor-biological and agricultural engineering.

“Poultry farming is an energy-intensive business with gas and electricity as major expenses” said Liang who works as part of the Center of Excellence for Poultry Science.

Liang looked at results from a solar installation by Stephen Boyd who operates a six-broiler house farm in Cleveland County. The farm has been growing during its 10 years in operation with varying size houses built in different years.

“One thing in common between houses is that electricity consumption increased dramatically over the years” Liang said. “This increased electric demand is due to cooling requirements for modern broilers raised to heavy weights due to market demand.”

Liang said Arkansas provides an advantage for those who produce their own energy through its “net metering” policy in which excess electricity generated by a consumer can be credited and applied during periods of peak electricity usage.

‘It Just Made Sense’

The decision to go solar wasn’t made impulsively Boyd said. His interest was piqued when he picked up information from a vendor at an Arkansas Farm Bureau convention. The following year there were more vendors more information and more interest. In 2020 he decided it was time to get some bids. Delta Solar of Little Rock won the contract.

“I wanted to be energy independent and be a good steward of natural resources” Boyd said. “It was pretty expensive but I was able to apply for a REAP grant and use the tax benefits that go with the system. It just made sense to me.”

Arkansas is one of the top poultry producing states each year. The most common poultry in Arkansas are chickens and turkeys. Chickens that are raised for meat are called broilers and chickens raised for their eggs are laying hens.

Arkansas is home to numerous poultry companies and businesses that support poultry companies and poultry farmers. Most Arkansas chicken and poultry farmers grow birds on contract for poultry companies such as Tyson Foods or Peco Foods according to the Arkansas Farm Bureau. Butterball is a turkey processing operator with plants and farmers in the state.

The Natural State ranks second in broiler production with 7.42 billion pounds produced with a value of $3.6 billion according to the USDA. The broiler industry generated $28.3 billion in the U.S. during 2019.

REAP is the USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program which provides guaranteed loan financing and grant funding to agricultural producers and rural small businesses. The Boyd Family Farm had 460 solar panels installed on less than 1 acre of land and went online “right around Thanksgiving and I think the first full month was December” Boyd said. “It didn’t produce a tremendous amount of energy in that month due to the day length.”

However “since that first month I have not paid for more than the minimum for any bill” he said. “My biggest bill for five meters combined was $104 and change.”

The system is expected to save $25000 a year on electricity bills.

“That’s more than 90% of the farm’s annual electricity expenditure” Liang said.

Power Payoff

And while installing solar isn’t cheap being able to use a USDA REAP grant and tax incentives will help Boyd recoup his costs within two to four years.

“Under the Arkansas net-metering rules any power that is put back onto the electric grid is credited against your other meters on a ‘1-to-1’ basis” said Doug Hutchings CEO of Delta Solar. “This means that the energy you produce is valued at exactly what you would be paying for it. Note that farms as commercial entities will be paying less for power than residential users so it is critical to accurately model the true electric rate that a farmer is paying to accurately model the long-term savings.”

With the solar energy system’s 25-year warranty “Boyd will earn free electricity for at least 20 years” Liang said.

“The investment in solar is making financial sense now and adds tremendous values to his own farm business no matter whether he sells the farm several years from now or passes it along to the next generations” Liang said. “A solar energy system has become more competitive due to the continuous drop of system prices and improvement on energy conversion efficiency with additional benefits to reduce greenhouse gases.”

Although his initial investment wasn’t inexpensive Boyd believes the system adds value to the farm and any future buyer of the farm will have the energy savings to look forward to. In addition to solar Boyd made other changes on his farm changing to LED lights and tube heating in the poultry houses to increase efficiency of gas and electricity.

Hutchings said there are important considerations for an agriculture operation that wants to go solar.

“Farms can have complicated ownership structures with electric meters spanning multiple farming entities” he said. “Policy in Arkansas enables you to build a central solar array behind a single meter and use it to offset unlimited additional meters but they have to be under ‘common ownership.’”

Solar & Agri Intersection

Hutchings said farm setups differ from residential systems in several ways.

“Typically you will need to upgrade the transformers or install new utility infrastructure to accommodate a solar array that is offsetting multiple meters” he said. “Talking with the utility early on in the process is critical to making sure that the local grid can handle the solar generated electricity in times when it is producing more than you consume. This is particularly important for seasonal users like grain bins or poultry producers who have periods of high usage followed by lower usage.”

Another important consideration is solar panel placement.

“As a rule of thumb you are looking at somewhere between three to five acres of land per megawatt of solar panels” Hutchings said. “It is highly site dependent with an ideal location having flat ground with no shading from trees or buildings and no rocks is a big plus.

“Farms that often check all of these boxes make an ideal site to deploy solar” he said. “The intersection of solar and agriculture is really interesting in Arkansas at the moment. Most people think solar is expensive and only done for environmental reasons but we are regularly seeing projects provide 10%-18% internal rates of return and produce upwards of $20000 per acre in value from electric cost offset.”

Boyd said a group of growers like himself were meeting once a month until the pandemic started.

“We talked about a range of things in our industry including what we did to set the houses up and they were very interested” he said. “I’m trying to get the group back together and get them back looking at it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIwLXBvbGwtZXJyb3JzLzIwMjEvMDcvMTgvOGQ2YTk4MzgtZTdkZi0xMWViLWJhNWQtNTVkM2I1ZmZjYWYxX3N0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2020 presidential polls suffered worst performance in decades report says,Public opinion polls in the 2020 presidential election suffered from errors of “unusual magnitude” the highest in 40 years for surveys estimating the national popular vote and in at least 20 years for state-level polls according to a study conducted by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR).

They have been around for centuries and will probably be here for a long time. Here we take a look at the top 10 largest banks in the world. The ranking is based on data from S&P Global Intelligence which publishes a report on global banking and financial services every year ranking the world’s 100 largest banks based on total assets.

Ranked: Top 10 largest banks

American banks dominated the ranking for decades. But the emergence of China as a global economic powerhouse has helped many Chinese banks earn a place among the largest in the world. Out of the top 10 largest banks four are from China two from the US and two from France.

The S&P Global Market Intelligence’s ranking is based on total reported assets. It’s not adjusted for different accounting practices. The US banks use US GAAP method while banks in most other countries use the IFRS. If American banks reported under the IFRS method JPMorgan Chase would be the fourth biggest bank instead of sixth.

10- Credit Agricole

The second largest banking behemoth in France has total assets of $2117 billion. It has been ranked as one of the world’s most sustainable companies. Founded in 1894 Credit Agricole has a history of providing banking and other financial services to farmers. It also happens to be the world’s largest cooperative financial institution.

9- Bank of America

Personal finance guru Ramit Sethi has been a vocal critic of the Bank of America calling it “one of the worst banks on the planet.” But it is one of the world’s largest banks with total assets of $2281 billion. With a market value of $325 billion it’s the world’s third largest bank by market capitalization. The company strengthened its investment banking arm by acquiring Merrill Lynch in 2008.

8- BNP Paribas

The largest bank in France was created in 2000 following the merger of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Paribas. It has $2357 billion of assets under management. BNP Paris has more than 40 million customers in 75 countries across the globe.

Dahle WCI Founder

Physician mortgage loans have been around since before I started writing this blog in 2011. All of the doctor mortgage lenders on our recommended list will lend to physicians and most will lend to dentists. Other professionals such as CRNAs attorneys veterinarians pharmacists podiatrists optometrists and even accountants often qualify as well.

What Is a Physician Mortgage Loan?

While some definitions differ my definition of a doctor mortgage loan is one that:

Does not charge PMI despite having a down payment of less than 20%

Will close with a signed employment contract rather than pay stubs

Only considers the payments of student loans (not the entire loan burden)

Is not an FHA or VA loan

Often these loans are “portfolio loans” (i.e. are kept in house at the bank that issued them). These lenders will also have experience working with self-employed (1099/independent contractor) doctors—which adds a level of complexity to getting a mortgage.

As a general rule the rates and fees on these loans can be slightly higher than what you can get with a 20% down conventional mortgage. That's the price you pay for the convenience of not having to meet conventional mortgage rules and for being able to use your down payment money to pay off student loans max out retirement accounts or something else.

The terms are highly variable and include 30-year fixed 15-year fixed 5/1 ARMs 7/1 ARMs and 10/1 ARMs. As a general rule I'm a big fan of a 15-year fixed mortgage but there are certainly other circumstances that merit using other types of mortgages. For example if you know you will sell in 7 years a 7/1 ARM is a fixed mortgage for you. Others prefer a 30-year amortization so paying it off in 10 or 15 is optional not mandatory.

In today's post I wanted to discuss the real-life experiences of doctors who have shopped for a doctor mortgage in the last year or so. So I sent out an email to thousands of my readers and received a couple of hundred responses. Don't worry not all will be included in this post but it will be enough to provide a good sample of what I received.

Bear in mind that a lot of the variation in interest rates you will see below is explained by the fact that we are looking at people who took out mortgages between 2017-2019. These are not the same rates available to you today.

This can be an input to help you understand if a physician mortgage would be a good idea for you.

Doctor Mortgage Experiences from WCI Readers

Read Up and Shop Around

Lance went to Fulton Bank for his physician mortgage loan because he didn't have a down payment and a friend had a good experience there. He put 0% down and ended up with a rate of 3.75%. He advises “read up and shop around.”

10% Down Payment

Richard checked out US Bank and Fairway Mortgage and ended up with US Bank because “They were very helpful throughout and offered the best interest rate by quite a bit.” He put 10% down for a rate of 4.375%. That was a lot better than he could get with any other mortgage given the lack of a 20% down payment.

Closing Four Months Before Contract Start Date

Luke took a look at Arvest and US Bank and chose Arvest “because they allow closing up to 4 months before contract start date and they offer 100% financing up to a certain house price. I have been very happy with my choice to go with Arvest. Previously used Suntrust for my current home 5 years ago and there was a bit more ‘red tape' in getting things finalized compared to Arvest.” 0% down 4.25%. He went with a physician loan because he is “just finishing residency and do not have enough liquid cash for a conventional down payment.”

Low Down Payment on an Expensive Home

Alexander bought in 2017 using a physician mortgage in order to only put 10% down on a $930K home a year out of fellowship in a high COLA. Rate was 3.99% with Suntrust the lowest rate he found.

“Pushed Off to Someone Else”

Michael got a doctor's loan because he wanted to use his saved money for home improvements. He went with BMO Harris but was disappointed because the rate (4.75% with 5% down) ended up being 0.75% higher than the original quote and the agent “pushed me off to someone else in a different state who was not good at communicating or coordinating with the title company so we did not meet our deadline.” He wishes he would have used a 10-year ARM instead of the 15-year fixed he got.

Used a Local Credit Union

Andy checked out many options in Michigan but ended up with a local credit union because he got better rates 0% down and a 3% checking account up to $30000. He ended up with a 4.24% 10/1 ARM because he plans to pay it off in less than 10 years.

Make the Lenders Compete for Your Business

Lindsey looked at Citizens One and SunTrust and ended up putting 11% down with Citizens One to get a 3.375% 15-year mortgage. She advises “Make the lenders compete for your business. My husband and I have credit scores in the 800s so all the banks wanted our business. Be creative and don’t just focus on interest rates. Ask for credits at closing too.”

Days of 0% Down Gone for Jumbos

Rishi put 10% down to get a 4.375% interest rate on a jumbo loan with Citizens Bank. He says “make sure you have enough money saved prior to looking. Sounds obvious but you need more than just an attending contract before you get approved. The days of 0% down are almost gone definitely unavailable for jumbo loans.”

Two Doctor Loans in Three Years

Benjamin has done this twice once in 2014 (Key Bank 10% down 30-year fixed 3.675%) and once in 2017 (Fifth Third Bank 10% down 30-year fixed 4.125%).

Locked It in Instead of Saving Up a Down Payment

Adam went with the physician mortgage because he found the rates to be very competitive with conventional mortgages but only had to put 5% down. He says “I could have saved up a bit more for a higher down payment but rates were rising at the time so I wanted to lock it in quickly. Overall it's been a good experience.” He looked at US Bank and PNC Bank before going with Huntington Bank with a 3.325% 7/1 ARM.

A 5/1 ARM

Anton chose the physician loan because he didn't have a down payment. He chose Simmons Bank over Bank of America put down 5% and got a 5/1 ARM at 4.25%. He recommends looking for the best interest rate and locking it in.

Just Rent a Cautionary Tale

Ashmi closed on her doctor loan (5% down 3.75%) with Bank of America after checking out Wells Fargo and Union Bank. She says “I was in the middle of finishing fellowship moving preparing for my new job and also studying for my specialty boards. In retrospect I don’t think I was in the right mindset to make all these decisions. Waiting 3-6 months until we had the 10% down payment (and interest rates relatively low still) would have been a much better deal. Or waiting 1-2 years to have the full 20% down.

We underestimated the costs of buying closing and the amount of repairs/renovations buying a 40-year-old home in Los Angeles (which actually is “newer” for our neighborhood) would cost. Now that I have read WCI I would definitely recommend waiting. Renting what you need (i.e. we would have been fine in 2 bed/2 bath townhome or apartment) and then deciding the next step based on 1) finances 2) children/family 3) choosing the best neighborhood after exploring for a year or two.”

Mortgage Broker Instead of a Bank

Aaron a self-employed periodontist ended up working with a mortgage broker because the banks would not even look at him without two years of tax returns. 0% down 5.25%. He recommends “explore the options of “buying down” the interest rate by paying points. My broker gave me that choice and if you’re financing that large a number ($330K) it’s advisable to pay the thousand or so up front to buy a lower interest rate.”

Rates a Little Higher Than Before

This doc closed in November 2018 with 0% down and a rate of 5.4% on a $225K loan with Sun Trust. He is pleased but hated all the paperwork.

A Serious Mortgage Loan Shopper

Ryan bought early in attendinghood and so didn't have a down payment but doesn't regret it given other job options he had in the area if the first didn't work out. He emailed 8-10 lenders off this site and 3 local banks and credit unions but only had 3-4 email back. He simply chose the best rate he could get which was a local bank who gave him a 90/10 loan instead of a doctor loan. The 90% loan had a 30-year term 10% loan had a 5-year term but both were fixed at 4.25%.

He says “Everyone seemed helpful I'm sure they will be because they are about to make a lot of money off of you. I seemed to get the best responsiveness from the local folks and actually the best rate as well. I highly suggest shopping around—I had rates range from 4.375% to 5.75% that can really change payment structures. Overall this was a bit more stressful and difficult than refinancing my student loans.”

Ask Who Will Service the Loan Post-Closing

Sara used First Citizens Bank and then refinanced from 4.75% to 3.99% with Suntrust 6 months later after her credit score improved and she had an improved loan to value ratio after doing some renovations. Both were 30-year mortgages. Sara found SunTrust to have a lower rate but higher credit standards. She was surprised to find rates to be similar to conventional mortgages.

She and her husband really liked the “portfolio loan” aspect of the physician loans. “For us it seems like physician mortgages are serviced by the actual bank who loans the money. This has been a much better experience than previous conventional mortgages that were sold to a third-party servicer. For example I had a house before meeting my husband (he's the physician in our relationship) and it's serviced by Rushmore Lending Group after being sold from the original bank I financed through. Horrible horrible experience with Rushmore in attempting to obtain information early pay-off escrow etc.

In contrast both First Citizens and Suntrust kept our loan in their portfolio. It's been super easy to set-up extra principal-only payments as well as obtain information anytime about the loan. That can be a real win time-wise. And if needed I could go into my local branch and talk to the bank about the loan at any time.”

Did as Much by Email as Possible

Jimmy is now coming out of fellowship and recently got preliminary quotes from 13 lenders (Suntrust Synovus First Tennessee BB&T BBVA Citizens Physician Loans US Bank FNB IBeria Simmons UMB and Willow Bend) and went with First Tennessee because they had the best terms (0% down to $1M 5% down to $1.5M) rates were as good as anyone else's and the agent was easy to work with. 5% down 4.25%. He says “I sent a form email to everyone on your website and got some information on basic terms and conditions and then circled back with those who had agreeable basic terms to get final rate quotes before proceeding with the “winner.” I tried to do as much as possible via email so as to have minimal impact on my day-to-day work. If people weren't willing to work via email they were cut. At the end of the day I figure that they are competing for my business and that I'm not required to bend to their needs in order for them to get my business.

Used the WCI Recommended Mortgage Lenders

Nabil looked at Regions Bank BBVA and Fairway before going with Cadence Bank with 5% down and a 4.375% 30-year fixed mortgage. He says “All the lenders I reached out to were recommended by WCI for physician loans in Texas. They all provided good service and an overall good experience. I mentioned I found them through WCI. Went with the one that gave me the best rate. No issues with the process and closed on time and everything went smoothly.”

Careful with Construction Loans

Elizabeth looked at Bank of America and then settled on SunTrust for a 4.49% loan with 5% down. She warns “I found not all banks were willing to do physician mortgages for new construction so that's something to ask about up front if that's what you're planning. ”

Expect Some Inconvenience

Tyler just closed on a house last month with a physician mortgage to avoid PMI and put less down. He put 10% down and got 4% with US Bank. He notes “Working with someone in another state was a little inconvenient since there were no person to person meetings. There were lots of emails and scanned documents with some things getting lost.”

Rate Was Most Important But Service Matters Too

Steven's wife is coming out of residency and they wanted a mortgage that didn't count her student loans and would accept her signed contract. They were quoted 5% down 4.99% by Fairway but are looking at a local bank offering 0% down 4.25%. They were willing to put more down but there wasn't much benefit. He said “Fairway was great to work with. They went back and forth with me on the various options (fixed vs. variable 30 vs 15 buy down options etc.) updating the presentation with each of my requests. They answered all my questions. Honestly Fairway was so helpful I feel kinda bad going with the local bank especially since Fairway doesn't charge an application fee (so we got all their help for free). But the rate difference is significant and it gets us established with a local bank which could be helpful down the line especially since I'll likely be self-employed (in a non-medical field).”

Flexibility Matters

Aubrene looked at Fifth Third Bank and some local banks and chose Fifth Third because “they were more willing to be flexible with closing dates and paperwork.” She put 5% down and got a 4% rate.

Closing This Month

Jessica is closing this month with Fulton Mortgage after looking at SunTrust. 4.25% on a 15/1 ARM with 6% down on an $850K home. She is looking forward to using her cash to pay off student loans instead of a down payment.

I don't dare make this post any longer but after looking through more than 100 emails the story is mostly the same. Mostly great experiences with minor inconveniences and the occasional major hassle. Rates mostly in the 4-5% range—again be mindful that these experiences were sent to us in 2019 and rates are sure to change. Down payments mostly in the 0%-5% range. People mostly doing it because they don't have down payment money or have a better use for it but still expect to be in the home for many years. The amazing thing is just how many different lenders people are using. There really was no one lender that stood out over the others. You just need to take a look at the ones in your state and shop around to get the best rate terms and service for your personal situation.

What do you think? Have you taken out a physician mortgage loan in the last year? Why did you choose it? What rate and terms did you get? What companies did you look at and how was your experience with each?

I have four children and after each one I have been more ambitious than ever. People blame pregancy maternity leave and childcare for the lack of women in banking. - Apparently women with children don't want to come back after they've had babies. That's crap. Pregnancy is distracting but after three to four weeks' recovery from childbirth you can be doing what you need to do remotely. I know. I've done it.

Why aren't there mid-ranking women on the trading floor then? In fact why aren't there more female vice presidents and executive directors across all divisions of the banking industry? Politics.

Banks today do a good job of hiring women to their junior roles. If you go into a bank now you're going to see a lot of old white men and a lot of non-dominant junior women. That's a big shock to the women who join. You thought the world had moved on? In banking it hasn't.

What about the female managing directors? Yes you'll see some of those too but you'll also see that they're not normal. The senior women in banks are mostly characterless and childless and it's by choice. They rose to the top in a different environment and they're very oriented towards the men. They're not going to help you and that can be a shock when you're a young woman who's used to collaborating.

The fact is that banking is a very weird and difficult workplace where the men have all the power and young and often attractive women are typically juniors.

In this environment it's easy to be a woman at the bottom of the pile - to be an analyst or an associate who gets promoted automatically simply for working to a particular standard. But once you become a vice president promotion is far more subjective and women start to struggle.

The problem is that your boss will almost certainly be a man. Some men in banking are great - and they usually have daughters; many are not. Men tend to be a lot less structured than women. This means that if you want to gain the attention of your male boss it helps to do so in an unstructured way - to go for drinks after work to play soccer or golf.

Women tend to approach things differently. If a woman wants to get a boss's attention for her achievements she might schedule a promotion or pay-rise conversation to talk through everything she's done. Unstructured men don't like this: they see women who take this approach as being too ambitious and aggressive and the reaction is usually ""tone it down.""

As a woman you can play the unstructured game. You can buddy-up with your boss and start hanging out in bars after the markets close but this creates problems. I know male bankers who are afraid to even ask young women on the floor to fetch the coffees let alone to go out for drinks with them. And even if women do get to know their male bosses in a less formal setting they need to be careful not to put a foot wrong. - Men badmouth their peers all the time but if you do this as a woman you're judged very differently. For men criticizing others is ""correcting mistakes""; for women it's ""non-collaborative."" Believe me you hear that a lot in finance. And if your boss doesn't like you you're screwed.

Of course there are diversity committees. I've sat in on then. But they're usually just fluff and complaining. The average tenure of a diversity and inclusion officer is one year. - People resign when they realize they can't achieve anything and have no way of proving their value.

So what can banks do to keep women? Rewards and punishments. If the men in charge were told their salaries would be doubled if they filled half their teams with women they'd do it in a flash. The same would happen if they had their bonuses taken if teams weren't a 50:50 gender split.

Radical action needs to be taken. There are plenty of brilliant and talented women who want to make their careers in banking but because of this industry's systemic cultural problem they're leaving when they're only halfway through.

For the last couple of months I have been actively applying for Machine Learning jobs. My main source of application has been LinkedIn. I applied for the position of Data Scientist at Uber via LinkedIn. The job responsibilities included the implementation of ML algorithms for real-life challenging problems related to Uber Ride and Uber Eats.

Recruiter’s Email

I received an email from the recruiter within two weeks. The recruiter asked for my availability and also provided a detailed document mentioning the interview timeline and useful resources. The document was really helpful for me to get a good understanding of what the interview process would look like.

Phone Screen 1:

I had two phone screenings ten days apart. Each screening was a 45mins video interview and followed the same format. In the first 5 mins the interviewer introduced him/herself. Followed by my introduction and a walk-through of my resume. The first phone screen interview consisted of two parts

Case Study: The case study consisted of a relevant open-ended problem similar to UberEats. The interviewer and I discussed various aspects of the problem such as understanding the objective collecting the data carrying out exploratory data analysis scaling the system important KPIs for the problem underlying Machine Learning solutions deploying the solution and integrating it into the existing system. The purpose of this case study was to evaluate my approach to large-scale Machine Learning problems.

The purpose of this case study was to evaluate my approach to large-scale Machine Learning problems. Coding: The second part consisted of a medium coding question via CodeSignal. I was asked to choose the language of my liking. The interviewer was very clear when explaining the problem. I was able to solve the problem optimally in the given time.

In the end the interviewer asked me if I had any questions. We had a really good discussion on what his job responsibilities are at Uber.

Phone Screen 2:

I heard my first phone screen interview feedback in 3 days and my next phone screen interview was scheduled within a week. Similar to the first interview this interview had two parts

Machine Learning basics: The interviewer went through some basic to intermediate level questions related to machine learning such as backpropagation graph ML ensemble methods vanishing gradients precision vs recall bias-variance trade-off etc. A good understanding of these topics can be found on the useful link below

ML case study: Similar to the first interview an open-ended case study related to UberEats was discussed. Contrary to the first interview this case study was much more complex and more machine learning and statistics oriented. I was asked to design an ML-based solution for a related product-based problem. The interviewer asked relevant detailed questions in each step. The discussion started from a simple logistic regression model to slightly complex SVM and decision trees and finally to even complex graph ML models. We also discussed important features of the available data set and how to use them towards solving the problem.

Again the interviewer was very friendly and made sure the interview environment was comfortable enough for me.

On-site

The onsite interview consisted of 6 rounds spanning a total time of 5–6 hours with two 15-minutes breaks. They gave me enough time to explain my answers made me feel welcomed. They eased me into the process by first introducing themselves and describing their job responsibilities. None of the interviewers were distracted and were completely focused on what I had to say. I have listed the six rounds into the following categories of my own based on the nature of the questions asked.

1. Design Problem

This interview consisted of an open-ended case study related to designing an online grocery store. I walked the interviewer through the process of data collection exploratory data analysis feature selection feature transformation machine learning model selection training the model and selecting the right KPIs to analyze the performance. This round was much more focused on the bigger picture. The interviewer was interested in my high-level understanding of the problem and not in the technical details of the algorithms. We also discussed a few business-related KPIs to gauge the solution to the problem.

2. Coding:

The coding interview was focused on my understanding of statistics. The interviewer asked me to implement a problem that involved hypothesis testing. Since I was used to the LeetCode type question related to real-world problems this coding question gave me a tough time. It took me some time to understand what the interviewer wanted me to implemented. The interviewer gave me a few hints when I got stuck. This coding question had multiple follow-up coding questions. A good understanding of the section can be found below

3. Research

This part of the onsite consisted solely of my prior research experience. The interviewer asked me to explain my Ph.D. research asking follow-up questions. This part was more of a discussion. The interviewer went through my CV in detail and asked relevant questions on projects that I had mentioned. He asked me to pick up a research project and explain in detail the objectives setbacks and final results.

4. Behavioral:

The interviewer asked me questions regarding my experience as a Ph.D. student my experience as an intern and a Machine learning engineer. The questions revolved around my leadership qualities time management meeting deadlines dealing with a difficult colleague and conflict resolution. A good understanding of such questions can be found below

5. Machine Learning/Statistical:

This section was an open-ended discussion related to one of Uber’s products. The problem was presented as a case study and the interviewer was most interested in my ML approach to the problem. We started with a very basic ML solution discussed how this was a very simple approach that would fail in real-life cases moved onto more complex solutions. Throughout the interview we discussed various ML concepts and how changing a few things would address issues related to the ML pipeline. Topics such as Graph ML models embeddings loss functions etc were discussed as well.

A few of the related topics can be found on the link below.

6. Case Study:

This was similar to the Design Problem and Machine Learning/Statistics but the Uber product under consideration was different. The interviewer was interested in my high-level understanding of designing a solution to a given problem and how would I design a solution when scaled to larger data sets. The case study was somewhat similar to the design problems asked in FAANG companies.

Summary:

Overall my interview experience with Uber was really good. The interviewers were focused on what I had to say and gave me ample time to explain my answers. The interviews mainly focused on design problem/case studies machine learning concepts coding problems and my research background. I found the following resources useful while preparing for the interview.

Uber Engineering Blog:

Things to focus on with case studies/design problems:

Scalable solution: With over 90 million active users Uber is a company that gives significant importance to scalable solutions. Whenever answering a case study or design problem make sure your solution

With over 90 million active users Uber is a company that gives significant importance to scalable solutions. Whenever answering a case study or design problem make sure your solution Customer-oriented approach : Uber deals with people directly. The customers are the general public. Hence your solution should give more importance to making lives easy for customers. The design problem should be modified keeping the user experience in mind.

: Uber deals with people directly. The customers are the general public. Hence your solution should give more importance to making lives easy for customers. The design problem should be modified keeping the user experience in mind. Business KPIs: Finally the end goal for Uber is to generate revenue. Your solutions should focus on user retention user churn new users number of riders number of orders with Uber eats new restaurants being added to Uber eats etc. Ask yourself how do these metrics eventually impact revenue generated?

If you have an interview lined up with Uber I hope this article helps you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90di1hbmQtcmFkaW8vMjAyMS9qdWwvMTgva2VuLWJ1cm5zLWktZmVsdC10aGF0LWhlbWluZ3dheXMtdWJlci1tYXNjdWxpbml0eS13YXMtYS1tYXNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ken Burns: 'I felt that Hemingway's uber-masculinity was a mask',"Ken Burns 67 is a veteran and celebrated American film-maker who has made more than 30 documentaries in a career lasting more than 40 years. Among them is a much lauded history of the American civil war and an equally rapturously received history of the Vietnam war. His six-part documentary on Ernest Hemingway is currently on BBC Four and iPlayer and there is a forthcoming series on Muhammad Ali.

What attracted you to Ernest Hemingway as a subject?

We’d been thinking about doing Hemingway for an awfully long time – Geoffrey C Ward Lynn Novick [writer and co-director respectively] and me – for literally decades since the 1980s. We needed all that time to sort of ruminate. We knew there was a lot of new scholarship that would help complicate the picture that it isn’t just this toxic masculine guy with a bunch of wives and a literary legacy but even more interesting dimensions that would permit us to explore things at a greater depth. There’s a tendency particularly in our media world for everything to be binary: good bad yes no up down. And we found Hemingway tantalisingly complicated which is what we like because it is faithful to human beings.

Do you think the Hemingway myth has overshadowed his virtues as a writer?

Perhaps but once you dive into Hemingway you’re just stunned at how spectacularly great he is and how difficult it is to find excuses however simplistic to cancel him out. The short stories are perfect art; the novels particularly A Farewell to Arms and The Sun Also Rises are great works of literature. Modernist writing was extraordinarily complicated but as one of our literary critics Stephen Cushman says he dared to impersonate simplicity. So he’s like Miles Davis next to Charlie Parker.

There is footage in your film of Hemingway being interviewed and he comes across as deeply uncomfortable reading from cue cards. Were you surprised by this?

“Surprised” isn’t good enough. It was flabbergasting it was embarrassing it was excruciating to watch. It was impossible to account for but apparently he had a fearful worry about himself on camera. This was later in his life around the time of the Nobel prize. We’re beginning to see the many demons that contribute to his end becoming a much greater force in his life. There was a history of family mental illness his suicidal ideation the trauma of the first world war the trauma of his father’s suicide the alcoholism and self-medicating to go along with it and then the significant brain injuries – at least nine that we could count that would have possibly created the dementia.

Werner Herzog once said: ‘Ken is interested in an emotional truth. I’m interested in an ecstatic truth’

Did your opinion of Hemingway change as a result of making the film?

Very much so. My literary appreciation for him only increased at his ability to use words – even as we delved into spectacular failures of his writing where he really lost it for a while and wrote god-awful stuff such as To Have and Have Not and Across the River and Into the Trees. I also learned a kind of sympathy. I felt that the uber-masculinity was a mask; although he was a deep-sea fisherman a big-game hunter an outdoorsman a brawler a lover of women a drinker he also had a desire to speak about gender fluidity in his writing.

The women in his life tended to be boyish but his third wife the war reporter Martha Gellhorn was also quite fearless. Do you think he felt challenged by her?

Yes. I think Martha Gellhorn threatened him fundamentally. His writing begins to decline. He sort of goes into his shell he doesn’t want to go out. She wants to go out and cover the world particularly the greatest cataclysm in human history. He’s not so sure having been through the first world war and having done the Spanish civil war. And so I think he’s terrified of her maybe emasculated. I think she needed her independence. As she said she wanted her name back. She thought he could be a partner and he had pitiably no ability to be a partner.

You’ve made a large number of documentaries across a wide range of subjects that tend to share strong American themes. But what are the deciding factors for you in choosing a topic?

There are three: story story story. I do admit that all of the films that I have done so far in 45 years have been American but we’re now working on a project about Leonardo da Vinci which will be the first non-American topic. I’m drawn intellectually to the story and then there’s something about the story that magnifies and drops down from your head into your heart. I’m about to turn 68 and I’m working on eight films. It’s the process that’s so interesting for me rather than just putting the film out there. It’s like I appreciate the birth of each child but it’s the parenting I really love. It’s a form distillation. We collect easily 40 or 50 times the amount of material that will go into a long film. I’m happiest when I’m editing and making the film better.

Among your frequent collaborators is the actor Peter Coyote who often narrates your films. What does he bring to the mix?

I love Peter like a brother. He’s an extraordinary reader. And he has this amazing gift – we never send him anything in advance. He reads it cold the first time. And I swear to you it’s take one or take two that is usually what’s in there. His voice is close to mine though clearly with the timbre and qualities that a professional actor brings to it. He’s immensely interested in our subjects and he has the ability to inhabit the word.

Your films are particularly celebrated for their use of archive photography. What is it about the still image that is rendered powerful in moving pictures?

My father was an anthropologist and he was also an amateur still photographer. I wanted to become a film-maker and I ended up going to a college where all of my teachers were social documentary still photographers. And so the still photograph is a kind of DNA of my work. I look at a photograph as if it is the arresting of an alive moment. So as I film it I want to take that feature film-maker’s sensibility and each photograph is a master shot that has a long shot a medium shot a close-up a tilt a pan a reveal detail. In the opening of The Civil War you tilt from an innocent boy’s face down to his waistband stuffed with two revolvers. That spoke a million words.

In one sense this is a great time for documentary-makers because of the streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime but do you think the general quality of film-making is improving?

We are definitely in a crescendoing golden age. I thought we were in one in the 1980s. I’ve stayed in public broadcasting my entire time: it’s made fundraising just hell – we don’t have the funding that the BBC does. The Vietnam film costs $30m. That took me every ounce of blood sweat and tears to raise. I could walk in with my track record to a streaming service and get that $30m probably in one conversation for whatever the next big thing is. And yet they wouldn’t give me 10 years which is what I took to make the Vietnam series. But I would say that we are overwhelmed with a continually broadening spectrum of documentaries and really great talented work.

Who are the documentary-makers you most admire?

I would go back to Werner Herzog. We couldn’t be more stylistically opposite to each other. He said once at a panel at the Telluride film festival: “Ken is interested in an emotional truth. I’m interested in an ecstatic truth.” I love Errol Morris’s work from the 1980s to this day. I find it so compelling. And I think some of the newer things that have come along about Michael Jordan about OJ add to a sense on the part of the public that documentaries which were perhaps seen as castor oil – something that was good for you but hardly good tasting – have now taken over the storytelling reins because Hollywood plots with obviously wonderful exceptions have become so predictable.

Has there been a project that you’ve wanted to do for many years and it’s just got away from you?

Someone asked me that in the 90s and I said: “The project I’d like to do but can’t do is the history of Martin Luther King. And the reason why I feel like I can’t do it is because the family is so controlling.” And extraordinarily coincidentally the family then contacted me. They said: “We think you’d be the best person to make the film on our father and our husband.” And I said: “You are right.” I rushed down to Atlanta and I spent a day with them and afterwards I wrote them and said I had to step away from it.

Ramon Gil-Medrano was gunned down on July 11 in the back of a livery cab at 178th and Valentine Avenue. He was found around 11:30 p.m. with multiple gunshot wounds to his head and chest.

Police are looking into whether the 16-year-old was shot point-blank in retaliation for the death of a 13-year-old shot and killed hours earlier in the Bronx. The young victim was gunned down outside a café around 3:30 p.m. in the Belmont section of the Bronx in what police say was a gang-related killing.

Gil-Medrano was linked to the 800 YGz gang and had three prior arrests in 90s days according to police officials.

Officers also took into custody a 15-year-old on charges of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Both suspects have prior arrest histories and ties to gangs in the city a senior NYPD official said.

Police say a gang war is unfolding in the Bronx with teenagers as the victims. Jonathan Dienst reports.

The back-to-back fatal shootings marked a particularly bloody weekend in the city and Bronx. At least 10 people were victims of gun violence over the weekend with two other people killed in addition to the Bronx teenagers.

Mayor Bill de Blasio attended an anti-violence rally on Saturday and met with families from the borough impacted by gun violemce.

TOKYO -- Pushed to the brink by the coronavirus pandemic a 28-year-old man with no earnings and only around 300 yen (about $3) in his pocket chose to move to Tokyo to become an Uber Eats rider. For a month starting April 2020 when the country's first state of emergency was declared he kept cycling around Japan's capital filming himself and the cityscape using his smartphone and a small camera. Now the footage has become a documentary that premiered July 10.

Taku Aoyagi director of ""Tokyo Jitensha Bushi"" had been waiting for a chance to make his own film while doing video production work and part-time jobs for a designated driver service in his hometown in Yamanashi Prefecture. But the coronavirus took his work from him and left him without an income. It was then Aoyagi decided to find work in Tokyo.

""I was also interested in Tokyo without its usual crowds. I started filming thinking maybe I could find something if I made records from the perspective of a delivery rider moving freely by bike"" said Aoyagi.

A scene from the movie ""Tokyo Jitensha Bushi"" is seen in this image provided by film distributor nondelaico.

Workers for the Uber Eats food delivery service are contracted as sole proprietors. The company launched in Japan in September 2016 and has seen a surge in food delivery demand since last year as many have stayed home in the pandemic. Increasingly more people have started delivery jobs.

Aoyagi recalled ""At first I admired riders' work. I imagined them as connecting people in Tokyo where the flow of people had been cut off and giving the city a sense of humanity. But actually it turned out I mostly left products in front of doors and rarely met customers face to face. I don't even know who my services helped. I realized I was only a part of a larger system.""

In the movie Aoyagi faced incidents where his bike tires were punctured and his mobile phone necessary for taking orders and checking maps broke. The repairs expenses were about the same as his daily earnings. On top of this he was shocked to discover he was uninsured for work-related accidents.

Aoyagi said ""Even if I worked hard and earned I couldn't save. Once I realized that I felt we were expendable laborers. The employers don't think about your individual life or treat you as a person.""

Taku Aoyagi is seen leaving a delivery in front of a housing complex room at night in an image from a scene in the movie ""Tokyo Jitensha Bushi"" provided by its distributor nondelaico.

Aoyagi said loneliness started to set in as he worked while perceiving himself as ""being incorporated into a profit-pursuing system."" Around the same time an elderly woman he met during breaks between deliveries told him her war experiences and about how the area they were in had been razed to the ground. It made him say without thinking ""Tokyo in 2020 has also been burned away.""

He elaborated saying ""Of course in reality there are many buildings standing and it's not a burned-out area because it's not like there was a fire or disaster. But more and more people like me feel lonely as their hearts have hardened from accepting this reality where people are divided by a system someone else has created. The landscape in the minds of people whose hearts are becoming closed-off overlapped with the woman's words about a city razed to the ground. I thought something terrible is happening.""

Kazuo Osawa the movie's producer expressed Aoyagi's ""burned away"" in even harsher terms saying ""What we can see from Uber Eats is a system that exploits and enslaves people. This is the limit of capitalism. Individuals are being dragged into it and left at its mercy and that's why they feel lonely.""

But Aoyagi says he hasn't made such definite conclusions. Uber has a ""quest"" system offering riders with extra money for achieving certain goals. ""As someone who actually worked there I understand well the feelings of those exploited. There were times when I would take on extremely packed schedules making 70 deliveries over three days to earn a reward. It is also true that completing the quests gives you a sense of achievement and makes you feel you fulfilled your job. With an unclear outlook under the pandemic I also understand why some people want to live while finding each moment rewarding.""

Taku Aoyagi who still works as an Uber Eats rider following his film's release is seen in Tokyo's Shinjuku Ward on June 30 2021. (Mainichi/Chie Yamashita)

Although the director had been depressed about not being able to see the faces of the customers he delivered to the film shows him actively approaching and conversing with people he met in Tokyo. He gradually gained insight on life and the movie shows how small interactions between strangers can give you hints for easing loneliness.

Aoyagi said emphatically ""Firstly I'd like people to enjoy watching the Tokyo cityscape of the time. I tried to depict what happened to me while including very real experiences. I'd be glad if people can use it as a step to thinking about society from a wider perspective.""

The movie premiered July 10 at Pole Pole HigashiNakano in the capital's Nakano Ward and is set to for a nationwide release in future.

Why Trust Us?

Belinda Carlisle says she’s used as her go-to moisturizer for over 40 years.

“There’s a reason why it’s been around for so long” she said of the product which has been available for over 90 years. “It’s a miracle cure.”

Multiple other members of the Go-Go’s use the cream too.

Belinda Carlisle has been performing for over 40 years—and she’s used her favorite moisturizer for just as long. Like countless other celebrities (and regular people too) the lead singer of the Go-Go’s counts as one of her most-trusted beauty secrets—she even calls it a “miracle cure.” (You can find it at or !)

“My skin is extremely extremely dry” Carlisle then 62 told the Strategist. “But when I put this on at night it no longer feels dry the next morning. I use it on my face my cuticles my feet—I rub it all over them then put socks on to let it soak in.”

The cream was formulated over 90 years ago per the  and got its distinctive name by supposedly healing a cut on a child’s knee in just eight hours. Today it’s used as an all-purpose moisturizer and beauty hack that’s stood the test of time.

“There’s a reason why it’s been around for so long” the “Heaven Is a Place on Earth” singer continued. “A lot of the girls in the Go-Go’s use it too and have been for probably just as long.” (You could say they’re “Head Over Heels” for the stuff!)

Reviewers rave about the  too using it to smooth nails define brows and soothe painfully dry skin. “I wish I could give this 10 stars because that’s how much I love it” one reviewer writes. “My 13-year-old daughter had EXTREME dry lips ... Within TWO HOURS we could already see a difference and by the end of the week the dry skin was completely gone.”

“I find that using a tiny bit on the cheekbones after applying makeup makes the skin look so healthy” another reviewer explains.

As for Carlisle there’s little chance she’ll ever stop using the cream. “I’ve been using this for 40-odd years. It’s one of those classic standbys” she said. “[It] really did change my life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9iZWF1dHktYW5kLXRoZS1iaXRjb2luLWZlbWFsZS1mb2N1c2VkLWJyYW5kcy1hY2NlcHQtY3J5cHRvLXBheW1lbnRzLWRyaXZpbmctYWRvcHRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beauty and the Bitcoin: Female-focused brands accept crypto payments driving adoption,"While Bitcoin (BTC) may be considered as a store of value for many some consumers across the globe may be thinking otherwise. Recent data has revealed that 46 million people in the United States plan to use cryptocurrency to pay for things such as groceries or real estate. Payments giant Visa further revealed in July that its crypto-enabled cards processed over $1 billion in total spending during the first half of this year.

As such it shouldn’t come as a surprise that major brands like Starbucks Home Depot and Target have started putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Yet as crypto payments gain popularity and become easier to incorporate smaller brands — specifically those geared toward women — are starting to accept crypto to help drive female adoption.

Beauty industry bets on Bitcoin

For example the billion-dollar beauty industry has taken a recent interest in Bitcoin. Ann McFerran CEO and founder of Glamnetic — a magnetic eyelash beauty brand — told Cointelegraph that the company now accepts Bitcoin Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) through a recent partnership with Bitcoin payment provider BitPay. According to McFerran Glamentic is one of the very first female-founded beauty brands to support crypto payments.

McFerran shared that she started investing in cryptocurrencies in 2017 yet noticed that the space was heavily male-dominated. To McFerran’s point research firm BDC Consulting found that only 8% of all crypto users were women in 2019. After launching Glamentic in July 2019 McFerran was determined to incorporate crypto payments into the brand to encourage women to use cryptocurrency:

“The beauty industry is a sector where crypto payments aren’t widely accepted. I wanted Glamnetic to be one of the first brands to support crypto payments since I’m a huge believer in cryptocurrency and because I want to bring more women into the space.”

McFerran further mentioned that she believes there is still a lot of stigma associated with how crypto is being used today. “It was certainly not a secure payment method to begin with” she remarked. McFerran noted that events such as Silk Road and Mt. Gox have further resulted in women’s disinterest in crypto: “Even to this day women are not fully educated when it comes to crypto. I want to educate others so they can understand the risks and what they are potentially missing out on.""

Although transacting with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for beauty products may encourage women to become interested in cryptocurrencies this is just one part of the equation. Sanja Kon CEO of Utrust — a banking system for crypto payments — told Cointelegraph that educating women around crypto depends heavily on a brand’s ability to reach their consumer base with the correct educational tools:

“More beauty brands adopting cryptocurrency payments can increase awareness but not necessarily usage. Women need to feel comfortable using cryptocurrency as a payment method. In order for that to happen brands should provide support and educational content to advocate adoption.”

According to Kon Utrust is facilitating this movement by investing resources into educational plans with the company’s merchants. McFerran also noted that Glamnetic has started creating TikTok videos to educate consumers on cryptocurrency which can make a big impact given the notion that younger consumers are more likely to own crypto. PYMNTS.com found that 27% of all millennials either own or have owned one type of cryptocurrency.

McFerran further remarked that Glamnetic will be releasing a magnetic eyelash collection inspired by Dogecoin to help drive adoption: “I think people will be more open to the idea of crypto if you turn that concept into an entire beauty product.”

While Glamnetic may be one of the first female-founded beauty companies to accept crypto payments a handful of larger cosmetic brands have also started incorporating crypto in other ways to drive female participation.

Aubrey Strobel head of communications at Lolli — an online Bitcoin rewards platform — told Cointelegraph that the company works with leading retailers including Sephora Ulta EM Cosmetics and Glossier. According to Strobel women make up 30% of Lolli’s user base. “Historically women have lagged behind men in the space but lead a vast majority of many households’ purchasing decisions” Strobel said.

Strobel explained that companies offering Bitcoin rewards to consumers are attractive to many shoppers especially women who want to “stack sats” when making purchases online.

This notion is highlighted in a recent report from The Defiant titled “Global Report on Women Cryptocurrency and Financial Independence.” In this document a woman named Christine noted that she occasionally learns how to manage cryptocurrency by practicing with small transactions. She stated that she has been stacking sats to accumulate small amounts of Bitcoin over a long period of time. “When I travel I like to buy coffee and other things with it” Christine further remarked.

Will Bitcoin catch on in the beauty industry?

While it’s too soon to tell if crypto payments for beauty products will drive female participation within crypto a small impact is already being exhibited. McFerran shared that Glamnetic has already processed a handful of crypto transactions from women consumers. Yuvi Alpert founder and CEO of Noémie — a jewelry company that also recently incorporated crypto payments — also told Cointelegraph that the brand has currently only seen crypto sales with their female customers.

Although this may be the case findings show that the top products females are likely to spend cryptocurrency on are travel and leisure real estate and furniture or appliances. Yet while crypto payments may be slow to catch on in the beauty industry brands incorporating cryptocurrency transactions will likely gain a competitive advantage.

According to Kon more brands in general are starting to understand the advantage of accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment method:

“They will be able to drastically reduce their payment processing fees as blockchain allows to cut all the traditional intermediaries such as banks payment processors and credit card schemes. Additionally these brands will be able to eliminate chargebacks and fraud as well as increase their revenue by reaching out to new customers.”",,,,,,,,,

In the wake of George Floyd's murder corporate America pledged to do better saying it would diversify its leadership encourage equity and take concrete actions to root out systemic racism.

But a USA TODAY analysis of previously undisclosed hiring records from dozens of top firms found that more than a year later executive roles remain overwhelmingly white and male. Black and Hispanic workers particularly women tend to be concentrated in the lowest ranks and some of the nation's most powerful brands still refuse to disclose data on the gender ethnic and racial makeup of their workforce.

The eight-part series combed the records of the Standard & Poor’s 100 some of the most highly valued companies in the stock market.

Building pipelines for diversity success Anthony D. Wilbon dean of the Howard School of Business and Charlotte Newman senior manager at Amazon talk growth strategies for diversity and equity Jarrad Henderson USA TODAY

They revealed that while Black and Hispanic employees are often overrepresented as compared to U.S. census data on the nation's workforce among the technicians administrative assistants and laborers who form the backbone of many organizations they are less likely to be found at the company's senior levels or in other professional positions.

The lack of diversity in corporate roles that pay the highest salaries offer the best benefits and provide a path to promotions influence and leadership hardens the racial and gender wealth gap that's resulted in the typical white family having eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic household.

Companies are more transparent but not all

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies have become more transparent in the 14 months since Floyd's killing when protests condemning systemic bias and calling for social justice swept the nation.

Among the S&P 100 a record 54 companies including Merck Ford Motor Co Bank of America and Target gave USA TODAY their EEO-1 forms documents detailing the gender race and ethnic breakdown of their workforces that businesses are required to provide each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Another 23 corporations including Home Depot Walmart and Boeing said they would publicly disclose that information this year or in 2022.

Altria Abbott Laboratories AT&T General Dynamics and UnitedHealth Group were among the companies that provided their EEO-1 reports after publication deadline.

But some of the nation’s most well-known brands such as Exxon T-Mobile and FedEx rejected USA TODAY’s requests and gave no future date when they might provide such information to the public. Amazon which last released its EEO-1 report in 2016 also would not provide the most recent demographic data of its workforce but said it would release its 2020 data in the coming months.

Federal officials will not release these demographic records to the public without companies’ permission citing privacy protections in the Civil Rights Act. A civil suit filed by Reveal a nonprofit investigative journalism outlet challenges the legality of hiding these records from the public.

Boards are largely white and male

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Companies often point to the diversity of their boards of directors to distract from the concentration of white men in their corporate suites. But board membership at the 54 companies examined by USA TODAY also did not reflect the racial makeup of their business's workforces let alone the nation's overall population.

While white men make up about a third of U.S. workers they held half or more of board seats at 33 of the 54 companies.

Amgen a biopharmaceutical company had the highest percentage of white men on its board – eight people or 73% – even though only 30% of the company's workers are white males. White women held two of the remaining three board seats which is almost half of their rate in the company's workforce.

Compared to their company workforces white non-Hispanic men were only underrepresented on 12 company boards almost always by just a handful of percentage points. Among the remaining corporations reviewed the share of white male board directors often was two or three times higher than their business' workforce.

The companies also appointed white women to their boards at higher rates than people of color.

White non-Hispanic women held a disproportionately large share of board memberships at about two-thirds of companies.

White women had no seats on the board of Coca-Cola despite holding 23% of all jobs. At Starbucks they held just 9% of seats while accounting for 38% of the company's workers.

About a third of companies had boards where the percentage of men of color matched or exceeded their representation in the business's workforce. Six companies did not have any men of color on their boards.

Another 19 companies did not have any directors who were women of color. They were equitably represented or overrepresented on the boards of just 10 companies. But those figures are based on counting all non-white women together obscuring the lack of Black and Hispanic women board members in particular.

“We have to move from tokenism to transformation'' says Darren Walker who is head of the philanthropic Ford Foundation and a diversity advocate. ""Having one Black on the board or the chief diversity officer three levels down from the CEO will not result in a successful strategy. There has to be genuine authenticity.”

At about half of the companies reviewed the board membership had more representation for people of color than among the business's executives although men of color were much more likely to hold those seats than women.

For instance 44% of board seats at Gilead Sciences Inc. a pharmaceutical company are filled by four men of color but no women of color. Two white men and three white women hold the rest. Yet men of color account for 20% of the company's executives and 26% of its workforce.

Women of color account for a larger share of McDonald's workforce than any of the 54 companies reviewed: 44%. None sit on the company's 13-member board.

Again these tallies lump together ethnic and racial groups that face different challenges with workplace discrimination and gaining the kind of career recognition that leads to invites for board seats. Closing the gaps will take targeted strategies experts say.

Diversity strengthens the bottom line

A diverse board appeared to help some S&P 500 companies weather the economic downturn sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic better than businesses whose boardrooms were less inclusive according to a new report.

S&P 500 businesses whose boards were more than 30% people of color experienced a 4% bump in revenue as compared to the previous year while their peers whose boards were less than 20% people of color saw their revenue dip 2.8% according to BoardReady a nonprofit focused on making boards more inclusive.

Race inequity in corporate US

And companies where women made up more than 30% of the directors outperformed those whose boards had fewer women in 11 of the top 15 S&P 500 sectors last year.

“It’s striking that so many aspects of diversity correlated with better performance” the report’s lead researcher Rajalakshmi Subramanian said in a statement announcing the findings. “No matter whether you’re looking at racial diversity gender diversity or diversity in age companies with a broader range of perspectives at the board table did better.”

The gains that have been made in some board rooms have been hard-won and companies can easily backtrack if advocates aren't vigilant says Ursula Burns the former CEO of Xerox and the first Black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company. She's been leading the charge to diversify the boards of major corporations.

“The board level in many publicly traded companies is better than the C-suite data and it’s better than the employment levels” Burns told USA TODAY in an interview. “Basically if you beat the (crap) out of them about something – I’m sorry to say it this way – they will pay a little bit of attention to it with the hope that we will forget about it after a while and they then can take their foot off the pedal.”

Mondelēz International which produces snacks like Oreos and Ritz crackers has no women of color and only one man of color on its 12-person board. Nearly 40% of the company's workers are people of color.

In an emailed statement the company said that last year it signed on to the Board Diversity Action Alliance which aims to make boards more inclusive.

""We value diversity within our board of director members as we do throughout our organization'' the company said. ""We know we can and will continue to improve in this space.""

USA TODAY's series puts a spotlight on several industries including:

Tech

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

While white employees across all U.S. industries are three times as likely as their Black or Hispanic peers to get top jobs the gap is even starker among the nation's largest tech firms.

White employees at Facebook Google Amazon Apple and Microsoft are five times as likely to be executives as their Hispanic colleagues and seven times as likely as their Black co-workers USA TODAY found.

And while women are underrepresented among managers and executives throughout corporate America – a pattern that continues in the tech world – the disparity among Black tech employees is particularly striking. In that sector Black men are twice as likely as Black women to have leadership roles.

Black and Hispanic workers have a disproportionate share of lower-level jobs in big tech. At tech companies analyzed by USA TODAY nearly half of white employees had professional positions as compared to 1 in 5 Hispanic workers and 1 in 9 Black workers. The professional gap between white and Black employees in tech was three times greater than what is seen in the overall labor force.

Banking

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

Leadership of the nation's major banks has traditionally been – and continues to be – predominantly white.

White people fill 73% to 87% of all executive positions at US Bancorp Bank of America Bank of New York Mellon Citigroup Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.

Wells Fargo says that it will release its EEO-1s for 2019 and 2020 later this summer roughly a year after its CEO Charles Scharf a white man drew criticism for saying the San Francisco-based company missed its diversity benchmarks because there was a limited pool of Black executives to draw from.

Food Retail

Colin Smith/USA TODAY Network

At some of the nation's largest or best-known food companies and chains the diversity in top jobs is vastly out of sync with the broader population.

White workers are 64% of the nation's workforce while Hispanic workers are 16.8% and Black workers are 11.2% according to U.S. Census data.

But 87% of executive positions at Costco are occupied by white people. Meanwhile 77% of executives at Pepsi and 74% at Coca-Cola are white according to records obtained by USA TODAY. McDonald's was the most reflective of the U.S.'s racial demographics with white people filling two-thirds of executive roles. Although the company's leadership was the closest to matching the overall American workforce McDonald's still had disproportionately high rates of Black and Hispanic people particularly women in lower-paying and lower-ranking jobs.

Carrying on that legacy is at the core of Hoyt Hsiao’s mission for the company. Hsiao joined the family company in 1987 at 22 after graduating from college. He worked on general business operations including some project management and estimating work.

“I think I was fortunate with my dad as my role model in the sense of how he treated his employees and his team members. Also how he brought me into the business. He was always pretty open and sharing and he actually let me take some responsibility and be accountable” says Hsiao. “I know some of my peers who worked in family businesses didn’t have that same opportunity.”

A Star Tribune obituary for Fred Shaw offered this take on his role in the community: “He was a pillar and major benefactor in the Twin Cities’ Chinese-American community and a man whose word was his bond.”

Hsiao says that he is trying to carry his father’s values forward in business.

“We really push to be a purpose-driven and value-focused company where we use those as guideposts for how we bring our team members on” says Hsiao. “Our purpose is building better lives.”

Shaw-Lundquist made a bet on Las Vegas in 2005 when it opened an office there and the bet has paid off. Hsiao says that its Vegas business started kicking into high gear in 2016 and has been an important part of the firm’s growth. Hsiao’s younger brother Holden leads the Las Vegas office.

“We had great opportunities out there and started developing really good relationships with a couple of the resort and hospitality companies along the Strip” says Hsiao.

Hsiao says that the company was “going gangbusters” there until Covid hit. “Our revenues have dropped by more than half” he says. In the process Shaw-Lundquist has been looking to cultivate Las Vegas business outside the Strip. But the high-profile projects haven’t dried up entirely; Shaw-Lundquist recently completed work for the new Amalfi by Bobby Flay restaurant in Caesars Palace.

We like to work with people who are ethical and transplant. He does have that reputation in the market. —Brenda Quaye founder/owner Venstar

The company’s revenue topped $200 million for its fiscal year ending March 31 2019. But in the wake of Covid it fell to roughly $90 million for the fiscal year that just wrapped up.

Throughout the pandemic the company has focused on maintaining relationships.

“We’ve really worked hard to keep the momentum going during Covid and keep all those relationships fresh” says John Jensvold vice president. “It’s starting to look like there’s great momentum coming out of this whole pandemic. We’re seeing a lot of opportunities for the next fiscal year in manufacturing and hospitality.”

The company set a revised target of $120 million to $130 million in revenue for its current fiscal year. Roughly two-thirds of the company’s revenue comes from repeat business.

Shaw-Lundquist is a small company compared to the construction giants but still lands some big jobs.

Hsiao mentions Fortune 500 companies Xcel Energy 3M and U.S. Bank among the firm’s past clients. The company has done several projects for Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group including a 2019 renovation of executive offices at the company’s headquarters. Shaw-Lundquist also built a location for iFly an indoor skydiving attraction in Minnetonka.

Current projects include Cranberry Ridge a 45-unit affordable housing project in Plymouth developed by St. Paul-based Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative and a 30000-square-foot neighborhood retail development adjacent to the Viking Lakes campus in Eagan for Bloomington-based Venstar LLC.

“We were looking for somebody who had a really strong reputation. We like to work with people who are ethical and transparent. He does have that reputation in the market” says Brenda Quaye founder and owner of Venstar. “But also as a female real estate developer I’m kind of an oddity in Minnesota. I know Hoyt is I think one of the largest minority general contractors in the state and [Shaw-Lundquist] is also headquartered over in Eagan so it was a great opportunity for us to work together.”

It isn’t in Hsiao’s nature to dwell on feeling different; it never has been.

“I remember growing up and being called names or in college going out and people saying things to me. It never really bothered me” Hsiao says. “I always had friends who were supportive but those things do happen.”

The conversation has been tougher to avoid lately given the spate of blatant racism and violence against Asian-Americans.

Although there has been progress in the building industry inequities built into the system remain says Hsiao. “Are there things that we can do to make it more equal? Will it ever be fully equal?” he asks posing the questions he often hears. “I don’t know.”

But he’s comfortable as a role model and business leader. Hsiao is in demand as a board member locally. He joined the board of the University of Minnesota Foundation in November 2020 his alma mater where he majored in business. He is also on the board of the Minnesota Chamber Foundation and the Children’s Theatre Co. He has been on the board of the Minneapolis-based Metropolitan Economic Development Association since being named the organization’s Entrepreneur of the Year in 2015.

“Hoyt has been a great client for MEDA for many many years” says Edgardo Rodriguez a business consultant with MEDA. He notes that MEDA worked with Shaw-

Lundquist to help with the transition of the business from father to son and says that Hsiao also took part in a three-year MEDA entrepreneurial leadership program.

“Under his leadership they have done just fantastic. He’s still looking to grow” says Rodriguez.

“He has really given back to the community in a very very big way.”

Looking to the future the third Hsiao generation is not quite ready to step into management.

Hsiao 56 laughs and mentions his daughter: “She’s five-and-a-half. She’s in kindergarten.”

Welcome to life in America,"Baby got bills

For the last couple of months my wife and I have been playing a quintessentially American game of Guess the Baby Bill. The rules are simple: try to guess exactly how much we would be charged for the birth of our daughter earlier this year. Last week the hospital bill finally came putting an end to the guessing game. The cost of an uncomplicated vaginal birth? $37617.69.

I won’t repeat what I said when we got this bill because it is unprintable. My language became particularly colourful when scrutinizing the bill I noticed that the bulk of the charge was for three nights’ “room and board” in a semi-private room (containing two beds separated by a curtain) which was $10350 a night. That’s five times more expensive than a completely private suite at the Ritz-Carlton by Central Park. The post-delivery hospital room by the way was more budget motel than the Ritz. It was barely big enough to swing a baby and I had to sleep in an office chair squeezed by my wife’s bed. To add insult to economic injury the hospital also marked me down as “male” on the baby’s birth certificate and we’ve spent the last two months trying – and failing – to get this changed.

Anyway the good news is that we don’t have to pay the entire bill: our health insurance covers about $31000 – leaving us with a balance of around $6000. Although of course that doesn’t make the ridiculously high prices OK. We’re still covering the costs indirectly via our enormous insurance premiums. Which we were recently informed by Oxford Health part of UnitedHealth Group are going to go up by 16% next year. But it’s understandable I guess. They need that money to do the things health companies are supposed to do: maximise profits boost the share price and pay their executives huge amounts of money. The UnitedHealth Group’s chief executive made over $50m in salary bonus and stock option compensation in 2019.

It’s not just the extortionate prices in America’s health system that are problematic. It’s the lack of transparency. My partner called our insurance company multiple times before the birth to try to find out how much we would expect to pay. We were told on each occasion that we wouldn’t have to pay anything. Which was obviously baloney as nothing in the US healthcare system is free. Then again nothing in the US healthcare system seems to have a fixed price. It seems like medical providers come up with the largest number they think they can get away with charge you that and then wait for you to spend three months of your life haggling about the bill. I’m not sure Franz Kafka himself could have envisaged a bureaucratic system as nightmarishly opaque and absurd as American healthcare.

America’s healthcare system isn’t just a nightmare to navigate – it’s inefficient and inequitable. The US may spend more on healthcare as a share of the economy than any other developed country but it also has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world and maternal deaths have been increasing since 2000. And Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women.

Sadly while there’s a growing desire among Americans for a single-payer system it doesn’t look like healthcare in America is going to grow more affordable or equitable any time soon. Joe Biden campaigned on the idea of creating a public insurance option but plans for that seem to have fizzled out. Meanwhile across the Atlantic things are not looking much better: Britain’s NHS is slowly and stealthily being privatized.

Do you know what the saddest thing about my hospital bill is? In the grand scheme of American healthcare the $6000 we have to pay really isn’t so bad. Lauren Bard an ER nurse from California for example got hit with a bill for $898984.57 when her daughter arrived at just 26 weeks. You’d think a nurse would get pretty good health insurance from her employer but Dignity Health whose motto is “Hello humankindness” refused to cover the costs until the media company ProPublica got involved. $6000 is a lot of money but it could have been a lot worse.

Still if we lose our minds and decide to have another kid in the US then I’m hiring a midwife and popping the kid out at the Ritz.

So George W Bush is a feminist now huh?

Bush has criticized the western withdrawal from Afghanistan in an interview with a German broadcaster saying he fears Afghan women and girls will “suffer unspeakable harm”.

That’s certainly true – but the way the US pretends the forever war in Afghanistan is about protecting women rather than protecting America’s military interests is disgusting.

All you need to know about Ashok Gehlot’s Ayushman Bharat-like programme implemented from May 1,"While many states have opted for the Modi government’s ambitious healthcare scheme Ayushman Bharat Yojana since it was launched in 2018 states ruled by opposition parties like the Congress and the Trinamool Congress decided to roll out their own schemes on similar lines. While the West Bengal government led by Mamata Banerjee came out with the Swasthya Sathi scheme way back in 2016 last month Rajasthan also came out with a similar scheme called Chiranjeevi Yojana. Telangana also has a similar scheme called Aarogyasri Health Insurance Scheme. Naveen Patnaik led Odisha also has been providing healthcare benefits to citizens under Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana.

In Rajasthan according to government data the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) covers about 6o lakh families which is about 40 per cent of the total population. The state government now claims to have covered the entire population though a section will have to pay Rs 850 to get the benefits.

Launching the scheme Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said “The biggest healthcare scheme is aimed at providing medical relief to the residents of the state. The registrations have already begun. This scheme is one more milestone aimed at bringing about a huge difference in the health standards of citizens of the state as it puts health as the focal point of concern. The scheme entitles citizens to avail cashless treatment across all state hospitals.”

When asked whether the Rajasthan government brought this as a counter to the Ayushman Bharat scheme Aruna Rajoria IAS CEO State Health Assurance Agency said that Chiranjeevi Yojana is for all but PM-JAY only covers poor and vulnerable families. “The Ayushman Bharat Scheme only covers poor and vulnerable families based on deprivation and occupational criteria as per the SECC database. However Mukhyamantri Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojna is for all citizens of the state” she said.

Rajoria also said that beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat are covered under the Chiranjeevi scheme. She said that the Chiranjeevi scheme has all packages offered under the Ayushman Bharat it also extends several other packages such as those for treatment of Covid-19 Mucormycosis and haemodialysis. She claimed that in the MM Chiranjeevi Scheme almost 75 per cent of the population will have to pay no premium.

Recently many hospitals in Rajasthan were found violating the rules and denied treatment under the scheme. However they were willing to offer treatment if paid in cash and not under the scheme. This raised a serious question on the implementation and compliance part. Aruna Rajoria said that the state government has taken serious note of the issue and strict action has been ordered against such hospitals.

“The state government has ordered strict action against any empanelled hospital which denied services to registered beneficiaries. Many of such complaints are due to misunderstandings between the hospital staff and the insured person. Being a new scheme at times the patient or even the hospital staff is unclear on several provisions and limits of the offered packages. If money has been taken from any patient of MM Chiranjeevi Swasthay Bima Yojna in relation to covid-19 and mucormycosis (black fungus) between the time period of 1st May to 30th June then that hospital will have to refund it back to patients. Directions have been given to all the district authorities and we are working on that” she said.

She said that the state government is planning to establish a help desk in all empanelled private hospitals. “As a pilot project we started it in ten big empanelled hospitals of Jaipur. We are trying to build a system of referrals too whereby if a patient does not find his treatment package in a hospital he/she can be referred to a hospital having the treatment package. This shall help better delivery of healthcare services for all citizens” she stated.

As many 13386213 families have already registered for the scheme while 113285 people have benefitted so far including COVID-19 treatment cases. Now with a universal healthcare scheme the state is also working to ramp up medical infrastructure in wake of the third COVDI-19 wave. Speaking about the state’s preparations Aruna Rajoria said “Strengthening the health infrastructure is the first step in the direction to tackle the third wave. The state health department is also continuously increasing bed availability at hospitals and health centres. At the beginning of the second wave we increased isolation beds from 42000 to 48000 and now intend to increase the number to 60000. Similarly the number of oxygen supported beds has been increased from 8243 to 17000 and will be further raised to 25550 and ICU beds. The number of ICU beds will be increased to 6000.”

She claimed that the state government has already been working to augment the availability of oxygen and has added nearly 350 MT tonnes of capacity with nearly 40000 oxygen concentrators. “In addition work for the installation of 400 oxygen plants at the major hospital has commenced from the second wave. Training and deployment of staff and sanction have been made for the appointment of 26000 COVID assistants. Also 1000 MBBS doctors are being deployed as COVID consultants. 332 CHCs have also been identified and are being equipped to work as COVID management centres” she said.

Rajasthan has so far administered 27641858 COVID-19 vaccines which includes 22426945 first dose and 5214913 second doses. With vaccination still going at a slow pace amid alleged claims of a supply crunch the state needs to see that its basic healthcare systems remain active and well placed to contain any surge in the COVID-19 cases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uLmFmcmljYS9rZW55YS9jb3VudGllcy9raXJpbnlhZ2EvdXBncmFkaW5nLW9mLWhvc3BpdGFscy10by1ib29zdC11aGMtc2F5cy13YWlndXJ1LTM0NzcxNTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waiguru: I'm committed to leaving a legacy in health sector,"Kianyaga Hospital in Kirinyaga County will be upgraded to level four facility with Sh150 million already having allocated for the project.

According to Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru the upgrading of the hospital will commence in a month's time.

While affirming her commitment to leave a legacy in the health sector Ms Waiguru said she has prioritised improvement of health facilities to ensure access to affordable and quality medical services for the people of Kirinyaga.

The governor also revealed that Kimbimbi Hospital will also be upgraded to a level four facility.

Modern facilities

The upgraded hospital will have a modern theatre specialised maternity wards and expanded male and female wards among others.

At the same time Kerugoya Referral Hospital a five-storey medical complex is nearing completion. The facility has been hailed as one of its kind in the country due to its high-end standards.

It will have specialist consultations with a general surgeon and among others.

Oxygen plant

The medical complex which has an estimated 340-bed capacity will also have an oxygen plant to enable piping of medical oxygen to all the beds.

Several other medical facilities among them health centres and dispensaries which have been refurbished or expanded are lined up for full operation. They include Joshua Mbai dispensary and laboratory Kiamugumo Kiandai Kiamwathi Kavote Ndaba and Kianjiru dispensaries among others.

Governor Waiguru noted that with enough dispensaries residents do not need to travel to higher level hospitals which are very far to seek treatment.

The dispensaries which are among 19 whose construction had stalled but are now on the way to completion.

Residents have been complaining that since the projects stalled the county government has not been taking the matter seriously.

Residents now hopeful

But according to a resident Gibson Njagi they are now hopeful that their problems will come to an end as they will not been travelling long distances to seek treatment once the dispensaries are complete and become operational.

Once complete the dispensaries are expected to serve at least 4000 residents from different villages across the region.

Recently Governor Waiguru said her administration will employ more doctors nurses and other medical workers to work in the newly-built medical complex at the Kerugoya Level Five Hospital and Kimbimbi and Kianyaga hospitals.

More health workers

“The infrastructural development will be complemented by an expanded workforce which will create room for absorption of more medics and also enhance service delivery” she said.

En junio se vendieron 11636 autos un alza de 9.3% respecto al mismo mes del año pasado según datos del Grupo Unido de Importadores de Automóviles (GUIA). Las ventas están 8.3% por debajo de las del mes de mayo (12686) que fueron las más altas desde diciembre. Las ventas de autos se han mantenido por encima de las 10000 unidades mensuales en los últimos nueve meses.

“Dado que para junio del año pasado fue el primer mes durante la pandemia que pudimos abrir el mes entero nos confirma lo que esperábamos que los márgenes de crecimiento comenzarían a reducirse y van bajando sus niveles. Por otro lado para el primer semestre del año ya no lleva el paso histórico que se llevaba. El asunto de la escasez de los ‘microchips’ de computadora ha limitado el inventario fuertemente y por ende el crecimiento. Lo que mantiene aún el leve crecimiento son las inyecciones de fondos federales. La preocupación sigue siendo ‘qué sucederá cuando se vaya acabando y hasta cuándo se impactará la industria nuevamente. Eso se va a tener que atender” indicó Ricardo M. García presidente de GUIA.

En referencia a los segmentos las “SUV’s” con un crecimiento de 60.22% continúan dominando las ventas en el mes seguido por el segmento de las pick-up con un 13.32%.

En 2020 se vendieron 95019 autos 11605 menos que en el 2019 una caída de 10.9% la mayor en los últimos seis años.

Foco innegable de la tauromaquia a todos los niveles representa un papel crucial exigiendo unas cualidades específicas tanto a los toreros como a los toros que se citan en su ruedo desde hace noventa años.

Como bien nos cuenta Paco Aguado periodista taurino de la Agencia EFE y profesor de la Escuela Taurina José Cubero “Yiyo” el principio de la cultura taurina de Madrid se produce en la plaza Mayor donde tienen lugar los primeros festejos relacionados con el toro. El desarrollo de la afición popular exige que se consolide un lugar diferencial y preparado para acoger la Fiesta Nacional y de esta forma la acción taurina se traslada primero a la Plaza de toros de la Puerta de Alcalá y posteriormente a la Plaza de Felipe II el actual WiZink Center.

El torero Joselito “El Gallo” fue uno de los impulsores de la construcción de la Plaza Monumental de Las Ventas en un intento de devolver los toros al pueblo con un mayor aforo y un abaratamiento de las entradas.

Se inaugura en el año 1931 el año de la instauración de la II República aunque aún no está del todo completada puesto que los alrededores no facilitan el acceso. Es en el año 1935 cuando se celebra la primera temporada completa.

Durante la Guerra Civil tiene diferentes usos entre ellos el de huerto y ya en 1939 se celebra la llamada Corrida de la Victoria con Franco en el palco presidencial.

La historia de la plaza de toros de Las Ventas no es únicamente la historia de los toreros y de los toros que han pisado su arena también es la historia de millones de aficionados y de muchos profesionales que de una forma u otra mantienen su vida vinculada a la tauromaquia.

Vicente Zabala de la Serna Chapu Apaolaza Sixto Naranjo o Maxi Pérez son algunos de estos profesionales periodistas taurinos de diferentes medios que recuerdan con claridad cuál fue su primer contacto con Las Ventas la mejor faena que presenciaron en ella o la tragedia que más les sobrecogió.

Las diferentes emociones vividas en este ruedo son parte esencial de su día a día y la plaza de toros de Madrid representa para ellos unos valores distintivos una forma de ver el mundo sin la cual no se imaginan su vida.

Manuel Alonso el conserje de la plaza de toros es el ejemplo más patente de este hecho. Nació en la plaza jugó de niño en su ruedo y en sus tendidos heredó el trabajo de su padre y vive actualmente allí. Conocedor de todos sus recovecos y sus misterios para él la plaza es un nido de recuerdos y vivencias además del lugar donde disfruta de su gran pasión: lo toros.

Otro gran aficionado Faustino Herranz “el Rosco” imprescindible del tendido siete es uno de los representantes de la exigencia máxima de Madrid tanto en lo que al toro como al torero se refiere. Madrid sigue siendo garantía de bravura de casta de templanza y de sentimiento.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZWZlYWdyby5jb20vZ2FuYWRlcmlhLWNhcmFjb2xlcy1wcm9kdWNjaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,El sector del caracol pierde el 60% de las ventas tras más de un año de pandemia,"El sector productor de caracoles ha perdido el 60 % de las ventas tras más de un año de pandemia ya que el 90 % de su comercialización se centra en el canal de la restauración y la hostelería.

En une entrevista con Efeagro el presidente de la Organización Interprofesional del Caracol de Crianza (Interhélix) José Antonio Marcelo asegura que el sector caracolero mira ahora el futuro con cierto optimismo conforme avanza la vacunación y con la apertura creciente de los establecimientos hosteleros.

La pandemia les ha hecho ver la ""gran vulnerabilidad"" que tienen respecto del canal Horeca admite.

Esa es la razón por la que este período de pandemia ha sido ""muy complejo"" con producción sobrante por el cierre de la hostelería y cree que ""costará normalizar"" su funcionamiento.

El exceso de oferta en España se produjo porque se conservó caracol (aunque eso puede hacerse ""3-4 meses"") y a ello se unió la llegada de ejemplares importados cuando ""no se vendía nada"".

Con esta situación ve necesarias las ayudas para la conservación ""soportar"" esta situación o afrontar las pérdidas por caracoles muertos en los criaderos sin salir al mercado.

Se queja del escaso apoyo recibido por las administraciones de las que obtuvieron principalmente ""muy buenas palabras"".

La experiencia vivida ha sido ""dura"" y ""ha puesto en evidencia la necesidad"" de avanzar en productos ""innovadores"" y por ello están incluidos en grupos operativos según remarca.

Al granjero indica ""hay que implicarlo"" en proyectos de innovación para desarrollarlo en sus explotaciones pues hay margen para innovar por ejemplo en la búsqueda de productos más saludables.

Un sector ""joven""

De hecho señala que hay ""todo por hacer"" porque el sector es ""relativamente joven"" y ""hace 30 años que nació"" en España.

A pesar de ello son pioneros en áreas de la genética o la nutrición del caracol para mejorar el producto.

A su juicio es en la restauración ""media-alta"" donde el caracol tiene que ""posicionarse"" porque el consumidor está dispuesto a pagar ""más por un alimento diferente"" que no puede entrar a competir en precio con los importados desde terceros países.

""Si hacemos lo mismo que todo el mundo nos vamos a un nicho de competitividad por precios y hay que ir a competitividad por calidad. Ahí es necesario buscar un caracol más saludable u organolépticamente mejorado y para todo esto hace falta innovación"" resume.

Innovaciones

Una de esas innovaciones son los caracoles probióticos desarrollados a partir del descubrimiento hace ""muchos años"" de una cepa de lactobacillus propia del caracol que se puede usar para conseguir animales más saludables con una menor necesidad de tratamientos veterinarios.

En cuanto a nichos de mercado por profundizar está la penetración en los hogares en los que Marcelo cree que pueden crecer a través de un impulso a los platos preparados que incluyen caracol en sus ingredientes como elemento principal o secundario.

""Hay un camino por recorrer que puede ser muy interesante y animo a las empresas transformadoras a que lo introduzcan como un ingrediente más"" apostilla.

El papel de las interprofesionales

Por otro lado valora el hecho de que el sector haya sido capaz de crear una Interprofesional organizaciones que las ve ""muy útiles"" pero ""infrautilizadas"".

En su opinión ""no hay una apuesta firme por parte de la Administración"" para impulsarlas y defiende que deberían servir para ""algo más que una extensión de norma"".

De hecho manifiesta que la Administración ""no nos convoca desde hace cinco años"" cuando ""consideramos que podría haber muchas sinergias entre las interprofesionales

De acuerdo a sus datoslos criadores de caracoles utilizan esta actividad normalmente como una ""renta complementaria"" a su negocio principal pero ""sí hay gente que vive"" del caracol y aunque es un sector ""pequeño"" dentro de la producción primaria tiene su ""importancia"" sobre todo en el ""desarrollo rural""."

This article describes how to monitor your data usage so that you don't exceed the data limit on your mobile data plan. This is especially important when you're traveling outside your wireless carrier's normal coverage area because data usage caps might be lower.

Use a Mobile App

Download an app for your smartphone to track data usage and in some cases even turn off your data before you get to a pre-defined limit:

For Android there's the popular My Data Manager app which tracks data for everyone on a shared or family plan. It identifies which apps use the most data and has alerts to notify you before you run out of data.

For iPhone users DataManPro tracks your data usage in real-time and posts a red percentage badge on the app icon so you can see where you stand at a glance. It works with all carriers and the app maps where you used data. The app has an accompanying Apple Watch app.

Also for iPhone users MobiStats is a free iPhone app that tracks your usage in real-time and maps where you use the data so you can monitor your behavior and not go over your monthly data limit.

Check Data Usage From an Android Device

To check your current month's usage on your Android phone go to Settings > Connections > Data Usage. The screen shows your billing period and the amount of cellular data you've used so far. You can also set a mobile data limit on this screen.

“Hearst Magazines and Verizon Media may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.”

Might wanna let that pile of bucket hats you just ordered know that a trucker hat is joining their ranks because the neon green “New York” hat that Hailey Bieber’s been wearing this summer is officially on sale at Urban Outfitters.

Hailey’s been spotted in the hat a few times on both her and Justin Bieber’s Insta Stories and she also posted it to the grid for posterity (swipe to see it in all its glory):

According to @HaileyBieberCloset the hat was previously sold out—but it looks like it’s back AND on sale for $19.99 from $30.

Hailey and Justin have been on a few vacations this summer including to Las Vegas with friends. Hailey recently hopped online to shut down false speculation that Justin was caught yelling at her on the trip saying “Reminiscing on how amazing last weekend was. Had the best time surrounded by so much love. Any other narrative floating around is beyond false. Don’t feed into the negative bullshit peeps.”

A source also told E! News that the couple had an amazing time with friends on the trip saying “[Justin] looked really happy to be singing and was dancing and vibing with the crowd he was smiling and in a great mood. Several bottles of 818 tequila were brought out by club employees and everyone was chanting ‘818’ and holding the bottles in the air. They were serving specialty cocktails with 818 including one that Kendall created and had bottles on tables throughout the club.”

Kay got it now off to buy this hat bye!

Laura Stevens has been in and out of hospitals for most of her life after being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby. At eight years old she lost over half of her lung capacity after contracting an infection. Then in 2019 there was a period where she was near death her mother says.

""I can't laugh with her anymore because if I do she gets so short of breath and it's so hard"" said Stevens.

When that happens ""everything kind of feels serious and not fun"" she added.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal and progressive genetic disease that affects over 4300 Canadians. The illness causes a buildup of mucus in the body that leads to severe respiratory issues and other related complications.

Last month Health Canada issued a notice of compliance for Trikafta a prescription drug developed by Toronto-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals for some people with cystic fibrosis.

Laura left and Stevens right are shown here speaking at a fundraiser. (Submitted by Sandy Stevens)

The notice means the drug can be put on the market. It was approved for use in people aged 12 and older with the F508del mutation — the most common to cause cystic fibrosis.

The drug is the ""single greatest innovation in the history of cystic fibrosis"" and could potentially increase the life expectancy of children with CF by over nine years Cystic Fibrosis Canada a national non-profit devoted to finding a cure for the disease said in a news release .

Trikafta could reduce the number of people living with severe lung disease by 60 per cent and the number of deaths by 15 per cent the release adds.

Laura Stevens has educated herself on the drug and spoken with people who have used it. She now has a new hope for life and plans for her future said Stevens.

""She talks about being over 50 which is not what she thought"" Stevens said.

""It gives so much hope.""

The next steps to access

There are still several things that must happen before Canadians with CF can access Trikafta.

The pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance which aims to create cost-effective drug plans determines the price and conditions of coverage on behalf of provincial and territorial governments.

Those governments then must decide whether to publicly list the drug in their formulary — essentially a list of prescription drugs that are paid for by a health plan.

Some people may choose to pay for the drug through private insurance. But that is not an option for other Canadians including Stevens and her daughter.

Stevens joined forces with Sharon Stepaniuk a mother with two children with cystic fibrosis in 2019 to advocate for the Alberta government to include Trikafta and other treatments on its public formulary.

""Alberta has been a leader for adding these modulators to the provincial funding formulary in the past"" said Stepaniuk.

""I do feel hopeful that Alberta will lead the way when it comes to listing this as part of the public formulary.""

Alberta is waiting on final recommendations regarding coverage from the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health — a non-profit that gives information to health-care leaders about optimal drug use and medical devices. The province will review the information before deciding whether to add Tikafta to the formulary a provincial spokesperson told CBC News in a statement.

Alberta is taking steps to ""streamline its listing processes"" so people can access the drug as soon as possible the spokesperson said.

""Having access to this medication is important to Albertans with cystic fibrosis and we look forward to providing this medication to all eligible patients.""

For Laura Stevens the medication means she can laugh more.

""I just want to laugh. I want to be able to laugh without coughing and trying to catch my breath"" her mother recalls Laura saying.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here’s what it means for customers and the payment system in India:

Why have these companies been barred from enrolling new customers?

On July 14 the RBI imposed restrictions on Mastercard Asia Pacific Pte Ltd from onboarding new domestic customers (debit credit or prepaid) in India from July 22 citing non-compliance with guidelines for storage of data in India. The RBI said it had given almost three years for Mastercard to comply with the regulatory directions but it was unable to complete the process.

In April this year the RBI had imposed restrictions on American Express Banking Corp and Diners Club International Ltd from enrolling new domestic customers onto their card networks from May 1 2021 also citing non-compliance of storage of data.

Will existing card users and banks be affected?

No. Existing customers using a credit card or a debit card with Mastercard American Express or Diners Club as the payment network can continue using these. Banks and non-banking finance companies that were planning to use these payment networks won’t be able to use these platforms to enrol new customers until the RBI lifts the ban.

“This leaves only Visa Inc and homegrown NPCI’s RuPay as payment providers under no restrictions currently. We don’t know if Visa has fulfilled all the requirements of data localisation as envisaged in the Storage of Payment System Data circular of the RBI. In the near term we don’t foresee any material impact on card issuers (especially credit card issuers) but there could be a medium-term impact if this situation persists” banking group Nomura said in a report. Banks that were planning for new customers through Mastercard will have to look at Visa for enrolment.

Yes Bank RBL Bank and Bajaj Finserv are likely to be most impacted as their entire card schemes are allied with Mastercard Nomura said. Around 60% of HDFC Bank’s card schemes are tied to Mastercard Diners and AmEx. For ICICI Bank and Axis Bank 35-36% are linked to Mastercard. The card portfolio of Kotak Mahindra Bank is allied with Visa.

What do the RBI guidelines stipulate?

By the RBI circular on Storage of Payment System Data dated April 6 2018 all system providers were directed to ensure that within six months the entire data (full end-to-end transaction details information collected or carried or processed as part of the message or payment instruction) relating to payment systems operated by them is stored in a system only in India. They were also required to report compliance to the RBI and submit a board-approved system audit report conducted by a CERT-In empanelled auditor within the timelines specified. However credit and card firms with global operations have been resisting the move citing costs security risk lack of clarity timeline and the possibility of data localisation demand from other countries.

According to Kazim Rizvi Founding Director of think-tank The Dialogue the RBI’s decision to restrict entities from onboarding new customers is a crucial development in their endeavour to ensure that all payment system operators store or localise their end-to-end transaction data only in India. “The motivation behind such a move is to carry out effective law enforcement requirements as data access for law enforcement purposes has been a challenge” Rizvi said.

Why have these firms not complied?

The RBI had stipulated that data should be stored only in India and no copy — or mirroring — should be stored in other countries. Payment firms like Visa and Mastercard which currently store and process Indian transactions outside the country have said their systems are centralised and expressed the fear that transferring the data storage to India will cost them millions of dollars. Besides once it happens in India there could be similar demands from other countries upsetting their plans.

What has upset foreign players is that domestic payment companies including e-commerce firms which are storing the data within India were putting pressure for data storage within the country. While the Finance Ministry had suggested some easing of norms in transferring the data the RBI has refused to budge stating that the payment systems need closer monitoring in the wake of the rising use of digital transactions. It’s not clear if Visa has obliged the RBI and transferred data storage to India.

Is there a way out?

Experts agree that it is necessary for all entities to comply with the RBI’s localisation mandate. “At the same time however it’s true that hard localisation may impact India’s payments ecosystem” Rizvi said.

“To have a more effective mechanism for law enforcement we need to move beyond MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty) which is slow and ineffective to a system based on bilateral treaties on data transfers with the EU UK and the US. Here the idea must be to ensure that Indian law enforcement requirements of access to data are met in a timely manner while at the same time allowing data flows to foster innovation and trade in the tech ecosystem” Rizvi said. However the RBI is against the suggestion that a copy of data stored outside be brought to India.

What’s the role of card networks?

Firms such as Mastercard Visa and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) are Payment System Operators authorised to operate a card network in India under the Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) Act 2007. Under the Act the RBI is the authority for the regulation and supervision of payment systems in India. The RBI’s payment system enables payments to be effected between a payer and a beneficiary and involves the process of clearing payment or settlement or all of them.

Funds transferred using debit or credit cards are routed through platforms such as Mastercard Visa and NPCI. The RBI has decided to allow non-bank entities — Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers card networks White Label ATM (WLA) operators Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms – to become members of the centralised payment system (CPS) and effect fund transfer through RTGS and NEFT.

How big is India’s card business?

According to RBI data there were 90.23 crore debit cards and 6.23 crore credit cards in India as of May 2021. There were 57841.30 lakh debit and credit card transactions valued at Rs 12.93 lakh crore during 2020-21. Of these debit card transactions accounted for a volume of 40200.24 lakh valued at Rs 6.62 lakh crore.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc3VuZGF5dGltZXMubGsvMjEwNzE4L2J1c2luZXNzLXRpbWVzL2F2YW50aGktY29sb21iYWdlLW5ldy12aXNhLWNvdW50cnktbWFuYWdlci1mb3Itc3JpLWxhbmthbWFsZGl2ZXMtNDQ5MzIwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Avanthi Colombage new Visa Country Manager for Sri Lanka/Maldives,"Avanthi Colombage new Visa Country Manager for Sri Lanka/Maldives View(s):

Marlene took great pride in wearing fashionable attire as well as making her home fashionable. Holidays were important to her as creativity was showcased during Thanksgiving and Christmas. She wanted to shine and it had to be “her way” or the highway. It was just Joy in her Soul to make you Happy! However Marlene’s biggest addiction may have been sending you cards (money included) throughout her lifetime. This addiction continued ….. even though she was 88 years old.

In Marlene’s later years of being home Marlene’s daily routine was checking in on her sisters Sarah and Clara and keeping others on the phone until “she” said Goodbye; but at the end of the day she forever cherished the memories of just hanging out with her grandchildren when they were little kids.

Marlene had certain sayings and wishes that she held close to her heart. One of her sayings was “one day at a time” and another was “you just don’t know how you gonna leave this world” Her wish and prayer was for the Lord to bring all of her children home together before she left this old world.

Marlene held close to her heart her Berkley families: the Hardys the Eures the Smiths; God daughters Shelby Janice Evon; Lifelong friends Celestine Lillian Liz Catherine Sadie Delores and other Friends

Pacetti Senior Product Manager Wabtec

The Challenge

In today’s automated economy there is a growing expectation among shippers for digital tools to support business needs. One of the challenges shippers have is knowing when railcars will arrive. Shippers ask:

Do I have enough railcars to meet production demand? If not how can I be proactive?

Where are my railcars right now?

When will my railcars arrive?

Can we accommodate this change to our production forecast?

How can I take advantage of the scalability and cost effectiveness of rail without compromising delivery performance?

Railroads that can help shippers track and organize railcar shipments unlock growth potential by making rail easier to use.

Solving Pain Points

RailConnect™ Visibility and Planning is a cloud-based software solution that brings transparency to the railcar supply chain and streamlines railcar planning scheduling and communication – all from one convenient application. Designed for shippers of railroads using RailConnect Transportation Management the solution gives transportation departments the visibility control and efficiency they need to keep production moving and scale their business through rail.

Longer term the vision for RailConnect Visibility and Planning is to become a true one stop shop information and communication portal for rail shippers and equipment owners. We are expanding what visibility means in the railroad world. Beyond ETA car locations and status RailConnect Visibility and Planning is being built to allow more types of visibility for example railcar health charges and price lookup. The goal is transparency between railroads and their shippers – making rail easy to use and unlocking its growth potential.

A jury ruled Walmart violated the American’s with Disabilities Act when it fired a longtime employee who claimed she was wrongfully terminated.

As a result the jury awarded $125 million to Marlo Spaeth who has Down syndrome. According to the Herald Times Reporter the compensation will be capped at $300000 because of federal regulation.

The jury awarded Spaeth $150000 in compensatory damages and $125000000 in punitive damages after deliberating for three hours following the four-day trial.

""The substantial jury verdict in this case sends a strong message to employers that disability discrimination is unacceptable in our nation’s workplaces"" said Charlotte A. Burrows chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ""All of those who come forward to ensure the right to a workplace free of discrimination do a service to our nation. Thank you to them and to my colleagues at the EEOC whose excellent work investigating and litigating the case made this important verdict possible.""

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes Down syndrome as a condition present in people with an extra chromosome. The extra chromosome affects how a person’s brain and body develop often resulting in mental and physical challenges.

But that didn’t seem to hinder Spaeth’s performance at work. According to the EEOC Spaeth had received positive performance evaluations in her 16-year stint with Walmart. But a schedule change in 2015 caused her significant difficulty.

When she requested to adjust her start and end times by an hour to 90 minutes the retail giant fired her instead the EEOC said.

""The jury here recognized and apparently was quite offended that Ms. Spaeth lost her job because of needless — and unlawful — inflexibility on the part of Walmart"" said Gregory Gochanour regional attorney of the EEOC’s Chicago District Office.

And when Spaeth requested to be reinstated Walmart turned her down because they would’ve had to accommodate her disability the EEOC claimed.

The EEOC filed a lawsuit on Spaeth’s behalf in 2017 which ended with last week’s verdict.

""Employers no matter how large have an obligation under the law to evaluate the individual circumstances of employees with disabilities when considering requests for reasonable accommodations"" said Chicago District Director Julianne Bowman. ""Ms. Spaeth’s request was a simple one and denying it profoundly altered her life.""

A 63-year-old Youngsville man was arrested this weekend after a mother claims he tried to pull down her 11-year-old daughter's pants at a Walmart in Wake Forest on Friday night.

Police have accused Raymond Leonard Mancini of harassing the girl sometime after 9:30 p.m. inside the aisles of the Walmart on South Main Street. After the incident he fled the building according to officials.

He was charged with second-degree kidnapping and taking indecent liberties with a child. He has his first court appearance at 2 p.m. on Monday.

Holly Haag said she was in an aisle looking at Insta Pots while her daughter looked at cups feet away.

Raymond Mancini was arrested for second degree kidnapping and indecent liberties with a child.

While separated a man approached her child.

""He followed my daughter and went up to her and says 'Sorry I have to do this'"" recalled Haag.

Haag said the man grabbed her daughter and tried to pull down her pants.

""She screamed 'Mom!' He put his hands up and says 'I'm leaving now.' And she was terrified"" said Haag.

The girl was not hurt in the incident which is under investigation.

""The safety of our customers is something we take seriously"" said Tyler Thomason senior manager at Walmart Corporate Communications.

He said that the store did initiate a lockdown once notified of the attempted assault and assisted law enforcement in finding the suspect.

Haag said she wanted to go public about what happened to warn others.

""I wanted to make sure he is caught. I don't want this to happen to any other family or any other child"" she said.

Whether it’s Disneyland Resort in California Walt Disney World in Florida or an international park like Disneyland Paris Disney’s theme park empire is the most magical around. Offering stellar entertainment thrilling rides and emotional fireworks performances there’s no better vacation than a Disney vacation. Even celebrities can’t stay away!

And yet despite its shiny exterior magical moments and memorable experiences sometimes spooky things happen — and no not the fun-filled Halloween parties. Back in 2009 security cameras at the original Disney Resort Disneyland caught a suspected ghost wandering the park and some fans thought it was Walt Disney…

Walt Disney opened Disneyland in 1955 with the Disney Park recently celebrating its 66th birthday (Happy Birthday!). The Disneyland Resort continues to grow with new additions like Avengers Campus having opened this year. Despite the Walt Disney World Resort leading the charge in terms of the vastness and sheer volume of theme parks in one Resort the Disneyland Resort is still a cherished part of the Disney theme park portfolio.

Whether you’re visiting Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at Disneyland Park or Cars Land at Disney California Adventure Park California’s Disney Resort in Anaheim has lots to do for everyone. And while all this magic-making happens during the day and through into the night it’s a wonder what happens in the Disney Parks after hours.

Well according to this old security footage nighttime at Disneyland is when the ghosts come out. You may be thinking “but there are ghosts on the famous Haunted Mansion ride” — and yes you would be correct but the security cameras at Disneyland may have caught another even more special ghost roaming their park after all the Guests and Disney characters had gone home.

The owner himself.

Sharing to TikTok @WeirdWonderz showed the old security camera footage that has resurfaced from the California theme park.

In fact The Mirror also shared information on the footage a few years ago offering an insight into the video’s popularity at the time.

The footage was originally captured back in 2009 but has begun circulating around the Internet again after it was suggested that the ghostly spectre could be the wandering spirit of the park’s original owner Walt Disney.

The collection of footage shows what looks like a figure roaming around the parks. Seen in multiple locations the “ghost” walks eerily like a person which would lend to the theory that this is the founder of the Disney Park Walt Disney himself. You never know he may have wanted to check in on Sleeping Beauty Castle or visit the attractions at Fantasyland or Frontierland — or just to make sure that the Happiest Place On Earth is exactly how he imagined.

There is no way of knowing if this myth is true so for now it will remain as such. But there is something rather special about fans imagining that this “ghost” is Walt Disney — almost as though he is checking that the park is all in order before it opens to the next batch of Guests.

ANAHEIM Calif. -- Disneyland the only theme park designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney opened on Sunday July 17 1955. Construction lasted for exactly one year and cost only $17 million to complete. See what it looked like back in the day in the video above.

The opening was only intended for about 11000 invited guests and press though a total of 28000 attended due to a rush of counterfeit tickets. The event was telecast by ABC anchored by actors Art Linkletter Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan who were all friends of Walt Disney. Although initially intended to be a preview event preceding the opening to the public the next day Disneyland adopted July 17 as the official date of its opening and birthday.

On the first day Disneyland offered five themed ""lands"" with a total of 20 attractions. At the start of the telecast Walt Disney made his opening dedication speech.

""To all who come to this happy place: welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals the dreams and the hard facts that have created America with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world.""

Unbeknownst to Walt Disney or the television audience the press event was rife with problems in large part due to the unexpectedly large crowd and scorching outside temperatures of over 100 degrees. Drinking fountains were dry restaurants ran out of food rides were breaking down and a gas leak in Fantasyland caused half the park to temporarily close. Company insiders would later refer to opening day as ""Black Sunday.""

Walt Disney worked hard to restore faith in the park inviting the press to return again once the problems had been sorted out.

Disneyland has changed a great deal over the past six decades but many of the attractions that were operating on opening day are still there today albeit renovated or slightly tweaked.

""Imagineers are tasked to do the impossible things to create magic for our guests all over the world"" Lomboy told us noting that Imagineers combine so many disciplines but their overall intent ""is to create magic for everyone everywhere.""

The series focuses on a number of beloved Disney attractions but Lomboy — whose favorite is Pirates of the Caribbean — pointed out that Imagineers are always looking to create that next generation of ""classic"" attractions that parkgoers will love for many years to come. Being an Imagineer is ""incredibly special"" according to Lomboy. She remembers the joy and magic she felt at Disneyland as a young girl and says Imagineers are always working to create those magical moments for everyone: ""We do it for our families our friends our children our loved ones and the guests that we don't know around the world.""

You can see how Lomboy and other Imagineers make magic at Disney parks around the world and watch the first five episodes of the new series on Disney+ starting on July 21 with more to come later this year. And don't worry learning how these classic attractions were made won't ruin the magic; instead you'll walk away with an even greater appreciation for all the incredible effort that goes into making each guest experience memorable.

It’s broken into two parts: Magic Kingdom Park and Magic Kingdom Disney Resorts. We’re currently working on guides to Disney World’s additional parks but wanted to make sure we had the big one covered first!

This year some eateries at Disney World’s Magic Kingdom have temporarily closed and some have downsized their menus. This has affected the amount of dairy-free and allergy-friendly options available but not too much! The guide below covers the food options available as of the summer of 2021. We will update as we learn about more openings and menu expansions.

Disney World: Your Dairy-Free Guide to the Magic Kingdom

Using the map of the parks we’ve listed the Magic Kingdom sections clockwise from the entrance – or heading left when you enter the park. The Disney hotels and resorts near the Magic Kingdom are also listed clockwise starting on the east side of the park and ending on the west side. If you discover any changes or find some additional dairy-free options kindly leave a comment!

Please Note: In many cases the dairy-free or food allergy-friendly options at Disney World require special ordering. So always let the staff know what your dietary needs are and if you have a food allergy. Disney World restaurants have protocols in place for handling allergy orders. Menu items and ingredients are subject to change at any time and potential cross-contamination with allergens should always be considered a risk in commercial kitchens. The following is a guide for informational purposes. It is intended to help with your planning but should not replace your own due diligence. Only you can decide what is “safe” for your needs.

Magic Kingdom Park: MAIN STREET

Casey’s Corner – This hot dog spot serves two different plant-based dairy-free sausage dogs plain and one with a pickled slaw and vegan aioli.

Some people have reported gluten-free dairy-free buns at this establishment (that contain egg) but we aren’t sure on their current availability.

Disney World Food Allergy & Special Diet Information

Guests with food allergies or intolerances are allowed to bring food into Disney World parks and into the restaurants. When you enter the park let the Security Cast Member at bag check know that someone in your party has a food allergy or intolerance. They can’t store any food for you and there are no preparation facilities on site but you can carry around ready-to-eat food yourself.

According to Disney World food allergic guests who are dealing with top allergens do not need to contact restaurants in advance of arrival. Simply discuss any dietary requirements with a Cast Member upon arrival at the restaurant. You can also request to consult with a chef or special diets-trained Cast Member.

Disney World dining staff is also well trained with common special diets like plant-based/vegan low sugar and low carb. So no advanced notice is needed. That said if you have any special diet needs it is helpful to note them if making an online reservation.

Kosher requests should be made at least 24 hours in advance. And if you have less common food allergies or special diet needs Disney World recommends contacting their team at least 14 days in advance of your visit. They can be reached at Special.Diets@DisneyWorld.com.

Is Disney World Truly Allergy-Friendly?

Many years ago Chef Joel Schaefer spearheaded Disney’s groundbreaking food allergy initiatives and ensured that all of their restaurants could better accommodate food-allergic guests. He recognized that Disney restaurants all strived to meet guests’ needs but each restaurant handled food allergies differently and each had its own food allergy procedures.

Schaefer streamlined Disney’s food allergy protocols to create a more consistent system and ensure that every Disney restaurant followed specific company procedures. As a result Disney World’s various restaurants and hotels are widely considered the “gold standard” in serving food-allergic guests allowing families with food allergies to truly enjoy the happiest place on earth.

Collaborating closely with Disney’s food safety department procurement team legal team restaurant chefs and managers Chef Joel trained Disney’s chefs managers cooks and servers on food allergy procedures. Additionally he examined the various products they were using checking to see which were free of the “Big 8″ allergens. During this process he asked for guest feedback wanting to know which brands and products food-allergic guests used themselves.

“Disney guests have many different food allergies so I had to find pancake mix breads beverages and other products that were free of common allergens to serve to guests with various – and often multiple – allergies” Chef Joel explained. The chefs at Disney World were also able to accommodate less common food allergies (besides the “Big 8″) creating customized meals without any of the guests’ “trigger foods”.

“We also designated special equipment for food allergic guests – separate griddles waffle irons etc. – and trained the entire staff on how to avoid cross-contact” Chef Joel continued. Since his time with Disney he has authored the book Serving People with Food Allergies: Kitchen Management & Menu Creation to help other establishments accommodate special diet guests.

I went into Space Jam: A New Legacy without much hope since I thought the premise was bizarre. However I also went in open-minded and I am a mom after all so I thought I’d be able to look at it through my children’s eyes. Honestly I didn’t hate it.

To be fair “didn’t hate it” is probably not what Warner Bros. was going for when they made this sequel to the 1996 film Space Jam. If you check out the scores across IMDB Metacritc and Rotten Tomatoes they suggest that the movie is a definite flop. But this movie wasn’t made for the critics. It was made for the families the kids from the 80s and 90s that grew up with Looney Tunes and Space Jam and literally any regular viewer that follows anything Warner Bros.

If you look at Space Jam: A New Legacy through the eyes of those people and not the critics the score jumps up drastically. Luckily between being a critic and a parent I get the best of both worlds. Yes I can see where the movie lets people down but I can also see how it lifts them up makes them smile and pulls on those nostalgic and parental heartstrings.

Space Jam: A New Legacy follows the fictionalized life of LeBron James and his son Dom (Cedric Joe) on a journey through parenting and following your dreams. How can a story like that go wrong? Of course chaos ensues and they get mixed up with Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) and they are dropped into a virtual world where James is left to hunt down a team to battle against the Goon Squad.

Lebron James leaves something to be desired in terms of his acting abilities. I could identify with his parenting struggles and the story plays on every ounce of mom guilt I’ve ever had unfortunately James’ physical acting and facial expressions weren’t quite up to snuff to consider the acting decent. When the film switched over to animation however his voice acting was absolutely good enough to get by helping out the overall film quality.

“The major issue I can see people having is the constant Warner Bros. plugs.”

Cheadle on the other hand had me entertained the entire time. He was campy but that was what the role called for. His transition from nice-guy to bad-guy was sudden and frequent and I found myself genuinely mad at him for manipulating a child. To me that says he must have been doing something right.

The major issue I can see people having is the constant Warner Bros. plugs. The entire movie is an ad for the company not to mention product placement like Beats by Dre and E3. This comes off overtly obvious which can definitely take away from the enjoyment of the movie. For children they likely won’t understand any of the references so as a kid’s movie it makes no difference.

However I started the film annoyed by it but once it switched over to an animated LeBron James I found the constant references fun. From that point of the movie on they used popular Warner Bros. titles like Harry Potter The Matrix DC Comics and even Mad Max like they were alternate Looney Tunes universes—planets in this case. We see James recreated in each universe like Robin for DC and Wez for Mad Max and our favourite Looney Tunes characters are as well. It was a nice twist on an otherwise obvious advertisement.

“I can see our children falling in love with the characters we grew up with too.”

The characters from each universe are also part of the crowd at the big DomBall game. This made for a fun game of Where’s Waldo so-to-speak for any adults joining in on the Space Jam fun. The Flying Monkeys from Wizard of Oz and the Night King from Game of Thrones were my favourite by far but I’m sure each time you watch the movie you will be able to spot new characters from all sorts of different Warner Bros. properties.

These little hidden easter eggs and several celebrity cameos (Michael B. Jordan) will keep the film fun for adults while the animated comedy is there to please the children. Yes Looney Tunes is a nostalgic franchise for us so of course there were lots of smirks and chuckles but I can see our children falling in love with the characters we grew up with too.

Even though you are inclined to enjoy your favourites like Bugs Bunny and Tweety Bird the writing leaves something to be desired. The subject matter between parent and child is there and does get the points it wants across but in a way that seems more scripted and less natural than it should.

“Space Jam: A New Legacy hit the mark if you’re looking at it for what it is.”

Sonequa Martin-Green portrays James’ wife Kamiyah and does well. Even with the cardboard cut-out kind of script you can see her genuine care for her husband and children even sharing a conversation or two that I’m sure I’ve had in my day-to-day life. Cedric Joe does his part as a child that feels unheard and misunderstood and is believable in most scenes. My favourite supporting role of the film goes to Malik (Khris Davis). He is a ball of over-acted anxiety and even though it was at best cheesy I still found myself smiling when he was on screen.

Space Jam: A New Legacy hit the mark if you’re looking at it for what it is a kid’s movie full of one off quips and animated comedy. It by no means will be winning an Oscar and probably isn’t a movie I would personally watch again but my kids would and in that alone Warner Bros. achieved what they set out to do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL3R2L3JvYmVydC1kb3duZXktanItdGhlLXN5bXBhdGhpemVyLWFkYXB0YXRpb24taGJvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Downey Jr. sets first major TV role in 20 years with 'The Sympathizer' adaptation at HBO,"Robert Downey Jr. is heading back to the small screen in a big way.

The erstwhile Iron Man will costar in a TV adaptation of Viet Thanh Nguyen's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Sympathizer at HBO EW has confirmed. Deadline first reported the news. The series will mark Downey's return to television after two decades being his first regular TV role since Ally McBeal ended in 2002.

Downey will play multiple supporting roles in The Sympathizer as various antagonists including ""an up-and-coming Orange County congressman a CIA agent and a Hollywood film director among others"" according to a press release. Casting is currently underway for the lead role.

Oldboy and The Handmaiden filmmaker Park Chan-wook will direct the series which A24 is producing with Don McKellar serving as co-showrunner alongside Park. Downey and his wife Susan will also executive produce through their Team Downey production company.

Nguyen's novel published in 2015 follows a Vietcong spy secretly living in exile in the U.S. at the end of the Vietnam War. Highly acclaimed the book won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and a sequel The Committed was released in March 2021.

""Adapting Mr. Nguyen's important and masterful work requires a visionary team"" Downey said in a statement. ""With director Park at the helm I expect this to be a creative producing adventure for Susan me and Team Downey and a stimulating process for myself in playing these complex supporting roles. A24 and HBO are the perfect combination of partners and co-parents.… It's exactly the type of challenge I've been craving and I believe we will deliver an exceptional viewing experience to our audience.""

Downey's last onscreen performance was the title role in 2020's Dolittle but he has been busy as a producer on such projects as HBO's Perry Mason and Netflix's Sweet Tooth. A release date for The Sympathizer has yet to be announced.

The win on Saturday was mistakenly announced by jury president Spike Lee at the top of the closing ceremony broadcast in France on Canal+ unleashing a few moments of confusion. Ducournau a French filmmaker didn’t come to the stage to accept the award until the formal announcement at the end of the ceremony. But the early hint didn’t diminish from her emotional response.

“I’m sorry I keep shaking my head” said Ducournau catching her breath. “Is this real? I don’t know why I’m speaking English right now because I’m French. This evening has been so perfect because it was not perfect.”

After several false starts Lee implored Sharon Stone to make the Palme d’Or announcement explaining: “She’s not going to mess it up.”

The problems started earlier when Lee was asked to say which prize would be awarded first. Instead he announced the evening’s final prize as fellow juror Mati Diop plunged her head into her hands and others rushed to stop him.

Lee himself spent several moments with his head in his hands before apologizing profusely for taking a lot of the suspense out of the evening.

“I have no excuses” Lee told reporters afterward. “I messed up. I’m a big sports fan. It’s like the guy at the end of the game who misses the free throw.”

“I messed up” he added. “As simple as that.”

Ducournau’s win was a long-awaited triumph. The only previous female filmmaker to win Cannes’ top honor — among the most prestigious awards in cinema — was Jane Campion for “The Piano” in 1993.

In recent years frustration at Cannes’ gender parity has grown including in 2018 when 82 women — including Agnes Varda Cate Blanchett and Salma Hayek — protested gender inequality on the Cannes red carpet. Their number signified the movies by female directors selected to compete for the Palme d’Or — 82 compared to 1645 films directed by men.

This year four out of 24 films up for the Palme were directed by women.

In 2019 another genre film — Bong Joon-Ho’s “Parasite” — took the Palme before going on to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards too. That choice was said to be unanimous by the jury led by Alejandro González Iñárritu but the award for “Titane” — an extremely violent film — this year’s jury said came out of a democratic process of conversation and debate. Juror Maggie Gyllenhaal said they didn’t agree unanimously on anything.

“The world is passion” said Lee. “Everyone was passionate about a particular film they wanted and we worked it out.”

In “Titane” which like “Parasite” will be distributed in the US by Neon Agathe Rousselle plays a serial killer who flees home. As a child a car accident leaves her with a titanium plate in her head and a strange bond with automobiles. In possibly the most-talked-about scene at the festival she’s impregnated by a Cadillac.

Lee called it a singular experience.

“This is the first film ever where a Cadillac impregnates a woman” said Lee who said he wanted to ask Ducournau what year the car was. “That’s genius and craziness together. Those two things often match up.”

On stage Ducournau thanked the jury “for letting the monsters in.” Afterward she acknowledged to reporters her place in history but also said she “can’t be boiled down to just being a woman.”

“Quite frankly I hope that the prize I received has nothing to do with being a woman” said Ducournau. “As I’m the second woman to receive this prize I thought a lot about Jane Campion and how she felt when she won.”

More women will come after her Ducournau said. “There will be a third there will be a fourth there will be a fifth.”

Cannes’ closing ceremony capped 12 days of red-carpet premieres regular COVID-19 testing for many attendees and the first major film festival to be held since the pandemic began in almost its usual form. With smaller crowds and mandated mask-wearing in theaters Cannes pushed forward with an ambitious slate of global cinema.

Last year’s festival was completely canceled by the pandemic.

The slate assembled as a way to help stir movies after a year where movies shrank to smaller screens and red carpets grew cobwebs was widely considered to be strong and featured many leading international filmmakers. The awards were spread out widely.

The grand prize was split between Asghar Farhadi’s Iranian drama “A Hero” and Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen’s “Compartment No. 6.”

Best Director was awarded to Leos Carax for “Annette” the fantastical musical starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard that opened the festival. The award was accepted by the musical duo Sparks Ron and Russell Mael who wrote the script and music for the film.

Jurors also split the jury prize. That was awarded to both Nadav Lapid’s “Ahed’s Knee” an impassioned drama about creative freedom in modern Isreal; and to Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasthakul’s “Memoria” a meditative film starring Tilda Swinton.

Caleb Landry Jones took home the Best Actor prize for his performance as an Australian mass killer in the fact-based “Nitram” by Justin Kurzel. Renate Reinsve won best actress for Joachim Trier’s “The Worst Person in the World.” Best Screenplay went to Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s “Drive My Car” a Haruki Murakami adaptation he penned with Takamasa Oe.

The Croatian coming-of-age drama “Murina” by Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović took the Camera d’Or award a non-jury prize for best first feature. Kusijanović was absent from the ceremony after giving birth a day earlier.

Lee was the first black jury president at Cannes.

You might be getting bored. Despite being among the fortunate 0.1 percent of Pakistanis who have access to Netflix — or someone who visits illegal torrent or streaming sites media servers on cable internet or DVD shops that copy movies and series on to USB drives — chances are that even with the wealth of options you’re still not enticed by what’s streaming. Perhaps you’ve run out of “good stuff” to watch during the coronavirus pandemic or the excess of options feel like a turn-off?

Well to the people who crave entertainment I have bad news… and then some bad news.

The first bad news is for everyday viewers who can’t settle on what to watch: your chances of not being able to pick a title may involve much more head-scratching in the next two years. Hypothetically speaking if you’re skipping 10 titles to find something good to watch chances are that soon you’ll be skipping 50.

The second bad news: there will be standardised excellence to the quality of productions which will ultimately make every film or serial look the same. When things start looking the same (one can change the production design and story only so much before it starts repeating itself) how would one make the choice of choosing one title over another?

Ah to be able to go back to the good ol’ days when choices were relatively fewer… and easier.

With mega corporate-media mergers happening globally do individual and non-conforming creative voices stand a chance? Do Pakistani start-up platforms? More importantly do audiences?

It has been a little more than six months since we discussed the rapidly escalating global war of giant streaming services Netflix Amazon Prime HBO Max Hulu Disney+ Paramount + and a whole lot of pluses coming our way (The Great OTT War published January 3 2021).

In the months since a new twist has lent itself to the story: corporate mergers.

In the context of showbiz corporate mergers are a standalone genre in its own right ripe with the best clichés of storytelling; they have romance and drama backstabbing and betrayal and billions of dollars at stake as we learn later in this piece.

If you thought superheroes tentpole franchises remakes reboots or films based on toys and video games were the big trend in Hollywood you’re wrong. In historic terms big corporate deals shape the very structure of the industry.

Now before you ask ‘How do corporate mergers influence my choice on what to watch?’ Let me tell you: whatever you see today in any form of entertainment is a direct result of a well-planned corporate philosophy made by people who hold degrees from prestigious business schools.

This is not news. But in a business that thrives on creative choices and artistic freedom to tell stories the corporate influence can be damaging. In an irksome way the productions born from these decisions can feel too calculated as if they’ve been deliberately designed to appeal on a global scale put out specific messages influence cultures and so on (the unwarranted invasion of culture is a long topic for another discussion).

Mergers and acquisitions — the world-shattering kind such as Disney’s meticulously planned takeover of Pixar for 7.4 billion dollars in 2006 Marvel Entertainment (which includes their comic label and film and television rights for a major chunk of characters) for four billion dollars in 2009 Lucas Film (makers of Star Wars and the Indiana Jones movies) for 4.05 billion dollars in 2012 and rival studio 20th Century Fox for a whopping 71.3 billion dollars — are directly responsible for the creation of the wholesome risk-free franchise-spewing barrage of content one regularly sees on screens.

Entertainment is business and business is governed by statistics. If there is a sudden gush of high-profile fantasy series on television or streaming platforms (The Witcher Warrior Nun Cursed Luna Nera Shadow and Bone Fate: The Winx Saga Invisible City Curon debuted on Netflix this past year) or if you’re fed-up with an off-shoot of Star Wars you’re probably witnessing a business decision that’s cashing in on a trend.

The bombardment of excessive ‘quality’ entertainment will not be limited to the streaming platforms either; the synergy of web and traditional entertainment will be absolute and baffling at the same time.

Think: the Marvel cinematic universe that spans across story ‘phases’ in films and series but messier. Case in point: Marvel’s rival DC Comics and their head-scratching universe of series and films that do not have a focal point or aligned continuity (Arrowverse on television Snyderverse in the movies standalone films such as Joker or titles such as Suicide Squad or Shazam lingering somewhere in between).

So yes the reason you’re not seeing a good sensible Superman film — or that there are talks of an African-American Superman movie in the works — is because of a corporate decision. And as you may have realised not all corporate decisions are good ones… especially when creative choices are involved.

Let’s turn back the clock a few months for a developing story that’s changing the very history of two nearly 100-year-old movie studios: Warner Bros. and MGM.

For whom the bells toll

Like a modern-day love story the casual flirting began with emojis according to stories on the topic published in the New York Times (NYT) and other publications.

“You around” tapped David Zaslav the chief executive of Discovery in an email to John Stankey the AT&T chief executive in February. “I’ve been thinking…” the former wrote. Stankey’s reply came back within minutes: “Always scares me when you do that.”

Within weeks a secret union was underway. Stankey through telecom giant AT&T controlled WarnerMedia — an entertainment conglomerate that owns about 30 major brands including Warner Bros. Studios HBO CNN TCM and DC Comics. Zaslav via Discovery Inc. has 20 brands including Discovery Animal Planet OWN (Oprah Winfrey’s channel) Food Network and HGTV.

It was a marriage made in corporate heaven… one that would ease AT&T’s financial burden enabling the telecom giant to concentrate on its core business and not worry about the business-end of WarnerMedia assets which it had been bungling up.

According to the contracts of the union the “spin-off” company (technically called a Reverse Morris Trust) will give AT&T and Discovery Inc. a split of 71 percent and 29 percent respectively and place Zaslav at the helm.

This is not WarnerMedia’s first big merger though. AT&T had acquired Warner Bros. and their sister assets from Time Warner for 85.4 billion dollars in 2018. A similar deal was set in motion in 2011 when AT&T’s competitor Comcast acquired NBC Universal from General Electric (GE).

By March with most internal negotiations between the big-wigs secretly sorted out an important and awkward conversation needed to take place. That happened two months later in early May. Jason Kilar a former Amazon executive and CEO of Hulu and nearly a year-old CEO of WarnerMedia was about to be given the boot after a corporate “Et tu Brutus?” moment.

Kilar was deemed a trail-blazing maverick — he is the man behind the structuring of HBO Max as a global OTT service the architect of the platform’s fierce global roll-out plan and the controversial decision-maker behind releasing all Warner Bros. films on the same day-and-date simultaneously on the streaming service and cinemas.

Yet despite his credentials as a “disruptive force” in the industry who had skyrocketed HBO Max’s appeal internationally (and also angered cinema owners A-list actors and directors) Kilar was kept out of the loop of the deal between Zaslav and Stankey.

On May 14 an extensive profile where Warner and other industry executives sang praises for Kilar was published in the Wall Street Journal. The article was facilitated by AT&T. Kilar however didn’t share the piece with his 37000 Twitter followers according to a NYT article. He instead hired an ace legal team to negotiate his exit from the company that weekend.

According to the rumours Zaslav will be taking over the new iteration of the company temporarily called Warner Bros. Discovery which will let go of the iconic shield logo that had the words WB at its centre. A horrendous cheap-looking makeshift logo of gold letters across an open blue sky was shown to investors at a recent conference. A tagline also in gold reads: ‘The stuff dreams are made of’ — a classic line uttered by Humphrey Bogart’s character from The Maltese Falcon (1941).

If Warner Bros.’ production decisions appeared erratic and inconsistent year after year this past decade one could blame the issue on an ever-changing roster of executives. If Zaslav maintains his reins and all comes to pass one can expect WB to have a radical change of image that’s consistent for the long-run.

By 2022 I doubt much of Kilar’s plans would remain at this new empire when the deal finally comes to pass for Warner Bros. Discovery. The new media giant will be home to Warner Bros. CNN Cartoon Network Discovery Animal Planet HBO HBO Max and an additional 20-odd brands functioning under a singular corporate umbrella.

Like Disney whose corporate philosophy of wholesomeness is embraced by most of its brands (Avengers and the characters’ standalone movies are nothing but wholesome) Warner Bros. Discovery might have a similar overarching set of doctrines in place that would have two goals: design and maintain an image of the company (what that is remains to be seen; WB was once known to be a radical but diverse studio that entertained serious films) and push as much content as possible to broaden the subscriber base.

At another end of Tinseltown another shake-up with a similar outlook was simultaneously in progress.

Amazon who owns their own major streaming service Prime Video announced that it would acquire MGM for 8.5 billion dollars. The price was 40 percent more than other prospective buyers Apple and Comcast deemed it worth. MGM as its chief Louis B. Mayer once bragged was “home to more stars than the heavens”.

That was in the golden days of Hollywood. Today after decades of losses MGM was slowly on the road to financial recovery before the pandemic hit. It had been shopped around for months before Amazon snagged it.

Despite most of its classic pre-1986 film library sold off decades ago (classics such as Singin’ in the Rain The Wizard of Oz and Gone to the Wind are owned by Warner Bros) and the studio lot recently bought by Sony Pictures the roaring old lion still owns 17000 episodes of television content and 4000 movies including Rocky Robocop The Pink Panther The Silence of the Lambs Legally Blond Moonstruck Basic Instinct Tomb Raider and James Bond.

The excessive price for MGM has a reason. In today’s world when corporate takeovers are creating mammoth media conglomerates catering to worldwide audiences streaming services such as Amazon Netflix or HBO Max need time-tested intellectual properties (IPs) and as many brands as possible in their arsenal.

Obviously studios who already own IPs are unwilling to license their libraries to rival platforms (notice how slowly Disney Paramount and Warner Bros. titles are going away from Netflix). With exception to Sony who has a long-term deal with Netflix and which technically doesn’t own a major OTT (the studio owns Sony Liv an India-specific streaming service with limited international growth) every major studio is forced to bolster its own streaming service with new and old content.

“The acquisition thesis here is very simple” said Amazon head Jeff Bezos during an annual shareholder meeting. MGM has a “vast deep catalogue of much-beloved” movies and shows that Amazon “can reimagine and redevelop for the 21st century.”

According to a report from the NYT Bezos said that the “work would be fun” and “people who love stories will be the big beneficiaries.”

The MGM buyout doesn’t sit well with John Logan the three-time Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Gladiator Aviator and Hugo and the James Bond movies Skyfall and Spectre.

Logan wrote an extensive op-ed in the NYT voicing his concerns over the future of Bond now that MGM owns 50 percent of the franchise (the other 50 percent is owned by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of Eon productions owners of the cinematic rights of Bond).

“The reason we’re still watching Bond movies after more than 50 years is that the family (Barbera and Michael) has done an extraordinary job of protecting the character through the thickets of moviemaking and changing public tastes. Corporate partners come and go but James Bond endures. He endures precisely because he is being protected by people who love him” wrote Logan.

“The current deal with Amazon gives Barbara and Michael who own 50 percent of the Bond empire ironclad assurances of continued artistic control. But will this always be the case? What happens if a bruising corporation like Amazon begins to demand a voice in the process? What happens to the comradeship and quality control if there’s an Amazonian overlord with analytics parsing every decision? What happens when focus groups report they don’t like Bond drinking martinis? Or killing quite so many people? And that English accent’s a bit alienating so could we have more Americans in the story for marketability?

“If you think I’m exaggerating consider some internal polling data that decreed that the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd — for which I wrote the screenplay — would be much more popular without all those annoying songs” he argues.

“From my experience here’s what happens to movies when such concerns start invading the creative process: Everything gets watered down to the most anodyne and easily consumable version of itself. The movie becomes an inoffensive shadow of a thing not the thing itself. There are no more rough edges or flights of cinematic madness. The fire and passion are gradually drained away as original ideas and voices are subsumed by commercial concerns corporate oversight and polling data. I wonder whether such an outré studio movie as Vertigo would have survived if such pressures existed then. Not to mention radical films such as Citizen Kane The Red Shoes Cabin in the Sky and Bonnie and Clyde.

“Please let 007 drink his martinis in peace. Don’t shake him don’t stir him” he concluded.

The Inevitable inescapable future

One can’t argue against Logan’s apprehensions; in fact this writer couldn’t have worded his concerns as compellingly.

There is a consensus that every major studio is scared of YouTube Facebook and TikTok and that scare is forcing billions to be funneled into productions.

Netflix will invest 28 billion dollars per year on productions by 2028; Disney+ will spend 16 billion dollars by 2024; Amazon will fund an expansion of the Lord of the Rings with a mammoth per-season cost of 465 million dollars. The above-mentioned merging and restructuring of Warner Bros. Discovery the indecisions of executives bad decision-making in terms of characters and IPs and lastly their global push for HBO Max is a part of that very changing future.

As the future of the entertainment industry changes and streaming services super charge their content by cashing in on nostalgia new franchises and happening trends and productions start rolling out on blistering production schedules and unfathomable scales no one seems to think about the audiences — or the fact that there is will eventually be a thing as too much entertainment.

This writer remembers that in his youth there was a popular saying that simply meant watching too much television rots the brain. Today one cannot escape entertainment. Are we eventually on the path of becoming those obese brainwashed couch potatoes from movies and shows that depict a technologically oppressive media-controlled totalitarian future? Perhaps.

With the mad-rush of creating global conglomerates the future is inevitable. Homegrown OTT platforms in Pakistan do not hold a chance against a world-sweeping onslaught by the likes of Apple+ Amazon Prime HBO Max Paramount+ and Netflix when they eventually invade this country. The promise of entertainment is great but the long-term damage will be immense.

About 11m tonnes of plastic entered the ocean in 2016—and without action that figure could almost triple to 29m tonnes per year by 2040.

Asia is at the centre of the crisis: just four countries (China Indonesia the Philippines and Vietnam) account for about half of the plastic waste that flows from land into the ocean. Moreover nine out of the top 10 countries ranked by annual plastic emissions are in Asia. Recent studies have also highlighted that urban rivers in South-East Asia and West Africa are the main hotspots for plastic emissions. Although this can be attributed to weak waste-management systems in these countries Asia also imports a large share of the world’s waste so the problem there is more acute. Between 2016 and 2018 the ASEAN nations (Brunei Cambodia Indonesia Laos Malaysia Myanmar the Philippines Singapore Thailand and Vietnam) experienced a 171% increase in plastic-waste imports even though global exports of waste decreased by 50% in the same period.

As a result there are 150m tonnes of plastic in the ocean today. Of this about 70% is packaging—from monomaterials such as grocery bags and clingfilm to multilayer plastics such as sachets diapers bottles and other containers (see Figure 1). Microplastics—which come from clothing fibres tyre fibres face scrubs and shampoos—make up about 11% of the plastic waste found in the ocean. Finally about 13% comprises fishing gear such as nets ropes and traps.

But how does this waste end up in the ocean?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHA6Ly93d3cueGluaHVhbmV0LmNvbS9lbmdsaXNoLzIwMjEtMDcvMTcvY18xMzEwMDY2NzY3Lmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beijing mulls imposing charges for non-household kitchen waste - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-07-17 11:33:14|Editor: huaxia

BEIJING July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing is mulling a comprehensive weight-based charge for non-household kitchen waste and has begun to solicit public opinion on draft regulations local authorities said Friday.

The non-household kitchen waste defined in the draft mainly includes kitchen trash generated by catering services collective canteens farmers' markets and the like.

Such measures are expected to promote the reduction classification and resource utilization of household garbage at its source according to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.

According to the city's cost survey the average cost of transporting and treating non-residential kitchen waste in Beijing in 2019 was approximately 563 yuan per tonne (about 87 U.S. dollars per tonne) and the price came in at around 594 yuan per tonne after taking taxes and reasonable profits into account.

The draft stipulates that non-household kitchen waste disposal charges will be calculated at 300 yuan per tonne covering about 50 percent of the average cost.

The disposal cost of such kitchen waste can be based on a metered charge according to its weight or the volume of the garbage collection container. Waste in barrels will be calculated by a reference standard of 0.9 tonne per cubic meter.

Improper handling of this waste not only leads to emission of toxic greenhouse gases during its decomposition but also pollutes the groundwater through percolation of leachate.”CMERI has developed a Decentralised Solid Waste Management Technology (DSWMT) comprising of a number of modules which tries and provides solution for management of every aspect of solid waste. “The pilot plant of CMERI offers module-wise technologies for the disposal of individual components of waste which can help the user division obtain a sustainable model” said officials.Inaugurated in November 2017 the technology is being implemented in CRPF Group Centre Durgapur Senapati Imphal East Imphal West Bishupur districts of Manipur and plastic agglomeration module in all 16 districts of Manipur. “Efforts are also underway for the installation of a 5-tonnes per day plant for fruit and vegetable waste to be sponsored by the Punjab Mandi Board Mohali” said officials.The DSWMT consists of eight modules including mechanized segregation bio-methanation composting briquetting pyrolysis plastic agglomeration plasma gasification and bricks and aggregates. “Proper disposal of bio-waste at the generation site in decentralized manner is of utmost importance as it only taps the energy from the waste through production of biogas in anaerobic digesters. Moreover briquettes from waste compost and vermi-compost also add to the sustainability of the model thereby reducing the cost of transportation and the associated pollution from fossil fuel combustion in vehicles carrying waste” the experts said.They added that the voluminous segregated plastic waste and high bulk density inert waste can be collected segregated and disposed in a centralized pilot plant to be developed zone-wise in an eco-friendly way.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzZWluZGlhLm9yZy9pbnRlZ3JhdGlvbi1vZi10aGUtaW5mb3JtYWwtc2VjdG9yLTEwODk00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Integration of the Informal Sector,"Developing countries like India face certain unique challenges in solid waste management. Rapid urbanization and the rise of a middle class lifestyle have led to proliferation of waste. But its management is hamstrung by lack of policy intent funds and institutional capacity of city governments.

The reason India has not drowned under its own waste is a workforce referred to as the ""informal sector"" -- apparently unorganized but a super-efficient contributor to the cause of the circular economy. Much has been said about India's informal waste management sector -- the huge army of rag-pickers kabadiwalahs and recyclers -- but they continue to remain under the radar when it comes to a real recognition of their role and their integration.

Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) invites registrations for a webinar to release its recent study on the integration of the informal sector in solid waste management and to discuss the questions that have emerged from the analysis. The webinar will focus on issues such as the role of the informal sector in SWM and initiatives enabling mechanisms and strategies for integrating the sector in the waste management chain.

NOTE: This is a free webinar for waste management practitioners officials from central and state urban departments and municipalities urban and town planners academicians students NGO representatives CBOs wastepicker's associations and others.

The petroleum industry is currently facing various challenges including a global movement toward a low-carbon world. These challenges however also provide the oil and gas industry geoscientists and engineers with new opportunities for exploration and production as well as research and development. Exploration for critical minerals in sedimentary rocks and basins briefly described in this article is a case in point. This field is rapidly growing in the US as the country seeks to decrease its dependency on China which has been the dominant exporter of critical minerals in the past three decades. In 2020 for instance the US Department of Energy allocated $122 million for regional research initiatives to produce critical minerals and rare earth elements from the country’s sedimentary basins.

What Makes a Mineral Critical?

Mineral economics textbooks have remarked that the terms strategic critical and essential minerals are the outcome of war emergency in relation to supply status of minerals necessary for winning a war. However these terms are important for peacetime as well because modern civilization depends more than ever on a vast array of minerals. Indeed we currently use all the elements of the periodic table. A cell phone for instance utilizes about 75 different elements.

A college textbook similar to AGI’s Glossary of Geology defined a ‘strategic mineral’ as one that a country has little resource of its own and thus depends on imports; ‘critical mineral’ has some occurrence in the country while ‘essential mineral’ has both fundamental usefulness and large occurrence. However definitions of these terms vary. A 2018 US Geological Survey listed 35 critical or strategic minerals “whose absence would have substantial consequences for the US economy or national security.” Th ese minerals are “essential for the manufacture of high technology devices national defense applications and green energy-growth industries.”

Criticality depends not only on industrial importance or economic value but also on vulnerability risk and disruption in supply chain due to various factors such as international conflicts. Table salt was once a critical mineral for ancient peoples; today it is produced in abundance. Rare earth elements were not even known in premodern times; today they are among critical minerals for the industrial nations.

Another related term is ‘energy mineral’. In a strict geologic definition fossil fuels are not ‘minerals’ because they are organic. Moreover oil and gas are not solid and are mixtures of various hydrocarbon molecules. In 1977 the American Association of Petroleum Geologists founded the Energy Mineral Division to advance the science of nonpetroleum minerals that can be used for energy production such as coal and uranium. Today energy minerals are sometimes considered as those used to produce electricity or fuel. In this way there are large overlaps between critical and energy minerals.

Minerals Sediments and Basins

All rocks are made of minerals and they in turn of elements; however their distributions are not uniform. Certain elements and minerals are more abundant in some rock formations than others. Igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks are all valuable for mining with sedimentary rocks classified into clastic chemical and organic types. Th is classification is not merely a semantic issue; it pertains to the formation processes of sediments and thus guides us in mineral exploration. Clastic rocks from conglomerates to clays are derived from pre-existing rocks; chemical rocks form by precipitation or evaporation in marine environments and organic sediments come from plants or other organisms. Minerals occur in sedimentary rocks via various mechanisms.

Sediment-host deposits of base metals such as lead zinc and copper are well known. Indeed the classification of ore deposits known as Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) around the world were named after the successful extraction of such deposits along the Mississippi River in Missouri Iowa Wisconsin and Illinois (‘the Lead Belt’) as early as the 18th century. These are high-grade sulfide bodies hosted in carbonates.

Some sedimentary rocks are also known to contain low- to mediumgrade uranium-bearing minerals. Colorado Plateau-type sandstones the site of the post-World War II ‘uranium rush’ are sandstone bodies of Jurassic– Cretaceous age widely distributed in Colorado Utah and Wyoming. These sandstone formations with alternating red (oxidizing) and white or green (reducing) layers are ideal for uranium mining because uranium is mobile in oxidizing environments and precipitates in reducing environments. Black shales may contain 50 to 250 ppm uranium. Phosphorite deposits can also contain uranium oxides within apatite and fluorite.

Although in the subsurface dolomite may be a petroleum reservoir dolomite layers in basin-margin exposures may also provide a major source for production of magnesium. Dolomite itself can be used as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Magnesite (MgCO3) another industrial mineral occurs in shales and limestones in association with salt and gypsum or within regolith above ultramafic rocks. In the US sedimentary magnesite mines are located in California Nevada Idaho Texas and Florida.

Vanadium used for production of steel alloys for glass coating and as a catalyst is present in considerable concentrations in black shale coal crude oil oil shale and oil sands.

Sedimentary basins sometimes host igneous intrusions which create ideal conditions for ore deposits. For instance in Salt Lake City Utah there is an open-pit copper mine called the Kennecott or Bingham Canyon mine which is the second largest of its kind in the US and the deepest excavated mine in the world. This huge deposit of copper (as well as gold and silver) was formed by a 35-million-year old quartz monzonite porphyry that intruded Late Paleozoic sediments of the Oquirrh Mountains.

Rare Earth Metals

Rare earth elements or metals (REEs) include the entire lanthanide series (with atomic numbers from 57 to 71) as well as scandium and yttrium because of their similar chemical and physical properties. REEs are classified into light (atomic numbers 57 to 64) and heavy (atomic numbers 65 to 71). Yttrium is included in the heavy REEs because it also has paired electrons. REEs have a wide range of applications in electronics glass and other industries and they are used as permanent magnets alloys and catalysts (including petroleum-refining catalysts).

REEs are not really ‘rare’ on Earth but unlike the base metals such as chromium and zinc which are found individually in ore deposits REEs occur together in a limited number of minerals. Moreover their mining results in toxic substances which must be properly dealt with.

Although igneous rocks especially carbonatites and alkaline magmatic rocks are the major sources of REEs sedimentary deposits can also yield REEs. Major REE minerals include bastnaesite monazite apatite and xenotime. The presence of REEs in sedimentary rocks largely depends on the provenance of the sediments as REEs are insoluble in water.

Placer deposits especially monazite in Ontario’s Elliot Lake mining district contain heavy REEs and the Alberta black shale deposits in Canada are also attractive for REE mining.

Phosphorite deposits from Idaho to Florida are proven sedimentary sources for REEs. Bastnaesite the major mineral for REEs has been found in karst bauxite deposits in the Balkan region of Europe.

Laterite deposits are intensely weathered bedrocks in tropical to sub-tropical climates. More than 250 laterite deposits containing REEs have been mapped around the world. One particular type ion-adsorption clays (formed by the intense weathering of granitic rocks) are massively mined in southern China as the world’s main source of heavy REEs. These elements are adsorbed to the surface of kaolinite halloysite or illite.

Minerals From Brines

Formation waters in oil fields are often brine with high concentrations of dissolved salts and thus contain various minerals. These toxic waters must be treated stored disposed or reinjected into the wells. However formation waters also offer important sources for mineral extraction. These waters may be classified as four types: reservoir water associated with oil and gas bottom water at the base of hydrocarbon column edge water to the sides of the hydrocarbon column and water in barren traps. Compared to hard-rock mining which is time-intensive and has adverse impacts on the land surface and likely on groundwater formation waters are easier to exploit.

Lithium is one of the valuable metals that can extracted from brine. A successful US example is Albemarle Corporation’s Silver Peak mine that has been in operation since 1966 (it is North America’s only lithium brine mine).

Lithium-ion batteries power many devices from cell phones to electric cars. Global demand for lithium is expected to increase and Goldman Sachs Group has called lithiumrich formation waters ‘the new gasoline’. Moreover lithium processing also yields other critical elements and minerals such as cesium and rubidium as residues.

In 2017 the Canadian mining company MGX Minerals acquired the Lisbon Valley Petrolithium Project in the Paradox Basin of south-east Utah that is designed to extract lithium and other minerals and salts from brine waters in the Lisbon Valley oil and gas fields. Lithium content in these formation waters is as high as 750 ppm.

Tesla Eyes Opportunity

In the 1970s several authors reported lithium in various clays with concentrations from several ppm in some montmorillonites to as high as several thousand ppm in hectorites.

In 2020 the electric car company Tesla announced obtaining lithium mining rights in 10000 acres in Nevada where lithium has been proven abundant in vast and thick tracts of clay deposits. Tesla plans to extract lithium from claystone by the weak acid leach technique. Laboratory experiments have shown over 80% recovery within several hours; the leftover clay would be put back in the land. Tesla is not the only lithium-bearing clay mining company in Nevada. Cypress Development Corp owns the Clayton Valley Lithium Project totaling 5430 acres in south-west Nevada.

Helium From Natural Gas Fields

Helium the second simplest element (after hydrogen) is an inert (noble) gas. Helium is rare on earth and is also considered a non-renewable resource because it can escape into outer space. Although helium can be released by volcanic activity it is mainly produced in the radioactive decay of uranium thorium and elements present in both basement and sedimentary rocks. Being a buoyant gas helium can migrate upwards and accumulate in natural gas reservoirs. As much as 7 percent radiogenic helium has been reported from gas fields from which helium can be extracted by low temperature fractional distillation. The Petrolia Oil Field in Clay County Texas and the Texas Panhandle gas field are both historical sources of helium production dating back to the 1920s.

Helium has a wide range of industrial applications including cryogenics (liquid helium to cool superconductive magnets) shielding gas in arc welding helium-neon lasers carrier gas in gas chromatography supersonic wind tunnels etc.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen was first envisioned as a fuel (extracted from water) in Jules Verne’s The Mysterious Island published in 1874. Verne knew about the abundance of water on Earth but in his time nobody was aware of abundant natural gas reserves. Ironically natural gas which has been flared for decades is now considered a major source for hydrogen probably a better source than the much-needed water (‘green hydrogen’ can be produced by water electrolysis). ‘Grey hydrogen’ is already produced from natural gas in places like the Alberta Basin which is primarily used in petrochemical facilities. However Canada now has its eyes on massive production of ‘blue hydrogen’ from natural gas via steam methane coupled with a carbon capture and storage system. In this way natural gas opens up a new frontier for hydrogen fuel during the energy transition in the coming decades.

Mineral mining requires sophisticated technologies and petroleum companies which have advanced some of the best geological geochemical and geophysical techniques for exploration of oil and gas are in an excellent position to explore for critical minerals in sedimentary basins. These new ventures will also demand participation of geoscientists and engineers who want to learn new techniques. Perhaps the science of sedimentary and geochemical processes in petroleum basins for critical minerals has come of age.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ3VhcmRpYW4uY28udHQvbmV3cy9taW5pc3Rlci1mbG9vZGluZy1pbi1ib25hc3NlLWNlZHJvcy10by1iZS1hZGRyZXNzZWQtNi4yLjEzNTcxNjUuYTM3YTYwZDQ1Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minister: Flooding in Bonasse Cedros to be addressed,"Flood­ing at Bonasse Ce­dros should soon be cur­tailed.

Wells Fargo Economist Addresses State of U.S. Agriculture

In a recent episode of The Food Institute Podcast Wells Fargo agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson discussed how current market conditions like record heat extreme drought and supply chain constraints are affecting farmers.

Swanson said the hot and dry summer will hurt crop yields across much of the nation but farmers experienced in navigating serious weather challenges should be able to weather the storm. Regulatory and supply chain issues however may prove to be more significant obstacles.

Transportation Storage Issues Press on Growers

Rising transportation costs are among the top problems facing farmers with operators forced to either absorb price increases or pass them along to customers the economist noted. Additionally farmers are losing opportunities to ship to international markets with container supplies limited and highly priced.

Swanson also said pandemic-related constraints depleted reserve stocks of key commodities which some operators did not see coming and COVID-19 exposed vulnerabilities in the “just-in-time” system of inventory management. While the system works well when fully primed it does not do well with shocks as showcased in 2020.

Effects of Heat and Drought in California

Swanson said California’s current situation is dire because its agricultural system was not designed to handle years without sufficient snowpack. The situation has only worsened under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.

In years past farmers would be able to rely on subsurface water extraction for irrigation needs but under the legislation they quite literally cannot return to that well. As such some agricultural producers have opted to fallow land.

Swanson also said that some farmers are buying properties or utilizing existing farmland with water rights in order to divert irrigation to their most profitable crops. However with the water situation unlikely to improve in the years to come he said production in California could plateau which may require a reassignment of resources among farmers in the region.

Will 76ers stay?,"Comcast Spectacor will resume on Monday its $300 million renovation of the Wells Fargo Center a project that was stalled for more than a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and that could affect the long-term relationship between the company and one of the arena’s primary tenants: the 76ers.

The renovation which began in 2016 is still $100 million away from completion according to Comcast Spectacor which owns the Flyers and rents the center to the Sixers. Installation of new and improved guest seating in the arena’s club level is expected to be finished this fall and additional changes – an upgrade of the exterior facade remodeled and updated entrances a greater variety of food and beverage vendors – will begin next summer.

“We’re a local company and we take pride in our sports teams and our arena” Valerie Camillo the center’s president of business operations said in a phone interview Friday. “We want to invest to give the best fans in sports what they deserve and that’s the best experience in sports with the best arena.”

Camillo said that Comcast Spectacor is the sole source of funding for the project. “There are no public monies of any kind” she said. “There are a lot of needs in Philadelphia and quite frankly we don’t think it’s reasonable that we would expect public money to help deliver that.”

It was natural to interpret Camillo’s words as a salvo in the public-relations tug-of-war between Comcast Spectacor and the Sixers whose plans for a taxpayer-funded arena of their own at Penn’s Landing were revealed last August.

Comcast Spectacor sold the Sixers to Joshua Harris the founder of Apollo Global Management and his partners in Harris & Blitzer Sports & Entertainment in 2011 and the team’s lease at the Wells Fargo Center expires in 2031.

Harris and the Sixers’ ownership group want their own arena for a host of reasons according to an Aug. 28 Inquirer report. Those reasons include additional revenue streams priority in scheduling the team’s games and concerns about how much the Wells Fargo Center’s condition will deteriorate between now and the end of the lease.

“Comcast Spectacor is a great long-standing partner of the 76ers and we’re excited by their continued commitment to delivering a world-class arena experience” a Sixers spokesperson said via email. “We have a lease with our partners at Comcast Spectacor for another decade. We will continue to explore all options in Philadelphia for when our lease expires in 2031 with a focus on delivering the best experience for our fans.”

When asked whether the renovations were in any way intended as a carrot for the Sixers Camillo said: “We’re not thinking about our transformation in terms of enticing the Sixers to stay. We’re thinking about it in terms of every guest who comes into the building and the Sixers are certainly part of that. But we also host Flyers games concerts family events shows. This is an investment in the city in the community in the stadium district. We want to provide the city of Philadelphia a world-class arena.

“Look I don’t want to get into speculation about how the Sixers think about this” she added. “The Sixers know we want them to stay.”

The Wells Fargo Center opened in 1996 kickstarting a massive refurbishment of the South Philadelphia sports complex that continued with the building of Lincoln Financial Field and Citizens Bank Park and that led to the razing of Veterans Stadium and the Spectrum. Comcast Spectator owns the development rights for the land next to the center “and we have exciting plans for that” Camillo said. “In the next several months we’re going to have exciting announcements to come there too.”

That declaration seemed a direct counter to the argument or perception – one that the Sixers have promoted merely by the nature of their plans one that existed in the early 2000s when the Phillies were weighing where to build Citizens Bank Park – that a downtown arena would be better for the city’s economy and civic life.

“The stadium district is such a unique urban-planning success story” Camillo said. “It’s well-planned. It’s managed. It’s a significant well-functioning traffic-management plan – ingress and egress everyone’s down here together. The partnership structure works very well between the teams. I would be hard-pressed to think that there’s anything better out there than what we have today.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RnYXRlZnVuZXJhbC5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy93YXJyZW4tZGVrcmV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren DeKrey Obituary 2021 - Eastgate Funeral & Cremation Services,"A service livestream will be available below starting at the time of the service.

W. Warren DeKrey was born December 22 1925 to Cornelius DeKrey and Winnie (Vellenga) DeKrey. He grew up on a farm near Pettibone the third of seven children. He attended a one-room country school for grades 1 through 8 and graduated from Pettibone High School.

Upon graduation Warren farmed with his father for a few years and then earned a Bachelor of Science degree from NDSU and a master’s degree in Agricultural Economics from the University of Nebraska.

On September 7 1952 he married his high school sweetheart and the love of his life Eileen Wyngarden. They have five children nine grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.

Warren worked as county extension agent in LaMoure and then in Mohall before becoming assistant professor in the Agricultural Economics Department of NDSU. In 1959 Warren began his banking career at First National Bank of Fargo as an Agricultural Lender. He became president of the Grafton National Bank in 1967 and eventually became a vice president at the Minneapolis corporate office before retiring in 1987 as president of the Bismarck Norwest Bank (now Wells Fargo). After his 32-year career with the bank Warren became a lobbyist at the North Dakota legislature. He received numerous awards and honors throughout his career.

Warren’s love for God and family defined his life. He was known for his positive attitude and passion to help others; a sought-after mentor to many. He served on many boards and gave back to the community and church in great ways through his kindness generosity and leadership. He taught Sunday School more than 25 years and served in church leadership both locally and regionally. Warren was an excellent singer; singing solos in men’s quartets and in choirs. He enjoyed photography travelling abroad golf and hunting.

Some of the organizations he was involved in included Bismarck Meals on Wheels United Methodist Church Salvation Army Board YMCA Trustee and former chair Bismarck State College Foundation Governors Prayer Breakfast Committee Steer Incorporated United Way University of Mary Greater North Dakota Association St. Alexius Hospital Advisory Board and Foundation Chamber of Commerce Bismarck-Mandan Development Association Fairview Cemetery Board and Rotary Club.

Warren was an exceptional man who based his life on the principles of love compassion and peace that are set forth by his savior Jesus Christ. He walked with grace on the path God set forth before him. He was a giant among men – a beacon of light to many through his leadership. Warren leaves behind a wonderful legacy and will be greatly missed by his friends and family.

Happy birthday to the index fund which this month turned 50 years old — looking fitter feistier and more controversial than ever.

Five decades ago John “Mac” McQuown a headstrong former farmhand from Illinois led a team of brilliant iconoclasts at a Wells Fargo skunk works that cooked up ways to use newfangled computers in finance. Among the things the Management Sciences unit helped birth were Fico’s famous credit scores and Mastercard. But the greatest was the index fund.

At one point McQuown had six future Nobel laureates of economics on his payroll. “That tells you how much brain power we focused on the problem” he reminisces. The first clunky iteration was born in July 1971 with $6m from Samsonite’s pension plan. Soon afterwards two other unorthodox financiers — Rex Sinquefield at American National Bank of Chicago and Dean LeBaron of Batterymarch — launched the first S&P 500 index funds.

The success of passive investing has been breathtaking. There is now over $16tn in index funds of various stripes almost twice the size of the combined private equity venture capital and hedge fund industries. Throw in non-public internal passive strategies and we are probably talking of well north of $25tn.

Yet this success has naturally fostered fears across parts of the finance industry which has been rattled by such a tectonic trend. Some of the concerns are overdone and probably a little self-serving but others have a ring of truth to them.

The argument that index funds somehow wreck financial markets is the oldest and most popular. Already in 1975 analysts at Chase Investors Management Corp warned that if the then-nascent index investing trend kept growing “the entire capital allocation function of the securities markets would be distorted and only companies represented in indices would be able to raise equity capital.”

An anonymous mutual fund manager offered a more inadvertently honest complaint to the Wall Street Journal back in 1973: “If people start believing this random-walk garbage and switch to index funds a lot of $80000‑a‑year portfolio managers and analysts will be replaced by $16000‑a‑year computer clerks. It just can’t happen.”

More recently more cerebral financiers have presented cogent alarming arguments for how the growth of index investing has evolved from a good idea into a volatility-stirring potential disaster. However what many critics seem to ignore is the fact that financial markets are always in flux.

Yes passive investing is undoubtedly affecting how markets function. How could it not — both on the level of broad markets and individual securities — given its growing scale? What is doubtful is whether they are “distorting” markets any more perniciously than any other types of investors that have come (and sometimes gone) over the centuries from investment trusts to hedge funds. McQuown is roundly dismissive. “It’s just complaining” he says.

In fact fears that surround indexing have uncanny echoes with the rise of mutual funds a century ago. A 1949 Fortune article on the trailblazing Massachusetts Investors Trust marvelled at how the mutual fund had grown to an astonishing $110m making it the largest owner of stock in the US but fretted over what might happen if investors pulled their money out at the same time. Today sceptics fret over the same with index funds undaunted by the encouraging evidence from major bear markets.

However the concerns over some of the more abstract effects are harder to set aside.

The economics of scale in indexing mean that the big invariably get much bigger. The Spectre of the Giant Three a 2019 paper estimated that BlackRock Vanguard and State Street account for a quarter of all S&P 500 shareholder votes and within two decades they will probably account for as much as 40 per cent.

Indeed Harvard Law professor John Coates argued in a seminal 2018 paper that eventually just 12 individuals could enjoy de facto power over most US companies. “The effect of indexation will be to turn the concept of ‘passive’ investing on its head and produce the greatest concentration of economic control in our lifetimes” he warned.

Intriguingly professor Coates is now acting director of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s division of corporate finance. It is hard to see what he might be able to do to address this issue but it is unquestionably a conundrum that will climb up the agenda in the coming decade.

Consumers are becoming increasingly keen on the idea eating insects but there are still hurdles to overcome according to an expert panel in the FIRST session “The Role of Insect Proteins for Nutrition Environment and Artificial Intelligence.”

While consumer acceptance in the Western world is “quite low” research shows it is growing says Mariam Nikravech PhD candidate at the University of Berlin’s Dept. of Education for Sustainable Nutrition and Food Science.

“There is an emerging trend for insects as food that has been observed whereby they're considered as an exotic luxury product to be consumed as part of a culinary experience” she says. Young males are particularly willing to try insect products according to research.

Nikravech and other researchers at the University of Berlin are investigating the premium that consumers will pay for insects. Via a hypothetical choice experiment involving 750 consumers in Germany Italy and Portugal “We try to identify the price that consumers are ready to pay for a specific attribute of insect-based food products such as the form the continuance degree or whether or not they have organic labels” she says.

However in order for more of the population to be comfortable with eating insects suppliers and educators must first increase “the acceptance to taste insects at all” Nikravech notes. “Then the second goal would be to increase the acceptance of insects as part of the regular diet.”

To overcome the disgust in order to increase acceptance marketers are utilizing a positive association with edible products as a marketing approach.

“The most important aspect to increase the consumer acceptance is the taste” explains Nikravech. “The insect-based food has to taste good right from the first experience on. But before reaching that point of tasting the insect there's a need to create a positive taste expectation.”

Associating the insect with a known familiar carrier product flavor or dish is one of the best ways to garner trials. “For instance savory preparations appeared in several studies to be more appropriate to increase the acceptance of insect-based food” Nikravech notes.

Another route is making the insects invisible through processing into more conventional forms or adding the insect proteins to a new food product she adds.

Consumer acceptance can also be increased by educating them about insects’ high nutritional profile. Dried insects have a much higher protein content than fresh lean meat and eggs while being much more sustainable.

Where to Buy

You probably don't have enough on-device storage space on your Mac and it's probably not that much different on your iPhone or iPad. This is fixable across your network or over the Internet with the solid Asustor Lockerstor 2 and Lockerstor 4 network attached storage devices.Is there anybody left that has only one computer? We're increasingly living in a world where data storage needs are escalating and not everything is best stored in the cloud.We like home servers  and we like the Mac mini for that task. But we also very much appreciate network attached storage devices (NAS). They are the ultimate storage appliances in that we can sit it on a shelf and just let it serve files.But modern NAS devices can do so much more and the Asustor Lockerstor 2 and Lockerstor 4 are no exception.The Asustor LockerStor 2 and LockerStor 4 network-attached storage appliances are an expansion of the company's range from the larger LockerStor 10 and LockerStor 8 with the new units aimed at the prosumer NAS market. As the name suggests the LockerStor 2 and 4 have two and four drive bays respectively but there's more to the story than drive bays alone.Of the two the four-bay is the physically larger device measuring 7.3 inches tall and 6.7 inches wide versus the 6.4-inch height and 4.3-inch width of the two-bay version. Both measure 9 inches in length.Only part of the physical difference is down to needing to house more drives. The LockerStor 4 has an additional LCD panel above the drive bays which is used to provide data like status updates or the current IP of the device.This is a nice addition in environments where the NAS is present in the room though far less useful for anyone who stores their NAS out of the way and remotely manages it.The two models share similar design aesthetics with the drive bays in the front along with interface buttons and LED status indicators and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port in the bottom-left corner.The back has the remaining ports of the NAS the power connector and the cooling fan.Each bay can handle up to an 18 terabyte drive giving the LockerStor 2 up to 36 terabytes of capacity rising to 72 terabytes on the LockerStor 4. As the drive trays on both models are sized for 3.5-inch drives they are compatible with both desktop hard drives plus 2.5-inch mechanical drives and SSDs.This is only the capacity for the built-in storage. Asustor sells expansion units that can allow the servers to handle higher drive counts. The LockerStor 2 can handle up to 14 drive bays at a maximum while the LockerStor 4 can deal with 16 drives.Taking drive bay expansion into account brings the total raw capacities up to 252TB and 288TB respectively.The file system support is the same on both NAS units with internal drives formatted in EXT4 or BTRFS. External disks can use FAT32 NTFS EXT3 EXT4 HFS+ exFAT and BTRFS.With more drives the four-bay model offers more RAID options as well. Both offer single disk JBOD RAID 0 and RAID 1 volume types with the larger model adding in RAID 5 RAID 6 and RAID 10 for good measure. Both also include support for ""hot"" RAID level migration if such maintenance is required.To help achieve faster speeds there is space to fit in a pair of M.2 NVMe drives into each NAS. The M.2 drives are theoretically used for caching files for faster access and faster file receipt from hosts rather than for storage capacity.Asustor claims the LockerStor 2 can read at speeds of up to 588MB per second and write speeds of 583MB per second. The LockerStor 4 is said to be capable of marginally faster speeds at 591MB per second for reads 590MB per second for writes.We never got these speeds across the network and we're not sure why the company claims them -- but speed limitations have more to do with the capability of Gigabit and 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet networks. On a wired 10-gig network with both a SATA SSD RAID and a hard drive RAID we saw about 285 megabytes per second read and write on the 2.5-Gig network and 120 megabytes per second on the Gigabit network -- and about the same with a NVMe SSD for caching installed.We do have the hardware to test the link aggregation and saw about 355 megabytes per second read and write. However in most prosumer or SOHO networks link aggregation is either difficult to set up or problematic from a network managing standpoint so most won't see these speeds.Neither unit has a PCI-E slot for a future 10-gig expansion.And in regards to fan speed and noise at idle from three feet away with no intervening material that could mask the sound the unit runs at about 34 dBA. During the file copy in a 71F office and hard drives installed we had a 44 dBA noise level. This dropped to 41 dBA with just SSDs installed.While completely slept with either SSDs installed or hard drives sleeping the unit consumes about 0.4 watts. Under full load with a full four SSD install it consumes about 25 watts. Loaded with four hard drives and getting slammed with input and output it was taking 61 watts.The two-bay unit drew commensurately less power at 15 watts under load and 32 watts with two hard drives under load.The speed to access data on drives is only part of the equation with the need to get that data to user's computers being the other half. The LockerStor 2 and 4 have a pair of 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back to meet that.Each port can handle 2.5Gbps networking as well as lower gigabit and 100Mbps speeds if needed. In cases where compatible hardware is on hand the two LAN ports can also be combined using link aggregation producing up to 5Gbps of bandwidth in ideal conditions.A trio of USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports are available with two on the back and one on the front allowing external drives to be connected shared on the network or to quickly transferring files from a portable drive for safekeeping.An HDMI 2.0a port is also available allowing you to connect up an external display directly to the NAS. This offers some extra benefits such as locally managing the device instead of over the network or viewing stored video directly if the NAS is hooked up to a living room television.And given the unit's app-centric nature which we will speak about more in a bit there are freely downloadable apps for Amazon Video Disney+ and more.It's not a fantastic player with us experiencing some full-minute lags on scrubbing even locally stored content nor does it have the best interface but it is pretty good for simple playback. It's nice to have convenient local storage adjacent to your television for warehoused video so you don't always have to reach out to the Internet to watch something if you have the file handy.Powering the LockerStor 2 and 4 is the same Intel Celeron J4125 processor a quad-core chip with a 2.0GHz base clock speed and 2.7GHz under Turbo Boost. Asustor claims the Gemini Lake chip is 30% faster than Apollo Lake equivalents and has a higher 4MB of onboard cache making it a powerful chip for use in a NAS.Supporting the Celeron is 4GB of DDR4 memory as a SO-DIMM. As Asustor uses only one memory module but included two slots a user could add an extra 4GB stick to bring it up to the maximum supported memory of 8GB which will help performance in applications but not in file transfers.The processing power and RAM out of the box is more than enough for file management and transfer and a single expansion app. But given the results of our trials with multiple we feel that if you're using more than one or two apps on the unit especially something beefy like Docker get the extra RAM.Setting up the unit is easy. It is a browser-based process and if you can read this text you can manage the setup. Drives are also formatted in the browser and limitations for users are set up here as well.Like most modern network attached storage devices the LockerStor 2 and LockerStor 4 are powerful computers in their own rights. To fully leverage that power there are installable apps to expand the capabilities of the unit.Conventional apps include an FTP server a Download Center for managing automated downloads including Bittorrent an FTP server VPN server connectivity with various cloud storage services antivirus and photo storage.Heading towards specialized territory Docker is available and there's a Linux Center to install Linux on the NAS. Plus amongst others there's Virtualbox a mail server a surveillance center supporting up to 40 camera channels in a single live view and servers for SNMP Radius and Syslog.Time Machine support is native to the ASUS software and is a matter of a few checkboxes clicked for one or multiple users assuming that discrete users have been set up for everyone who wishes to back up to the device.Beyond the media players we discussed earlier for local media serving it has SoundsGood for storing a user's personal music collection a UPnP Media Server and the LooksGood video server with transcoding capabilities.Apple ecosystem users will benefit from LooksGood's video playback support on the Apple TV using AiVideos for tvOS. An iTunes server is also available with AirPlay and iOS Remote Pairing support.Beyond video playback -- and even Minecraft play -- the HDMI port can also display video from the Asustor Portal which hosts an interface for its various apps and services such as viewing four IP cameras. Links are available for various online services viewable via the built-in Chromium browser.Users of the iPad iPhone and other mobile platforms aren't completely left out. The AiData app allows users to open and browse files on the devices. Additionally built-in sharing tools in the app generate shared links for others either on the local network or across the internet.The app isn't fantastic and there is no native Files app integration with it -- but you can connect to the NAS on your local network with Files as you normally would. However using the app you can share a file to yourself in an email and then open the file in the email with whatever handles that file format on your iPhone.But for a simple photo browser or media preview tool it's adequate for the task.We've been using both the LockerStor 2 and LockerStor 4 in parallel for many months now. Both units have proven to be reliable have shaken off power outages flawlessly and have recovered from failed drives well.While we prefer out Apple TV hardware to the LockerStor the unit was never designed to be a fully standalone player and the added functionality is nice to have. It would even be great to load up video and drag it along to a vacation that seems to always have terrible connectivity to keep watching your ripped DVD collection or similar.We like both the LockerStor 2 and LockerStor 4. We aren't fans of a two-bay network attached storage device just on principle because of a lack of a total capacity but we wholeheartedly recommend the LockerStor 4 for just about anybody that reads AppleInsider of any skill level for home or small office network storage needs.Both units are incredibly solid and should serve you well for many years to come. And so far Asustor's support for the unit is pretty good. We feel that there's not enough room for expansion in the two-bay model and as such give that model a 3.5 out of 5 stars.However the four-bay model is a different story. Sufficient storage more than enough power and quiet. We give the LockerStor 4 a 4.5 out of 5.The Lockerstor 2 model AS6602T retails for $399 at Amazon.The four-bay Lockerstor 4 model AS6604T sells for $549  also at Amazon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbG1zcHJpbmdzbGlmZS5jb20vcGlvbmVlcnRvd24tZmlsbS1mZXN0aXZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pioneertown Film Fest Has Historic Western-Themed Town as Backdrop,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.palmspringslife.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Entrepreneur Justin Turk knew his start-up was special but a $1 million prize from Grammy award-winning singer and producer Pharrell Williams came as a shock.

On Tuesday Williams announced the winners of his Black Ambition prize competition – and Turk and his business partner Andre Davis are in the national spotlight.

Williams’ non-profit was founded in December to help Black and Latino business owners close the wealth gap through entrepreneurship.

Turk and Davis co-founders of Livegistics took home the top prize of $1 million. The Detroit-based entrepreneurs run a cloud-based material management software company which eliminates paperwork in heavy civil construction and demolition. The company also provides data and metrics that construction experts can use for efficiency.

Livegistics is also helping the environment through the elimination of tons of paper each year and helps local communities accelerate the elimination of blight in urban cities and neighborhoods.

“We knew we had something special but you don’t go in thinking you will walk away with $1 million. But when it happens you are like ‘Wow we just won $1 million’” Turk said.

But the 40-year-old said he never knew joy and pain could co-exist simultaneously.

Success can be bittersweet

On the day he learned his tech start-up won the grand prize his father-in-law died before he could share the news.

“All in 24 hours it was the greatest and worst moments tied together forever. There we were with the our biggest business success to date along with the worst day of our lives all in 24 hours” Turk said. “It is weird. Sometimes I feel guilty for being so happy about what’s going on but I know he would have been excited.”

Turk who co-founded the business three years ago with Davis said that hours after he learned about winning he watched a team of health care professionals try to revive his wife’s father whom he admired. He was a veteran who loved architecture. And they shared the same passion for construction.

Instead of hosting a celebration party for friends and family Turk said he will bury his father-in-law in a private ceremony Saturday.

“He would have been enamored with what’s going on. If he would have been able to see all of this it would have just blown him away” Turk said. “He would walk around the city of Detroit and look at buildings on his own. This would have just made his decade.”

More like brothers

Turk’s and Davis’ friendship goes back decades. The two met in elementary school when they were 5 years old Davis said. Then they were college roommates at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Davis the chief financial officer said it was never a goal to become business partners but it made sense.

“He’s been in just about every special moment in my life” Davis said. “Not only are we solving the single most significant reason construction companies go out of business (cash flow) we’re doing so in a manner that creates less work and makes the lives of our customers easier to manage.”

Davis 41 said he worked at Financial One as an outsourced CFO to clients in the Metro Detroit area. He started and operated his own accounting and financial services practice for 10 years managing to keep one foot in the non-profit sector to give back. He wants to encourage other Black and minority entrepreneurs looking to start their businesses to take the leap of faith.

“A thought today backed by effort today is one step closer to your dream tomorrow. Justin is brilliant. His background is the foundation for what I forsee as a unicorn in the making” Davis said. “A third generation business owner minority-owned who understands all facets of large construction projects at an expert level…who also has a degree in computer science to speak tech geek language! You don’t find a Justin Turk walking around every day.”

Together the hybrid team beat out nearly 1700 applicants to win the grand prize. Williams who announced the initiative in December congratulated the team on Twitter Tuesday saying “We are so inspired by you and can’t wait to see how you change the world.”

Turk and Davis said this win is bigger than them. It’s about opening the door for the next person.

“Winning this competition is bigger than just the prize money” Turk said. “When we first entered the tech start-up world as two Black entrepreneurs we had no idea how to navigate in this space.”

Turk said they are not only being taught how to navigate “but also to dominate in an industry that just recently decided to grant access to people of color.”

The win will break open doors. And Turk has an another goal.

“We don’t just want an invite we want to create the guest list” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTYvdGVjaG5vbG9neS93aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLWlibS13YXRzb24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Ever Happened to IBM’s Watson?,"A decade ago IBM’s public confidence was unmistakable. Its Watson supercomputer had just trounced Ken Jennings the best human “Jeopardy!” player ever showcasing the power of artificial intelligence. This was only the beginning of a technological revolution about to sweep through society the company pledged.

“Already” IBM declared in an advertisement the day after the Watson victory “we are exploring ways to apply Watson skills to the rich varied language of health care finance law and academia.”

But inside the company the star scientist behind Watson had a warning: Beware what you promise.

David Ferrucci the scientist explained that Watson was engineered to identify word patterns and predict correct answers for the trivia game. It was not an all-purpose answer box ready to take on the commercial world he said. It might well fail a second-grade reading comprehension test.

His explanation got a polite hearing from business colleagues but little more.

“It wasn’t the marketing message” recalled Mr. Ferrucci who left IBM the following year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvc3BhY2UtamFtLWxlYnJvbi1qYW1lcy1zcHJpbmdoaWxsLWNvbXBhbnktbmlrZS1pbnZlc3RvcnMtMTIzNDc5NDU1NS_SAWVodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3L3NwYWNlLWphbS1sZWJyb24tamFtZXMtc3ByaW5naGlsbC1jb21wYW55LW5pa2UtaW52ZXN0b3JzLTEyMzQ3OTQ1NTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Space Jam’ Breakout Will Only Add To Investor Ardor For LeBron James’ SpringHill Company,"Tongues were wagging in early June when LeBron James and the LA Lakers got bounced from the NBA playoffs in the opening round. It was the earliest exit of the 36-year-old’s career and the fizzle by the defending champions fueled speculation about James’ future as he approaches his 19th season as a pro.

Conveniently there were plenty of projects to focus on off the court. One of the biggest: the release of the long-gestating Space Jam: A New Legacy. The film’s better-than-expected opening this weekend at almost $32 million did more than burnish James’ credentials as an onscreen draw. It added validation for the SpringHill Company the entity that James and longtime business partner Maverick Carter founded in 2020.

Last week in the days leading up to the release of Space Jam in theaters and on HBO Max reports surfaced that investors were looking to take a stake in SpringHill. A source familiar with the discussions told Deadline that there are “a number of active conversations” with investors among them Nike at a $750 million valuation. The likeliest scenario is an infusion of cash but no change of management control.

While a number of athletes have recently embarked on a range of initiatives in the media business SpringHill is a more evolved entity. Founded with a $100 million initial funding round last year it now has 120 employees across three main business units: marketing agency Robot Co. SpringHill Entertainment and Uninterrupted described as an “athlete empowerment” effort. Operations span branded content marketing services podcasts and scripted and unscripted film and TV projects. The company’s board includes Elisabeth Murdoch Serena Williams and several other notable finance and business figures.

In a July 19 appearance on the Smartless podcast hosted by Jason Bateman Will Arnett and Sean Hayes James said he intends to play another four to seven years. He is under contract with the Lakers through 2023. During his rookie year in the NBA in 2003 James said he realized “I wanted to be a businessman. I wanted to be in control of my business.”

He formalized business ties with a group of friends he grew up with in Akron OH creating an entity called LRMR short for LeBron James Rich Paul Maverick Carter and Randy Mims. Even though James was still a teenager when he made the move he felt certain it would bring him control over his own destiny albeit with a steep learning curve.

“I didn’t give a damn about what they were talking about” he said of the skeptics who questioned his decision to put his future in the hands of industry outsiders. “Who are people to trust more than the people that I know? We can all learn together. … Let’s takes bumps and bruises together. Let’s fail at the same time we go along this journey.”

James who starred in Trainwreck and hosted Saturday Night Live has long been active as a producer. SpringHill Entertainment long predates the larger corporate entity. Diversifying well beyond the confines of Hollywood is the plan. The company has overall TV and film deals with Disney and Universal but fashion advertising and technology are also all very much in the mix. In the runup to opening weekend for Space Jam SpringHill played a role in forging more than 200 marketing partnerships.

“We want to continue to climb. We want to continue to build relationships and build great content for everyone” James said.

“Those guys are great” WarnerMedia Chief Revenue Officer Tony Goncalves told Deadline. “Mav is a great partner for him.” Of the film’s overall marketing effort Goncalves added “They’ve done an incredible job taking the IP and really sort of building a flywheel around it in sync with the movie all the way down to the basics — Amazon boxes wrapped in SpaceJam showing up in people’s homes — all the way to these AR experiences.”

While the ambitions for SpringHill are broad it helps that it is anchored by a leader of undeniable charisma. Critics’ reviews of Space Jam were not universally kind but even the harshest notices included positive notes about the star and producer.

James told the Smartless hosts his interest in entertainment has run in parallel to his involvement in sports. “When I was a kid not only was the inspiration coming from sports figures but from TV shows” he said. “I always felt like ‘I wish I was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.’“

Comedy has been the best fit for James as an actor thus far he said becoming an action star à la Dwayne Johnson is not out of the question. “I’m not against that” James said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc2VyZW5hLXdpbGxpYW1zLXd0YS10ZW5uaXMtbmV3cy1zZXJlbmEtd2lsbGlhbXMtcmV2ZWFscy13aHktc2hlLWludmVzdGVkLWluLXN0YXJ0LXVwLWZpbnRlY2gtZmlybS1lc3VzdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Serena Williams Reveals Why She Invested in Start-Up Fintech Firm Esusu,"SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 22: Serena Williams speaks on stage during keynote conversation at 2019 Watermark Conference for Women Silicon Valley at San Jose McEnery Convention Center on February 22 2019 in San Jose California.

Be it her tennis career or entrepreneurial side Serena Williams never shies away from taking chances.

While doing the percentages right on a tennis court the 23-time Grand Slam champion would seldom miss out on a chance to fire a blinding cross-court winner when her opponent expects her to go down the line.

In business it’s the same streak the same urge to go off the beaten track that makes her invest in start-up firms peddling bright and unique business ideas.

The 39-year-old tennis superstar pumped in the money through Serena Ventures her venture capital firm.

The start-up received the investment as part of its first funding round.

Serena says she supports ventures that are about empowering others

Speaking to CNBC about the new start-up that she has chosen to support Serena said “I started Serena Ventures to invest in diverse founders and early-stage companies that outperform and generate impact while at the same time empowering others and creating opportunities. Esusu is definitely one of those companies.”

She added that at the core of the start-up’s business idea is the “financial inclusion” of working families as well as institutions.

“Esusu is really focused on credit building and creating pathways to financial inclusion not only for working families but for individuals as well” the seven-time Wimbledon champion said.

Headquartered in New York City Esusu already has funding support worth $14 million.

For example eating alone is quite a popular thing in Japan as it is not just socially accepted but also increasingly considered the norm. Rohan Joshi one of India’s finest comedians shares an experience of eating at a Japanese restaurant and recalls this tradition of eating alone in the country. While attempting to make sushi on the first episode of Gobble’s You Got Chef’d he recollects the culture shock experience when he had to sit in front of a wall and eat his ramen alone like most people in Japan. He was totally amused by this and while sharing this memory Rohan mastered the art of the perfect sushi with help from Chef Ranveer Brar who also rated his sushi roll to be absolutely perfect.

Rohan adds “I just started cooking during the lockdown. So if you’d told me I’d be making such a complex dish on a show like You Got Chef’d in under a year I wouldn’t have believed it. You hear so much about how chefs can be really tough but Chef Ranveer Brar was a total sweetie and I had a ton of fun cooking with him. And right now I’m wondering and hoping he did too!”

Rohan Joshi is one of India’s finest comedians who has entertained people not just on his stand up shows but also through the lockdown since last year by uploading relatable content on his social media platforms. Apart from entertaining during the lockdown Rohan says that he picked up the skill of cooking while being quarantined at home.

Rohan Joshi shares this unique experience and many other anecdotes in the third episode of Gobble’s You Got Chef’d season 3 presented by Dewars only on the Gobble Channel.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But actual reimbursement will likely take some time.

Officially added on July 1 and set to take effect on January 1 2022 the new category III code -- 0691T -- would apply to the use of AI for automated analysis of existing CT studies for vertebral fracture(s) including assessment of bone density when performed data preparation interpretation and reporting.

The code was approved by the AMA after representatives from the RSNA American College of Radiology (ACR) the American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS) and the Association of University Radiologists initially proposed the code in a presentation at the AMA CPT Editorial Panel meeting in February.

This use of AI will advance radiology's role in population health by utilizing existing imaging to assess patients at risk for more debilitating osteoporotic fractures such as hip fractures said Dr. Melissa Chen of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

""These patients can be appropriately medically managed to improve morbidity of this at-risk population"" Chen said.

The use of AI to assess prior CT studies for incidental findings of vertebral fractures could provide significant clinical value.

""Vertebral fractures are notoriously frequently not mentioned by radiologists on thoracic or abdominal CT scans unless there is moderate-to-severe loss of height of the vertebral body"" said Dr. Eliot Siegel of the University of Maryland and the Baltimore VA Medical Center.

Importantly the combination of a vertebral fracture and low bone mineral density is synergistically associated with a high likelihood of additional -- and potential debilitating -- vertebral body fractures Siegel said. Although dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is currently the gold standard for determining bone mineral density CT can also be used.

Siegel noted that another category III CPT code -- 554T -- includes the determination of bone strength and fracture risk using finite element analysis a computer simulation technique that utilizes functional data and analysis of bone mineral density from a CT scan.

""[554T and 0691T] represent two related but separate algorithms"" Siegel said.

An important first step

The new CPT code for automated assessment of vertebral fracture is an important first step in facilitating the adoption of AI technology Chen said.

""More importantly radiological specialty societies led the code proposal ensuring that radiologists -- the physician experts in imaging appropriateness acquisition and interpretation -- remain a part of the payment models for AI"" said Chen who also serves as advisor for the American Society of Neuroradiology to the AMA Relative Value Scale Update Committee and as chair of the economics committee for the American College of Radiology (ACR) Commission on Patient- and Family-Centered Care.

Israeli AI software developer Zebra Medical Vision which garnered FDA 510(k) clearance in May 2020 for its software for analyzing vertebral compression fractures also hailed the new code.

""The recognition of AI as an integral part of the radiologist workflow by the AMA is pivotal for expanded adoption and acceptance perception and robust reimbursement strategies"" said Dr. Orit Wimpfheimer chief medical officer and head of product strategy at Zebra.

Zebra now expects greater awareness of AI's merit in population health screening in general as well as increased utilization of its software for detecting vertebral compression fractures to treat the most high-risk osteoporotic patients and prevent hip fractures Wimpfheimer said.

The CPT code is structured so that ordering clinicians need to request AI screening for vertebral body compression fractures when ordering exams Wimpfheimer said.

""We consider this as the first milestone in achieving population health screening on a national and then global scale"" Wimpfheimer told AuntMinnie.com. ""The ultimate goal is to automatically screen the age-appropriate population to make the biggest impact in preventative healthcare by treating medical conditions at an earlier phase of the disease to decrease the morbidity mortality and financial cost associated with the later-stage more debilitating chronic conditions.""

Patience needed

Although the new CPT code sets an important precedent for radiology AI there are some caveats Siegel said. Category III CPT codes are temporary codes designed for emerging technologies services and procedures. These codes then result in collection of data to create documentation for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product clearance and to validate the general clinical application Siegel said.

""These do not mean to imply [Medicare] or private payor reimbursement"" Siegel said.

The 0544T and 0691T CPT III codes represent promising very early steps toward more routine reimbursement of AI algorithms by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and other payors Siegel said. However he anticipates that this ""will be a very slow process requiring a good deal of collection of compelling data and patience by the diagnostic imaging community.""

It's unlikely that any payors will reimburse for 0691T in the near term said Sandy Coffta vice president of client services at billing services provider Healthcare Administrative Partners (HAP).

""CPT III codes are typically considered experimental or investigational and denied by the majority of insurances"" she said. ""In the midterm – two to three years -- we may see some payers reimburse this code but consistent reimbursement is unlikely until a permanent (category I) CPT code is assigned.""

Despite the lack of immediate reimbursement it's still important to submit claims for CPT III codes; utilization data from a CPT III code is used to support creation of an eventual category I CPT code according to Coffta.

The typical expectation for a standard CPT III code is that it will lead to a permanent -- category I -- code within five years Coffta said.

""Whether that happens or not for 0691T will depend on a number of factors"" she told AuntMinnie.com. ""In addition to utilization data the CPT Editorial Panel will consider published research on the clinical efficacy of the service when deciding whether a category I code should be created.""

It will likely take years before reimbursement begins Siegel said.

""I believe [CMS] and payors will be slow to pay for this despite the CPT code but this will encourage data collection on this important clinical issue and will allow radiology as a specialty to collect data to make a strong economic case for reimbursement"" Siegel said.

As it's a category III CPT code payment decisions will be made at a local level at the discretion of the payor Chen said.

""I would anticipate that this may take some time as payors determine if they [will] reimburse and the amount of reimbursement for this service"" Chen said. ""The payment rate may be highly variable.""

Wimpfheimer of Zebra said however that the new CPT code has already drawn the attention of payors.

""We believe that this CPT code testifies to the value that screening for vertebral body compression fractures can provide and we are already seeing interest among payers to institute programs to implement this screening among their providers"" Wimpfheimer said.

Impact on radiology AI

This radiology AI-specific application could be a harbinger of what's to come.

""I believe that this type of 'population' health application will lead to requests for many additional CPT codes such as coronary artery calcification on conventional thoracic CT abdominal aneurysm detection on thoracic abdominal and pelvic CT scans evaluation of cardiac chamber enlargement [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] renal calculi and many others"" Siegel said.

The new CPT code opens the door for reimbursement of the use of AI in radiology supporting the economics and incentives for adoption of the technology at scale according to Wimpfheimer.

""We believe that other applications will follow substantiating the broader use of AI and augment the work done by radiologists in areas of triage productivity and population health"" Wimpfheimer said.

Even though payment for a CPT III code is at the discretion of each payer the AMA's issuance of a CPT code for radiology AI is the first step toward being able to show a return on investment for the technology according to imaging consultant Michael J. Cannavo.

""A business case for reimbursement that insurance providers will accept needs to be developed"" Cannavo said. ""That is fairly easy to do though if you understand the provider's requirements.""

The AMA's decision hopefully will also enable payors AI developers and radiologists to see a reimbursement path forward in adoption of AI technology and in particular how AI can augment radiologists' role in improving population health Chen said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ZTS,Zoetis,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdvcmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNy9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtem9vLXBsYW5zLXRvLXZhY2NpbmF0ZS1hdC1yaXNrLWFuaW1hbHMtYWdhaW5zdC1jb3ZpZC0xOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia Zoo plans to vaccinate at-risk animals against COVID-19,"PHILADELPHIA — Gorillas otters aye-ayes and more will soon be joining the ranks of those vaccinated against COVID-19.

The Philadelphia Zoo is gearing up to vaccinate its highest-risk animals with an experimental vaccine developed by Zoetis a former subsidiary of Pfizer that develops drugs for animals. While animals are not a major concern for spreading the virus to humans according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention they may still get infected. Cases have been reported in some big cats and gorillas at zoos household pets and farmed minks motivating zoos nationwide to help their animals build up immune defenses.

“We were concerned that animals would be susceptible and we started taking precautions pretty early on” said Keith Hinshaw director of animal health at the Philadelphia Zoo which is awaiting state approval before it proceeds. “This vaccine is really what we were looking for all along.”

The zoo’s precautions included face shields and gloves for zookeepers and minimizing the time they spent within 6 feet of the animals — which wasn’t always easy for animals used to interacting with their human companions. “When the state was in lockdown I would walk through the zoo and the animals would be very excited to see one person” Hinshaw said.

But there was good reason to be careful. Gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park not only got infected with COVID-19 but also developed unpleasant symptoms like coughing and congestion which alarmed Hinshaw. When he heard about an experimental vaccine from Zoetis that the San Diego Zoo had administered to their great apes he immediately reached out to the New Jersey-based company to see how the Philadelphia Zoo could get its own supply.

Zoetis originally thought there might be demand for a dog or cat COVID-19 vaccine but switched gears to minks when outbreaks on farms prompted the U.S. Department of Agriculture to put out a call for mink COVID-19 vaccines. Now that vaccine still under development is being distributed for zoo animals.

“We can’t make a new vaccine for every species” said Mahesh Kumar senior vice president of global biologics at Zoetis. But the company thought its prototype which seemed to be safe and effective in cats dogs and other species might work for a wider menagerie.

Zoetis is donating more than 11000 doses to more than 70 zoos and other animal organizations to be administered to everything from meerkats to orangutans. To maximize efficacy Zoetis instructs zoos to administer two doses: the first to prime the immune system then a second to boost the response weeks later like human vaccines. “Even in a large animal you’ll get some level of protection” Kumar said.

The animal vaccine isn’t quite the same as the jabs that humans receive. Both are designed to teach the immune system to recognize the spike protein that gives the coronavirus its characteristic crownlike halo. That way if the immune system encounters the protein again — from an infection — it knows to defend the body. But unlike the human COVID-19 vaccines that use RNA to deliver genetic instructions to make the spike protein the Zoetis vaccine delivers pieces of the spike protein made in the lab. Whatever the species getting jabbed it’s impossible to actually get the disease from the vaccine as it doesn’t deliver the entire functional virus.

The Zoetis vaccine also uses an adjuvant — material delivered with the spike protein to get the immune system’s attention — designed for cats and dogs that seems to work in other animals too.

Zoetis doesn’t yet know how all species will respond to the vaccine but zoos will be encouraged to share any adverse events that occur. Some zoos have been wary and a research study is in the works to measure effectiveness and safety said Michele Goodman director of veterinary services at the Elmwood Park Zoo in Montgomery County. The Elmwood Park Zoo has not decided if it will participate.

Hinshaw knows that administering an experimental vaccine might have risks but feels more comfortable because the vaccine doesn’t contain a live virus and because it has already been safely administered by other zoos. The benefits are substantial he said: keeping animals and zoo staff healthy and minimizing opportunities for the virus to replicate and pick up mutations that make it more contagious like the delta variant that now is causing cases to rise around the nation and world in unvaccinated people.

“It’s a little bit of extra assurance that we are trying to do our best caring for the animals” Hinshaw said.

As with the human vaccine rollout in which some groups were prioritized some animals will have to wait their turn. Primates are at the top of the list starting with great apes such as gorillas and orangutans because their biological similarity to humans might make their cells an easier target for the virus. The rest of the monkeys will follow including gibbons and mangabeys. There are also around 40 carnivores slated to be vaccinated beginning with big cats — lions and tigers — as well as otters bears and more.

Many of the animals are seasoned vaccine recipients and have already been trained to cooperate with routine rabies and canine distemper shots Hinshaw said. Tigers for example will walk to the front of their enclosure turn sideways lie down and press their shoulder or thigh up against a mesh panel. There’s a treat on the line of course: A keeper stands by with pieces of meat or a squirt bottle of milk as a reward.

The Philadelphia Zoo is waiting for the state to approve the vaccine’s use before it can receive and administer the doses but Hinshaw expects this to happen within the next two months.

Pet vaccines against COVID-19 haven’t been approved by regulatory agencies yet so don’t even try calling your veterinarian. For now Kumar has some simple advice for worried pet owners: “The best thing you can do is vaccinate yourself.”
