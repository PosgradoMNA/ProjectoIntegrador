Abbott said he presented during an hour-long investment planning session. The conferences are held twice a year.

“This was my first time being invited to give the presentation as part of the panel” Abbott said. He was on a panel with three other financial experts.

“I was very pleased and honored that they would invite me to join that panel” he said.

Other panelists included Ryan Nelson from the RedTree Investment Group; Lorrie Harper vice president of Chase Bank; and Jennifer Trowbridge investment manager with RedTree.

“It was basically providing information on allowable investments under law and insights on how to invest county funds in today’s challenging and low-interest-rate market and the environment that we’re in” he said.

Abbott said this was particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I’m looking at revenues for the past year and where things stand. I’m looking at sales tax. I’m looking at general fund revenues. Housing fees from the jail. I’m looking at current interests that will receive investments to see how the market’s fluctuated Whether it’s up or down. Obviously it’s been down but we’re poised to start seeing an upswing but it’s a slow recovery” he said.

“When I took office here in the county that was one of the things I set out to reform. I wanted to have a stronger more diversified and secure portfolio which we’ve been able to do. We’ve more than doubled our portfolio since I’ve taken office and a lot of that was just understanding what the financial needs of the county and seeing money that wasn’t readily needed at this time just sitting in a bank” he said adding he decided to put these funds into a secure investment. He worked with an investment adviser to form a strategic plan.

“One of the biggest things we had to focus on in the past year and a half was opportunities for investments which there weren’t a whole lot of” he said. “There was a huge influx of stimulus money from the governments that hit the banks that tanked short-term rates. There’s more money out there than even most banks wanted to have and until that money gets spent and goes out the door it’s going to keep our short-term rates down.”

He said the State Treasury Asset Reserve of Ohio (STAR Ohio) a government-backed banking program in Ohio saw rates at a historic low at 0.08 percent. He said in January 2020 before COVID hit it was 1.87 percent.

“The success of (Monroe County) even through COVID even with the financial market what it was this county was still able to make money and stay fairly on track. We didn’t take a hit like other counties did” Abbott said. “We were protected that way. That’s my job.”

Other questions touched on how to maintain communications with other offices involved such as the commissioners and auditors to best understand the county’s needs.

Abbott said transparency and customer service is the focus of his office.

“Taxpayers have a much easier ability to pay their taxes or go online and do it and get their tax bill” he said. “We want paying taxes to be as easy and efficient as possible.”

He took office in September 2017.

During the conference there were 17 new treasurers in the state. Abbott spoke about handling the transition into the position.

“I gave some insights on the challenges of taking over an office without a transition and what’s available to those new treasurers” he said. “I’ve been happy to be part of that group of treasurers. We help incoming treasurers with any questions they have.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lcG0ub3JnL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvMjAyMS0xMi0wMi9ibGFjay1hbmQtbGF0aW5vLXN0dWRpZXMtZ2V0LWEtcGxhY2UtaW4tdGhlLWNsYXNzcm9vbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black and Latino studies get a place in the classroom,"Brandon Rodriguez is getting ready for his fourth-period Black and Latino history class. Rodriguez a high school senior says he signed up for the course to learn more about his ancestry.

“My parents were born in Ecuador but I was born here” Rodriguez said. “But it’s nice to learn a little bit more about your Hispanic side and the impacts or benefits they’ve done in this country.”

Connecticut passed Public Act 19-12 in 2019 which requires all high schools in the state to offer courses on African Black Puerto Rican and Latino studies beginning in 2022. Danbury’s Abbott Technical is among 50 public high schools piloting the elective course. The law signed by Gov. Ned Lamont requires all high schools to offer a course that covers African American studies in the first semester and Latino history in the second. But it does not require that every student take it.

The curriculum written by the State Education Resource Center or SERC  was completed over the summer. It’s the same curriculum that Adrian Solis is teaching to Rodriguez’s senior class.

Inside his classroom the discussion begins with a prompt.

“I’m going to put a phrase up on the board. Your job is to come up with one word” said Solis as he wrote “Slavery in the U.S.” on the board. As offered by the curriculum the course begins with an introduction to African origins and contributions of ancient African empires and the African diaspora. It moves through topics of slavery and freedom to Black liberation movements in the U.S.

Solis says that growing up as a Latino in a suburban town he didn’t learn about his own history until college.

“I’m so glad I’m able to at least play a little role in it to help these kids learn about themselves a little bit” said Solis who teaches social studies.

Deciding what to include in the 90-day lesson plans of Latino studies involved discussion and reflection among a racially diverse committee said Nitza Diaz an education consultant with SERC. It included teachers administrators state employees and community members.

Ryan Caron King / Connecticut Public Abbott Technical High School social studies teacher Adrian Solis walks around the classroom during a Black and Latino history class as his students study primary source documents as they learn about demographics economics and the history of slavery in Connecticut. The class’s curriculum is being piloted at 50 schools across the state after the state legislature passed a law requiring high schools to offer courses on African Black Puerto Rican and Latino studies.

“So we start with who we are in the context of indigenous and the colonizers Spaniards and enslavement” said Diaz. “And then who we are in the United States.”

The course then dives into a unit called Blood and Beauty. It explores Christopher Columbus’ arrival in the Americas with students also reading about Bartolome de las Casas’ writings on Spaniards’ treatment of indigenous populations.

Diaz explains that the course moves through themes rather than a chronology. But she says the material can also cause students distress or shock. Diaz recalls one pilot class where students participated in a lesson about police brutality against Latinos.

“There was a student there and she stayed quiet and everybody’s quiet” Diaz said. “And somebody else said ‘This was so hard to watch. I cannot believe they did that to us.’ “But then somebody said ‘It was hard but it was the truth.’”

When speaking to teachers and facilitators Diaz emphasizes attention to creating a safe space for students to discuss and process particularly in diverse classrooms.

Solis also played a role in designing the Latino portion of the course. The final units dive into Latino civil rights movements like the case of Mendez v. Westminster that banned the forced segregation of Mexican Americans and was a precursor to Brown v. Board of Education . They also look at the intersections of Latinos and African Americans. In between they’ll study the United States’ relation to Puerto Rico and present-day politics. But Solis says it all ties back to hyper-local history.

“It’s kind of like closure as to where are Latinos now specifically in Connecticut. This whole course is focused on Connecticut’s history” Solis said.

During class Brandon Rodriguez learned about the involvement of Connecticut in slavery in the cotton and sugar trade and the nearly 5000 enslaved people in the state.

Ryan Caron King / Connecticut Public 12th-grader Brandon Rodriguez participates a class at Abbott Technical High School about Connecticut’s involvement in slavery a unit that’s part of a Black and Latino history course being piloted at high schools across the state. His teacher Adrian Solis helped write the curriculum.

“Today’s class was the most surprising” said Rodriguez. “Learning about how Connecticut used slaves to profit off of them and how it became a way to make them enough money for them be [considered] one of the richest states back then.”

With that window into a different history briefly opened Rodriguez heads to his fifth-period statistics class.

The partnership between the Australian defence-focused management consultancy and the UK-headquartered risk management specialist comes ahead of Australia’s transition to a nuclear-powered submarine capability as part of its recently-struck AUKUS pact with the UK and US.

The formal agreement is built on an existing close working relationship between the two consulting firms and aims to capitalise on the melding of local knowledge and international nuclear expertise.

Co-founded in 2015 by Navy veteran and managing director Phil Cutts Coras provides a range of management consulting services to the Australian defence sector from offices in Sydney Adelaide and Canberra including in the areas of business and commercial advisory asset management program and project delivery and governance and assurance. The company prides itself on its deep industry knowledge of the local defence landscape.

Abbott Risk Consulting meanwhile was established in 2002 in Edinburgh and has since grown to upwards of 130 risk and safety consultants across seven offices including three in Australia. The firm focuses on high-risk industries such as the oil & gas mining and rail sectors and especially nuclear and defence delivering services in hazard assessment and safety engineering. Notably the UK’s Ministry of Defence is among its clientele.

In particular Abbott Risk Consulting has provided the Ministry of Defence’s project teams and prime contractors involved in the UK’s Naval Nuclear Propulsion Programme with extensive support on the development and maintenance of nuclear safety justifications for UK naval bases and various classes of submarine – including through the provision of on-the-job training to the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and formal training courses for the ministry.

Coras and Abbott Risk Consulting believe this fusion of nuclear expertise and localised knowledge as well as their previous experience in having worked together on projects for the Australian Navy ensures that the partnership will be well-primed to provide the Australian government with expert advisory services in developing a sovereign nuclear-powered submarine capability once its technology-sharing arrangements with the UK have been formalised under AUKUS.

“Taking into account the scale and significance of nuclear-powered submarine projects understanding and managing risk and meeting compliance requirements in a highly regulated environment is absolutely paramount” Cutts said of the alliance.

“With their vast experience in safety and risk their global reputation for excellence and the trusted relationship between our two companies Abbott Risk Consulting is the very best firm to partner with.”"

While in town Cook was also presented with the “Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers Captains of Industry Award” from Auburn University’s Samuel Ginn College of Engineering.

As a refresher Cook graduated from Auburn University with a degree in industrial engineering before attending Duke University for his MBA. Cook regularly pays visits to both Duke and Auburn for sporting events and other gatherings.

This award from the Auburn University’s Samuel Ginn College of Engineering is the “institute’s highest honor.” It was first announced that Cook would receive this award back in the spring and this weekend he was presented with it prior to the Auburn vs Alabama game. In a post on LinkedIn the school wrote:

Welcome back Tim Cook ‘82 industrial engineering and Apple CEO. We’re honored to present Mr. Cook with the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) Captains of Industry Award the institute’s highest honor that is bestowed solely on business industry and government leaders. Cook was nominated for the award by Alice Smith an IISE Fellow and the Joe W. Forehand/Accenture Distinguished Professor of industrial and systems engineering. Annie Dorsey Auburn IISE chapter president interviewed Cook during the institute’s annual conference in the spring when he was announced as this year’s recipient. Smith and Dorsey presented Cook with his award prior to the Iron Bowl.

Also while in Auburn Cook made an appearance on the Friday episode of The Paul Finebaum Show on ESPN. In the interview the Apple CEO revealed that he visited with the Auburn football team on Friday where he delivered a short speech:

“I told them that tomorrow is a rare opportunity to create a memory that lasts a lifetime” Cook said. “And that there’s no better memory or longer-lasting memory than those that hit you when you do something that you’re not supposed to do. We’re not supposed to win tomorrow but we can win tomorrow. I tried to leave them with that spirit and the fact I think the team in Crimson is not the major foe. The major foe for all of life’s greatest challenges is the person staring back at you in the mirror and you have to recognize that. And sort of that little voice in your head that tells you that you’re doing 100% when you’re doing 90 and you have to eradicate it somehow.”

At the Auburn vs Alabama football game itself Cook was named as the game’s “honorary captain.” The only thing that could have made this weekend better for Cook would have been if Auburn was actually able to beat Alabama.

Canada’s big banks are undergoing a migration.

Faced with rising competition from startups higher expectations from consumers and the increased digital demands of COVID-19 experts say banks are speeding up a monumental shift of operations to the cloud from legacy computer systems.

The move had started before the pandemic but the sudden closure of branches and offices in March 2020 forced banks to rely even more on online systems and prompted the acceleration said Robert Vokes managing director of financial services for Canada at Accenture.

“What happened was in March of last year all of a sudden people realized ‘Oh my gosh I’ve got to go a lot faster.’ That was the big wake-up call.”

Cloud-based systems sometimes run privately by banks and more commonly by third-party tech giants allows data to move faster and more freely and gives banks the potential for more customization for each customer more automation as well as potential cost savings.

Such promises have been around since the dot-com bubble said Vokes but the hardware has only in recent years been up to the task.

“We didn’t really have the scalable technologies and now those technologies have caught up.”

Several banks made major cloud commitments in recent months including CIBC’s deal with Microsoft’s Azure Scotiabank reaching a deal with Google Cloud and BMO partnering with Amazon Web Services as they all push for “cloud-first” strategies.

BMO recently completed its first major system shift since the Amazon partnership by moving its entire transportation finance operations to the cloud which involved shifting about a thousand servers’ worth of data.

The bank made the move because it was finally convinced the cloud infrastructure was established and reliable enough said Sid Deloatch chief information and operations officer for North American commercial banking at BMO.

“We had to reach that threshold of expectation and we feel it exists and we’re very confident that it exists now and that’s why we’re moving forward.”

The shift creates the ability for BMO to offer automatic loan decisions in many cases as well as save upwards of 30 per cent on operating costs he said.

Along with waiting to be confident in new systems banks have also been held backby the patchwork of legacy systems built up over decades said Sanjay Pathak head of technology strategy and digital transformation at PwC.

“Untangling current operations from some old technology is very very complex and it can be very risky and disruptive to business.”

He said getting executives to the right mindset alone has been a challenge since it means letting go of the control of the underlying infrastructure built up over decades.

But banks can no longer delay since they’re feeling both consumer pressures as well as expectations from employees for more seamless processes said Pathak.

Smaller banks without extensive legacy systems have been able to move faster such as EQ Bank shifting its entire system to the cloud in 2019 while new startup financial companies have the advantage of starting out on the cloud and forcing banks to respond.

“There’s this great pressure being exerted on financial services from fintechs and fintechs are often born on the cloud. They move quite quickly they’re doing fully digital capabilities” said Hillery Hunter chief technology officer at IBM Cloud.

She said banks are moving more core systems on to the cloud because so many data sources need to be integrated and readily available to be able to make things like instant loan decisions happen.

“(Consumers have) all become quite impatient and we expect things to be instantly available.”

However the increasing reliance on third parties to host so much of the bank’s operations including personal financial data is raising concerns from regulators.

The Bank of England said in October that additional policy measures are likely needed to “mitigate the financial stability risks stemming from concentration in the provision of some third-party services.”

Canada’s banking regulator released draft guidelines on tech and cyber risks earlier this month that said banks should plan exit strategies from third-party cloud providers and make sure they can switch data from one cloud provider to another. It plans to release more specific third-party guidelines early next year.

But while the main concerns now are about data security and making sure big tech companies don’t have too much power in dictating terms of service competition may emerge as a threat as well said Pathak because the big tech companies have both the scale and the speed to become a threat.

“There’s an increasing tension I think around cloud providers also becoming competitors … that’s a real threat to the banks.”

Online sales reached $8.9 billion on Black Friday slightly below 2020 levels according to data from Adobe Analytics.

Meanwhile physical store traffic rose significantly from last year but was still well below pre-pandemic levels.

According to analysts the mixed performance points to shifting consumer trends like buying earlier particularly amid the supply chain crisis.

Another Black Friday has come to a close and early reports show a mixed performance for the annual shopping holiday.

While the impact of the coronavirus pandemic dampened 2020 sales this year's Black Friday faced a number of unique hurdles of its own including a national labor shortage widespread supply chain constraints and the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant.

Though retailers made some gains — including in areas like in-store traffic and mobile sales — data shows the industry is still struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels. The findings also indicate a shift in consumer spending patterns such as starting shopping earlier in the season and taking advantage of newer services like buy-now-pay-later.

""Consumers have been shopping strategically this season: Buying early and taking advantage of deals retailers have been promoting since late October"" Adobe Digital Insights Director Taylor Schreiner said in a statement on Friday. ""Black Friday still remains a major online shopping day but the surge in online shopping is coming from the less marketed days of the season.""

We took a closer look at the key findings from Black Friday below.

In-store traffic rose but failed to reach pre-pandemic levels

While some shoppers were met with traditional Black Friday scenes of lengthy lines and crowded malls others reported sparsely populated and fairly quiet stores this year.

This mixed bag was also reflected in the traffic numbers: According to data from RetailNext traffic at brick-and-mortar stores increased by 61% on Black Friday compared to 2020 levels. And while the boost is a marked improvement from last year in-store traffic was still 27% below pre-pandemic rates in 2019.

Likewise Sensormatic Solutions a company that tracks physical store traffic found that while there was a 48% gain over 2020 rates were still 28% lower than 2019.

""While in-store shopping is still not back to 2019 levels more shoppers felt comfortable visiting stores in person this Black Friday than in 2020"" Brian Field senior director of global retail consulting at Sensormatic Solutions said in a press statement. ""One driver of this increased traffic could be ongoing supply chain challenges and shipping delays.""

Online sales dipped

E-commerce sales reached $8.9 billion on Black Friday slightly below 2020 levels of $9 billion according to data from Adobe Analytics.

The number was at the low end of Adobe's predicted range and also came after disappointing flatline sales of $5.1 billion on Thanksgiving Day — marking the first time both days failed to boost year-over-year spending.

The sales indicate ""another sign that consumers started to shift their spending to earlier in the season responding to promotions and deals from retailers that started in October"" Adobe said.

Buy-now-pay-later usage surged

Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay have been on the rise and in recent months several major retailers have opted to integrate the option into point-of-sales both in-store and online.

Thanks in part to its newfound ubiquity BNPL usage is on the rise this holiday season: Accordng to Adobe total BNPL spending and volume of orders in November is up 422% and 438% respectively from 2019 levels.

Smartphone browsing is on the rise

Mobile shopping comprised 44.4% of online sales on Black Friday an increase of 10.6% year-over-year according to Adobe. However a majority of consumers prefer to browse deals on their phone before making purchases on desktop with smartphone visits accounting for 62.2% share compared to desktop an increase of 2.2% from 2020 the data shows.

Curbside pickup is still thriving

While some pandemic-era shopping habits have fallen away one remains popular — curbside pickup. According to Adobe curbside services were used in 20% of all online orders placed on Black Friday. For the month of November curbside services were up 78% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLWJsYWNrLWZyaWRheS1zaG9wcGVycy10YXBlcmVkLW9ubGluZS1zcGx1cmdlLXNvbWUtcmV0dXJuZWQtc3RvcmVzLTIwMjEtMTEtMjcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Black Friday shoppers tapered online splurge as some returned to stores,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-black-friday-shoppers-tapered-online-splurge-some-returned-stores-2021-11-27/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLWJsYWNrLWZyaWRheS1zaG9wcGVycy10YXBlcmVkLW9ubGluZS1zcGx1cmdlLXNvbWUtcmV0dXJuZWQtc3RvcmVzLTIwMjEtMTEtMjcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI3L2JsYWNrLWZyaWRheS1vbmxpbmUtc2hvcHBpbmctaW4tcGVyc29uLXBhbmRlbWlj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Friday shopping up from 2020 but trails pre-pandemic levels,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2021/11/27/black-friday-online-shopping-in-person-pandemic on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI3L2JsYWNrLWZyaWRheS1vbmxpbmUtc2hvcHBpbmctaW4tcGVyc29uLXBhbmRlbWlj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9yZXBvcnQteGJveC1zZXJpZXMtcy1kb21pbmF0ZXMtcHM1LWFuZC14Ym94LXNlcmllcy14LXJldGFpbC1ibGFjay1mcmlkYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: Xbox Series S dominated PS5 and Xbox Series X at retail during Black Friday,"What you need to know

Adobe's Digital Economy Index claims that the Xbox Series S has become the dominant console of Black Friday.

This is because it's actually available to buy unlike the PS5 and Xbox Series X.

Despite some analyst skepticism about the Xbox Series S it certainly seems to be holding its own.

While PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X dominate the mindshare when it comes to general console conversation it turns out that it's actually the runt of the litter that's taking up a lot of the traction. That is at least according to a report from Business Insider and the Adobe Digital Economy Index who claim the Xbox Series S is outstripping PS5 and Xbox Series X in early Black Friday projections.

While there are no hard sales figures from Adobe they say that across the ""trillions"" of retail site visits it's the Xbox Series S that is seeing much of the sell-through. And you don't need a degree in economics to work out why.

Thanks to the global chip shortage silicon to produce cutting-edge hardware like the PS5 and Xbox Series X is simply hard to come by. Microsoft and Sony both are selling through all of their stock of the PS5 and XSX near instantaneously as soon as they hit shelves. The Xbox Series S by comparison uses less powerful internals which are easier to source in an economy desperate for chips for anything from electric vehicles to smart toasters.

While the Xbox Series X is obviously the more powerful option the Xbox Series S can still runs most popular titles launching this year at full 60 FPS from Call of Duty Vanguard to Halo Infinite and Xbox Game Pass is the cherry on top that sweetens the deal. If I was a parent looking to buy a younger relative a device to attach to a basic 1080p TV this Christmas the Xbox Series S is almost always going to be the more obvious choice. This is especially true if they already own a Nintendo Switch which may be approaching a market saturation point.

As we head deeper into the generation more and more games are being made for Xbox Series X|S first too meaning the Xbox Series S is being utilized to its full potential more frequently than it has been in the earlier half of this year. The Xbox Series S is often cited as a big reason for Xbox's surge in Japan.

Microsoft couldn't possibly have predicted the global chip shortage which has arisen in part from the surge in retail activity as the world emerges from pandemic-induced lockdowns. But it seems the dual-console play which initially had analysts confused could be right on the money.

Grab the new Xbox Series S bundle at GameStop

While Xbox Series X remains impossible to track down you might be able to score the more affordable Xbox Series S. It plays the same next-generation games as Xbox Series X albeit better suited to HD gaming rather than 4K resolution. It's also missing a disc drive making this perfect for Xbox Game Pass and digital gaming. GameStop has stocked the first Xbox Series S bundle bundling Fortnite and Rocket League bonuses at no additional cost.",,,

The global Covid-induced supply crunch for chips has badly hurt production across a number of industries ranging from cars to consumer appliances smartphones and personal computers.

The trade war between the United States and China has only served to make a bad situation worse.

About a year ago the U.S. Commerce Department declared Chinese chip manufacturer Semiconductor Manufacturing International or SMIC persona non grata after determining the company supplies the Chinese military with chips thus making it a threat to national security. The federal government restricted SMIC from obtaining some U.S.-regulated chip-making equipment leading to U.S. buyers cutting back orders from the company. SMIC is one of the largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips accounting for about 5% of global semiconductor supply. Although the Biden administration recently granted SMIC and Huawei suppliers billions of dollars worth of licenses from November through April that allows them to sell them goods and technology despite their remaining on the U.S. trade blacklist it remains to be seen if the move will ease the shortages.

The alarming part: Some experts expect the supply chain glitches to drag on into 2022.

But whereas the global chip shortage has been a nightmare for businesses that make cars and home appliances as well as people who buy them semiconductor stock investors are hardly complaining as they continue to see outsized gains on their investments.

For instance shares of gaming and auto chip manufacturer Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) have gained 40% over the past 30 days; those of smartphone chip maker Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) are up 38% while those of computer chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have added 25%.

Overall the biggest semiconductor benchmark iShares PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is up 15% over the past months compared to a modest 4% gain by the S&P 500.

Investment bank JPMorgan is recommending that investors pursue longer-term trends in the semiconductor space that are more structural than cyclical. Structural trends tend to be longer-term permanent changes in an industry whereas cyclical trends are influenced by the business cycle and tend to be short-lived.

JPM recommends investing in very high-end computing segments noting there’s ongoing disruption in high-end computing globally which used to be very monolithic but is now being fragmented as more companies enter the space.

JPMorgan also recommends investing in semiconductor companies that focus on legacy long-tail technologies. These companies manufacture a variety of less advanced chips in areas like power management microcontrollers sensors and other consumer-related segments.

Bearing this in mind here are our top semiconductor chip stocks for long-term investors.

#1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest contract manufacturer for semiconductor chips. The company counts tech heavyweights such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Nvidia and Qualcomm as its clients. In fact TSMC is so dominant that it accounted for 54% of total foundry revenue globally last year as per TrendForce data.

Source: CNBC

TSMC manufactures some of the most advanced chips for fabless tech companies that do not own their own foundries. Last month Wedgewood Partners an investment management firm had this to say about TSMC:

""Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing detracted from performance as the market attempted to price in a downturn in the semiconductor cycle. Although there are some signs that memory markets might be somewhat oversupplied we have yet to see any tangible signs that logic semiconductors – particularly at the leading-nodes where the Company dominates – are in anything but short supply. In addition and as a result of this strong demand the Company should be able to pass through price increases to help fund very attractive returns on the rare leading-edge capacity that serves this demand.""

Indeed TSMC is reportedly raising prices by 10% for advanced chips while less advanced chips–used commonly by automakers--would cost 20% more.

#2. ASML Holding

ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch semiconductor equipment maker. ASML develops produces markets sells and services advanced semiconductor equipment systems consisting of lithography metrology and inspection related systems for memory and logic chipmakers. The company is the world's largest manufacturer of lithography machines used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Indeed ASML is the world’s sole manufacturer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines required to manufacture the smallest and most advanced chips.

It’s therefore hardly surprising that ASML counts Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  Intel (NASDAQINTC) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) as top customers for its EUV machines. ASML has been recording robust demand for its advanced chip-making machines helping the company to grow the topline by 35% in the current year compared to 18% growth in 2020. Further a product mix that increasingly lean towards high-end machines has helped boost its gross margins by 75 basis points to 52.2% in 2021 compared to 2019.

#3. UMC Corporation

United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC) is another Taiwan-based wafer foundry with operations in the United States Europe China Singapore Hong Kong and Japan. The company serves fabless design companies and integrated device manufacturers and provides circuit design mask tooling wafer fabrication and assembly and testing services.

Unlike TSMC which manufactures some of the world’s most advanced chips UMC primarily manufactures larger and cheaper auto and IoT chips for cars and other gadgets. You can think of UMC as TSMC’s smaller less glamorous peer.

UMC has reported that YTD sales were up 17.89% Y/Y to NT$173.07B with October net sales growing 25.36% Y/Y to NT$19.16B compared to NT$18.75B in September. Wall Street remains fairly bullish on UMC with a $13.77 price target good for 21% upside.

Early learning is an issue close to the royal's heart; this summer she launched The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood which emphasizes the importance of the early childhood years when it comes to educational development as well as long-term wellness.

Per a release from Kensington Palace ""Over the last ten years Her Royal Highness has spent time looking into how challenges in later life such as addiction family breakdown poor mental health suicide and homelessness can have their roots in the earliest years of someone’s life. Through her work with The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood she is aiming to highlight how what we experience in early childhood shapes the developing brain which is why positive relationships environments and experiences during this period are so crucial.""

Alabama needed a big drive to stay in the game against the Auburn Tigers in the Iron Bowl. Bryce Young and the Crimson Tide delivered and in a huge way.

Down 10-3 in the fourth quarter one touchdown is all they needed and they would get it at the cap of a 97-yard touchdown drive.

Young and company took over with just over a minute remaining in the game.

A few great passes later Young found Jameson Williams’ replacement Ja’Corey Brooks down the sideline for a touchdown pass.

The game is now tied at 10 with this one now going into overtime.

Hall Talk Harrison's Emerging Darkness and Dexter's Reaction to That Big Reveal,"In Sunday’s episode of Dexter: New Blood Dexter’s greatest fear may have become reality.

While Harrison was being hailed as the savior of his high school for thwarting a potential shooting Dexter’s suspicions over his son’s story led him down an unsettling rabbit hole. With the help of police photos and crime-scene spatter Dexter deduced that Harrison was actually the instigator of the conflict and later found what he believed to be the real weapon used on the teen’s classmate Ethan: a straight razor — the same blade used by the Trinity Killer when he sliced up Rita and left her for dead. (Click here for a full Episode 4 recap.)

More from TVLine

If Harrison does indeed have a dark passenger of his own does that mean Dexter will take on the role of Harry and teach his own son “the code”? It’s possible teases star Michael C. Hall.

“I think that possibility is a part of the fun and the richness of that relationship” Hall tells TVLine. “There are opposing things that are happening simultaneously for Dexter when it comes to Harrison and the dark passenger. On one hand it’s Dexter’s deepest fear that his son has the dark passenger and on the other hand it’s his deepest wish which makes parenting tricky.”

—

Considering that Dexter went into hiding to escape his dark death-filled past the emergence of Harrison “turns Dexter’s life upside down” says showrunner and executive producer Clyde Phillips. “Dexter’s been living this abstinent monastic lonely life by choice and suddenly here’s his son who’s a young man filled with anger and issues of abandonment and pain but yet somehow is able to socialize.”

Any parent might be on the lookout for abnormalities in his or her child but having both suffered bloody traumatic experiences Dexter’s “curious” (to say the least) as to what effect the past has had on the boy.

Dexter New Blood Episode 4 Debra

“There’s a phenomenon called inherited trauma and Dexter has it” says Phillips. “He wonders if Harrison has it too or if he was too young to remember. And we’ll learn the truth of what that is. Obviously it’s the more entertaining truth. If Harrison had nothing and no memory then we have no story” he teases.

When Dexter pieces together that Harrison might share some of his more violent traits the look on his face is… complicated. Is he frightened beyond belief? Relieved maybe?

“As is always the case with Dexter when presented with an either-or scenario — is it this or is it that? — it’s usually both” says Hall. “He’s experiencing a sense of horror and a sense of relief and a sense of a wish being fulfilled and a sense of the forbidden. It’s all of these things.”

Between Dexter’s return to his old ways and Iron Lake’s missing persons case (what is Kurt Caldwell up to at that cabin?) “Jim Lindsay” will certainly have his hands full for the remainder of the series. As for Harrison what he remembers exactly and what similarities he shares with his father will continue to be explored in upcoming episodes.

“We don’t know if it’s a dark passenger but there is a darkness in Harrison that will emerge” hints Phillips. “I’ll just leave it at that.”

Start with the obvious

In conversation with Rachel Crouch The AES Corporation

In ambitious visions of a green hydrogen-fuelled future the gas powers everything from cars to national power grids. In this world the sheer scale and variety of demand mean that the supply question solves itself: investors will be happy to finance schemes to generate green hydrogen because they are confident there will always be buyers.

The bankers we rely on to finance such schemes however think more prosaically. They will not extend loans against imagined future demand from hydrogen-powered planes trains and steel mills. They require guaranteed cashflow from a creditworthy customer who has signed a contract to take all of the hydrogen produced at a fixed price.

That is why we should focus first on greening existing hydrogen uses. More than 70m tons of hydrogen is consumed each year mainly to refine oil and produce ammonia. Nearly all of that hydrogen is generated from reforming methane producing 830m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to the emissions of the UK and Indonesia combined.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Which Dyson air purifier should I choose?

Dyson air purifiers may look similar but they have slight differences that are usually reflected in their price. They all have a certain style that’s in line with the Dyson brand but some models will have different functions. It’s a good idea to get clued up about what you want from your air purifier so you choose the right Dyson air purifier for you.

The size of your room will matter as different Dyson air purifiers cater for different types of spaces. If you cook a lot and you’re looking to get rid of smoke smells in your home or you’re looking for an air purifier to help with allergies because of pet dander there will be different Dyson models that will suit your needs.

When choosing an air purifier you may be tempted to go for the smallest one in order to save money. However if it doesn’t properly cover the room you want to purify then you could be wasting money. The oscillation degree of the fan is one of the most important factors as this will determine how big or small an area it will cover. The sound they emit can also be a factor for some especially if you’re planning to use it while you’re working or sleeping. Make sure you check the decibels (dB) that the model produces as this will give you a good idea of how noisy or quiet it will be. Newer models such as the Purifier Cool are 20% quieter than previous versions.

One of the aspects that make the admittedly expensive Dyson air purifiers worth their money is that they come with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters. These high tech filters make sure that microscopic particles of dust pollen and animal dander in your room are captured. Some Dyson air purifier models seal the pollutants that are captured from the air and others trap them in the filter.

If you’re also looking for a Dyson air purifier with a built-in humidifier (read our explainer feature air purifiers vs humidifiers to understand the difference between the two) or a heating system then pricier models such as the Dyson Pure Humidifier and Cool and the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool could be the right ones for you.

The organic farming has been receiving increasing attention throughout the world of recent because of growing consciousness on health hazards of chemical agriculture. The consumers are awakening and are raising the question of ethics in promoting poisons in our food chain. They are willing to pay a premium for chemical free environmentally responsive and safe products. The agriculture chemicals like pesticides weedicides fertilizers growth promoters etc. are affecting our soil water bodies air food and animals. The traces of these chemicals have been found in the milk and even in the mother’s milk. There is no doubt that our agriculture scenario has been completely changed with the usage of modern technology particularly after green revolution. The use of high yielding varieties seeds coupled with increased usage of chemical fertilizers and plant protection measures have no doubt increased our production but it seems that the quality of the produce has deteriorated.

The demand and trend of organic products is bound to be more pronounced in the coming years.The prevalence of organic products is still concentrated in developed and most affluent countries. India is poised for faster growth with growing domestic demand of organics. Success of organic movement in India depends upon the growth of its own domestic markets. India has traditionally been a country of organic agriculture but the growth of modern scientific input intensive agriculture has pushed it to wall. The indiscriminate use of chemical inputs in agriculture raises fears for the contamination of foods with agrochemicals. The consumers are concerned about the vegetables or fruit or food they eat. Both the international and domestic communities are becoming more and more conscious on issues like residues of poisonous agrochemicals in the food items and their associated health and environmental hazards. This therefore made us to think about alternate form of agriculture to produce food devoid of contaminants. Organic agriculture is one among the broad spectrum of production methods that are supportive of the environment and restricts the use of synthetic inputs.

Organic farming is defined as a “holistic management system which promotes and improves the health of the agro-system related to bio-diversity nutrient bio-cycles and soil microbial and bio-chemical activities. Organic farming emphasizes management practices involving substantial use of organic and green manures”. In its simplistic form organic agriculture may be defined as a kind of diversified agriculture wherein crops and livestock are managed through the use of integrated technologies with preference to more on the locally available resources. It emphasizes more on optimizing the yield potential of crops and livestock under given set of farming conditions rather than maximization.

In another definition FAO suggested that “Organic agriculture is a unique production management system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health including biodiversity biological cycles and soil biological activity and this is accomplished by using on-farm agronomic biological and mechanical methods in exclusion of all synthetic off-farm inputs”.

The crop residues compost farm yard manures vermicomposts biogas slurry green manures poultry manures are the major components of organic farming. Any type of biological waste used to fertilize the crops or plants is termed as organic manure. It is an integral part of organic farming that helps in activating the soil biologically physically and chemically. Different crop residues like paddy straw wheat straw paddy husk mash residues vegetable parts sugarcane trash press-mud beggasse molasses tree leaves stubbles weeds etc. are available with the farmers. The compost is prepared by decomposing a wide variety of organic wastes like farm residues wastes weeds cattle dung cattleshed wastes ashes etc.

To ensure genuineness of organically farmed products reaching the markets the farmer the processor manufacturer distributor and retailer must go through a process of certification. An organic cultivator has to adhere to well defined norms protocols procedures and practices for the preparation of land application of inputs such as seeds organic manures etc. conforming to strict production guidelines. In April 2000 National Organic Programme for Accelerated Promotion of Organic Farming Movement was launched in India. The programme is being implemented by APEDA (Agricultural Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) under the auspices of Ministry of Commerce.

Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) has been adopted by some states in our country. PGS is a quality assurance initiative that is locally relevant emphasize the participation of stakeholders including producers and consumers and operate outside the frame work of third party certification. Participatory Guarantee Systems are locally focused quality assurance systems. They certify producers based on active participation of stakeholders and are built on a foundation of trust social networks and knowledge exchange. PGS is a process in which people in similar situations assess inspect and verify the production practices of each other and take decision on organic certification

There is high demand of organic products in the domestic markets in the country. A huge potential for production of organic basmati rice is there in the plains of Jammu due to abundance of crop residues animal dung and low fertilizer usage or requirement. The farmers can be motivated from the low use of fertilizers to no use of fertilizers for organic production of basmati rice. Similarly the organic production of Ratta Ranja Chandaki rice can be promoted in Poonch-Rajouri Belt and Muskbudji Kamad and Zag rice in Kashmir Valley. Agro-climatically the hilly areas of Jammu as well as Kashmir Provinces are best suited for the organic farming as the specific pockets or the belts can be effectively utilized for biological control measures coupled with restriction on entry of chemicals or fertilizers. The cost of carriage of fertilizers to the remotest and hilly areas is high and instead locally available materials can be converted for manuring. Low usage to no usage of chemical fertilizers will save our soil water bodies and rivers from pollution. The lower Shivaliks intermediate hills and upper reaches can supply a variety of organically produced fruits and vegetables. Many fruits like walnuts cherry and pears produced in the hills without use of chemical fertilizers in hilly areas. There is a great potential for production brand promotion and marketing of organically produced local specialities like Bhaderwah Rajmash Marwah Rajmash Poonch Rajmash Kala Zeera Kishtwar Kesar Solai Honey Turmeric Garlic Sweet Corns Cowpeas Peas Desi Mash Desi Kulath Ganthia Thoom Red Chillies Sesame Kashmiri Brinjal Desi Kheera Desi Gobhi etc. There is no data in the UT regarding chemical residues on the vegetables fruits pulses or cereals being consumed directly by the human beings due to lack of Plant Residue Laboratories.

The awareness of general public and the local consumers on residues and harmful effects of the poisonous molecules in the fruits vegetable or food items will increase the consumption and demand of organic products besides prevention of health hazards. The production of chemical free vegetables and fruits can be encouraged in the rural semi-urban and urban areas by segregating the vegetative household wastes and converting it into valuable vermicompost utilizing the backyards rooftops and growbags. The complete technical Know-how of organic farming needs to be provided to the growers and the field or extension functionaries through trainings and awareness programmes. Lack of assured marketing costly certification procedures attack of pests and diseases lack of government incentives or support to the organic growers undue profit by the intermediaries unreliability of assured returns initial low production and marketing of organic products are some of the major constraints in organic farming. The non-availability of organic manures or inputs coupled with their bulky nature mar the interest of farmers. There is need for Techno-economic Feasibility Studies Project Formation and Start-Ups initiation in the potential areas for organics in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir. The State Agriculture Production & Farmers Welfare Horticulture and Allied Departments State Agriculture Universities Krishi Vigyan Kendras Central/State Universities and NGOs can take a lead role in making J & K a hub of organic products.

See what got him here.,"It took just six months for Luke Richardson to make a splash in the world of short-term lodging: Airbnb just named him as its top new host in Oklahoma.

That seems quick but he came to Airbnb with a few years of experience in long-term rentals. He and his wife Joni own 28 ""doors"" now — that's real estate language for rental units — after buying the first one in 2017.

His Airbnb unit dubbed Walk to Paseo/Western Districts is one side of a duplex built in 1924 and remodeled with a mid-century modern vibe at 1013 NW 33. It has two bedrooms and one bath and accommodates up to four guests.

The criteria for being named as top new host included becoming an Airbnb host in 2021 and hitting a certain number of guest check-ins. His listing has about 100 reviews and he is maintaining a top rating as an Airbnb ""Superhost.""

Feeling welcome in OKC

What made it an immediate success?

Airbnb says its best hosts ""work hard to give their guests the best travel experience possible (and) make their guests feel comfortable cared for and truly welcomed in both the space where they are staying and in the surrounding area.""

They also ""anticipate guests’ needs mind the details and add thoughtful touches that surprise and delight.""

Richardson said he didn't see the accolade coming.

""It definitely caught me by surprise. It's definitely an honor I appreciate it. I kind of pride myself on communication whether it's my long-term tenants or short-term I treat them just the same you know — how I'd want to be treated"" he said.

That kind of at-your-service mentality could be from the 20 years he worked in his family's cemetery business: They own and operate Hillcrest Memory Gardens and Oaklawn Memorial Gardens in Spencer.

But Richardson who lives in Edmond said something else was at play too the old saw about real estate: location location location.

""The location is great central to all the main districts in town"" said Richardson who is 42. ""You have Western Avenue less than a mile away. The Paseo is less than a mile away. The Plaza is just over a mile. The Asian District is a half-mile away. Midtown a mile away.

""So it's a 10- to 15-minute walk to Western and Paseo or a two- to three-minute car ride to all the others. With it not being immediately in those districts Paseo Midtown the price is quite a bit less per night.""

Since he started he said he's had just three nights of vacancy at $78 to $95 per night and has averaged 16 turnovers a month.

""We do a lot of one-night stays people passing through the city coming into town for a concert something like that"" he said.

Who's staying?

Guests have run the gamut.

""All ranges. You have young married couples looking for a night out to professionals coming through town to people just traveling across the country"" Richardson said. ""I had people stay here for a week for the College Softball World Series. Rodeo events.

""I was expecting it to be more people working on a contract for a week downtown or (say) a traveling nurse. But it's been anybody and everybody.""

The only trouble he's had with guests was one who smoked inside and one who stayed two hours past checkout time.

Success bred success. He started a second Airbnb a couple of weeks ago near NW 43 and Western. It's been vacant one night.

With so many properties now and probably more to come and his wife with her own career their Triple H Investments LLC could use a crew — and they're raising one: Holden 15; Hayes 10; and Hollis 7.

""The 15-year-old as soon as he starts driving he's mowing the lawns"" Richardson said.

That’s the debate going on in the city of Niagara Falls.

The debate has mobilized some against a fellow homeowner in the La Salle area of the city.

What You Need To Know Signs in a Niagara Falls neighborhood say community members want Airbnbs gone and say one short-term rental is loud and potentially dangerous



An Airbnb owner says neighbors are harassing her guests not the other way around



It is part of a larger push to limit short-term rentals to one section downtown

“I can't believe I have to live here” said Kathleen DuBois an Airbnb owner. “I’m a happy person. I didn’t live my whole life to spend my retirement years being angry.”

Humanity kindness and community are the words written on a sign in DuBois’ yard. They’re qualities DuBois says are in short supply with some of her neighbors.

“This is what my guests had to look at all summer” she said gesturing to a sign that read “Neighborhoods are for neighbors not short term rentals.""

“They want to make sure it's pointing this direction” DuBois said.

Her property is a short-term rental on Airbnb. She doesn’t live there but does rent it out to people like tourists. It’s a problem for some in the area who took their concerns to city council in May.

“My home is not a safe refuge anymore for me” said Andrea Nossavage a neighbor who expressed safety concerns.

“I've got Ring doorbells all over the place and I got a pistol permit” added Gretchen Leffler another neighbor who detailed the additional security steps she’s taken recently.

“It is the neighbors who bear the brunt of the problems added fellow neighbor Laura Rotella. “They have to police the property.”

After that meeting DuBois says the signs went up.

Spectrum News 1 attempted to ask some of the people who had these signs up why they were posted. Many did not want to comment. The people who did didn’t want to go on camera but their reasons varied.

Some said they were against Airbnbs in residential areas period. Some were just against DuBois’ Airbnb citing loud parties and even one accusation of drug dealing.

“No” DuBois said when asked if any of the allegations were true.

DuBois says she rents mainly to families a max of six people to reduce problems. She doesn’t rent to locals anymore to reduce the potential for big parties. She meets everyone in-person at the property and she herself lives around the corner in case anything comes up.

“I have forgone profit over keeping the neighbors happy” DuBois said.

According to city documents from September 2019 to June 2021 there were only six police records of issues. Only two of them were short-term renters for loud parties.

The issues go both ways DuBois said. She detailed instances in the past when her renters were yelled at had air horns blown at them and one where the family was photographed and followed.

“[He] said ‘what is the problem?’ They said ‘we're keeping an eye on everybody who comes here.’ Now who does that” questioned DuBois.

The short-term rental debate is ongoing in the city of Niagara Falls.

Dubois is one of about 350 Airbnbs here.

A new proposed ordinance would limit STRs to a section downtown an area some say is way too dangerous for tourists. Those against the zone also argue the city has bigger problems than holding back a competitive market.

“We have housing stock for a lot of people here but our population is down to 47000” said James Abbondanza the president of the Niagara Falls Tourist Home Association. “There's a lot of houses leftover. A lot of them are falling into blight.”

Abbondanza says STRs have brought back a lot of these rundown homes. He says the opposition comes down to the NIMBY or “not in my backyard” mentality.

“A lot of people are worried about strangers or transients coming through but for the most part you'll find that it's families who are coming through” Abbondanza said.

The tourists Abbondanza says spend $80 per person per day on average. So do the benefits outweigh any risks?

Abbondanza says problems with Airbnbs are low and when there are issues the problem renters don’t stick around. After all these are short-term rentals.

He does however want the city to crack down on illegal listings. Of the 350 on Airbnb only about 100 have a permit and certificate of occupancy he says.

As much as some neighbors might say otherwise DuBois is one of those responsible ones.

“I'm the highest rated Airbnb in Niagara County.”

“I'm legal and I pay every bed tax“ DuBois said.

But if an ordinance doesn’t force her out this situation might. What was supposed to be a supplement to retirement is now more of a nightmare.

“What is the point of being able to continue to operate when you can't when you're sleeping in your car on the road because you're worried what they're doing to your guests” asked DuBois. “That is pretty scary stuff.”

She won’t rent her Creekside Drive place out anymore. Her son and business partner lives here now. But they did buy a place in the zone downtown that has all necessary permits already and so come next season she might make some of that money back.

A vote to continue forward with the new short-term rental ordinance is expected on Dec. 9.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVybWFnLmNvbS9ob3VzZS1vZi1ndWNjaS1haXJibmItdmlsbGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 'House of Gucci' Villa Is on Airbnb,"Who wants to take a Gucci getaway?

Just in time for the release of Ridley Scott's highly anticipated House of Gucci superfans with a lot of extra pocket change now have the opportunity to stay at the actual six-bedroom six-bathroom villa used in the film. However the hefty price tag shouldn't come as too much of a surprise once you see the Airbnb listing.

For $1128/night you can stay at the iconic Villa Balbiano a 16th century estate right on Lake Como that's owned by Al Pacino's Aldo Gucci. Used in the movie for a Gucci family birthday party the opportunity will allow you to have the full House of Gucci experience — at least for one night.

What's for certain though is that it'll be one extremely glamorous night as the legendary waterfront palazzo is the pinnacle of luxury with ""the finest objets d'art and furniture of past centuries"" and ""spectacular 17th century frescoes painted by the Recchi brothers and Agostino Silva"" per Airbnb. Not to mention outdoor amenities like an outdoor pool private pier boathouse and the ""sumptuous garden"" where Adam Driver's Maurizio Gucci and Lady Gaga's Patrizia Reggiani reconnect with the rest of the Guccis.

A word of warning though: Only one person (and a plus one) will be able to rent out the villa so make sure your alarms are set for 12 p.m. EST on December 6.

The Italian mansion pranced around in by the likes of Lada Gaga Adam Driver Salma Hayek and Jared Leto in the just-released film “House of Gucci” will be available for a one-person one-night stay in March through the apartment rental service Airbnb.

The New York Post reports a night in the Lake Como home known as Villa Balbiano can be scored by one lucky renter on March 30 2022 for the Gucci-esque price of $1125 (airfare not included).

If you make the cut you can stay in the 16th-century mansion that has famously hosted high society — and high ranking members of the Catholic Church — for dances banquets and festivals while it was the home of Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini in the 1700s the Post reports.

The home includes a large garden that has been celebrated by Britain’s Society of Garden Designers a private pier and boathouse on the lake and an outdoor swimming pool (which we’re guessing will be closed in December).

The interior of the home includes six suites with “opulent marble bathrooms” according to the Post as well as 17-century frescos painted by Agostino Silva and the Recchi brothers.

In the new movie based on the book by Sara Gay Forden the villa plays the part of Gucci family patriarch Aldo Gucci’s (Al Pacino) home. The film centers on the life of Patrizia Reggiani (Gaga) who married into the family triggering a headlong spiral of betrayal revenge and murder. Driver plays her husband Maurizio Gucci in the Ridley Scott-directed drama that also stars Jeremy Irons.

The setting may be spectacular but reviews of the film have been atrocious. The New York Times said it is missing “a strong idea and a credible reason for existing” while the Post’s headline didn’t mince words claiming “Lady Gaga and her terrible move are shallow.” If you’re still interested in checking it out the trailer is embedded below.

The chance to book the home begins at high noon on Dec. 6 according to the Airbnb listing."

The COVID-19 Omicron variant has been named a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization raising concern just ahead of winter vacation. If you still plan to travel the best advice would be to wear a mask.

The SonoMask by Israel’s Sonovia has released multiple reports by leading textile-testing laboratories including in the European Union showing that its fabric eliminates COVID-19 particles with over 99.95% effectiveness. This has been true for the original virus strain and most recently the Delta variant.

“COVID-19 variants might have different epidemiological or immunological properties that are the result of point mutations in critical areas of the receptor binding domain. Still their overall structure and biophysical properties of the virus are almost identical. Hence the antiviral effect exerted by the Sonovia-treated fabrics is expected to be present in all COVID-19 variants” said Prof. Amos Adler director of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Tel Aviv University with whom the company consults.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a report last year explaining why people become infected during airplane flights showing that in-flight transmission is strongly associated with seating proximity crowding and flight duration.

“Air travel is contributing to the extent and speed of the pandemic spread through the movement of infected persons” the CDC said in its report.

A separate study published in the Journal of Travel Medicine looked at three mass transmission flights compared to five with zero transmission despite there being people traveling on the airplanes with COVID-19. The difference the study found was strict masking.

“Strict use of masks appears to be protective” the authors wrote.

Airplanes have unique HEPA filtration systems that help reduce the risk of the virus spreading through the air. That means that catching the virus on the plane as noted by the CDC is almost entirely from people sitting around you. Wearing masks lowers this risk by bocking particles released by those who are near you from getting into your nose and mouth.

Sonovia’s fabric is coated with zinc nanoparticles. It’s technology uses sound waves to inject silver and zinc particles into the textile that kill bacteria and viruses. The technology is currently being applied to a wide range of products other than its trademark SonoMask including seat covers for public transportation and airplane seats bed sheets and pillowcases for the hospitality sector and clothing.

Last week Sonovia reported that a global aircraft manufacturing company had reached an agreement with the company for a follow-on order for the purchase of masks with tens of thousands of dollars.

Sonovia is specially designing the masks to match the company’s brand and logo.

This followed a smaller purchase made in April 2021.

Here's how you can get a Sonovia mask too.

""Sonovia continues to expand its circle of customers and reach huge companies in various industries and the fact that an aviation giant which is among our list of customers has placed a follow-on order is proof of the quality and effectiveness of the product that we have developed and its ability to resist the COVID virus in particular and virus bacteria in general” said Sonovia CEO Igal Zeitun. “The choice of the masks that we have developed testifies to the change in the global approach and understanding that masks are not a passing fashion but will be part of our personal equipment for a long time to come.

“The choice in ordering multiple-use masks that are resistant to bacteria and viruses confirms the many advantages in using the effective technology that we have developed and which is resistant to all COVID virus variants” he continued. “We will continue in the development and sales of end products based on the company's technology to commercial and private customers around the world.""

This is not the first large company to purchase such masks according to Zeitun. He said that some of Sonovia’s other customers include Align Technology Roche and Bridgewater.

In addition to masks Sonovia also offers other products using the company's ultrasound technology and is working to create business collaborations with companies in the aviation vehicles high fashion sports fashion and institutional textiles industries.

The company already offers travel seat covers which it calls the “ultimate compact companion for flights trains buses cinemas theaters and any other time you are on the move.” (Credit: Courtesy of Sonovia)

“Airplanes have an infestation of viruses and bacteria” said Iuri Verba Sonovia’s vice president of Operations.

He said that this is especially the case in the US where airplanes can take five to six domestic flights per day and there is simply no time to deep clean seats and tray tables in between them.

“Deep cleaning happens only about once a month on most airplanes” Verba said. “People usually think the tray is the dirtiest place or the seat pocket where you stuff all your little items. But actually the dirtiest place is the head of the seat - especially the aisle seat.”

That’s because people walk through the aisle of the plane touching the top of the seat on their way back from the bathroom and after they get a drink or play with their toddler in the aisle.

A Sonovia seat cover is small enough to carry on and cover your seat for added protection. Right now these seat covers can be purchased by individual consumers. Over time as the company works closely with the same airplane manufacturer who bought SonoMasks Sonovia hopes to be able to build airplane seats covered in its fabric which would offer a long-term solution.

As the Omicron variant just reminded the world COVID-19 has not gone away.

“People won’t fly for the next decade without masks” stressed Sonovia Co-Founder Shay Hershcovich. “Our masks reduce the risk of flying as much as possible.”

Their new guidelines which have been circulated among governments clarify that VAs and VASPs fall within the scope of FATF standards — which means countries will be judged on their performance on the new metrics devised by the FATF.The guidance outlines the “application of the FATF Recommendations to countries and competent authorities; as well as to VASPs and other obliged entities that engage in VA activities including financial institutions such as banks and securities broker-dealers among others.” The idea it says is to frame rules for countries to follow that makes it easier to track and intercept money laundering/terror financing (ML/TF). In the absence of global coordination cryptocurrencies which remove the bank/financial institution as an intermediary would make such financial flows outside the ambit of global law enforcement authorities.“VASPs … have the same full set of obligations as financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions.” The guidance says. Therefore “countries should apply all of the relevant measures under the FATF Recommendations to VAs VA activities and VASPs.”The Guidance stresses that governments and central banks are “required to take action to identify natural or legal persons that carry out VA activities without the requisite license or registration.” This would be equally applicable to countries that have banned crypto as well as to those who allow it with regulation and monitoring.In addition FATF rules say only governments are “competent authorities” to monitor crypto.The October 2021 updated guidance adds greater detail and clarity to what is expected of governments as they seek to address this new technology which is both an opportunity and a threat. “(1) clarify the definitions of VA and VASP to make clear that these definitions are expansive and there should not be a case where a relevant financial asset is not covered by the FATF Standards (either as a VA or as another financial asset) (2) provide guidance on how the FATF Standards apply to stable-coins and clarify that a range of entities involved in stable-coin arrangements could qualify as VASPs under the FATF Standards (3) provide additional guidance on the risks and the tools available to countries to address the ML/TF risks for peer-to- peer transactions which are transactions that do not involve any obliged entities (4) provide updated guidance on the licensing and registration of VASPs (5) provide additional guidance for the public and private sectors on the implementation of the ‘travel rule’ and (6) include Principles of Information-Sharing and Co-operation Amongst VASP Supervisors.”Basically it leaves little space for an outright ban by governments. The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill seeks to ban all but a few private cryptocurrencies to promote underlying technologies while allowing an official digital currency by the RBI . The proposed legislation seeks to ""create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India however it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses"".Globally China has completely banned all cryptocurrency and declared that it will issue a digitised yuan. However blockchain and startups are supported.The US is more welcoming — New York has a licensing framework BitLicense for private crypto exchanges. Reports say the US is working on further clarification of rules and regulations regarding crypto.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZXRpbnNpZ2h0cy5ldC1lZGdlLmNvbS9sZXZlcmFnaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ2ljYWwtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1mb3ItZXhjZWxsZW5jZS1pbi1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vZXRpbnNpZ2h0cy5ldC1lZGdlLmNvbS9sZXZlcmFnaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ2ljYWwtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1mb3ItZXhjZWxsZW5jZS1pbi1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leveraging Technological Innovation for Excellence in Customer Experience - ET Edge Insights,

NORTHBROOK - The Allstate Corp. Monday said it has reached an agreement to sell property making up the majority of its campus in Northbrook to Dermody Properties for approximately $232 million. The sale is expected to close in 2022.

Allstate is selling the property as employees have more choice about where they work and many are choosing to work from home. The company plans to keep a significant presence in the Chicago area including its existing office space in downtown Chicago.

The sale will also reduce real estate expenses and further advance Allstate's multiyear initiative to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost insurer with broad distribution the company said.

Allstate moved into the Northbrook site in 1967 and the campus now includes 2 million square feet of office space. The buildings and land are located at 2675 2700 2755 2775 and 3075 Sanders Road in Northbrook.",,,,,,,,,

How to translate a single phrase

Sometimes you just need to translate a single phrase into another language. This can be something as simple as ""where's the bathroom"" or ""where can I find pizza?"" Whatever you need Google Translate can help with that quick request.

Open the Google Translate app. At the bottom of the screen above the microphone select your language as the first language. Select the other person's language as the second option. Press the microphone button and begin speaking. When finished speaking press the stop button to end translation. You can also select the transcribe button to prepare a text of what was heard.

Note that Google Translate currently only works offline with a handful of languages like English French German Italian and Japanese.

How to translate a conversation

Sometimes it makes more sense to translate entire conversations at once especially if you're trying to ask more complex questions or get to know someone who doesn't speak your language. Google offers two types of conversational translations: manual and automatic.

With manual translation you'll speak into the translate app one at a time and wait for Google Assistant to read back your translated speech. With automatic translation Google Translate will automatically detect the languages spoken and translate them at near-real-time speed with Google Assistant reading translated speech aloud as it is processed.

Open the Google Translate app. At the bottom of the screen above the microphone select your language as the first language. Select the other person's language as the second option. Select the conversation button to initiate automatic conversation translation. In conversation select the microphone button for each language to translate one person's speech at a time. For a more natural conversational flow select the auto button at the bottom to allow Google to detect spoken languages automatically.

It's worth noting that Google Live Translation is only intended for a conversation between two people. While it's possible to initiate a 3-way conversation it'll require a bit more finagling to get things flowing well. While offline you can only translate between a handful of languages like English French German Italian and Japanese.

Also note that there can sometimes be a significant delay between translations when using the automatic translate mode. This is because Google Translate is waiting to ensure that someone's end of the conversation is finished before translating in an attempt to keep Google Assistant from talking over the person in question.

Manual translation takes a slight bit of additional work but is worthwhile since you can manually start and stop translation at any time resulting in a quicker translated conversation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - WhatsApp has won regulatory approval to double the number of users on its payments service in India to 40 million a source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Friday.

The company had requested that there should be no cap on users of its payment service in India.

Instead the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)this week told the company it could double the user base to which it can offer its payment service - currently restricted to 20 million - the source said.

WhatsApp is owned by Facebook which recently changed its name to Meta.

The source said the new cap would still hinder the company's growth prospects given that WhatsApp's messenger service has more than 500 million users in India the company's biggest market.

It was not clear when the new cap would come into effect.

WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment while the NPCI declined to comment.

WhatsApp competes with Alphabet Inc's Google Pay SoftBank- and Ant Group-backed Paytm and Walmart's PhonePe in India's crowded digital market.

The NPCI gave WhatsApp approval to start its payments service last year after the company spent years trying to comply with Indian regulations including data storage norms that require all payments-related data to be stored locally.

WhatsApp has almost reached its user base of 20 million for payment services said the source who declined to be identified as the details are private.

Online transactions lending and e-wallet services have been growing rapidly in India led by a government push to make the country's cash-loving merchants and consumers adopt digital payments.

If you don't have a Google Pixel 6 don't fret. Google Live Translate still works and will just need an active internet connection to function instead. That's because Google Live Translate is processed through Google's cloud Tensor processors while the Pixel 6 has its own Tensor processor on-board.

How to translate a single phrase

Sometimes you just need to translate a single phrase into another language. This can be something as simple as ""where's the bathroom"" or ""where can I find pizza?"" Whatever you need Google Translate can help with that quick request.

Open the Google Translate app. At the bottom of the screen above the microphone select your language as the first language. Select the other person's language as the second option. Press the microphone button and begin speaking. When finished speaking press the stop button to end translation. You can also select the transcribe button to prepare a text of what was heard.

Note that Google Translate currently only works offline with a handful of languages like English French German Italian and Japanese.

How to translate a conversation

Sometimes it makes more sense to translate entire conversations at once especially if you're trying to ask more complex questions or get to know someone who doesn't speak your language. Google offers two types of conversational translations: manual and automatic.

With manual translation you'll speak into the translate app one at a time and wait for Google Assistant to read back your translated speech. With automatic translation Google Translate will automatically detect the languages spoken and translate them at near-real-time speed with Google Assistant reading translated speech aloud as it is processed.

Open the Google Translate app. At the bottom of the screen above the microphone select your language as the first language. Select the other person's language as the second option. Select the conversation button to initiate automatic conversation translation. In conversation select the microphone button for each language to translate one person's speech at a time. For a more natural conversational flow select the auto button at the bottom to allow Google to detect spoken languages automatically.

It's worth noting that Google Live Translation is only intended for a conversation between two people. While it's possible to initiate a 3-way conversation it'll require a bit more finagling to get things flowing well. While offline you can only translate between a handful of languages like English French German Italian and Japanese.

Also note that there can sometimes be a significant delay between translations when using the automatic translate mode. This is because Google Translate is waiting to ensure that someone's end of the conversation is finished before translating in an attempt to keep Google Assistant from talking over the person in question.

Manual translation takes a slight bit of additional work but is worthwhile since you can manually start and stop translation at any time resulting in a quicker translated conversation.

If you find yourself looking for directions or just trying to read a menu in a foreign country Google Translate can help translate any image your phone's camera can see. Here's how to get started:

Open the Google Translate app. At the bottom of the screen select the camera button. At the top of the next screen select the language you're translating from as the first selection. Select the language you're translating into as the second selection. Aim your phone's camera at any sign or other printed or digital text and watch as the words are automatically translated into your language of choice.

As general manager of the Akron Amazon Fulfillment Center he is in charge of 4000-plus employees 100 managers and 10000 robotic helpers all tasked with getting consumers what they want and when they want it.

And Amazon Akron is ready for the full Yule demand he said.

“We spent the year loading up on inventory” Boorstein said in a recent phone interview. “We are pretty well-positioned for the holiday season.”

It’s a position many local and national businesses would envy. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to buffet the economy companies have struggled to find workers reluctant to rejoin the workforce.

Amazon itself is running an advertising blitz recruiting workers at a starting wage of $15 per hour with health care benefits. Bloomberg News reports that the company's entry-level workers can earn more than some managers with ample overtime shifts.

In Akron Boorstein said the center remains in a hiring mode touting a $3000 bonus that’s paid out over 90 days to lure new employees.

“This holiday season we’re hiring hundreds at our Akron fulfillment center” he said.

The massive needs of the 2.5 million-square-foot facility also create opportunities for employees to advance quickly he said.

“Just in the last two weeks [we] promoted eight team members to the management ranks” he said. “There is a path to advancement in Amazon that is faster and a little more broad … than you see elsewhere.”

Akron facility delivers a half-million items daily

The center celebrated its first anniversary Nov. 1 and in that time has ramped up to deliver a half-million items a day.

“We are one of the highest-volume sites in terms of shipping to customers in the area” he said.

The Akron center isn't the area's largest he said but it is more modern incorporating ever-evolving changes the company discovers as it expands. Boorstein said the Akron facility is constantly looking for ways to update and streamline its operations with ideas often being generated from within the center.

The improvements can be very basic he said.

“How the material that goes in the package … is distributed and goes to where it’s packed” he said. “[What’s a] more efficient way to distribute it?”

None of the space in the four-story center goes to waste Boorstein said.

“Our entire roof is now covered with solar panels [with] 4-megawatt capacity” he said.

It wouldn’t be enough to power the entire center he said but could provide enough electricity for 400 to 900 homes according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission statistics.

Fulfillment center boosts local eateries food trucks

Despite its vast size the center doesn’t house any food establishments providing the basics with vending machines and microwave ovens.

Boorstein said the center often hosts food trucks for hungry employees and is happy to accept inquiries from local food vendors.

Employees also keep food coffee and other establishments located near the facility busy he said.

“We keep the Taco Bell across the street in pretty good shape” he said.

Amazon hiring 150000 seasonal employees nationwide using alternate ports

Boorstein said Amazon in Akron and across the U.S. has tried to position itself this year to keep Christmas merry for consumers.

Nationally Bloomberg News reports the company planned to hire 150000 seasonal employees to deal with the holiday crush. It’s also been chartering ships to obscure ports to avoid the dysfunctional Port of Los Angeles — where ships have been unable to unload their products in a timely manner — and running half-full delivery trucks.

Akron is doing its part in the Amazon system to keep things moving Boorstein said.

“I think the company has really worked hard to make sure we’re ready for the holiday season” he said. “[In Akron] we are focused on the inventory that comes to our location … We work almost around the clock.”

In The Warehouse: Workers and Robots at Amazon Alessandro Delfanti associate professor at the University of Toronto and author of Biohackers: The Politics of Open Science deftly examines the dichotomy between Amazon's public personas and its union-busting worker-surveilling behavior in fulfillment centers around the world — and how it leverages cutting edge technologies to keep its employees' collective noses to the grindstone pissing in water bottles. In the excerpt below Delfanti examines the way in which our current batch of digital robber barons lean on the classic redemption myth to launder their images into that of wonderkids deserving of unabashed praise.

Pluto Press

This is an excerpt from The Warehouse: Workers and Robots at Amazon by Alessandro Delfanti available now from Pluto Press.

Besides the jobs trucks and concrete what Amazon brought to Piacenza and to the dozens of other suburban areas which host its warehouses is a myth: a promise of modernization economic development and even individual emancipation that stems from the “disruptive” nature of a company heavily based on the application of new technology to both consumption and work. It is a promise that assumes that the society in question is willing to entrust such ambitions to the gigantic multinational corporations that design implement and possess technology. This myth of digital capitalism is based on a number of elements including magical origins heroes and stories of redemption. Some are by now familiar to everyone: A couple of teenagers tinkering away in a garage can revolutionize or create from scratch an entire industry generating billions in the process. The garage is an important component of this myth. Here we are not talking about the garages where MXP5 workers park their cars after a ten-hour shift in the warehouse nor about the garages where Amazon Flex couriers store piles of boxes to be delivered. The innovation garage is the site where individuals unbounded by old habits and funded by venture capital turn simple ideas into marketable digital commodities. Nowhere does this myth run deeper than in California: William Hewlett and David Packard’s Palo Alto backyard shack is listed on the US National Register of Historic Places as “the birthplace of Silicon Valley” while the garage of Steve Jobs’ parents’ house (where he and Steve Wozniak built the first batch of Apple computers) has been recently designated as a “historical site” by the city of Los Altos. These garages have even been turned into informal museums and receive thousands of visitors a year some even arriving with organized tour buses. For Californian historian Mario Biagioli the garage has become an important rhetorical device in contemporary discourses helping mythify the origins of contemporary innovation. Masculine innovation in particular since the garage is a strictly male space. Bezos himself started Amazon in a garage albeit not in California—or so Amazon’s origin myth goes: in 1994 he left his lucrative but dull Wall Street hedge fund job and wrote a business plan while driving cross-country from New York to Seattle where he used his and his family’s money to start the company.

The myth of the redemption and success of the hero entrepreneur trickles down to the warehouse insofar as Amazon presents work to its employees through the frame of emancipation. The idea of redemption through work is nothing new. On the contrary it is a damnation common to modern society. In the early 1960s militant sociologist Romano Alquati pointed out that the culture of mid-20th century Italian factories included the construction of a “myth” or “cult” of emancipation. In this instance it was directed at the masses of migrant workers who following World War II moved from the rural south to the north of the country to find manufacturing work with the flagship companies of the Italian postwar economic boom such as FIAT or Olivetti. Redemption from the backwardness of rural life was ensured not only by steady paychecks and the prospect of a pension at the end of the line but also by participation in technologically advanced production processes—the assembly line of industrial capitalism. Amazon simply repeats and updates such promises. In Italy for example Amazon positions itself as an employee-focused company that brings stable employment back to a precarized labor market—a boon to a labor market hit by financial crises lackluster growth and lack of opportunities for retraining and upskilling. So Amazon continues a historical trajectory of Italian capitalism but imports onto the local context novel characteristics borrowed from the American digital corporation model.

Indeed digital capitalism updates industrial capitalism’s promise of economic and social emancipation with some novel elements of its own. Rather than simply swapping out the assembly line with the robot or the algorithm the culture of digital capitalism mixes libertarian ideology with entrepreneurial elements. At the core of this myth lies a form of individualism. The combination of new information technologies with free-market dynamics enables emancipatory potential for the entrepreneur. Furthermore digital capitalist companies state that they exist to change the world to make people happy to create value for everyone and not just for investors—technological optimism at its apex. After all how could you deliver a bad outcome when your first principle is don’t be evil as Google’s old slogan famously put it.

Amazon extends this old myth to all its workers. Indeed in corporate documents the company goes so far as to state that everyone is an “owner” at Amazon. While this is quite literal in the case of engineers and executives who receive shares of the company it can only be understood at the level of mythology for warehouse workers. A figurative or spiritual commitment to the company’s destiny. Managerial techniques used in the warehouse contribute to building this myth as associates are asked to have fun at work and help Amazon make history as one of its corporate slogans goes. The myth brings with it the idea that there is no alternative to digital capitalism. Only co-option or failure for those who can’t keep up or won’t adapt or submit.

Myths are not just old stories or false beliefs. They are ideas that help us make sense of the world. The myth of digital capitalism itself is not simply fictitious but instead has very concrete effects. For Big Tech corporations this myth projects a positive contribution to the world helping to attract workers and investment and boost corporate value on financial markets. But it has other concrete effects as well. In different areas of the world and in different communities the myth of redemption stemming from participation in high-tech production has impacted economies and cultures. Feminist media studies scholar Lisa Nakamura recounted how in the 1970s electronics manufacturers operating on Navajo land in New Mexico justified the employment of Indigenous women. Labor in microchip production was presented as empowering for the crafty and docile Navajo women—assumptions derived from racist stereotyping. Italy is completely different from the Navajo Nation and yet the idea that an imported version of American digital capitalism can be a force for collective modernization and individual emancipation is alive and well there too. Belief in this myth is evidenced in many different and even contrasting ways. Some bring resources like the $1.5 billion state-owned venture capital fund launched in 2020 by the Italian government to support start-up companies in the hope they will foster economic growth. Others sell resources off like when mayors of small towns with high unemployment compete to attract the next Amazon FC offering the company both farmland newly opened up for development and a local workforce ready to staff the warehouse. Over the years the mayors of Castel San Giovanni have described the presence of MXP5 as a force of “development” and a source of “pride” for the town. This is not unique to Italy. American mayors are routinely quoted praising the arrival of a new Amazon facility as a “wonderful” or “monumental” thing for their town.

Amazon’s corporate slogans also hedge up its myth. Central is the valorization of disruption—the idea of a hero entrepreneur defeating the gods of the past. Some of the slogans (the so-called Leadership Principles) are repeated time and again and painted everywhere in the warehouse. While Aboutamazon.com the company’s corporate website describes them as “more than inspirational wall hangings” that is exactly what they sound like. Customer obsession is perhaps the most famous one a slogan that captures the strategic goal of focusing on customers’ needs: the rest (profits power) will follow. It also signals that workers are by design an afterthought. Other slogans are even more predictable like Leaders are right a lot or Think big. Amazon’s myth trickles down to fulfillment centers like MXP5 in many ways. Amazon routinely conducts marketing operations aimed at finding new workers not new customers. Billboards sporting smiling warehouse workers recruitment events and glowing articles commissioned by staffing agencies in the local newspaper are common sights in Piacenza as in the areas surrounding other FCs. Social media multiplies the message. Amazon encourages employees to join its army of “ambassadors”—workers who plaster social media with positive stories about their job or videos in which they happily dance inside the warehouse. Like the FC’s walls all these practices are soaked with the Leadership Principles: at a recruitment event near Toronto slogans such as Fulfilling the customer promise were projected as part of a slideshow filled with smiling arrow logos accompanying a presentation of more mundane details like job descriptions or benefits. “Every Amazonian who wants to be a leader” we were told should focus on “customer obsession” and “never settle” and let’s not forget that Amazonians “are right a lot.” The event wrapped up with free pizza.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9hbWF6b24ta2luZGxlLW9hc2lzLTIwMTctcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Kindle Oasis (2017) review,"The 2017 version of the Amazon Kindle Oasis remains expensive but it still offers one of best ereader experiences money can buy with an easy-to-use system beautiful design and phenomenal reading experience.

When Amazon launched the first Kindle it felt revolutionary and helped to propel the nascent ereader to the widespread reading tool it is now.

But nowadays innovating in the ereader market is a difficult task and something Amazon has struggled with in successive iterations of the Kindle line-up. That's all changed however with the Kindle Oasis.

The launch of the Kindle Oasis (2017) marked 10 years since the release of the first ever Amazon ereader. Fittingly for a milestone product the Oasis felt like a big step forward.

It has since been replaced in Amazon's line-up with its most recent Kindle Oasis that was launched in 2019 that comes with a warm light for the very first time.

That means the price of this existing Kindle Oasis has dropped down but it still comes with a waterproof design audiobook playback features and a notably larger screen than other Kindle models.

The Kindle Oasis (2017) price started at £229.99/$249.99/AU$389

Has now dropped down to around £199.99/$199.99 (about AU$350)

You can buy it now from Amazon and other third-party retailers

Image 1 of 3

This version of the Kindle Oasis was released back in 2017 and despite being replaced by a newer model it's still readily available from a variety of retailers. You'll find it refereed to on Amazon's site as the ""previous generation Kindle Oasis"".

The 8GB version launched at £229.99/$249.99/AU$389 but the price is now slightly lower at £199.99 or $199.99. We can't find the Kindle Oasis (2017) on sale in Australia at the moment.

There's also a 32GB version that launched at £259.99/$279.99 (with no Australian pricing available for this model). If you want the top of the range model which comes with free cellular connectivity so you can download books anywhere that originally set you back £319.99/$349.99/AU$529 but is now available for less.

It’s not a cheap piece of kit considering you can pick up the cheapest version of the Kindle for only £59.99/$79.99 (about AU$105) but you get a lot more than with the most basic versions of the Kindle and if you’re planning to read a lot you may find it worth the extra money.

Black Friday is sure to bring some further discounts to Amazon's Kindle range as well when it turns up toward the end of 2019.

Key features

Audible integration so you can listen to audiobooks over Bluetooth

No 3.5mm headphone jack or speakers though

Unlike its predecessor the Kindle Oasis (2017) doesn’t just do ebooks – it also works with Audible audiobook titles. If you use the audiobook service from Amazon you'll be able to listen to them on your Oasis with the use of Bluetooth headphones or a speaker.

There's no 3.5mm headphone jack which means you won't be able to listen to audiobooks over wired headphones and that will be disappointing for some people. But it's likely been sacrificed to allow for the waterproof design so swings and roundabouts.

We'd have loved to have seen some speakers included within the Kindle Oasis itself but if you have a pair of Bluetooth headphones you’ll be able to listen while on the move in peace.

One nice touch is that if you own both the Audible and ebook version of a title you can quickly switch between the two without losing your place.

That means you'll be able to read physically on the screen then switch over to the audiobook while you're on a walk and seamlessly switch back when you have a chance to read on the screen again.

Owning both audiobook and ebook versions of a title may sound like an expensive endeavour but if you already own the ebook Amazon will sell you the audio version starting at £2.99 (about $4 AU$5). It's going to cost extra money but if you’re a serious reader who wants to make progress with a title anytime anywhere with minimal interruptions you’re likely to welcome this feature.

We found it worked well – you can just press on the Audiobook button at the bottom-right of the display to switch over to the audio edition; you may have to listen to a minute or so of audio you’ve already read within the ebook as it won’t know the exact moment you stopped but it makes it easy to pick up where you left off.

If you're also planning to use the Oasis for your audiobooks it's likely you'll want the larger 32GB version to ensure you have enough room for all of your titles. The 8GB version will be enough for a ton of ebooks but if you’re planning to add a few audio titles that’ll soon fill up.

Design

First time Amazon has released an all-metal Kindle plus it's waterproof

Most comfortable to hold Kindle that you can buy right now

In perhaps the biggest departure in terms of design the Kindle Oasis (2017) has an all-metal design a first for the Kindle range. It's an aluminium material that doesn't feel slippery in the hand.

It's heavier than the last-generation Kindle Oasis at 194g but it's still a comfortable weight in the hand and weighs less than the Kindle Paperwhite . During our time reading with the device we never found it would get too heavy and that’s down to its unique design.

The design on the rear is similar to the previous Kindle Oasis with one side thicker than the other with the thicker side designed to sit in your hand to offer a good grip.

The primary reason for this thicker part is to house the battery but this time there's no ugly case connector on the rear and overall it looks superior to the original Oasis.

Color choice wise you'll have graphite (the one pictured throughout this review) but there's also a champagne gold version of the 32GB model if you want something a little more extravagant.

In fact Amazon has taken the case mechanic of the original model away altogether. Instead you can buy covers to protect your Kindle but there are no battery cases available for this model.

For cases you have the choice of water-safe fabric covers for £39.99 (about $50 AU$70) or more premium-feel leather options available in Midnight (black) Saddle Tan or Merlot (dark-red) for £54.99/AU$84.95 (about $70).

We tried out the blue water-safe case during our full review and while it felt comfortable we did find that it would get in the way a little while you were reading and this may be an issue if you’re planning to always use it.

Image 1 of 2 These are the water-safe cases for the Kindle Oasis Amazon also offers premium leather options to protect your Kindle Oasis

The new Kindle Oasis is also waterproof which is a first for the Kindle range. It can survive for up to an hour submerged up to two meters deep which means it'll shrug off the odd dunk or splash which is reassuring if you do a lot of reading in the bath or by the pool on holiday.

Arguably the only negative in terms of the design is that if your Oasis has been sitting around on a table or in a bag for a while the metal can feel uncomfortably cold to the touch when you pick it up.

Apart from that though this is the most comfortable experience we’ve had with an ereader and that means it’s easier to keep reading for longer.

In July 2020 the Seattle-based carrier opened a gleaming new 6-story office building called ""The Hub"" across from its corporate headquarters with an open-to-the-public company store (and a Starbucks) on the first floor. But because the pandemic was just taking hold when The Hub opened there's been barely any publicity about the store and thus few non-employee shoppers.

This holiday season should be much different. More people are traveling and word is spreading about the unique logo and branded gear on the shop's shelves for Alaska Airlines and its sister regional carrier Horizon Air.

""This is the best of the best for company swag. says Karen McAvinew Manager of Retail Operations for Alaska Airlines. She says the shop is a short drive or a manageable 1-mile walk from SEA airport and offers a view of the Alaska Airlines hangar and a peek-a-boo view of the 780-foot aerial walkway at SEA that is the longest arial walkway over an existing taxiway.

While most of the glassware apparel accessories and gift items in the store can also be found in the airline's online shop we discovered plenty of in-store bonuses during our pre-Thanksgiving shopping excursion alongside several pilots who had stopped in before their flights.

Model Airplanes

The shop stocks – and displays on a wall – model airplanes in various scales of almost every current Alaska and Horizon livery flying including the More to Love livery that celebrated the joining of Alaska Airlines and Virgin America the Salmon Thirty Salmon depicting yup a salmon the ""Honoring Those Who Have Served"" plane and livery celebrating ""Captain Marvel"" ""Toy Story"" Disney and other promotions and partnerships. Prices range from about $30 to well over $100 and we spotted some models in the shop that show as sold-out online. Models of Alaska Airlines' new Pride plane and one celebrating Seattle's new professional ice hockey team the Seattle Kraken should land soon.

Be sure to look up. Hanging from the shop is a display of many collectible airplane models that have been discontinued.

Latin America’s largest airline plans to raise around $5 billion by issuing shares and convertible notes to current stockholders and creditors as it exits Chapter 11 bankruptcy according to court papers. Ultimately the deal allows a group of creditors – led by Sixth Street Partners Sculptor Capital and SVPGlobal – to take control of the company.

It will also allow Santiago-based Latam to slash its debt load by around US$4 billion upon exit from the process which could come as soon as mid-2022 if approved by a judge and shareholders. Delta Air Lines Inc Qatar Airways and Chile’s Cueto family – which together owned most of the company going into the reorganisation – have agreed to support the plan helping smooth over thorny Chilean law issues that have hung over negotiations.

Creditors and shareholders “joined forces in providing over US$5 billion of fresh capital for Latam to support the restructuring and bring it forward” Roberto Alvo chief executive officer of Latam said in an interview. The plan and agreement “provide the basis for a very strong and solid future of Latam.”

The deal marks a win for Latam which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 as Covid-19 lockdowns stymied international travel. Had the company failed to file a restructuring plan by Friday it risked losing control of its bankruptcy exit strategy. Rival carrier Azul SA has said it wants to buy Latam if given the opportunity.

Plan details

For Latam the plan is a major step toward exiting bankruptcy. Creditors who are unhappy with the deal can still seek to block it but US bankruptcy rules allow a company to force a restructuring deal on unwilling creditors if certain legal hurdles are met.

The airline plans to issue US$800 million of common stock and resume trading in Santiago with American depositary receipts or ADRs in New York Alvo said. Existing shareholders will get the first crack at purchasing the new stock – an unusual occurrence in US bankruptcy which typically sees shareholders wiped out entirely. But Chilean regulations give stockholders rights over new shares sold by their companies.

A creditor group owed billions of dollars by Latam has agreed to buy any new shares not purchased by existing stockholders. In addition to Sixth Street Sculptor and SVPGlobal that creditor group included Monarch Alternative Capital and Silver Point Capital as of October 27 according to court papers.

Crucially the plan calls for the issuance of three classes of notes that can be converted to stock. In keeping with Chilean law current stockholders will have the right to buy those too but their structure makes them more attractive to creditors and shareholders supporting the plan Alvo said.

Low-ranking creditors can swap their claims for one class of the notes while the others are designed for stakeholders that have already agreed to support the plan or are contributing fresh cash to Latam Alvo said.

All told existing Latam shareholders could end up with close to 30 percent of the the equity in the airline with the rest ending up in the hands of creditors he said.

In addition Latam will take on US$2.75 billion of new debt – to be raised either through the bond market or term loans along with a credit facility – which will be used in part to repay current creditors. Overall plan will reduce Latam’s debt to about $7 billion from around $11 billion at the start of the bankruptcy.

Azul bid

Rival Brazilian airline Azul SA – founded by David Neeleman who also started JetBlue Airways – made a bid to buy Latam’s operations. Latam considered Azul’s proposal but Alvo said it lacked specificity.

“It was a proposal that was hypothetical and impossible to bring forward” he said without providing details. “We considered its merits. It’s insufficient.”

Azul has been working with a smaller group of creditors on an alternative bankruptcy exit plan according to a person with direct knowledge of the proposal who asked for anonymity because the details are confidential. The proposal would result in the formation of a new company owned by Latam creditors and Azul shareholders. Combining two of the largest carriers in the Brazilian domestic market would create a more efficient company and cut operating costs the person said.

But under US bankruptcy rules because Latam filed its plan within a court-specified deadline Azul and other creditors’ ability to float their own plans is severely curtailed. Latam has the sole right to pitch a restructuring proposal until that right is terminated.

What’s next?

Latam used Chapter 11 to trim its fleet renegotiate aircraft leases and cut other costs including slashing its workforce to around 29000 from 43000 previously. The company has seen domestic travel in key markets such as Brazil Colombia and Chile rebound but it won’t reach pre-pandemic levels of demand until 2024 Alvo said.

It will emerge into a Latin American travel market turned upside down by the pandemic with some of the largest carriers including Colombia’s Avianca Holdings SA and Grupo Aeromexico forced into bankruptcy.

Alvo said Latam has cut operating costs to allow it to compete with the ultra low-cost carriers and is in the final stages of receiving regulatory approval for a joint venture with Delta that will boost its international flight options.

“The whole industry and the company has been brought to its knees by this unforeseen event” he said referring to the impact of Covid-19. “Today our position in all of the countries where we have operations is equal or better than the one we had prior to entering the pandemic.”

EV Battery Market and Materials,"Electric vehicle (EV) batteries have come a long way since the first electric vehicles were invented in the 1830s. Modern electric vehicles run on lithium-ion batteries which were introduced in 1991.

As the EV battery and energy storage markets grow manufacturers continue to experiment with chemistries configurations and production processes—with the common goal of creating more efficient batteries that last longer cost less and have a lower environmental impact. What goes into an EV battery is already changing and is likely to continue to change over the next decades.



What Is in an EV Battery?

An EV battery is a pack of individual battery cells each about the size of a AA battery. Those cells are clustered into protective frames called modules each with its own circuitry and those modules are clustered together into a pack.

The entire pack is managed by a Battery Management System and a cooling system that regulates the heat and voltage protects the battery from draining too much or too quickly and manages the charging and discharging of energy.



EV batteries work by moving lithium ions (charged atoms) through a solution called an electrolyte which carries positively charge ions between separate electrodes called anodes and cathodes. This process creates an electric current that is sent to the EV's motor.

What the electrodes separators and electrolytes are made of can vary. Lithium is the indispensable element of course but among the most frequently used other components are aluminum carbon cobalt iron manganese nickel oxygen phosphorus and silicon. New combinations and chemistries emerge all the time using other elements like sodium or tin and sulfur. (These are not the so-called rare earth minerals that are used in other parts of EVs as well as in gas-powered cars.)

Supply Chain Concerns

EVs compete with electronics and energy storage devices—both of them growing industries—for lithium-ion batteries.

The International Energy Agency projects that 200 million EVs could be on the roads by 2030. Demand for minerals for supplying batteries for EVs and energy storage is expected to grow by five- to ten-fold by 2030 and ten- to thirty-fold by 2040.



According to the Electric Vehicle Battery Supply Chain Analysis from Automotive Manufacturing Solutions (AMS) there is concern over whether supply will match the demand across the battery supply chain. Yet AMS predicts that “global capacity for lithium-ion batteries will increase from 475 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2020 to more than 2850 GWh by 2030” with 80 new gigafactories across the globe to produce lithium-ion cells and batteries.

None of the key elements in EV batteries are rare. The question is whether or not the production of them can keep pace with the increasing demand for electric vehicles.

Cobalt and Replacements

Anti-mining groups protest the proposal to expand lithium mining in Portugal May 2021. Horacio Villalobos / Getty Images

Cobalt is the most controversial of the minerals used in EV batteries since its main source the Democratic Republic of Congo has a history of human rights abuses. While manufacturers have reduced the percentage of cobalt from 60% in the first generation of lithium-ion batteries to 15-20% cobalt today reducing that percentage to zero is part of the U.S. Department of Energy's National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries released in June 2021.

Replacing cobalt with more nickel poses its own problems however depending on how environmentally-friendly (or unfriendly) the mining is. Cobalt- and nickel-free electric vehicles do exist already and have proved commercially successful. Lithium mining has also come under criticism from environmentalists and indigenous people for its harmful effects.

Three countries—China Argentina and Bolivia—account for 58% of the world's lithium reserves though Australia puts about half of the world's lithium into production. Abundant lithium supplies (86 million tons) exist around the world including in the United States.

China is the world's leader in refining those raw materials for batteries and more than two-thirds of battery manufacturing is controlled by three companies—CATL LG and Panasonic—based in China South Korea and Japan respectively. Three other companies bring that market share up to 87%.

In the United States however 70% of battery cells and 87% of battery packs are produced domestically rather than imported—in large part due to the industry dominance of Tesla known for its vertical integration. Its Panasonic batteries are produced in Nevada.



What Is Vertical Integration? Vertical integration involves keeping the manufacturing processes in-house rather than outsourcing them to independent suppliers as most auto companies do today.

Traditional car manufacturers have historically relied on outsourced suppliers so as they increase their own production of EVs concerns about supply chains have grown with them. European and American EV manufacturers are taking steps to bring battery manufacturing home.



Battery Recycling

Battery recycling is likely to play a key role in meeting such a high demand for minerals. 95% of the minerals in EV batteries can be recycled and numerous startup companies are already competing to garner market share. By 2021 over 100 companies worldwide were recycling EV batteries or planned to do so soon.



The problem is that EV batteries are expected to last a long time and the demand for batteries may outpace the supply of recycled ones. Used EV batteries can be deployed as-is for stationary energy storage thus reducing their availability for recycling.

The challenge is for battery recycling companies to reach economies of scale to make recycling worth their efforts. As in other industries recycling efforts can be little more than industry greenwashing.

The results of the American Express 2021 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey show that total reported projected spending among U.S. consumers who shopped at independent retailers and restaurants on Small Business Saturday reached an estimated $23.3 billion1 up 18% from $19.8 billion in 20202 and an increase from pre-pandemic spending in 2019 ($19.6 billion).

Over the past 12 years consumers reported spending an estimated $163 billion at small businesses on Small Business Saturday since American Express started the movement in 20103. This year thousands of American Express Neighborhood Champions across all 50 states celebrated Small Business Saturday in their local communities.

“This Small Business Saturday communities coast to coast came together to show their support for the small businesses they cherish” said Elizabeth Rutledge Chief Marketing Officer at American Express. “We can all make a difference when we Shop Small® and American Express is committed to encouraging consumers to do so all year long through our goal to drive $100 billion in consumer spending at small businesses over the next five years4.”

As communities continue to navigate the effects of the pandemic particularly underrepresented business owners who were hit harder consumers say they are being mindful about the businesses they frequent this season with 64% of those surveyed stating they make it a priority to seek out and shop at underrepresented-owned businesses in their communities.

“Small Business Saturday is a way for us to engage with our community and show people why it's important for us to have each other's backs” said Ali Rose of Genusee a Flint Michigan-based eyewear company. “We’re here because we want to create jobs in our community not just to sell items because creating local employment is as important as having special places to shop and gather together.”

A majority (79%) of consumers understood the importance of supporting the small businesses in their community on Small Business Saturday this year and 66% reported that the day makes them want to Shop Small all year long. In addition the 2021 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights survey revealed that online shopping an important source of revenue for small businesses was up slightly on the day with 58% of shoppers making a purchase online compared to 56% in 2020 and 43% in 2019.

With small businesses in need of continued support to help navigate the effects of the pandemic American Express is asking consumers to prioritize shopping at independent retailers in their community throughout the holiday season. New research released earlier this month by American Express found that consumers shopping small throughout this holiday season have the potential to contribute an estimated $695B into the U.S. small business economy5. In the same study 78% of independent retailers said these holiday sales are critical and will enable them to stay in business in 2022.

Consumers can find American Express accepting small businesses in their community to shop at all holiday season long through the Shop Small Map.

The lounge is located on the domestic pier of the Delhi IGI Airport.

American Express will amend policy for Platinum and Black Cardmembers effective December 24 2021

Till so far American Express permitted all their cardmembers Platinum and Centurion plus their supplementary cardmembers to bring along two guests to the lounge in Delhi apart from kids under 12 years of age.

American Express has now notified a change whereby guests will be no longer be admitted to the lounge free of charge effective December 2021. Here is an excerpt of a member communication sent out to Platinum and Centurion cardmembers:

While you and your Supplementary Cardmember have complimentary access beginning 24 December 2021 a fee of ₹2000 plus applicable taxes will be charged to your Card for your guest at our lounge in Terminal 3 at Indira Gandhi International Airport New Delhi.

This change takes away the complimentary lounge access for accompanying guests. This might be looked at differently by different people. For instance I have not flown out of Delhi with people this year especially those without their lounge credentials. So it does not affect me at all for now.

However others may look at it as a devaluation because they may frequently bring people to the lounge. Also in my various trips to the Delhi lounge I hardly spot people with a +1 or a +2. I do find that to be the case in the Mumbai American Express Lounge though.

With this change American Express is amending its policy to align with the global transition to their lounge access policy which was notified earlier in 2021 valid for 2023 and onwards. Here is the excerpt from the policy.

If you have not visited the American Express Lounge in Delhi here is a video about the lounge experience.

Bottomline

Complimentary guest lounge access for the American Express Platinum and Centurion Cardmembers’ guests will be withdrawn effective December 24 2021. Each guest trip will cost INR 2000 plus taxes (INR 2360) per head nett.

What do you make of the change to the guest lounge access policy at the American Express Lounge in Delhi?

Ish.

In the latest Associations Now Deep Dive my colleagues and I spent a lot of time parsing issues around meetings which are newly resurgent but still dealing with the complications of COVID-19. For leaders there’s a complicated calculus at play as they determine how to balance the safety of attendees with members’ eagerness to meet in person after months of Zoom calls and virtual events.

Successful associations have managed this by thoughtfully surveying their members to get a sense of their comfort levels. Some like the American Traffic Safety Services Association have used those findings to go all-in on an in-person event; others like the Turnaround Management Association have stayed hybrid while actively courting the longtime members who were most eager to return in person.

Either way attendance will likely be diminished for a while longer thanks to anxiety about COVID and restricted travel budgets. But that hasn’t necessarily spelled unsuccessful meetings so far. As Gregg H. Talley FASAE CAE president and CEO of Talley Management Group told me: “Yes the events are smaller but what we’re hearing from our sponsors and exhibitors almost across the board is that the quality is there so we’re ready and willing to do the trade-off on numbers so long as the quality is there.”

No question many in the meetings world are eager to get back to normal: A survey released earlier this month by American Express Meetings & Events found that two-thirds of respondents expected in-person attendance to reach pre-pandemic levels within the next two years. Moreover 81 percent of meetings next year will have an in-person component of some sort.

Of course there are excellent financial reasons to hustle back to a real-deal exposition hall and conference rooms. But this transitional period between now and (knock wood) the end of the pandemic is also an opportunity to slow down and return to some first principles: What audiences are you trying to attract? What are you trying to provide for them that can be best offered in person? What makes them high-quality experiences?

Associations are willing to do a trade-off on numbers so long as the quality is there. Gregg H. Talley FASAE CAE

The answers to those questions Talley suggests will need to be based on an understanding of not just where the pandemic will be but how your members are likely to engage with you. “Boards are saying ‘We’re not willing to sign contracts unless there are really generous outs because we simply don’t know yet how our audience is going to respond and what our industry is going to look like in another two years.’”

This is also a good time to think about your international engagement Talley says. Despite the fact that earlier this month the United States ended its international travel ban and now welcomes vaccinated visitors travel hesitancy can be strong. Given that reality virtual meetings may still be valuable—again if the quality is there.

“If my objective is to reach the rest of the world increase their opportunity to participate and learn and I’m counting on building a longer-term relationship with them as stakeholders that may be an investment I’m willing to make” Talley says.

Regardless he adds there’s no need to rush to return to old modes of thinking—take the time to research and understand your audiences before you reconvene them. “Those who can switch faster and develop new products and services based on that kind of data and drill it right down to that level are ultimately going to be the more successful association” he says. “Those that think we can operate the way we were before are going to fall behind.”

What’s been your association’s approach to reassessing meeting attendees as you return to in-person events? Share your experiences in the comments.

It’s harder to evaluate the impact a coach has on the lives of athletes. But one thing’s for sure: Longtime U.S. Freestyle Ski Team aerials coach Matt Christensen was a gold medalist in each category.

Christensen who coached the U.S. aerials team from 1998 until 2010 passed away October 31 in Hawaii where he lived. In the time since his passing his athletes and fellow coaches have remembered him as a friend who always stayed in touch and as a coach who had a special way of helping his athletes achieve not only their athletic dreams but to find their pathway in life.

His career with the U.S. Ski Team was bookended with a 2002 Olympic silver from Joe Pack and a 2010 Olympic silver from Jeret “Speedy” Peterson. In 2009 he was at the helm when Ryan St. Onge won the World Championship in Japan. He left the U.S. Ski Team in 2010 for an opportunity with Red Bull where he used his knowledge of acrobatics to help global athletes across a wide range of sports.

Canadian Athlete

A Canadian native he grew up in Guelph Ontario and later moved to nearby Toronto making his way to the Canadian Freestyle Team - a ski ballet national champion who turned aerialist. As an international athlete he had 14 top-10 World Cup finishes in aerials and acro (ballet) and was 14th in aerials at the 1993 World Championships.

Traveling the world as a Canadian athlete he was quick to pick up friends building what would become one of the largest Rolodexes in the sport - a network of friends and colleagues that would serve him throughout his life.

What was unique about him as an athlete was his ability to translate his initial career in ballet into aerials. “How he transformed his acrobatic awareness from ballet and kind of showed up on the aerial hill one day was pretty fascinating to me” said world champion freestyle skier Trace Worthington who competed at a similar time. “I'll never forget - there are only a couple of people who've really done that successfully - Matt Christensen and Richard Pierce - who became aerialists from being a good ballet skier.”

As the 1998 Olympics loomed in the foreground he saw that he was not likely to crack the top selection for a trip with Canada to the Nagano Games. So he started to set his sights on new opportunities. And he looked south across the border to America.

Coming to America

That winter Christensen did show jumping to get by. But his focus moved to coaching. He landed a job with aerials guru Nick Preston at the training pool in Lake Placid. At the same time U.S. Freestyle Ski Team Head Coach Wayne HIlterbrand was in the market for another coach for his growing aerials team.

“I knew that I had a pretty big need for an additional coach” said Hilterbrand who oversaw the entire freestyle program as well as coaching aerials. “So I offered him the job as C Team aerials coach essentially our development team. He accepted.”

Just months after Eric Bergoust and Nikki Stone swept aerials gold at the 1998 Nagano Olympics the fledgling new coach was now hooked into the red hot U.S. aerials team. It was also a transitional period with a generation of athletes retiring and a new wave coming on.

Hilterbrand recalls the new thinking that Christensen brought to the team. “He had a lot of ideas that really made sense and I hadn't thought of” he said. “They were ideas that made a pretty big difference.”

One of those ideas was greater integration of trampoline skills as a means of raising skill level. “I had used trampoline for learning tricks and then taking them to snow. Matt was trying to extend their skills on a trampoline more extensively than I was. That was huge. It really helped athletes to be able to perform better. As a young coach he brought stuff to the table that I hadn’t really thought of and it was great.”

Uncompromising Belief in Athletes

Young aerialist Emily Cook met Christensen at her first aerials World Cup in January of 1998 at Mont Tremblant. A month earlier he had competed in his final event at Tignes. “Matt was there and I think he just decided at that event like ‘All right I’m done.’ And the next fall he came on as our C Team coach - my coach.”

Cook saw early on that he was more than a coach. “He was a dynamic human being” she said. “He was good at keeping in touch with people. You would always get a random text or phone call. While some of us just hunker down and move on he wasn’t like that.”

Despite going on different pathways in life Christensen stayed in touch. “I actually saw him three weeks ago at a Red Bull event” said Cook. “He was just the same as he had always been.”

Over the next three seasons Cook would grow into one of the best aerialists in the world. She was ranked sixth in the 2001 World Cup - the top American. She won the Olympic qualifying Gold Cup at Lake Placid and was soaring into the Salt Lake City Olympic Winter Games as a medal favorite.

But the euphoria came crashing down two weeks before the opening ceremony when she shattered her feet in a dramatic training crash in Lake Placid. She wouldn’t compete again for three years.

“Matt was a fiercely loyal coach” said Cook who was devastated by the injury. “He believed in me every step of the way.”

She recalls lying half asleep after the accident on the couch in a condo her father Don had rented in Lake Placid. Matt was there talking to her father. “Matt was saying to my dad ‘Everything is going to be OK. We’re going to take care of her. She’s going to get healthy and come back better than ever.’

“But what struck me was that he had so much going on. He was preparing for a hometown Olympics. But he took the time to spend that day with my dad and myself. It was so hard for us. But he set the stage for everything that afternoon. I knew that he was the type of coach that had every bit of belief in me.”

During Cook’s comeback Christensen was always there for her. “I always knew that he had my back” she said. “Without that I don’t know what those years would have looked like or what my future in the sport would look like.”

Just Loved Working With Athletes

“He just loved working with the athletes” said Worthington who retired in 1997 and was beginning his own career in broadcasting. “You could just tell they just really loved jumping for him. And he made it fun. He did a lot of things outside of just coaching. He was a guy who truly was engaged in athletes’ personal lives and cared about what they were doing.”

After two seasons as C-Team coach Christensen stepped up to the head aerials coach position when Hilterbrand retired in 2000. As he embarked on his new role he took the helm of a team in transition. With the development of summer training pools in both Lake Placid and Park City in the ‘90s aerials was booming in America. And a new wave of future stars like Cook Peterson and Pack was beginning to rise up.

“Matt Christensen was a big piece of who I was and how well I did” said Pack who soared to Olympic silver in front of hometown fans at Deer Valley Resort. “He managed the personalities of the men's aerials team. We didn't do things very traditionally if you will. But we produced results. Matt was so good at making sure the athletes made it fun. And when they needed support he did it for everybody - he didn't pick favorites.”

“He was the head coach of the aerials team when being a member meant being family” said St. Onge. “He kept that family together while we were competing and the decade since.”

Leading into the 2006 Olympic season Christensen organized a Navy SEALS camp with the team’s high performance director Andy Walshe. “That camp really brought us all together” said Cook. “I mean that was the closest team I’ve ever been on. And he was the anchor.”

It was also a period where the sport was growing. Aerials had debuted at the 1994 Lillehammer Games. The U.S. Freestyle Ski Team was one of the hottest global brands in ski sport. And the Deer Valley World Cup was becoming the marquee stop on the international tour.

“The team was getting bigger there was more fundraising the jump sites were getting better and there was more TV” said Pack. Christensen saw that and pushed his teams into the national and worldwide spotlight.

Peterson a sometimes unpredictable athlete from Boise Idaho was becoming the calling card for the team with his seemingly crazy Hurricane - a quintuple-twisting triple flip that carried a high degree of difficulty and a ton of risk. Unlike typical triple flips that featured single twists on two flips plus one double the Hurricane included a single twisting flip coming in and going out but sandwiched a triple twist on a flip in between. It was amazing to watch!

“Matt and Speedy they were like brothers” said Luke Bodensteiner who was head of athletics during Christensen’s tenure. “That was one of the tightest coaching relationships I've ever experienced. He'd been through all of Speedy’s roller coaster rides. But he believed in Speedy so much. They worked one-on-one for so long. They were absolutely best friends.”

“Matt was really good at helping keep Speedy between the lines” said Jeff Wintersteen a former athlete who became head freestyle coach in 2000.

“Speedy and I were both products of Matt's coaching” said St. Onge. “I can't think of two more different and difficult athletes to coach. Speedy was a force of nature a hurricane and Matt expertly predicted where he was headed and cleared the way for him to land. I know Speedy would agree there was no other person in the world that could have coached him better.”

Going into the 2006 Olympics in Torino NBC drew a sharp focus on Peterson. During the final week of the Games all eyes were on the tiny village of Sauze d'Oulx for the men’s aerials finals. After the first round he stood third with the top three each throwing full-double full-full - a pretty traditional opening round jump.

That set the stage for Speedy. He and Christensen talked between jumps and Speedy opted to go big shooting for gold with the Hurricane. The crowd was mesmerized as Peterson started spinning. He nearly stuck the landing but ever so delicately touched a hand to the snow behind him. The judges saw it dropping him down to what would become seventh place.

“We were struggling with speeds during that whole comp” said Wintersteen. Continually falling snow forced athletes to change their start spots. “Speedy was just a little bit slow. And when you're slow he had to pull in for that second flip. If you can stretch down to the landing it's easier to stick it. When he had to pull just a little bit it's hard to keep the momentum from going back and that's why he touched.”

The Night the Sport Will Never Forget

It was a cold night in Deer Valley as thousands of fans screamed in celebration. Up on the knoll Christensen stood on the edge as Peterson launched off the kicker.

With the triple twist in the middle of the Hurricane Speedy had virtually no visibility of the ground at any time. As he launched skyward Christensen began to yell. The coach’s commands were the athlete’s lifeline as Christensen called him through his four seconds to fame.

January 11 2007 was a night freestyle will never forget. 268.70 - a record two-jump aerials score that may never be eclipsed.

“With Speedy it was always like ‘I want to go for it’” recalled Wintersteen. “Matt was really good with Speedy. He knew when to press the gas with him and when he had to tap the brakes.”

After the 2006 Olympics Christensen looked to shore up his staff. He approached longtime athlete Brian ‘Curdog’ Currutt who had retired in 2003. Curdog couldn’t resist.

“Speedy threw a lot of caution to the wind” said Currutt. “He would say ‘I’m just doing it. It doesn’t matter. This is MY jump! And Matt always encouraged that which I think was awesome. That’s one of the things that brought out the best in Speedy. Matt was like ‘all right let’s go for this.’”

For Christensen and Peterson it was a special night. “It was just kind of Speedy” said Wintersteen. “It was a hill we're used to. And more importantly I think Speedy just was a little bit bigger at Deer Valley. He just had a little bit more confidence. He felt a little bit more invincible. When Speedy was feelin’ it well it was hard to say ‘no let’s just back off a bit’” said Wintersteen. There was no backing off that night.

As teammates swarmed Peterson in the finish Christensen put on his own show literally flying off the knoll ski boots postholing as he sprinted down the landing hill relishing every second of that special night as teammates hoisted Speedy to their shoulders.

The Culmination

A decade into his career as head aerials coach Christensen brought a strong team of aerialists into the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.

“Vancouver was kind of the culmination of everything” said Currutt. “We knew things were going to be different after that.”

After the first jump Peterson stood fifth with St. Onge eighth. Canadian home snow favorite Kyle Nissen held a commanding lead. But the stage was set to unleash the Hurricane one more time.

There was little discussion between Christensen and Peterson. It was go big or go home. Speedy hit the jump and soared higher than ever. Christensen ever his co-pilot screamed at the top of his lungs as Speedy twisted and rotated sticking the landing and pumping his fist.

“We do a subjective sport” said Currutt. “But I think Matt in his mind thought that Speedy had won - and we all did. But the silver was just fine too you know? That silver was kind of a culmination of everything that Matt did.”

To Christensen the Olympic medal was more than an athletic accomplishment.

“With the road Speedy was on and everything that those guys had been through over the years as friends and as coach-athlete relationship the demons that Speedy had tried to work to overcome - Matt was there the whole way” said Currutt. “So for Speedy to win that that medal that was everything for Matt.”

The silver medal was the 21st for U.S. Ski & Snowboard at Vancouver sealing its unprecedented run to become best in the world.

A Friend Forever

In the social media posts that have been shared and in conversations with mutual friends from the past since his passing one message has remained vividly clear. Matt stayed in touch.

Wintersteen heard from longtime Chinese coach Li Yang a colleague from his past. “He told me ‘Yah Matt and I just talked.’”

Stone who won Olympic gold in 1998 only crossed paths with Christensen as a coach for a few years. Her social media post summed up what others were saying. “He was an incredibly thoughtful person. Every so often I would find a package in my mailbox filled with these Wunderbars. Matt knew they were my favorite so every so often when he went to Canada (they are only sold there) he’d send me some. Just because...”

Christensen was Kate Reed Currutt’s coach for her entire World Cup career from her debut in 2000 at Deer Valley through her World Cup podiums in Ruka and Mt. Tremblant and to two World Championships. She wrote:

“As I sift through “grief quotes” a common theme is: grief does not exist without love. And with that Matt was loved by so many. So many fun times around the world (literally). ALWAYS a competition around who would get upgraded on the flights who would make 1K first. I can say that a number of times I did beat him in the above however if it were a chicken wing eating contest…I gracefully bowed out of that one. We will miss you Matt. The world is a little less bright and sarcastic.”

St. Onge laughed about all the texts he would receive. “The messages would come at a random hour of the night and often months since any of us have reached out to each other” he said. The messages showcased Christensen’s mastery of sarcasm and humor some of them pushing the envelope just a bit. “I'm sure that everyone had side splitting laughter for about a minute as messages were passed back and forth between Matt and the rest of the Team.”

Farewell

In August 2011 friends and teammates gathered in Boise to remember Speedy. It was a profoundly sad time for the freestyle community. For Christensen it was like losing a brother. Maybe even deeper.

As hundreds gathered Matt clutched a piece of paper on which he had written words about his friend. But the grief was overwhelming. Cook reached out to console him taking the note from his hand offering to convey his words to the crowd.

Christensen wrote about Speedy as more than an athlete. Even more than a friend. They shared a great comfort level. For a decade Matt Christensen had been so much more than a coach in the troubled life of an athlete that featured the highest of highs and lowest of lows. He balanced an aerials team of diverse personalities that shared the common bond of competing in a sport that put them constantly on the edge of life and death.

“We shared countless wonderful times together” Christensen wrote. “It didn’t matter if it was celebrating a podium or a win at the bottom of an air site or if we were sitting on a plane for 14 hours going someplace we dreaded (China comes to mind) or marching at the Opening Ceremony. Speedy and I could find fun in just about anything” he wrote.

A tear welled up in Cook’s eye as she read along ever mindful of her coach’s emotions.

“I can tell all of you Speedy’s competitive history results world records scores where and what events he competed his signature Hurricane where he won etc. There are some things I can’t tell you. I cannot tell you all of the nice things he has done for his teammates coaches friends and incredibly the nice and thoughtful things he did for people he didn’t even know. I can honestly say that there are only a few people who have walked into my life and changed it forever and Speedy Peterson was one of them. I miss him so much.”

Ten years after Speedy’s passing friends and teammates are reading those words from the Speedy Foundation yet another time. Once again they are mourning the loss of a friend. And they remember not so much the statistics the wins the losses the athletic innovation that he brought to the sport in 12 years with the U.S. Freestyle Ski Team or his 11 years with Red Bull.

What they remember is the kindness of Matt Christensen that touched so many.

Nikki Stone summed it up well: “I wish I could tell Matt how special he was. In honor of Matt please do something kind and unexpected for a friend today. I’m sure he’d love to know this kindness was being forwarded on his behalf.”

“Matt had a big job pushing me up the hill every day” said St. Onge in retrospect. “Most of my career I felt like if I wasn't progressing then I was failing. Matt did everything in his power to push hard with me to search for the next improvement. But it was Matt's unending belief in his athletes that helped me to realize that most of the time you're already good enough.”

Remembering Matt Christensen

A private celebration of Matt’s life will be held at the Granite Club in Toronto on November 30. Given limited space interested attendees are asked to RSVP to matthewgraniteclub@gmail.com by November 22. Donations in Matt’s memory may be made to the Ian Walsh Menehune Mayhem Foundation a youth-related cause in Hawaii that was important to Matt through GoFundMe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZWlnbnBvbGljeS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yNy9wZXBzaS1uYXZ5LXNvdmlldC11c3NyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pepsi's Soviet Submarine Fleet Was the Endpoint of Business Dreams,"In 1989 PepsiCo Inc. the maker of Pepsi acquired 17 submarines a cruiser a frigate and a destroyer from the Soviet Union. In recent years an internet legend has grown up around this deal which holds that Pepsi briefly possessed the sixth-largest fleet in the world. In one way that isn’t far off.

In 1989 PepsiCo Inc. the maker of Pepsi acquired 17 submarines a cruiser a frigate and a destroyer from the Soviet Union. In recent years an internet legend has grown up around this deal which holds that Pepsi briefly possessed the sixth-largest fleet in the world. In one way that isn’t far off. According to an analysis of Jane’s Fighting Ships 1989-90 a country operating a squadron of 17 submarines would have tied with India for possessing the seventh-largest fleet of attack submarines.

Yet in any real sense the story is false. What PepsiCo acquired were small old obsolete unseaworthy vessels. The Pepsi navy no more conferred military power than a rusting Model T could have been a Formula 1 contender. What’s more the ships themselves were immediately turned over to a Norwegian shipyard to be scrapped. PepsiCo was more a middleman than a maritime power.

Most interpretations of the story get its meaning wrong too. The Pepsi navy is sometimes portrayed as an embarrassment for the USSR. Far from it. The multinational firm and the country founded by Vladimir Lenin were business partners and in 1989 Pepsi executives were bullish on Soviet prospects. PepsiCo acquired the rusting fleet as part of a multibillion-dollar bet on the long-term stability of the Soviet Union an enormous market that had little to trade immediately besides raw material and the promise of future profits.

The Pepsi navy isn’t a story from the era of Soviet collapse. It’s from the brief moment right before when the Soviet Union looked likely to survive even though the Cold War had ended. The rusting submarines were one way in which Soviet leaders and Western corporations could establish world peace and a new post-communist prosperity led by business.

American leaders hoped that exposure to Western business could transform the Soviet Union into a country just like theirs. Pepsi executives influenced U.S. policymakers to gain a major advantage in its rivalry with Coca-Cola. Soviet officials saw the deal as part of a larger strategy of external trade that could help revitalize their creaking economy. In the end almost nobody got what they wanted.

Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev tries a cup of Pepsi alongside U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon in Moscow in 1959.

The Pepsi navy begins with one man’s driving ambition to sell soda to Soviets. Bluff hearty and ambitious Donald Kendall started as a worker in a Pepsi-Cola bottling plant but he swiftly climbed the corporate ladder becoming head of the company’s international division by 1957 when he was only in his mid-30s.

As a corporate executive engaged in international business Kendall filled a role sometimes slighted by scholars. Theorists can make international relations seem far removed from everyday experience: nuclear strategy treaty negotiations human rights principles.

Yet formal interactions between governments are only a small part of international relations. Most of what happens among countries concerns something far simpler and more direct: business. International business executives and their attendant lawyers accountants and fixers handle the complexities of cross-border trade and investment but such complex deals still chase a simple goal: making money.

There’s no mystique in that ambition which may explain why it’s written about far less often than the deals of politicians and diplomats. Yet it is the Donald Kendalls not the Henry Kissingers who steer much of international relations. The constant pressure business executives exert as they dig for profit can wear away at even the supposedly rock-solid foundations of national policy. If the quest for profit proves compatible with official objectives so much the better; if not then executives will try to manufacture opportunities to pursue their narrow interests.

These pressures manifest in unexpected ways. In the late 1950s as Kendall assumed his executive role U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower tried to use propaganda to counter the early advantages of the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Soviet leaders could point to the country’s sizzling postwar economic growth rates which outpaced U.S. growth so substantially that even leading American economic textbooks assumed that the USSR would soon overtake the United States. Soviet triumphs in space including the launch of the first artificial satellite Sputnik exemplified the communist world as the wave of the future—and American racial apartheid in the South made the United States seem like the champion of an imperialist past.

One part of Eisenhower’s counteroffensive involved organizing the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow. Eisenhower bet that showing the ordinary bounties of American living as showcased by the wares of such leading brands as Kodak General Electric and Pepsi-Cola would convince the Soviet people that peace was desirable—and more important that they would be better off under capitalism.

The most notable part of the exhibition came with the visit of Eisenhower’s vice president the anti-communist zealot Richard Nixon who escorted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on a tour of the pavilion. The two sparred over the relative merits of their systems in front of a media entourage who broadcast their exchanges.

Eisenhower’s vision of holding an exhibition that would shake the foundations of communism was a bust. But three other men got what they wanted from the display. Khrushchev demonstrated to his domestic audience that the Soviet Union could excel in peaceful competition. Nixon received a huge poll boost and media plaudits for defending the American system.

Kendall was the third. In 1999 he recounted that he had told Nixon the night before the visit that some at Pepsi-Cola headquarters viewed participating in the exhibition as a waste of money. The next day Nixon deftly guided the Soviet premier to the Pepsi booth. Pepsi photographers recorded Nixon and Khrushchev drinking the soda together.

Even though Khrushchev’s verdict on the soda was ambivalent (Time magazine recorded his reaction as “skeptical”) the publicity coup accelerated Kendall’s career. In 1963 Kendall became the company’s president and chief executive officer.

Kendall was now positioned to repay Nixon for the favor. Nixon needed it. He was then best known as a loser both in the 1960 race for president to John F. Kennedy and then humiliatingly the 1962 California governor’s race.

Kendall handed Nixon a lifeline: a promise that whatever law firm took the politician on as a partner would also receive Pepsi-Cola’s legal accounts. The prominent New York law firm Mudge Stern Baldwin & Todd leapt at the sweetener. The deal enriched Nixon and gave him excuses to travel around the country and globe as a Pepsi representative. Thanks to Kendall Nixon was rich and laying the groundwork for a political comeback.

Kendall’s role as a political sugar daddy paid off when Nixon won the presidency in 1968. The most visible return on Kendall’s investment came when the businessman used his relationship to broker one of the first deals between the Soviet Union and an American firm in the Cold War period. In the 1920s U.S. companies like Ford Motor Co. had been prominent in the Soviet Union which idolized American management practices but they exited the market before World War II.

In 1972 Kendall and Soviet officials announced a deal that would exchange equivalent values of Pepsi for Soviet vodkas made by Stolichnaya and Sovetskaya. Not only would Pepsi become the first American soft drink available in the USSR but the deal also locked Coca-Cola out of the Soviet market.

Nixon’s friendship paved the way for the deal. In 1971 U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger’s deputy Alexander Haig lobbied Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin to have the Soviets accept a trade delegation Kendall would head. In one of his regular phone calls with Nixon and his aides Kendall asked Kissinger (whom he greeted with “Hello handsome”) to press Kremlin leaders to finalize the deal. The Soviets got the message: This deal mattered to Nixon personally.

In a 1975 meeting in Geneva Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko wondered why the Soviets had Pepsi but not Coca-Cola. Dobrynin diplomatically observed that it was because “their chairman is more energetic.” Kissinger more bluntly said it was because Kendall “was a friend.”

Kissinger was not always so generous. In a 1973 meeting with the AFL-CIO’s foreign-policy adviser Kissinger thanked organized labor for their support of the president’s foreign policy and exclaimed “The businessmen in this country are a disgrace. Look at Kendall of Pepsi-Cola he would sell the country for a contract.”

The Pepsi-for-vodka swap may have been consistent with Nixon’s policy of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States but it was also a triumph for Kendall. The 1972 PepsiCo annual report featured a two-page photo spread of Kendall standing in front of the iconic St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow’s Red Square with a quote that made him sound more like a statesman than an executive: “I have long believed that trade between nations could help to build bridges of greater understanding between different cultures and economic systems.” Kendall was asserting that private enterprise could succeed in ways that the Kissingers of the world could not—that he could have both the profits of a salesman and the mystique of a statesman.

The deal faced obstacles. The cumbersome Stolichnaya-for-soda swap resulted from the difficulties of trading with a communist country outside the normal trading rules of the capitalist world. Because Soviet currency the ruble could not be traded on international markets and the Soviet Union hoarded its reserves of hard international currencies every deal involved complicated time-consuming and risky exchanges of material goods not the simple ease of currency.

Other obstacles were political. Jewish groups in the Soviet Union boycotted Pepsi charging that the deal placed profits before the rights of Soviet citizens of Jewish descent locked inside the country. (Soviet policy required Jewish emigres to pay exorbitant fees.) Activists in Congress linked U.S.-Soviet trade and human rights to block a planned 75 percent reduction of U.S. tariffs on imports including those of Stolichnaya.

Political and economic challenges could also combine especially as detente crumbled later in the 1970s. PepsiCo aggressively marketed Stolichnaya as an authentically Soviet vodka. That left the brand open to boycotts when Cold War tensions ran high as when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan or a Soviet fighter jet shot down a Korean Air Lines passenger aircraft in 1983.

Still Pepsi’s Soviet market grew and by 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev took power in the USSR Pepsi had built 16 bottling plants there.

A Russian boy looks at a model tank and bottles of Pepsi.

What were the Soviets getting out of all this? For Soviet leaders after Joseph Stalin trade with the West offered many advantages something they repeatedly made clear. Khrushchev stressed Soviet openness to trade when he met a delegation of U.S. state governors weeks before the American exhibition opened in Moscow.

Trade in such raw materials as gold and oil offered the Soviet Union the ability to earn hard currency which it could use to purchase advanced equipment (or when the harvest failed food) on world markets. Yet Soviet leaders conscious of their disadvantages relative to the leading technologically sophisticated capitalist countries also found commercial dealings to be a promising way to import more sophisticated technology. In 1966 for example the Italian automaker Fiat signed an accord to build a major automobile factory in a partnership with Soviet industry an investment whose impact in real terms far exceeded that of the Pepsi deal.

In the early 1970s Soviet leaders hoped that the Pepsi agreement would be only the first in a series of more such deals with the United States Western Europe and Japan. Reform-minded technocrats calculated that the occasionally pragmatic Nixon administration offered a window to accelerate Soviet growth. When the U.S. Congress tied human rights to the trade deal it weakened those reformers and detente—which were dealt another blow by the ascent of the hard-line anti-communist U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

Gorbachev’s ascent meant a return to the broad Soviet policy of international relaxation economic cooperation and domestic reform. Yet circumstances had changed. Western businesses were now warier of the political risks associated with trade with the Soviet Union. They had also learned at great cost about the less dramatic but real headaches involved with doing business in the Soviet Union: customs hassles contract violations truculent workers a primitive financial system and creaking logistics.

Despite those hardships American brands including McDonald’s Pizza Hut (also owned by PepsiCo at the time) and even Baskin-Robbins cautiously entered the liberalizing Soviet market. Even Coca-Cola entered the market (in a limited way with its flagship Coke at first only available in hard-currency stores open to tourists) when Pepsi’s exclusive deal expired.

There were some secondary benefits from entering the Soviet market: Pepsi ran television ads in the United States implying that its sodas had caused glasnost. The more important bet was on the long term. Executives like Kendall still thought that such hassles would be worth building a business that could be profitable as the reforming Soviet economy took off. Corporations got the best of all worlds: the ability to out-compete bumbling Soviet firms while using clout to exclude foreign rivals.

1989 turned out to be an axial year. Tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in June. The Berlin Wall fell in November. Less remembered but almost as important to observers at the time was that the Soviet Union held meaningful elections for its new legislative body the Congress of People’s Deputies another step that seemed to confirm the power of Gorbachev and reformers.

That was the environment in which PepsiCo concluded the deal that delivered the Pepsi navy. The ruble was still worthless internationally and Stolichnaya’s growth prospects were more limited than in 1972 so enlarging Pepsi’s sales in the USSR meant turning to new sources of revenue.

These were the circumstances in which PepsiCo struck the deal for the submarines and other vessels. The novelty of the submarine trade grabbed headlines even at the time but PepsiCo never even took possession of the watercraft. As the Associated Press reported in July 1989 PepsiCo was just the middleman for the vessels bound for the scrap heap which went to a Norwegian ship-breaker instead.

Indeed there was little notable about the sale of the submarines except that it involved Pepsi. The Soviet navy had begun selling its obsolete and unseaworthy vessels for scrap in the late 1980s one component of a flood of scrap exported from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Economist reported in 1990 that the Eastern bloc glut had contributed to scrap prices’ slide from 70 British pounds (over $100 at the time) per ton to less than 40 pounds per ton in only a few months. By then a Soviet Whiskey-class submarine could be had for $50000 or a destroyer for $400000. Even at those prices they were hardly worth the cost of ship-breaking not least because Soviet ships could contain loads of asbestos. Hard-liners in the West warned that such deals could simply help fund Soviet naval modernization making the Soviet navy of the 1990s a far more formidable foe.

The sale of the Pepsi vessels for scrap may have been worth a few million dollars which brought the Soviet navy much-needed hard currency. Yet it was a sideshow. The real soda-for-ships deal involved ships that would work. Initially PepsiCo arranged for its vodka countertrade arrangement to include two 28000-ton Soviet oil tankers which PepsiCo bought in a joint arrangement with a Norwegian shipping firm run by a friend of Kendall’s. In April 1989 according to the Financial Times PepsiCo joined a similar bigger deal with a Soviet trade organization and two Norwegian firms valued at nearly $2.6 billion to deliver as many as 85 Soviet-built ships over a decade. (The reported value of the deal varies by source possibly because American firms that were engaged in bartering could understate their true value to avoid tariffs and taxes.)

Pepsi announced the deal would double its sales of soda inside the Soviet Union over a decade and enable it to open Pizza Huts in the country. The Norwegian partners would handle the marketing of the Soviet ships (and bear the risks of selling the vessels). And the Soviet Union would receive not only a market for its ships but also investment by the Norwegian partners to overhaul shipyards where the vessels would be built.

With a reformist government moving forward executives such as Kendall assured themselves that the future looked bright for their investments in the Soviet Union. But one consequence of liberalization was a new wave of public criticism. Anatoly Sobchak the democratic mayor of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) attacked the expanded Pepsi deal as an exercise in “gigantomania” that would destabilize the market. Kendall ruefully observed in early 1991 that it had been easy to do business with the centralized economy before Gorbachev but “Dealing in a democracy in the Soviet Union today is much more difficult.”

Yet the fact that those objections could be voiced seemed only to confirm that reform was real and that progress was possible. On July 30 1991 U.S. President George H.W. Bush announced major steps toward full trade normalization. “My country stands ready to assist in this new Soviet revolution” Bush said. But Bush cautioned “Western governments—with their own strapped resources—are limited in what they can do. So we must bring together the businessmen from Europe and America and their partners from all across the Soviet Union.” Finally Kendall’s vision would be realized: Western capitalism would end the Cold War and get rich in the process.

Less than three weeks later hard-line forces launched a coup against Gorbachev. Within months leaders of key Soviet republics dissolved the union. On Dec. 25 1991 Gorbachev resigned as president of the USSR which vanished with the stroke of his pen.

To be sure Pepsi’s interests in Russia didn’t disappear. In 2020 PepsiCo reported revenue of $3 billion in Russia its third-largest market behind Mexico and the United States. In 2004 Kendall received the Order of Friendship for his contributions to Russian commerce from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yet there was no longer any mystique. Russia was now just one developing and newly competitive market among many.

The Pepsi navy has been remade as part of a narrative in which Soviet collapse was inevitable a can-you-believe-this story about an American victory lap over a terminally ill enemy. It fits the era of economic chaos that followed when the Russian economy crumbled oligarchs plundered industries and resources and military stockpiles—with functioning weapons not rusted submarines—really were traded on the black market.

But the thesis that foreign economic trade and investment could transform a moribund communist economy was tried in the People’s Republic of China at about the same time. Chinese technocrats wagered that international firms would bring new techniques and experience. And just as the Soviets gave Pepsi a monopoly in exchange for these benefits China granted Coca-Cola exclusive rights to its market in 1978.

Perhaps the Soviet Union could not have managed what China accomplished. Yet the idea that only one communist juggernaut could succeed was far from obvious at the time. Had events unfolded the way Kendall hoped and Gorbachev planned the 1990s might have been a decade of democratization and economic growth for a strengthening Soviet Union. And the story of how Pepsi scrapped 17 Soviet submarines to cement its hold on the Soviet market would have been just one among thousands about how American investments helped a former foe become an economic competitor."

This is Wirth’s twelfth week in his current cooperative education experience with Messer Construction though he also worked with the builder last spring and kept in touch with his supervisor during his summer courses. UC consistently ranks highly among university co-op programs. Officials said the program has only grown during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wirth says he’s walked the building top to ground floor at least 50 times by now doing safety walks three times or more each week. He likes being in the know about construction at the university. Sometimes his friends wonder aloud: “Man what are they doing on Calhoun?” And Wirth can tell them – down to the number of beds the dorm will fit and which will be the first and last rooms ready for occupancy.

Starting at the top Wirth circles each floor with his manager and UC's industrial hygienist and construction safety specialist John Burke for a safety check. They are looking to ensure general safety protocols are being met: scouting out fall hazards ensuring power cords are tucked away and that platform and wheels on carts are locked. If any issues arise Wirth notes them on his iPad and sends a photo to the proper foreman.

The words “safety is my responsibility” are displayed on his green hard hat for Messer which ranked as the Cincinnati region's fifth-largest privately held company on the most recent Deloitte Cincinnati 100 list.

Wirth one of the youngest people on the construction site says the hard hat gives him the confidence to let other workers know if they need to make a safety adjustment. Some of those employees are twice his age which can be awkward he says.

One of Wirth’s goals when he started his fall co-op was to work on his communication skills. He says he’s gotten daily opportunities to do this by running morning meetings with the foremen and he can already tell he’s getting better.

“Now I’m on a first-name basis with all of them” Wirth says.

'It's not job shadowing'

The University of Cincinnati’s co-op program rose to No. 4 in U.S. News & World Report’s latest rankings released in mid-September this year. The local program has historically placed in the top 5 co-op programs in the country.

Its reputation is enough to attract students from all over the world. Anshumi Dhingra a graduate student in UC's prestigious College of Design Architecture Art and Planning completed her undergraduate degree at India's CEPT University. She told The Enquirer she was particular about the type of curriculum she wanted in a graduate program.

“At UC the standout point was that it had co-op while you also study” Dhingra said. Every other program she applied to had one internship experience towards the end of the degree while UC's graduate program requires two co-ops. “So you get sort of a gist of professional experience along with academics.”

The university actually founded the concept of cooperative education 115 years ago said Gigi Escoe vice provost for UC’s undergraduate studies and dean of the division of experience-based learning and career education. The first programs were for engineering students but now students of any major can apply for positions within the university's more than 2200 global partners.

Each co-op is specific to a student's individual needs she said. And unlike an internship the co-op is embedded into the student's academic curriculum. Escoe said UC is constantly looking to better its program first to meet growing and changing student needs and then to meet the increasing demands of industry in the wake of pandemic-spurred workforce shortages.

“This is not following somebody around getting coffee” Escoe said. ""It's not job shadowing.""

Undergraduate students in engineering information technology and DAAP are required to complete at least three co-op experiences before graduation Escoe said.

“So that when they graduate they have almost two years of work experience"" Escoe explained. ""And they are usually hired into positions that are not entry-level but they take into account the fact that they have two years of work experience both in salary and title.”

Business students are also required to participate in a professional learning experience and all other majors have an ""experiential learning"" requirement that can be fulfilled by a service-learning program undergraduate research study abroad student teaching clinical internships or a co-op.

Escoe said university students participate in over 8000 co-op opportunities each year. Before the pandemic students collectively earned upwards of $70 million annually. Last year due to COVID-19 officials said students in co-op made a collective $58 million roughly though the number of students in the program did not decrease. And the number of partners actually increased Escoe said as more companies have been desperate for workers.

“Work is forever changed” Escoe said as a result of the pandemic. “And so young people that are coming out right now are going to have 50- 60-year careers that are starting in this new world right? And they’re going to emerge from that. So it’s not only digital. It’s how do you make friends? How do you do teamwork? How does ideation take place? So I have to prepare them for that workforce not the one that existed in 2017. Because that one’s gone forever.”

'Best decision I have ever made'

Dhingra completed a co-op at City Studios Architecture in Over-the-Rhine last year and is now in the process of applying for her next co-op experience. As an international student she says learning about American workplace culture is just as important to her as the design work.

For Sydney O'Connor a 2021 UC graduate the co-op program eased her fear of graduating without knowing if she actually liked the career she was preparing for. It wasn't until her third co-op at Tesla that she said she found a work culture and job description she could see herself in the long-term.

“Looking back on it it was without a doubt the best decision I have ever made"" O'Connor said about deciding to attend UC. ""Not only was it helpful in deciding what I wanted to do it was nice just to get a break from classes. It was nice to make some money. It makes UC incredibly affordable.”

Now O'Connor works as a firmware quality engineer at Apple where she completed her final co-op through UC before graduating. She's heard gripes from coworkers about the student debt they incurred through expensive private schools on the West Coast. O'Connor is grateful for co-ops that allowed her to make money as opposed to spending it on tuition for those semesters.

Wirth now in his third year at the university says he prefers co-op to coursework.

""I feel like firsthand work experience is most important when you're going into a career no matter what it is"" he said. ""You don't get the hands-on experience in classes.""

Towards the end of his safety walk Wirth takes a photo of a gaping hole on Calhoun Street where a guard is needed. His team puts up a red chain near the entrance to the site so no ""zombies"" – students walking with their eyes on their phones – accidentally walk in without the proper safety gear.

Burke gives him a fist bump for Wirth's good work today. Wirth smiles and walks back to his small office across the street. Soon he'll head home to his apartment less than half a mile away and get ready for track practice. He says he's grateful for Messer's flexibility with his athletic schedule and weekend competitions.

""It's kind of the perfect situation for me right now"" he says. ""Because they know that we're students and we still you know have that college life.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvZWFydGhxdWFrZS1wZXJ1LWJhcnJhbmNhLXRvZGF5LXNvdXRoLWFtZXJpY2EtYjE5NjU1MTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peru earthquake: Large 7.5 magnitude tremors hit South American country seismologists confirm,"The latest headlines from our reporters across the US sent straight to your inbox each weekday Your briefing on the latest headlines from across the US Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

A “major” earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 has struck northern Peru with some damage to homes and several minor injuries reported.

The tremor occurred in a sparsely populated region of the Amazon rainforest some 45 kilometres northwest of the city of Barranca the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said.

While it was extremely strong at a depth around 110km it was also relatively deep underground – which typically limits damages and casualties but results in tremors being felt in a larger area.

Authorities in neighbouring Ecuador said the quake was felt in 19 of its 24 provinces – and the EMSC received multiple accounts from people who felt minor quakes in Colombia more than 1000km from the epicentre.

The US Tsunami Warning System said there was no tsunami expected.

Only three minor injuries were immediately reported in Chachapoyas province where a local mayor said several houses were damaged and a church tower forming part of a 16th-century complex – considered to be the oldest Catholic temple in the Amazonas region – was reduced to rubble.

The earthquake also “caused damage to an as yet undetermined number of homes” in the Amazon districts of Valera San Jeronimo and Leimebamba Peru’s National Civil Defense Institute (Indeci) said.

There was some damage to homes in Ecuador but no injuries authorities said.

No damage was reported to the 1100km oil pipeline of state-owned Petroperu which crosses the Peruvian Amazon region to the Pacific coast in the north.

The earthquake took place within the Nazca plate at the Peru-Chile trench where large earthquakes at this depth “are reasonably common” the US Geological Survey said.

Over the past century there have been five other intermediate-depth earthquakes within 250km of the epicentre of Sunday’s tremor with a magnitude of 7 or greater according to the US government agency.

The most recent of these was a magnitude 8 earthquake which struck on 26 May 2019 and according to the government killed two people and injured 15 others while damaging hundreds of homes leaving many families homeless.

Roads schools and temples were also damaged in the 2019 quake and two road bridges collapsed Peru’s National Emergency Operations Centre said.

The man who has not been publicly identified “attempted to evade detection” by stowing away in the plane’s landing gear officials said.

The 26-year-old man appeared unharmed after the flight.

The flight American Airlines 1182 landed in Miami around 10 a.m. Saturday. Video posted on social media shows two employees one on the phone while the man sits on the concrete between them.

“He’s all right he’s all right” someone shouts off-camera.

A spokesperson for American Airlines told the Daily News Sunday that the plane was met by law enforcement at Miami International Airport “due to a security issue.”

The spokesman said the airline is cooperating with the investigation.

The flight landed at Miami International Airport Saturday morning.

“Persons are taking extreme risks when they try to conceal themselves in confined spaces such as an aircraft” CBP said in a statement. “This incident remains under investigation.”

The man was taken to the hospital for a medical assessment.

A spokesperson for CBP did not comment Sunday on whether the man will face charges or other consequences.

Temperatures in parts of the plane without climate control like the landing gear compartment can drop to minus-65 degrees according to the Federal Aviation Administration. But the presence of hydraulic lines can help warm the areas to survivable temperatures.

“Many of these communities have been struggling to deal with COVID-19 and job loss and all the recent civil rights actions and discrimination issues while also not having access to safe drinking water at home” Washington an environmental justice organizer with One PA a nonprofit community advocacy group told EHN.

Much of Washington’s work relates to clean water access in low-income western Pennsylvania communities. The problems she sees primarily fall into two categories: Drinking water that’s contaminated with lead and other toxic chemicals and the threat of shut-offs due to nonpayment of water bills.

Both of those issues she said create mental health impacts like stress and anxiety.

It’s not hard to imagine how fearing that your water is unsafe to drink or will be shut off could contribute to stress anxiety or depression. But emerging scientific research also suggests that a common drinking water pollutant—lead—impacts mental health.

Kids are exposed to lead through lead paint contaminated soil and contaminated drinking water which remains a primary source of lead exposure. No level of lead exposure is safe for children and blood lead levels lower than those that officially qualify as “poisoning” are still harmful to developing brains.

“We’ve known for a long time that early life lead exposure causes problems related to learning performance and cognitive deficits in children but now that many lead-exposed [groups of children] have been followed into adulthood we’re also seeing that later in life they’re more likely to have major depression schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders” Tomás R. Guilarte professor researcher and director of the Brain Behavior & the Environment program at the Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work at Florida International University told EHN.

“There’s no question that even at low levels of exposure there are associations with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders” he added.

These findings have major implications in the U.S. and abroad. While bans on lead in paint and gasoline have had a positive impact roughly one in three children around the world are still exposed to harmful levels of lead. “This is not a trivial problem” Guilarte said.

In a survey of more than one million kids in the U.S. researchers earlier this year reported that more than half of children have detectable levels of lead in their blood. The exposure was worse for children of color: About 58% of kids from majority Black zip codes and 56% of kids from majority Hispanic zip codes had detectable levels of lead compared to 49% of kids from majority white zip codes.

In addition about 186 million people in the U.S.—about 56% of the population—drank water from drinking water systems with lead levels above 1 part per billion (the level set by the American Academy of Pediatrics to protect children from lead in school water fountains) from 2018 to 2020 according to a report from the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Western Pennsylvania is particularly at risk:

The percentage of Pennsylvania children with elevated blood lead levels is more than twice as high as the national rate;

Blood lead levels in Allegheny County are declining overall but not equitably: The percentage of children of color with confirmed elevated blood levels is six times greater than the percentage of white children with elevated blood lead levels;

In 2019 lead was detected in 80% of water systems in Allegheny County;

Among school districts in 10 Western Pennsylvania counties that tested drinking water for lead in 2019 71% reported lead contamination but less than half took action to remove it.

In October the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lowered the threshold for blood lead levels considered “higher than average” from 5 micrograms per deciliter to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter.

This shift will mean that many more children in Allegheny County and across the country will be considered to have blood lead levels requiring intervention. Currently when a child is found to have a blood lead level higher than the CDC’s previous threshold of 5 micrograms per deciliter in Allegheny County the Allegheny County Health Department offers a free home investigation to test water dust and soil samples for lead.

Chris Togneri the health department’s public health information officer told EHN the agency is still reviewing the CDC’s revised threshold to consider updating that policy.

In addition to its lead exposure and drinking water issues western Pennsylvania also bears a substantial burden of mental illness.

From 2018-2020 40% of adults in Allegheny County reported having one or more days where their mental health was “not good” according to state data a figure that’s higher in Allegheny County than in half of other Pennsylvania counties and slightly higher than state averages. An estimated 13% of adults in Allegheny County said their mental health was not good for 14 or more days a month.

A survey conducted by the Allegheny County Health Department from 2015-2016 indicates the issue is even more serious among non-white residents: 48% of Black and 47% of Hispanic residents said their mental health was “not good” for one or more days a month compared to 42% of white residents.

Togneri said the Allegheny County Health Department works to address disparities in lead exposure through an index which ranks census tracts where children are more vulnerable to lead exposures based on factors like race poverty level and the age of housing.

“We do increased outreach in the areas that are identified as being at higher risk levels” he said. “As is the case in all departments more resources would allow for greater outreach.”

In Pittsburgh the number of pediatric patients seeking mental health treatment has increased by 30% since the spring of 2020. Meanwhile Pennsylvania is experiencing a statewide shortage of mental health care workers and in Pittsburgh therapists are quitting their jobs in droves because of burnout.

This is your brain on lead

Guilarte has been studying lead exposure since the 1980s when lead poisoning among children was rampant.

He was the lead author on a 2021 literature review that looked at dozens of human and animal studies and found increasing evidence that childhood lead exposure is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders like anxiety depression and obsessive compulsive disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD autism and Tourette syndrome.

The largest of these studies looked at more than 1.5 million people in the U.S. and Europe and found that people who had higher lead exposure as children were more likely to have negative personality traits like lower conscientiousness lower agreeableness and higher neuroticism in adulthood (all of which contribute to mental illness).

“Lead exposure impacts a protein receptor in the brain known as the NMDA receptor which is critically important for brain development learning and cognitive function” Guilarte said adding that improper functioning of the NMDA receptor is also seen in the brains of people with certain mental illnesses (like schizophrenia). The NMDA receptor influences the development of inhibitory neurons that help keep the brain balanced. When it’s damaged by lead exposure it creates too few of those neurons.

“In a healthy brain you have excitatory and inhibitory neurons operating in exquisite balance” Guilarte explained “but if that’s interrupted and you have too many of one or the other the brain goes haywire.”

For decades scientists only considered the impacts these changes had on children’s brains while they were still children but emerging research suggests some symptoms of the damage done by lead don’t emerge until adulthood or even middle age.

The poisoning of a generation

Aaron Reuben a researcher at Duke University led the longest study ever conducted on early life lead exposures and mental health outcomes in adulthood. It followed 579 people in New Zealand from the time they were 3 years old until they were 38 years old and found that people who were exposed to higher levels of lead as children were more likely to experience symptoms of mental illness as adults including antisocial behavior eating disorders depression anxiety post-traumatic stress substance abuse delusions and hallucinations.

“Because we’ve been following these kids for so long we can also look at where they are as adults compared to where their parents were when the study started” Reuben told EHN. “We’ve found that kids with low levels of lead exposure tend to do a little better than their parents on the whole in terms of socioeconomic standing but for kids at the higher end of lead exposure they appear to have slipped down the ladder compared to their parents and have lower social mobility.”

The mean blood lead level for children in the study was 11 micrograms per deciliter. That level is higher than most kids experience today but it still happens—in Allegheny County at least 582 tests showed blood lead levels higher than 10 micrograms per deciliter in children younger than six between 2016 and 2020 and across the U.S. as many as 243749 children currently have blood lead levels higher than 10 micrograms per deciliter.

More significantly that level of lead exposure is representative of the exposures experienced by an entire generation.

“The levels of exposure we looked at are typical for kids born in the 70s in most places in the world when lead was still being widely added to paint and gasoline” Reuben said. “I’ve estimated that there are about a hundred million people in their forties and early fifties living in America who had high lead exposures as kids.”

Western Pennsylvania has a large population of residents in that age bracket.

In Allegheny Butler Washington and Westmoreland Counties—the four most populated counties in Western Pennsylvania—there are around 371656 people between the ages of 40 and 54 who likely experienced high levels of lead exposure as children.

In 2016 18 Pennsylvania cities including Pittsburgh Altoona Johnstown and Erie had higher levels of lead exposure among children than those seen in Flint Michigan at the height of its lead crisis.

Njaimeh Njie / The Allegheny Front A woman walks up Grant Avenue at the intersection of Fifth Street in Duquesne PA.

Additionally recent reporting on Pittsburgh’s lead crisis revealed that lead levels in the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority’s [PWSA’s] water rose steadily from 1999 to 2016 and that because of inconsistent testing the region’s water could have had dangerously high levels of lead contamination for years before it was caught during the city’s “lead crisis.” The county didn’t mandate universal blood lead screening for kids until 2018 so it’s difficult to assess just how widespread lead exposure was during that time period.

Even today despite the county’s universal lead screening program about 35% of kids in the region aren’t getting tested for lead exposure. In many parts of the country the percentage of kids getting screened for lead declined sharply last year likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We don’t have a good understanding of where those children are or why that’s happening” Michelle Naccrati-Chapkis executive director of the health advocacy nonprofit Women for a Healthy Environment told EHN.

The legal federal limit for lead in public water systems is 15 parts per billion (ppb) and PWSA’s lead levels were higher than that from at least 2013-2016. Across the country about seven million people were served by drinking water systems that exceeded the 15 ppb threshold from 2018 to 2020 according to the NRDC report.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a non-enforceable health goal for lead in public drinking water of zero. In 2019 the agency proposed revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule that would lower the action level from 15 ppb to 10 ppb and create stricter requirements for replacing lead service lines but those revisions haven’t yet been passed.

Overlapping impacts

Across the country the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a huge toll on mental health. In October the American Academy of Pediatrics the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the national Children’s Hospital Association declared a national emergency in children’s mental health.

“We need more mental health resources and capacity especially for those in extreme mental health crises” Marita Garrett the mayor of Wilkinsburg a small borough about eight miles from downtown Pittsburgh told EHN.

Wilkinsburg is one of many communities surrounding Pittsburgh that’s had ongoing problems with childhood lead exposure.

In October the city of Pittsburgh announced a new lead ordinance that will require testing for lead paint and dust in rental housing built before 1978 (when lead paint was banned) implementing lead safety plans for repairs and demolitions of buildings that could contain lead paint and installing drinking water filters at city-owned water facilities.

But Allegheny County is home to 130 self-governing municipalities—more than any other county in the state—and the Pittsburgh ordinance won’t apply to them. Many including Wilkinsburg have government agencies that are under-funded and under-staffed. Garrett said old lead water lines in Wilkinsburg need to be replaced but it’s expensive.

Naccrati-Chapkis said Lead Safe Allegheny a local coalition of government agencies and nonprofits hopes to help other municipalities in the county use the Pittsburgh lead ordinance as a model to pass their own.

Meanwhile communities with childhood lead exposures are also likely to experience other issues that can disproportionately impact people’s mental health including poverty racism violence and other harmful environmental exposures including air pollution.

Wilkinsburg for example is a majority non-white community that experiences high levels of air pollution from U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thomson Mill and has a poverty rate of more than 24%.

In these types of communities Guilarte said “It’s almost like the perfect storm for these children to have developmental problems.” He noted that lead poisoning is linked to higher rates of crime and violence and that mental illness likely plays a role.

Communities with high levels of poverty are more likely to have lead in their water but research has also shown that regardless of income level Black children in the U.S. are two to three times as likely as white and Hispanic children to experience lead poisoning—a lingering effect of racist practices like redlining and a clear result of environmental injustice.

“This is a pure consequence of our history of systemic racism and a racialized caste system in America that has still not been adequately addressed today” Reuben said.

Some of the most high-profile national cases of widespread lead contamination in drinking water have been in majority Black communities including Flint Michigan; Newark New Jersey; East Chicago Indiana; and Benton Harbor Michigan which is unfolding right now.

Examples of “toxic zip codes”—regions where a combination of environmental injustice poverty and violence create substantial negative health impacts—abound in western Pennsylvania.

For example the Monongahela Valley (commonly referred to as the “Mon Valley”) a former steel corridor of municipalities from the southern tip of Pittsburgh to the West Virginia border is home to a large number of environmental justice communities (census tracts with a poverty rate of at least 20% and/or a non-white population of at least 30%) and also faces disproportionate risk of lead exposure.

Duquesne is a Mon Valley town about 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh that’s about 70% non-white (compared to Allegheny County as a whole which is 80% white). In June during one of 10 virtual discussions about the Lead and Copper Rule between representatives from the EPA and cities across the country Duquesne Mayor Nickole Nesby told the agency that on average children tested in Duquesne for blood lead levels have an average of 7 micrograms per deciliter.

“Those children are going to need medical services” Nesby told EHN pointing to the city’shigh poverty rate and noting that 33% of the city’s school children have learning disabilities. At the state level about 17% of children have learning disabilities. “We don’t even have a medical facility in Duquesne. We need medical care and we need medical research.”

In addition to lead problems Duquesne’s drinking water contains levels of unregulated contaminants linked to cancer at rates up to 400 times higher than recommended health limits.

Duquesne buys its water from the Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County but Nesby said contaminants enter the water once it flows through Duquesne’s aging infrastructure which would cost millions of dollars to repair that the city doesn’t have. Nesby is hoping to use some COVID-relief funds toward that end. She recently traveled to Washington D.C. to talk about her city’s infrastructure needs before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

“Our water department is just run amok” she said. “We need help.”

A 2018 report by the Allegheny County Health Department identified the census tracts in the county with the highest levels of lead exposure risk based on factors like what percentage of homes were built before 1950 (when lead paint and lead water pipes were more common) and what percentage of the population is under 5 years old. Many of those census tracts fall within the Mon Valley.

These overlapping impacts can also have physical effects that impact mental health.

“There’s evidence that one harmful exposure changes the brain in a way that can magnify the effects of another harmful exposure later on” said Reuben who has also studied the impacts of air pollution on mental illness. “So it’s not an additive effect—one plus one equals two—but a synergistic effect where if you’re getting one hit from lead exposure and one from air pollution they combine to create three or four hits.”

The new reinsurance unit will be led by Mohammad Al Marhoon managing director of Aon’s Reinsurance Solutions Saudi.



The Saudi insurance market is undergoing structural change through more focused regulations and operational reforms aligning to the guidance of Saudi Vision 2030 – “a unique transformative economic and social reform blueprint that is opening Saudi Arabia up to the world.”



Privatization driven by Vision 2030 is intended to provide greater opportunities for the global insurance sector in terms of risk analysis and mitigation as well as through Saudi firms’ and citizens’ increased utilization of a wider range of financial tools.



According to a SAMA report Saudi insurance premiums grew by 2.3 percent in 2020 with total written premiums reaching SR38.78 billion. With its new local reinsurance unit Aon aims to deliver reinsurance expertise innovative solutions and best-in-class service to regional clients.



Amr Sartawi chief executive officer Aon’s Reinsurance Solutions Middle East North Africa and Turkey said: “In a growing insurance market that currently generates approximately $10.3 billion in premiums we have the local presence global access and extensive capabilities to position us to provide the world-class service that clients would expect from their broker of choice helping them to build a resilient workforce and reduce the volatility of their businesses.”



Al Marhoon managing director of Aon’s Reinsurance Solutions Saudi added: “With new opportunities arising in this key sector our timely entrance into the Saudi reinsurance market will provide new impetus along with an inclusive insight. The establishment of our local reinsurance unit progresses Reinsurance Solutions’ global strategy in the region and aligns to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030. It will also offer us the opportunity to train Saudi talent who will specialize in reinsurance.”



In an unpredictable and volatile world known threats such as climate change and pandemics sit alongside emerging challenges such as data security supply chain disruption the rise of intangible assets and the widening health-wealth gap. These new forms of volatility expose organizations to risks that impact their colleagues customers reputation and ultimately their profitability.



Businesses governments and communities therefore need to become more resilient. To achieve this organizations must tackle volatility from current challenges while enhancing strategies for future growth achieved through the focused management of risk exposure.



Aon’s extensive experience global reach and investment in analytics mean that whether emerging or traditional risks the firm is well placed to deliver the insights and advice that aim to help clients protect and grow their businesses and make better business decisions. — SG

Bowls

With the green having slowed considerably following the recent heavy rains as well as the usual mental fortitude required physical stamina would be essential for all in order to triumph.

Fortunately the rain showers that were prevelant in the early stages dissipated and as the green dried out bowling became more suited to the high level of skill predominantly on show.

With 18 entries from seven nations the early stages consisted of a series of 6 x 3 bowl “scrambles” with the group winners plus two lucky losers advancing to the quarter finals.

Four previous “major” winners were early casualties and out of the eight remaining hopefuls six were in with a chance of appearing on the honour’s board for the first time. In a rather unfortunate twist of fate Noon and Mimi two of the four Thai lady bowlers who progressed were drawn against each other.

The quarter finals all produced comprehensive winners. Advancing to the semi-finals were Ron Blackwood Paul “Nobby” Styles Duncan Kennedy and Suwanna “Mimi” Promsit who was making a welcome return after a long period of absence through maternal duties.

Both Ron and Mimi outclassed their semi-final opponents by massive 15-3 scorelines and based on the quality of bowls they produced the stage was set for an enthralling final. Once again it was two previous winners making the final leaving several regular midweek bowlers still searching for that elusive “major” win.

In the early stages of the final Ron surged into 6-2 lead. Holding the jack he then delivered a series of super leading bowls forcing Mimi to play a determined counter-attacking game.

With Ron craftily defending his lead bowl time after time Mimi was left in an almost impossible position and soon found herself chasing an unassailable 11-2 lead after eight out of the possible 10 ends had been played.

Ron therefore managed to retain the club championship he had won last year with relative ease even if the scoreline did not necessarily reflect how close the contest actually was. It was Ron’s crucial early lead and ability to protect it that was the ultimate deciding factor.

In the “plate” final for first-round losers relative newcomer Sunee “Aon” Sriraksa (another potential Thai female bowls star) defeated seasoned campaigner Derek “Dr Rock” Chalmers 7-6 coming from behind and scoring the winning two points on the final end.

When I saw that the good people at Apple dropped a polishing cloth for $19 this was the first meme that came to mind:

There is definitely logic behind the madness:

The internet ripped Apple for its $19 polishing cloth. But it's sold out with a months-long backlog.



Based on Apple's pricing psychology the $19 price tag *actually* makes sense.

But still it’s hilarious.

Imagine being the person that has to earnestly write this ad copy:

The most-liked Twitter chirp was from some random account called @ElonMusk:

Here are some other good ones:

Microsoft has just overtaken Apple to become the largest company in the world by market cap.

Extra points to iFixit for its fake Apple polishing cloth review:

Under a microscope the premium quality of Apple’s polishing cloth comes to life. On the left you’ll see a plain old cleaning cloth. Boring. On the right? Miniscule fibers intricately woven together uniting to become not just a tool for cleaning but an object of beauty worthy of being cleaned itself. Amidst the beauty a thin line delicately traces the form of mankind’s foundational fruit: an apple.

Last thing: this pic LOL.

**UPDATE (11/30/2021 @ 7pm PT)

Elon just released a Tesla “Cyber Whistle” priced at $50. Naturally he takes a jab at Apple’s $19 cloth.

Gallagher (AJG) Ahead of Earnings?,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. AJG may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Arthur J. Gallagher is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AJG in this report.

In fact the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.40 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AJG giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.14% heading into earnings season.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Price and EPS Surprise

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. price-eps-surprise | Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Quote

Why is this Important?

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that AJG has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Arthur J. Gallagher and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

« La Guadeloupe pourrait mieux se gérer elle-même »

Dans une allocution télévisée vendredi soir le ministre des Outre-mer Sébastien Lecornu a expliqué que « la question de l’autonomie » avait été posée « en creux » par les élus locaux eux-mêmes lors des discussions avec le gouvernement pour tenter de trouver une porte de sortie à la mobilisation aux revendications multiples et émaillée de violences.

""D’après eux la Guadeloupe pourrait mieux se gérer elle-même"" et ""ils souhaitent moins d’égalité avec l’Hexagone plus de liberté de décision par les élus locaux"" a rapporté le ministre assurant que ""le gouvernement est prêt à en parler (...) du moment que ces débats servent à résoudre les vrais problèmes"" des Guadeloupéens.

La rédaction vous conseille Dix policiers blessés en Martinique journalistes visés par des tirs La situation se tend de plus en plus en Martinique avec à l’origine un mouvement anitvax qui a dégénéré en grave crise sociale. Forces de l’ordre et journalistes ont été visés par des tirs la nuit dernière.

Ses propos ont provoqué une volée immédiate de critiques à droite les candidats à l’investiture LR pour la présidentielle fustigeant un « désengagement de l’État » et un recul face aux manifestants voire une tentative « d’acheter les indépendantistes radicaux » selon Marine Le Pen (RN).

À gauche Jean-Luc Mélenchon (LFI) a jugé « stupéfiante » la « réponse de Macron » via son ministre et a appelé à traiter « d’abord (l') urgence sociale et sanitaire ». « Nous parlerons statut le moment venu » a-t-il ajouté.

« L’autonomie ce n’est pas moi qui l’ai demandée. Ce sont beaucoup d’acteurs –avec parfois un jeu de discours curieux il faut le reconnaître– qui nous disent ‘laisser les Guadeloupéens décider pour la Guadeloupe et c’est à nous de décider si la loi doit s’appliquer ou pas’. Ça c’est pas un département français » a tempéré le ministre dimanche sur Franceinfo.

Cela « crée de la confusion » et « ne règle pas les problèmes » sociaux a ainsi estimé Yves Jégo (Agir) ex-secrétaire d’État à l’Outre-mer sur LCI samedi exhortant plutôt à « un new deal économique » aux Antilles.

Gouvernement et majorité réfutent toute velléité d'« abandon » de l’archipel.

Lecornu : l’autonomie ce n’est pas moi qui l’ai demandée.

Les propos de Sébastien Lecornu posent la question du degré d’autonomie. Il a bien pris soin de ne citer que la Guadeloupe à la fois département et région d’Outre-mer deux institutions qui se superposent ce qui peut complexifier les relations avec Paris et non la Martinique collectivité territoriale unique depuis le 1er janvier 2016.

Selon un communiqué de la délégation ce programme vise à activer le rôle des cellules d’écoute et d’accompagnement et à améliorer leur travail en matière de lutte contre la violence en milieu scolaire tout en assurant la prise en charge psychologique et sociale des élèves en situation difficile.



Le programme élaboré par les cadres d’appui social relevant de la direction provinciale de l’Éducation les travailleuses sociales de la délégation de l’Entraide nationale et les associations pédagogiques œuvrant dans le domaine de l’éducation et de l’enseignement a également pour but d’échanger les expériences entre intervenants et de faire de l’établissement scolaire un espace protecteur et inclusif pour tous les élèves.



Les cadres veillant sur la réalisation du programme œuvreront à accompagner en particulier les élèves en situation difficile ainsi que les élèves qui ont des problèmes qui les empêchent de s’intégrer dans l’espace scolaire en leur prodiguant des conseils afin d’élargir leurs connaissances en matière de santé.



Le délégué provincial du MEN de Sidi Kacem M. Mohamed Ait Ouadif a déclaré à cette occasion que les cadres accompagneront également les élèves dans la lutte contre les phénomènes et comportements négatifs en les motivant à poursuivre leurs études de manière à lutter contre la déperdition scolaire sur la base de données scientifique tout en élaborant des recommandations aux parties concernées pour résoudre les problèmes dont souffrent ces élèves.

Le chef de l’Etat qui présidait vendredi la cérémonie de clôture de la 3ème Conférence sociale sur la protection sociale à Diamniadio a cependant évoqué la hausse concomitante des cotisations des travailleurs actifs entre autres probabilités pour la matérialisation de la hausse tant attendue par les retraités.

Par Alioune Badara NDIAYE – L’augmentation de 10% de la pension de retraite tant attendue par les retraités est assujettie à un préalable. Le Président Macky Sall a en effet fait savoir vendredi que la faisabilité de ce rajout qui va coûter à l’Etat 8 milliards francs devra s’accompagner d’un effort supplémentaire des travailleurs actifs. «Il faut sérieusement envisager l’augmentation des cotisations des travailleurs. On ne peut pas vouloir un revenu décent quand on ne cotise pas de façon décente. Pour les retraités c’est trop tard ; donc c’est à nous travailleurs de cotiser plus déjà pour les retraités et pour ceux qui viendront après» a indiqué le Président Sall assurant que tout le dispositif a été voté. «Il ne manque plus que la mise en œuvre et ça ce sont les centrales syndicales qui peuvent nous y aider les travailleurs le patronat aussi» a-t-il poursuivi lors de son discours à la clôture de la 3ème Conférence sociale sur la protection sociale ouverte jeudi au Cicad. Le Président Sall a dans la lancée évoqué pour une meilleure prise en charge des retraités la fusion entre l’Institut de prévoyance retraite du Sénégal (Ipres) et la Caisse de sécurité sociale. «Nous devons avoir le courage de faire certaines réformes sinon nous faisons du sur-place» a-t-il souligné à ce propos. Il a encore suggéré l’enrôlement des travailleurs ruraux artisans ; bref des travailleurs du secteur informel. «Il faut trouver des moyens et mécanismes pour les travailleurs ruraux il en est de même pour les artisans pour mettre de côté pour prévenir les lendemains difficiles» a-t-il expliqué notant que ces cotisations en tant qu’indépendants vont pouvoir permettre d’assurer une couverture maladie ou une pension de retraite. «En engageant le gouvernement à consacrer le thème de la 3e Conférence sociale sur la protection sociale j’ai voulu trouver un espace de dialogue plus large pour réfléchir en profondeur sur les mesures prioritaires supplémentaires visant le renforcement de la couverture sociale et son extension aux acteurs de l’économie informelle» a expliqué le Président Sall saluant l’engagement des parties prenantes à cette conférence pour avoir contribué à forger des consensus dans la problématique de la protection sociale. Le faible taux de personnes bénéficiaires de la protection sociale n’est pas un cas isolé pour le pays a rappelé le chef de l’Etat. «Selon un rapport sur la protection sociale 2020-2022 de l’Oit plus de la moitié de la population mondiale 53.1% soit 4.1 milliards d’individus ne disposent d’aucune protection sociale. Ce rapport récent indique que le pourcentage de couverture en Afrique se situe en dessous de la moyenne mondiale à seulement 17.4% » a-t-il évoqué à ce propos. Le directeur pays de l’Oit au Sénégal Dramane Haidara a noté les bons points du Sénégal dans le domaine de la protection sociale avec les politiques développées depuis 10 ans. Convaincu des capacités et de la volonté des autorités à aller encore plus loin M. Haidara qui dit fonder son propos sur une étude de 2020 a affirmé que le Sénégal peut mettre 7% de son Pib au financement de la protection sociale. «La protection sociale pour tous : agir vite pour réduire les déficits de travail décent et réussir la transition de l’économie informelle vers l’économie formelle» a été le thème de l’édition de cette année.

At least 13 killed,"An apartment building partially collapsed in the Russian border city of Belgorod on Sunday causing at least 13 deaths and injuring 20 other people officials said. They blamed Ukrainian shelling for the building’s destruction.

Online footage showed rescuers searching for survivors among the remnants of the building’s stairwell then fleeing the scene as part of the roof crashed to the ground. Russia’s Emergency Situations Ministry said 13 bodies had been recovered from the rubble so far.

Russia’s Investigative Committee the country’s top law enforcement agency said in a statement that the 10-story building had been hit by Ukrainian shelling.

The Russian Defense Ministry later wrote on social media that the building had been damaged by fragments of a downed Tochka-U TRC missile. It also said that air defenses had shot down several more rockets over the Belgorod region as well as two drones that were destroyed in a separate incident later Sunday.

Air raid alerts continued across Belgorod as rescuers worked. The city also came under fire Saturday evening killing one person and wounding 29 others Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

Cities across western Russia have come under regular attack from drones since May 2023 with Russian officials blaming Kyiv. Ukrainian officials never acknowledge responsibility for attacks on Russian territory or the Crimean Peninsula.

The Belgorod region on Russia’s western border has been the target of a large number of strikes. Although most cross-border shelling is seen in rural areas attacks have also been seen on the region’s capital. In December 2023 shelling in the heart of Belgorod city killed 25 people prompting authorities to start erecting public shelters.

Couples can easily spend $4000 (or more) on a weeklong trip to Disney World but my husband and I have found a few ways to save money.

Even though we don't have kids we usually stay at Disney's Art of Animation Resort. It's popular with families because of its kid-friendly Disney-movie theming. But adults shouldn't overlook the budget-friendly hotel.

High School died Friday in Florida. He was 80.

Bruggers helped Danube — located in Renville County about 100 miles west of the Twin Cities — reach the basketball high school state tournament in 1961 and '62. After the 1962 season Bruggers was named to the Parade All-America team.

After playing both offense and defense for the Gophers football team from 1963 to '65 Bruggers was signed as an undrafted free agent by the American Football League's Miami Dolphins. A linebacker he played 2½ seasons for Miami before getting traded to the San Diego Chargers where he played 3½ more seasons playing 57 AFL/NFL games in all.

After retiring from football he wrestled professionally for Verne Gagne and the Minneapolis-based American Wrestling Association. Bruggers wrestled for other professional wrestling organizations until 1975. He retired after suffering injuries in an airplane crash.

Smith — architect of Philip Rivers-era Chargers — dies at 75,"A.J. Smith oversaw one of the most successful eras in Chargers history. (Photo by Kirby Lee/Getty Images)

Former San Diego Chargers general manager A.J. Smith — who oversaw one of the most successful eras in franchise history — died on Sunday at 75 years old.

His son and Atlanta Falcons assistant general manger Kyle Smith announced his death in a statement alongside the Falcons. Per the statement Smith died following a seven-year battle with prostate cancer.

The Chargers released a statement from team owner Dean Spanos shortly after the announcement of Smith's death.

our hearts are with the Smith family 💙 pic.twitter.com/HjmXJY4JPb — Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) May 12 2024

""Belying a tough matter of fact and no nonsense persona — one synonymous with that of a true football guy — was A.J.'s softer side which included a tremendous love for his family the NFL and the Chargers"" Spanos said per the statement.

""The architect of one of the greatest chapters in franchise history A.J. made everyone around him better with a singular focus and intensity that elevated our organization.""

After two years as assistant general manager under John Butler Smith was the general manager of the Chargers from 2003-12 a span that saw them go 95-65 and make the playoffs five times. He's best known for overseeing the franchise's transition from Drew Brees to Philip Rivers an era that produced one of the NFL's most prolific offenses.

Smith took over a 2003 team featuring Brees and Hall of Fame running back LaDainian Tomlinson that went 4-12 in his first season as general manager. One of his first significant transactions was to sign projected Hall of Fame tight end Antonio Gates as an undrafted free agent. The last-place finish in 2003 secured the No. 1 pick in the 2004 draft.

Eli-Manning-Philip Rivers trade

The Chargers used that pick to select Eli Manning then traded Manning for Rivers whom the Giants had selected with the No. 4 pick. Manning had repeatedly told the Chargers that he wouldn't play for them.

The Chargers received a package of draft picks in return that included New York's first-round selection in the 2005 draft. They used that pick to select linebacker Shawne Merriman who went on to win Rookie of the Year honors and make three Pro Bowls. Manning went on to win two Super Bowls with the Giants.

The trade left the Chargers with two viable options at quarterback in Brees and Rivers. Under Smith's watch the Chargers ultimately ran with Rivers. Brees suffered a shoulder injury at end of the 2005 season that left his future as an NFL quarterback In doubt.

Rivers over Brees

The Chargers decided to let Brees walk in free agency after his injury and installed Rivers as their starter in 2006. Brees signed with the New Orleans Saints. He went on to recover from his injury and led the Saints to a Super Bowl championship after the 2009 season. He made 13 Pro Bowls in a certain Hall of Fame career.

Rivers made the first of his eight Pro Bowls in his first season as San Diego's starter and went on to lead the Chargers to AFC West championships in four straight seasons from 2006-09. The 2006 Chargers produced the league's best record at 14-2.

Despite the regular-season success the Chargers failed to advance to the Super Bowl. They advanced as far as the AFC championship after the 2007 season where they lost to the New England Patriots. The 2006 and 2009 teams that won 14 and 13 games respectively each lost in the divisional round of the playoffs after securing a first-round bye.

The Chargers dismissed Smith and head coach Norv Turner after a 7-9 finish in 2012 saw the team miss the playoffs for a third straight season. Smith then spent two seasons as a consultant and senior executive for Washington from 20013-14 before retiring in 2015 at 66 years old.

His son Kyle was a scout in Washington during his two seasons with the team. Kyle eventually rose to vice president of player personnel in Washington and was named assistant general manager of the Falcons in 2023.

Smith's 98 wins including playoffs are the most by a general manager in Chargers history. Smith is survived by Kyle his wife Susan and daughter Andrea."

DeSoto Eagles Offense Soars With Victory Over Spring Westfield

The DeSoto Eagles high power offense put on a show with 567 total yards in their victory over the Westfield Mustangs. Yes 567 total yards! The smooth combination of running and passing was on point. Quarterback Darius Baily lit up the sky going 11 for 11 with 218 yards and three touchdowns.

The Eagles have amazing receivers that made plays. With Baily’s accuracy the Eagles were able to run the ball well with Chris Henley Jr. running for 136 yards and one touchdown.

The Spring Westfield Mustangs were overwhelmed with the wideout talent the Eagles have. It did not matter if the Mustangs were running zone or man to man coverage. The Eagles quarterback was going to find his man. Mike Murphy was able to run a short out route that turned into a massive 43-yard touchdown catch. The speed that Murphy has is unbelievable. He was able to put up 128 yards and two touchdowns.

The number one target of the game was Jaylen Bean with nine recaptions and 103 yards. The explosive Johntay Cook showed off his speed with what seemed to be a go route as Cook rejoices with his hands extended out at the 10-yard line.

DeSoto knew this game was not going to be a walk in the park when it came to slowing down the Mustangs. What Spring Westfield was able to do was astonishing as they averaged 48 points per game this season. Quarterback Cardell Williams was befuddled the entire game as he was not able to show the fans his talent. The Eagles front seven was able to penetrate and disrupt the timing of the Mustangs. While the Mustangs fell they ended the season with an impressive 12-1 record.

To fully understand digital transformation it helps to look at examples of this emerging tech trend. Examples can inspire businesses considering investment in this rising trend by offering tangible instances of the benefits of digital transformation.

Digital transformation is the process of replacing or enhancing traditional business processes with digital technologies. The goal is to improve and streamline processes at all levels. In a now common example many medical offices are paper-free or are moving that way. Patients fill out medical documents on a tablet and records are migrated through the system digitally replacing the highly inefficient paper folders from yesteryear.

Even with a relatively modest example like shifting from paper to electronic records digital transformation can dramatically improve how companies serve their customers. However as you’ll see in the examples below digital transformation can require a seismic shift in process which means considerable investment of time and money in technology and staffing.

Virtually every example of digital transformation requires some form of cloud computing and often uses more than one cloud provider. Certainly most examples require machine learning a significant element of data analytics and – increasingly – support from artificial intelligence software.

Needless to say most businesses can’t achieve this transformation on their own; they’ll need to partner with digital transformation companies to enhance their odds of success. But because the advantages are so great even deep investment is typically justified. In the long run many digital transformation deployments become examples of success.

Examples of Digital Transformation

Digital Transformation in Retail

In 2017 Domino’s Pizza adopted artificial intelligence and chatbot technology to create a conversational interface with Facebook Messenger. Customers who have a Domino’s Pizza account can use Facebook Messenger to quickly reorder a previously ordered pizza combination or a new series of toppings.

Ordering is streamlined and interactive and since it’s tied into social media (as opposed to requiring a separate web site or a phone call) the frequency of orders have increased. The chatbot uses a data-based logic system to offer upsells like strategic discounts and related food items. Additionally the AI-based system saves labor costs for the pizza chain.

This example of digital transformation reflects the strength of AI in driving sales. One of AI’s main strengths is human-like chat in which an algorithm responds to customers in real time using NLP (natural language processing) even if the customer is using idiosyncratic language. Additionally AI excels at performing tedious tasks that would stretch the limits of human performance. This includes sifting through vast amounts of data to search for useful patterns and other insights – in this case patterns in how humans order food delivery to ease friction in the ordering process.

Given the many successful examples it’s no surprise that the market for digital transformation services is forecast to top $800 billion by 2025. Source: MarketResearchFuture.

Digital Transformation in Marketing

In 2012 toy and game manufacturer Hasbro saw its marketshare slipping and had an epiphany. Rather than market to children it targeted their parents who actually make the purchases. They began a new digital and data strategy which took a number of years to reach full implementation.

The company began gathering and mining customer data to create more targeted marketing campaigns promoting both nostalgic and newer brands. It made a major push into online media targeting web sites with high cohorts of parents. This data-based online approach gave Hasbro better and more immediate feedback. In 2016 the company broke the $5 billion sales mark for the year and is on track for $6 billion in 2021.

One of the main tools for digital transformation in marketing is data. Mining electronic data gathered in massive quantities in data warehouses and data lakes greatly increases the ability of sales leaders to hone campaigns. This usually involves business intelligence software – a core tool in digital transformation – which allows pinpoint targeting by demographics.

Digital Transformation in Banking

Institutions across the financial sector such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America have automated transactions even as this has required handling major security and compliance issues. The fascinating aspect of this example is that instead of one limited instance retail banks have undergone a rolling adoption of digital transformation over the last three decades.

The major milestone in this process was the adoption of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs); by allowing customers to get cash without human assistance the banking sector has been a leader in using automation to save on staff costs. For a contrasting example look at the grocery sector which didn’t move heavily to self-checkout (SCO) until the last few years; globally less than 200000 units existed in 2013 a figure forecast to rise to 1.2 million units in 2025.

The banking sector is also a leader in digital transformation in its use of mobile. Its adoption of mobile banking uses a combination of edge computing (its network of security gateways) and IoT devices (cell phones) to provide convenience to customers. Going a step further allowing customers to create automatic payments means that – at a very basic level – users are deploying automation themselves. Furthermore third party payment systems like Google Pay and Apple Pay let consumers pay for everyday purchases with a wave of their smartphones; this is yet another example of deploying technology Near Field Communication to enable an easier process.

Digital Transformation in Transportation

There is a good reason Uber grabbed so much marketshare from traditional taxi companies over the last decade. Uber took an in-depth data-driven look at the taxi industry and identified all the pain points of customers from locating a nearby taxi to offering non-cash payments. Using a key element of digital transformation strategy – active listening using data – the company catered to customers in ways they’d never been responded to before.

All of this logistics and data-centered strategy was built into the smartphone app which facilitates convenient and rapid customer feedback. Again this is close listening to the customer.

This example of real time interactive listening is echoed in a foundational practice in digital transformation: using social media to form a close bond with customers. The interactive smartphone app is a click away from major social media platforms and in the minds of many consumers is the same world. Clearly social media has become the new customer service desk. LinkedIn Twitter and Facebook have replaced 800 lines and email for instant communication between sellers and customers handling sales disputes and measuring brand sentiment.

In its “State of the Connected Customer” report Salesforce found 84% of high-performing companies are managing and responding to social inquiries and issues in real time while just 37% of under-performers say the same. As an additional advantage this interactive response is often accompanied by a marketing element.

Digital Transformation in Healthcare

Telehealth services like Teladoc MeMD MDLive and a host of other providers enable users to receive care from healthcare professionals using a Webcam lessening the need for physical infrastructure including fewer staff hours spent supporting waiting rooms.

An advantage of digital transformation is better focus on the customer and that’s certainly true with telehealth which allows better care for rural and other isolated patients. Not to mention enabling an on-demand format that’s more flexible for all patients. The telehealth market is forecast to expand from $144 billion in 2020 to $636 billion by 2028.

Additionally the healthcare sector is migrating to electronic data management at all levels from patient sign-in on electronic devices to record keeping with blockchain and data warehouses. This helps create a centralized data repository for each patient known as an EHR or electronic health record which facilitates better care by pooling data from disparate sources.

Data management and data mining are rapidly growing trends in healthcare easily rivaling telehealth as examples of digital transformation. Using data analytics on large number of anonymized patient records enables lower rates of medication problems by flagging consistent problems across many patients. Data is also used for preventative care which involves analyzing patient data to find links between current and potential future medical problems then informing the patient far in advance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzA5NTA3MDUxMjEwMDc1MTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TITAN: A knowledge-based platform for Big Data workflow management,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705121007516 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzA5NTA3MDUxMjEwMDc1MTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI2NjY2NzU4MjEwMDEwMTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intelligent financial fraud detection practices in post-pandemic era,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675821001016 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI2NjY2NzU4MjEwMDEwMTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

TOMS RIVER NJ — A Burlington County man is facing carjacking and weapons charges after police say he took a vehicle at gunpoint in the parking lot at AutoZone on Friday Toms River police said Saturday.

Devin S. Copley-Clevenger 20 of Lumberton was arrested Friday afternoon and charged with first-degree robbery first-degree carjacking second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a high-capacity magazine said Jillian Messina media relations specialist for the Toms River Police Department. The charges were approved by the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office Messina said. Copley-Clevenger is being held at the Ocean County Jail pending a detention hearing.

The incident was reported about 4:10 p.m. The victim told police he had given an acquaintance a ride to the AutoZone at 10 Route 37 East after the acquaintance's vehicle had broken down Messina said. Once at AutoZone the acquaintance got out of the vehicle and walked to the store the victim told police.

The booming demand for investments that help finance a cleaner world has forced new questions about ‘green’ bonds.

Companies and countries are increasingly issuing these bonds to help fund solutions to social and environmental problems. More than $800bn-worth of sustainable bonds had been issued as of September 30 according to Bank of America. And the bank has predicted that the total will reach $1tn by the end of this year.

Already in November pharmaceutical company Teva has raised a record $5bn through a sustainability-linked bond. A month earlier Japanese telecom NTT raised $2.7bn in one of the largest green bond deals of the year.

$800bn Total value of green bonds issued as at September 30 2021

But the market’s growth has invited scepticism about the authenticity of sustainable debt.

Companies in China for example — despite the country’s poor pollution and human rights record — are big issuers of so-called green debt. Belarus Saudi Arabia and Russia have also sold bonds to money managers that claim to adhere to environmental social and governance (ESG) criteria.

ESG principles can sometimes seem overly flexible as well. Earlier this year JPMorgan bought debt from CoreCivic a private prisons operator — two years after saying it would no longer finance the private prison industry. Investors were also invited to buy a sustainability-liked bond issued by Brazilian meat company JBS which has come under fire from campaigners over deforestation and labour standards.

So for bond funds decisions about which social and green bonds to buy have to be considered carefully by individual managers.

“We decide not the issuer whether the green bond is really green” says Bertrand Rocher a fixed-income portfolio manager at Mirova in Paris.

Whether managers should buy green bonds from a country with a questionable human rights record has become a contentious issue. At Mirova Rocher says: “We try to understand whether these countries have a chance to transition toward a more democratic version of their politics. Or whether they are stuck for decades with politics that will never change.”

That means a green bond from Hungary would probably be acceptable but a green bond from China would not he explains. Rocher notes that the Hungarian people have opportunities to overhaul the government in future elections but in China “we don’t feel that the Chinese power will change anytime soon.” Consequently when it comes to China “even if the green bond is purely perfect we will not accept it.”

Fund managers are also looking to NGOs such as Transparency International and Freedom House to help with screening for human rights issues says Saida Eggerstedt head of sustainable credit at Schroders.

We don’t feel that the Chinese power will change anytime soon . . . even if the green bond is purely perfect we will not accept it.”

However her view is that if a country is excluded under a screening process but then issues a sustainable or green bond “the sustainable investor should encourage that and it could be that an exception is made to the exclusion rule.” Fund managers must be able to prove why they overrode the exclusion though. “Clients ask questions: ‘Why did you do it?’” she points out.

Regulators too are starting to ask questions. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority this month published a discussion paper on the disclosures fund managers should make. At the same time Finma Switzerland’s financial regulator published guidance to protect fund investors from so-called ‘greenwashing’ or misleading claims. Its aim is to ensure investors “are not deceived regarding the alleged sustainability of products and financial services” Finma said.

Companies and countries are pushing the boundaries of what might be considered a green bond because the savings on debt interest can be significant. Demand has led green bonds to be priced at a premium — or “greenium” — to the price of conventional bonds which gives issuers slightly lower interest-rate costs.

For European green bonds the premium these bonds obtain versus conventional debt has increased this year Bank of America said in a November 1 report.

But with definitions being stretched ESG fund managers are increasingly turning to others to verify what issuers are saying they will do with bond proceeds. At Nuveen ESG funds “use third-party data providers” to identify bonds to invest in says Stephen Liberatore lead portfolio manager for the firm’s fixed-income ESG funds. Nuveen has also applied a proprietary vetting process to determine valid green or social debt he adds.

In the US however standardised reporting is behind that in Europe presenting a headache for fund managers. “We believe that increased transparency and standardisation of reporting from issuers can help investors better identify the best actors” says Robert Fernandez director of ESG research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHlwaWNhbC1nZW4tei1zdHVkZW50LWRlYnQtc2F2aW5ncy15MmstdHJlbmRzLTIwMjEtMTHSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3R5cGljYWwtZ2VuLXotc3R1ZGVudC1kZWJ0LXNhdmluZ3MteTJrLXRyZW5kcy0yMDIxLTExP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the typical American Gen Zer: debt savings trends,"Gen Zers the oldest of whom turn 24 this year make up the new ""it"" generation.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

The Vanguard Self Storage facility is being built at the former Regency Laundry site on the A36 Lower Bristol Road.

The reception area will feature a restored De Haviland Vampire aircraft adding a unique touch.

Vanguard Self Storage one of the UK’s remaining independent providers of self-storage solutions say the new facility marks a significant milestone in their strategic expansion.

The property which had been a laundry dating back to the 1880s had been purchased by a residential developer but faced a rejected planning application.

Vanguard seized the opportunity making an unconditional offer and completing the acquisition in January 2022.

Will McCullagh Managing Director of Vanguard Self Storage said: “We are excited to bring our high-quality self-storage services to the heart of Bath.

“Our new facility not only provides convenient and secure storage solutions but also showcases our dedication to sustainable design and environmental responsibility.”

It has been designed by Bath architects Designscape to blend seamlessly with the city’s architectural heritage.

Vanguard say: “Utilising a combination of Bath stone glazing and bronze cladding the building’s exterior pays homage to the local aesthetic while incorporating modern design elements.”

Mike Lamplough Vanguard’s Head of Property said: “We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible storage experience From the architecturally sensitive design to the state-of-the-art amenities our new Bath store exemplifies our dedication to excellence.”

Sustainability is at the forefront of the project. Key features include a 75kWp solar array on the roof electric vehicle charging bays and a new stream landscape feature that re-naturalises the existing waterway running across the site as well as landscaping to contribute to the promotion of natural habitats.

The new facility will offer 45000sq ft of net lettable storage space spread across four floors and served by two 3.5-tonne Kone lifts.

Each unit will be individually alarmed and the site will be monitored 24/7 by CCTV.

Ben Thilthorpe Head of Operations at Vanguard said: “Following the success of our Bristol store which we opened in 2019 we anticipate that our new Bath branch will be very attractive to business customers.

“We will have units that will be ideal for micro and small companies and a drop-in business lounge.

“The fact that we are only a five-minute walk from the city centre means that we will be providing the perfect location for final mile logistics.”

The Bath store is the latest addition to Vanguard Storage’s growing network of facilities across the UK.

The company have also announced the completion of expansion projects at its Staples Corner and Bristol locations as well as the installation of a new 295kWp solar PV array at their Manchester site."

(Provided by McHenry County College)

A human resources professional and a CEO in the health care life sciences sector have been named this year’s winners of McHenry County College’s Distinguished Alumni Award.

Retzlaff came to MCC as a wife mother and grandmother and graduated in December 2002 with an associate degree according to a news release. She went on to major in human resources at Roosevelt University before gaining experience in the field at a Fortune 100 company.

She returned to McHenry County where she joined the team at the State Bank Group in Wonder Lake as a certified human resource professional according to the release. She retired in 2019 after almost 14 years as its vice president of human resources.

Retzlaff also volunteered in the community via school programs scout leadership Phi Theta Kappa the Illinois Bankers Association and Leadership Greater McHenry County. She also has served on the board of Stateline SHRM the local chapter of the National Society for Human Resources Management as treasurer and president.

LeCoque who grew up in Crystal Lake and attended MCC in the early 1980s has worked in the health care life sciences sector for more than 25 years according to the release. He earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from Miami University in Ohio and his master’s in business administration from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.

We are proud to call them MCC alumni and excited to honor them with this award.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYWwuY29tL2VuLWNtL25ld3MvaG93LWJheHRlci1jYW4tc2V0LWthaXplci1jaGllZnMtZnJlZS1hZ2FpbnN0LXN3YWxsb3dzLWZjL2JsdDQ0NjgxMjA4YzM4ZDZhY2PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Baxter can set Kaizer Chiefs free against Swallows FC,"Following Wednesday's 1-1 draw against AmaZulu Amakhosi head to Dobsonville to take on the struggling Birds on Sunday afternoon

Despite Kaizer Chiefs' recent improved results the current Glamour Boys side under Stuart Baxter have not yet fully convinced.

It's hard to knock a team when they're on a good run of results. But it feels a bit like Chiefs have been papering over the cracks in recent weeks and that despite earning 13 points of the last available 18 the team is not firing on all cylinders.

Article continues below

There's a restlessness among some of the Chiefs fans on social media. Among the criticism of Baxter has been that there are 'favourites' in his team who are 'undroppable'.

Cole Alexander is one of those players and it's his omission from Sunday's match against Swallows due to suspension which might even prove a pivotal moment in Chiefs' season.

It could be argued that Baxter is too defensive-minded or conservative due to his tendency to field three players who are more hard men than creators usually Alexander Phathutshedzo Nange and a converted defender Njabulo Ngcobo.

For Sunday's game against Swallows Baxter may be cautious of a backlash from the struggling Birds expecting Swallows coach Brandon Truter to have his men fired up and ready to charge into battle.

In that case he'll probably replace Alexander with someone like Anthony Agay or Kearyn Baccus - both hard-working strong but also not the type to make things happen in attack.

Or he could decide to throw just a little caution to the wind and play Nange and Ngcobo as the two deep-lying midfielders and replace Alexander with a more forward-thinking option someone who can get up and support Bernard Parker.

The options to play in that free-roaming central midfield role are numerous - Nkosingiphile Ncgobo Khama Billiat Lebogang Manyama Kgaogelo Sekgota Njabulo Blom or even Happy Mashiane.

Effectively instead of a three-point attack which has usually been Keagan Dolly Billiat and Parker Chiefs could have a four-man front-line by playing two wingers a striker and a support striker/ advanced central midfielder.

It would mean Baxter having to place more trust in his defence. But he could still have Njabulo Ncgobo reigning PSL Defender of the Season playing as holding midfielder and shielding the actual defence.

Such a team would also surely be more exciting to watch and better appreciated by the supporters and why not get more of Amakhosi’s exciting attacking array on the field at the same time?

With just that one simple tweak it’s possible Baxter could set his players free and take the team to the next level - one that plays on the front foot with confidence and purpose and scores lots of goals rather than a side ready to grind out results.",,,,,,,,,

Jeremy Grantham legendary investor and pioneer of index fund investing expects today’s sky-scraping stock market to come crashing back to earth.

Grantham recently told Bloomberg that investors who enthusiastically drove the stock market to new heights during a global recession are in for a shock.

“When the decline comes it will perhaps be bigger and better than anything previously in U.S. history” he warned.

Grantham predicted the dotcom collapse and the 2008 meltdown of the real estate market — he’s also in charge of about $60 billion as the investment chief at asset management firm Grantham Mayo & Otterloo — so he’s worth listening to.

Before Grantham’s predictions have a chance to come true let’s look at a few safe haven stocks in GMO’s portfolio. One of them might be worth buying with some of your extra pennies.

United Health (UNH)

UnitedHealth’s quarterly dividend payout currently $1.45 per share and the performance of its stock which is roughly 30% this year suggest that the company is currently in strong financial shape.

But the insurance and healthcare leader is well positioned to weather any long-term financial tumult as well.

Regardless of what happens to the economy Americans will still need healthcare. Millions of them are already UnitedHealth customers.

UnitedHealth is a diversified company. In addition to its thriving insurance business it also provides software and information technology to a number of clinics and hospitals.

As the medical tech space continues to grow so should UnitedHealth’s profits.

U.S. Bancorp (USB)

U.S. Bancorp is the parent company of U.S. Bank one of the country’s largest banking institutions.

Betting on bank stock might seem counterintuitive when a stock market correction is expected to hammer investors’ finances but banks tend to do well in rising interest rate environments: As rates increase the profit margin or spread earned by banks widens.

Rather than turning itself into a casino through the kinds of risky derivative plays that tanked some of its competitors in 2007-2008 U.S. Bancorp has instead been focused on innovating and providing digital service for its customers.

The increased efficiency and lower operating costs that result should be music to investors’ ears.

Since the beginning of 2021 U.S. Bancorp stock has risen by about 31%. Of course if you’re on the fence about jumping in at the current price some apps might give you a free share of U.S. Bancorp just for signing up.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Despite the push for more healthy food and beverage consumption Coca-Cola’s dominance of the soft drink market remains unmatched.

Story continues

But the company’s offerings extend far beyond liquid sugar.

Coke also sells popular bottled water brands Dasani and Smartwater big-name juices like Minute Maid and Simply and international coffee products Costa and Georgia.

What makes Coca-Cola an interesting defensive play is the company’s consistently impressive profit margin which has averaged 23.6% over the last decade. That’s largely the result of Coke’s ability to tinker with portion sizes and prices and having the capital to invest in greater productivity.

A faltering stock market shouldn’t change any of those dynamics.

This year Coke’s quarterly dividend payout hit $0.42 almost double what it was a decade ago. The company’s stock is up roughly 4% since the beginning of the year.

Don’t forget inflation

Comaniciu Dan/Shutterstock

Grantham says portfolios also need protection from inflation which hit a 31-year high in October.

""This is the first time that inflation the number one predictor of a market downturn since 1925 is being ignored” he said.

At times of high inflation investors often turn to real assets which tend to hold their value. That’s why collectibles — diamonds wine fine art — are taking up an increasing amount of room in modern portfolios.

Investing in fine art no longer requires you to outbid a gaggle of millionaires at some stuffy auction house.

It has everything you’re looking for in a California Contemporary. White exterior with the appearance of a flat roof but look a little more closely it’s a FAUX ROOF LINE. It’s a clever way to transition a traditional to a contemporary AND it creates a huge porch out front with two seating areas. It’s tiled too for a little extra flash of class.

Even though this home is a strong nod to California Cool it also has some pretty serious Miami Vice Vibes at night. If you moved in you could be the toast of the town with your semi-annual Crockett & Tubbs Look-a-Like Competition. I call dibs on the pastel blazer. I’m kidding. THEY’RE ALL PASTEL BLAZERS.

More coolness out front? Not one not two but three privacy fences and a gravel pit just beyond the front porch with what’s that? A WATER FEATURE.

The creamy white brick contrasted with the charcoal gray trim and window casings are classic and the trendy color scheme continues inside. There’s white and gray and granite and that gorgeous soft wood color flooring that pretty much goes with every style.

Every inch of this home has been remodeled and I love the thick granite in the open kitchen. There’s plenty of natural light and no doubt that’s the reason for the privacy fences. You can keep the blinds open but thwart any would-be creepers.

There’s one feature I am dying to mention and it’s the hair dryer mounted on the wall. A lot of people describe their bathroom makeovers as spa-like or “it’s like the finest hotels” and this one went the extra mile to include the hair dryer. But don’t kid yourself that’s handy as heck. If there’s a pullout drawer with metal containers to hold your straightening iron without burning the house down we are in.

This house is over in the Hillcrest Homes neighborhood of North Dallas. It’s just north of 635 in between Coit Road and Hillcrest Road. It’s a neighborhood that’s known for larger homes with slightly more reasonable price tags.

Why he invested in his own words

I have always been interested in chemistry. I can’t stop trying to wrap my brain around it. Because of my love for chemistry one of the things that it led me to was brewing beer. I just thought it was so incredible that you can take malted hops yeast and water and make beer. And you can make a Hefeweizen a lager an ale a pilsner and the flavor profiles are so different. I ended up starting to brew myself but then I got away from that and got busy with other things.

A few years ago I met Micah [McFarlane Revel Spirits co-founder and CEO] through a sort of odd circumstance. He thought I was someone else and approached me and was so friendly that I didn’t know what was going on. I was thinking “Do I know this man? Because it seems like he knows me!” He later apologized saying he thought I was someone else but we struck up a new conversation now based on who we really are and we talked about what he was doing. I told him that I had always had a passion for the chemistry of brewing and the distilling process. And we just got to talking and figured out how he could introduce me to a world I’ve always been fascinated by and how I could help him.

Revel is the only brand that I own and invest in. I truly believe in it. We are introducing a whole new spirits category to the industry and that doesn’t happen often. You have vodka gin rum tequila whiskey Irish whiskey—but avila is a whole new category. It is an agave-based spirit but we don’t make it like tequila or mezcal. We combine the processes of the two. We have a blanco a reposado and an añejo. All three flavor profiles are so different. The reposado is something that I drink quite often and is smooth and you taste the oak because it is aged for 12 months in whisky oak barrels. The blanco is great for margaritas and the añejo is aged for 24 months in French oak. The añejo almost drinks like a Scotch. The brand has become like a baby to me. I care about it so much and I want the right message to get out. It becomes a mission that people understand the difference between tequila mezcal and avila.

I’m not silent at all as a partner. I have an opinion about everything whether it’s about the weight of the bottle or the matte finish on the box. Everything. We are about to launch an agave spritz and it’s a cocktail in a can an expression of avila. I was involved in the work that went into the canned cocktails. I cannot tell you how many different versions of each of the four flavors we decided on. It was incredible. I have a lot to say about the subject. We have Zoom meetings every Monday and I make most of them unless I’m on set.

I was drawn to Micah because of his honesty and where he was with the business and where he saw it going. It was his willingness to share with me both his dream scenario versus the actual practicality of the business and what’s going on in the marketplace. And also quite honestly it’s good! It’s the best agave spirit I’ve ever had in my life. When you invest in something you look at the potential to earn money. And also does it go with—and I hate when people talk this way but I can’t think of another way to say it—does it go along with your brand? Does it make sense? In other words you’ll see a guy endorsing something and you think to yourself “Well that guy doesn’t wear those shoes.”

You are trusting other people with your money when you invest. If you can invest in a company or a brand where you believe in the people and their heart and you use the products and know they are good I think you win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNoL2hhbXN0ZXItd2hvLWdvdC1yaWNoZXItdGhhbi13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1pbi1jcnlwdG8tdHJhZGluZy1kaWVzLTQ0ODkyNjguaHRtbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvdGVjaC9oYW1zdGVyLXdoby1nb3QtcmljaGVyLXRoYW4td2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtaW4tY3J5cHRvLXRyYWRpbmctZGllcy00NDg5MjY4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hamster Who Got ‘Richer’ Than Warren Buffett In Crypto-Trading Dies,"A crypto-trading hamster named Mr Goxx had once beaten indexes and funds like S&P 500 and Warren Buffett?s Berkshire Hathaway.

Both crimes occurred shortly after 8 p.m. on one of the busiest shopping days of the year following the Thanksgiving holiday. Police said a group of 20 to 30 people stole merchandise at the Burnsville store while 10 to 12 adults and juveniles were said to have looted the Maplewood store.

No one was injured and as of Saturday no one was reported arrested in connection with the thefts. They came after a series of brazen mass robberies at other retailers nationwide.

""Retailers across the country are seeing spikes in crime"" a Best Buy spokesman said in a statement Saturday. ""These incidents have been by and large nonviolent though often traumatic for those who witnessed them. As an industry we are working with local law enforcement and taking additional security precautions where it makes sense.""

No weapons were seen in the Burnsville incident Burnsville police Capt. Don Stenger said. ""We don't know exactly what was taken or the dollar value"" he said.

Maplewood police who arrived at the store at 8:10 p.m. Friday were told that the group of suspects had entered the store at the same time and worked together to steal items including TVs tablets and hoverboards.

The Star Tribune was at the Maplewood Best Buy store early Friday morning where crowds were bigger than on Black Friday last year when many shoppers decided to stay home out of caution due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Security personnel were posted at the front of the store as people shopped and paid for their merchandise.

Police were working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to identify the suspects and determine whether the crimes were related. They resemble a number of so-called mass robberies recently reported in the United States where groups of people swarm a store clear the shelves of goods and then flee.

""Across the board retailers are getting more concerned with this growing trend. … It is definitely a tough problem to solve given the organized nature and number of people involved in many of the incidents"" said Chris Walton a former Target executive who co-leads retail blog and podcast Omni Talk and the Minneapolis retail lab Third Haus.

Several burglaries were reported in Chicago stores on Black Friday. Smash-and-grab incidents were reported earlier this month at high-end brands like Louis Vuitton in the San Francisco area. Walgreens recently said it was closing several of its drugstores in San Francisco citing ""organized retail crime.""

Walton said he expected retailers to post more security guards at the doors and more controlled entry and exit points into buildings in addition to investments in technology that can better identify potential suspects. There could also be more lobbying for changes to shoplifting laws and calls for better regulation of online resale sites.

Best Buy is lobbying on the federal level for a law that would make the online reselling of stolen goods more difficult.

""We are definitely seeing more and more particularly organized retail crime and incidence of shrink in our locations. … And this is a real issue that hurts and scares real people"" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said earlier this week during an earnings call with analysts.

Barry said Best Buy is locking up some products and hiring security to try to counteract some of the crime. Best Buy leaders said such crime is playing a role in the company's falling profit margins.

It remains to be seen how organized these particular Best Buy crimes were or if shoplifters decided to act on the spur of the moment perhaps copycatting other crimes seen on social media said Mike Olson chief executive of Minneapolis-based 360 Security Services and a former U.S. Secret Service special agent and St. Paul police officer.

""With everybody wearing masks because of COVID and law enforcement resources spread thin you certainly create a perfect storm for would-be criminals"" Olson said.

Theft fraud and losses from other so-called retail ""shrink"" reached almost $62 billion in 2019 up from $50.6 billion the year before according to the National Retail Federation (NRF). In a 2020 survey NRF found that three in four retailers who experienced organized retail crime polled reported an increase in the past year.

""Between an increase in incidents and new ways to steal shrink is at an all-time high"" NRF Vice President for Research Development and Industry Analysis Mark Mathews said in a statement.

During the holidays shoplifting incidents rise because there is a bigger market of people who will buy stolen goods Olson said. He added that it's important for retailers to communicate with each other and for law enforcement groups to collaborate to spot crime circles.

Shoppers can also play a role and should come forward with information that could possibly help improve safety especially since the cost of shoplifting eventually is passed to them Olson said. ""It is everybody's job to take ownership in our community"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2JyaW5nbWV0aGVuZXdzLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtbmV3cy9sYXJnZS1ncm91cHMtb2YtdGhpZXZlcy10YXJnZXQtYmVzdC1idXktc3RvcmVzLWluLWJ1cm5zdmlsbGUtbWFwbGV3b29kLW9uLWJsYWNrLWZyaWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Large groups of thieves target 2 Twin Cities Best Buys on Black Friday,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/large-groups-of-thieves-target-best-buy-stores-in-burnsville-maplewood-on-black-friday on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2JyaW5nbWV0aGVuZXdzLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtbmV3cy9sYXJnZS1ncm91cHMtb2YtdGhpZXZlcy10YXJnZXQtYmVzdC1idXktc3RvcmVzLWluLWJ1cm5zdmlsbGUtbWFwbGV3b29kLW9uLWJsYWNrLWZyaWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyZW5kaW5nL2xhcmdlLWdyb3VwLXRoaWV2ZXMtcm9iLWJlc3QtYnV5LXN1YnVyYmFuLW1pbm5lYXBvbGlzL1pRUEc1TUFRWlJIQlhNTVRNV1hUNVI0VURFL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raXJvNy5jb20vbmV3cy90cmVuZGluZy9sYXJnZS1ncm91cC10aGlldmVzLXJvYi1iZXN0LWJ1eS1zdWJ1cmJhbi1taW5uZWFwb2xpcy9aUVBHNU1BUVpSSEJYTU1UTVdYVDVSNFVERS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Large group of thieves rob Best Buy in suburban Minneapolis,"We’re Sorry!

At 26 years old nearly five years after he graduated from Rutgers he hadn’t yet found a way to stick on an NFL roster. He began to wonder whether the years he had spent pursuing his dream would ever pay off.

DePaola sat at the breakfast counter in his parents’ Maryland home in early 2014 and pondered his future. He worked on and off at Best Buy and his family’s restaurant to make ends meet while training to stay ready for whatever opportunity might pop up. He had already spent two offseasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and been cut both times before the 53-man rosters were finalized.

His mother Janet asked Andrew what his next step would be if his dream of playing in the NFL didn’t work out and she instantly felt guilty for doing so.

“I do know a number of times where I said to Andrew ‘Do we have a Plan B?’ and the answer was ‘No not really’” Janet said. “He had that faith that someday this was going to work out.”

It took five years of heartbreak before DePaola finally secured a starting NFL job with the Buccaneers in August 2014 but disappointment soon followed as major injuries threatened his dream. But when he takes the field Sunday with the Minnesota Vikings to face the 49ers in San Francisco (4:25 p.m. ET Fox) DePaola will represent more than someone who found a way to stick on a roster. He’ll personify the type of incredible perseverance it takes to earn that opportunity and thrive. Pro Football Focus ranks DePaola as the second-best long-snapper in the NFL.

The dream has become a reality.

‘It was surreal’

Andy DePaola quickly realized his eldest son was not cut out to be a bartender.

“He’d take a liter of Tito’s and would get about four drinks out of it where you’re supposed to get 20” he said. “We were losing money.”

So instead whenever Janet and Andy were down an employee at DePaola’s Pub their neighborhood restaurant where locals flock for burgers they’d have Andrew wash dishes sweep the floors and bus tables.

DePaola went undrafted in the spring of 2010 after five seasons at Rutgers. The New Orleans Saints invited him to rookie minicamp as a college tryout but didn’t sign him.

He began working a seasonal shift in the winter of 2010 at Best Buy in Piscataway New Jersey where he’d offload HDTVs from the trucks and restock shelves. DePaola's NFL prospects were the same in spring 2011 – bleak. Rutgers let him use its facilities to train in the meantime. The New England Patriots called in August 2011 to check in but didn’t offer a workout.

Several of his coaches from Rutgers were hired by Tampa Bay in 2012 and they brought DePaola in for his first tryout in two years. DePaola was signed in the spring and stuck around for training camp before being released after the third preseason game.

The Bucs signed him to a futures contract at the end of the 2012 season and had him around all of 2013. He was the last man cut in the preseason and didn’t receive any assurances about being brought back for the next season.

DePaola took a hard look at his NFL future after pouring five years’ worth of time into making it a reality. He’d been offered a drafting/computer-aided design job in the meantime but couldn’t commit to it. He wanted to give himself one more shot at making a roster.

In May 2014 DePaola had two workouts scheduled when Tampa called back. The Bucs offered him a contract for the offseason if he signed with them and canceled his other plans. There was an open competition with Jeremy Cain the incumbent long-snapper through training camp.

“My husband said Andrew was on the phone and my shoulders shrunk” Janet said. “It’s the end of August; you know the routine. And he goes ‘Looks like you’re going to have to buy a Tampa Bay jersey.’”

It took Janet about 10 seconds to process what she was being told before she burst into tears. It didn’t feel real for Andrew either until then-Bucs head coach Lovie Smith congratulated him in the hallway on his way to a meeting.

“I wanted to break down right there because it was five years of really trying and it finally happened” Andrew said. “The feeling was indescribable. All these emotions running through your head and questioning where your future was a couple months before that. And just to finally get that ‘Hey you made it’ it was surreal.”

‘No doubt’

DePaola spent three seasons (2014-16) with Tampa Bay before he tore his ACL. He spent 2017 with the Chicago Bears and he tore his ACL again in the first game of the 2018 season while with the Oakland Raiders and was placed on injured reserve the rest of the season.

He was back at square one. After completing his rehab DePaola didn’t make it on to a roster and spent the 2019 season worrying about his next opportunity. His prospects again looked desolate but his support group never lost faith.

“Nope. No doubt” Andy said. “He already had it in his head. He just never stopped. He knew he wanted to be there and be part of that 32-guy club of long-snappers. He knows where he wants to be and that’s where he is.”

DePaola had a workout nearly every week in 2020 and Minnesota called in the middle of November. Austin Cutting the team's long-snapper at the time was a close contact for COVID-19 and his status for a Week 9 game in Chicago was in question. The Vikings quickly reached out to sign DePaola as an emergency option. The long-snapper raced to the airport but couldn’t make the last flight out to Minnesota in time to quarantine and be available to play.

Days later the Vikings called back. DePaola was signed to the practice squad and later replaced Cutting. He has been with Minnesota ever since helping its special team units rise in a year’s time from the bottom of the league to the eighth-most efficient according to ESPN’s Football Power Index. The perspective he has gained along the way from a nonlinear journey riddled with ups and downs keeps him grounded.

“The game has been taken away from me a couple of times and at this point I’m going to have fun I’m going to enjoy being around the guys soak it all in” DePaola said. “One day I’m here and the next day I might not be. I’m just going to enjoy it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI4LzIyODA2MDQ4L3NhbXN1bmctZ2FsYXh5LXotZmxpcC0zLWN5YmVyLW1vbmRheS1kZWFsLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 3 is up to $500 off at Best Buy,"Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the company’s lowest-priced foldable yet at its normal $999.99 but today you can get the trendy phone for way way less than that. In an early Cyber Monday 2021 deal the unlocked Z Flip 3 is available from Best Buy for $599.99 if you activate service on the device with your purchase.

That’s a colossal $400 discount from the Flip 3’s regular price and brings it on par with something like the Pixel 6. Google’s phone is terrific but it certainly doesn’t have the cool factor of a folding screen. Verizon and AT&T customers can both get that price for a limited time.

The phone is also water resistant has excellent performance and includes wireless charging. $850 at Amazon

In certain cases you can save even more. Activating a new line of service on T-Mobile / Sprint brings the price down to $499.99 for the unlocked Z Flip 3. If you can deal with some carrier bloatware the Verizon model is also discounted to $499.99 if you’re eligible for an upgrade.

Take a look at our review of the Z Flip 3 and you’ll find that my colleague Dan Seifert praised Samsung’s first truly mainstream foldable for its excellent screen snappy performance water resistance and compact size when folded up. If there’s one weak point of the phone its battery life is merely average among the competition. But there’s no denying the sleek look of this thing — and that cream color still looks just as fantastic now as when Samsung announced it though the deal applies to the black green and lavender colors if those are more your style."

But as their generation begins its long goodbye after dominating American life for the past three decades the boomers at the very top are sure to be among the last holdouts. From Patriots football coach Bill Belichick to Senator Elizabeth Warren to film director Steven Spielberg many are already plowing ahead into their late 60s or 70s — if not beyond.

The baby boomers who still run most of the nation’s business cultural and political bastions have been slow to move out of the corner office. There’s a lot to lose: The big salary. Access and influence. Business lunches and first-class travel. Staffs waiting on their word and whim.

The second in an occasional series on the future of the baby boomers.

More than half of rank-and-file employees born in the 20 years after World War II have left the labor force. That’s by no means true however in the leadership class where stepping aside means confronting an often uncomfortable question: “What’s next?” Boomers still hold most of the CEO jobs at top public companies most of the seats in Congress and most of the votes in the academy that hands out Oscars.

Yet their grip on power is growing more precarious as these high-octane players navigate — not always smoothly — a world changing all around them. The march of technology is rewriting the rules in virtually every field. Pressure is mounting for a more diverse workforce especially in leadership ranks that remain disproportionately white and male. And a new generation is demanding a say in how organizations operate and what they stand for pushing issues like climate change to the forefront.

“Boomer bosses have to adapt because their businesses are changing their customers are changing and their employees are changing” said workplace consultant Lindsey Pollak 47 author of “The Remix” a book about the new multigenerational workplace. “They have to keep up with the zeitgeist. If not they can become irrelevant.”

The twin shocks of the long pandemic and the outrage over racial injustice sparked by George Floyd’s killing have redoubled the momentum for leadership to evolve pushing more boomer bosses toward the door. For a generation whose youngest members turned 57 this year COVID-19 forced some to ponder their own mortality — and how much longer they want to work.

Boomer leaders at four of Boston’s legendary teaching hospitals stepped down over the past 14 months. Peter Slavin 63 who retired as president of Massachusetts General Hospital in September said he’d been considering the move before the pandemic but the outbreak of coronavirus was no time to step aside. Now he said he’s ready to start a “second chapter” of his career.

The widespread call for police reforms that followed Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has been especially challenging — and exhausting — for law enforcement leaders. Newton’s police chief David MacDonald 57 was among nearly 100 chiefs across Massachusetts who called it quits during the past year amid street protests and heightened scrutiny in their cities and towns.

“I knew I couldn’t get work done in that environment” MacDonald said. “People in this day and age aren’t satisfied with incremental progress.”

The clamor for change has taken a toll on boomer politicians too. Anger over dysfunction in Washington has fueled the rise of youthful insurgents such as 32-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York who knocked off a boomer member of the House leadership in 2018 and Jon Ossoff 34 who defeated a boomer incumbent in Georgia early this year to flip the Senate to the Democrats.

In Massachusetts former congressman Michael Capuano 69 was favored to win an 11th term in 2018. But the progressive Democrat was tripped up by Ayanna Pressley 47 who ran on the slogan of “change can’t wait” to become the only Black member of the state’s delegation. Capuano said he may no longer be in tune with the electorate.

“I can’t twist myself into a pretzel just to get elected” Capuano said. “I’m not interested in changing enough to do today’s politics. ... It’s other people’s turn and I wish them the best.”

Boomers who hang on to leadership positions have learned to embrace calls for change or are looking at their missions differently. Senator Ed Markey 75 fended off a rival more than three decades his junior by trumpeting his environmental bona fides and striking alliances with young firebrands like Ocasio-Cortez.

Andrew Dreyfus 63 has marbled social activism into his role as chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. The health insurer recently launched a program to pay doctors more if they close persistent gaps in care for people of color. Dreyfus admitted he sometimes hears “impatience and the undercurrent of an accusation” from the young about a mound of unaddressed problems being left for them.

A Boston Globe survey found that boomers continue to hold most of the top posts at some key power centers but their numbers are shrinking. And many of their successors are not only younger but more diverse in their gender racial background and outlook.

Boomers now claim 13 of the CEO positions at the 25 largest public companies in Massachusetts down from 18 five years ago. Nationally the ranks of boomers reigning over the top 100 giants on the Fortune 500 list have tumbled from 82 to 67 in the same span.

A parade of high-profile boomer departures picked up speed locally in recent weeks as John Maraganore 59 CEO of Cambridge biotech Alnylam; Steve Kaufer 58 cofounder of Needham travel website Tripadvisor; Al Sandrock 64 chief medical officer at drugmaker Biogen in Cambridge; and John Van Siclen 65 CEO of Waltham software intelligence firm Dynatrace all announced retirements.

Despite the election of Joe Biden 79 to the presidency last year political leadership is also trending younger — and away from boomers. Before Biden there’d been four consecutive members of the generation born between 1946 and 1964 presiding over the nation.

Boston just elected its first millennial mayor in Michelle Wu 36 the city’s youngest leader in a century and 18 years younger than the last elected mayor Martin J. Walsh. Wu modeled the ambitious and multitasking approach of many younger leaders when she assured election night supporters “We don’t have to choose between generational change and keeping the street lights on.”

In the US House of Representatives the number of boomer members has fallen from 276 to 230 since 2016 while in Massachusetts the number of boomers in Congress dropped from seven to five. The US Senate however has trended toward antiquity with five members over 80 and just one under 40. Its boomer contingent has increased from 62 to 69 in five years. Both of the Massachusetts senators are boomers.

Deciding when and whether to move on can be intensely personal.

“When you’re in that corner office you’re never really off” said Jim Roosevelt 76 who frequently logged 14-hour days during a decade as chief executive of Tufts Health Plan in Watertown before retiring in 2015. “You’re responsible for the business and the livelihood of hundreds of people. Sometimes you get to the point where you’ve done it long enough. And you recognize you can contribute in other ways.”

Helen Drinan 74 delayed her departure as president of Simmons University in Boston for years to rescue the school from financial crisis even as she waged a battle against cancer that she chose to make public. “You can’t be president of one of the few remaining women’s colleges in the United States and just keep this a secret” she said.

After guiding Simmons through the early months of the pandemic she felt it was time to step down in June 2020 — and leave the university in the hands of her successor Lynn Perry Wooten a Black woman 20 years her junior whose expertise is in organizational transformation.

At biotech Vertex in Boston Indian-born doctor Reshma Kewalramani 48 took over as CEO last year replacing 65-year-old Jeff Leiden who still serves as executive chairman. The new chief has been outspoken in her support for diversity within the industry.

“You have to have people who come from different backgrounds” Kewalramani said in a company video. “There’s no way to have this innovative way of thinking solving problems that have never been solved before if everyone is the same.”

The pace of change shows no signs of slowing. The next generational clash may be already unfolding in the office. Some younger employees who’ve come to prize the flexibility of working from home during the pandemic are resisting a return to the office every day meaning older supervisors may oversee a remote workforce indefinitely.

“The boomers are wanting to return to normal but it’s not clear what normal is now” said Basima Tewfik an MIT professor who teaches work and organizations. Many in the younger generations she said are more comfortable with change in their work lives and beyond.

The wisest course for boomer bosses is to lead with empathy be alert to ferment in their organizations and champion inclusiveness and collaboration said veteran executive coach Priscilla Douglas.

Douglas a boomer herself who’s winding down her Somerville firm dislikes the word “retirement.” She stays involved in business and the arts through board service while continuing to advise select clients.

“I do not consider myself retired” she said flatly before a recent gathering of the American Repertory Theater board in Harvard’s Radcliffe Yard. “This phase of my life is all about being ‘re-inspired.’”

An ‘adrenaline-pumping’ late career crisis

Peter Slavin was the face of the COVID-19 response at Massachusetts General Hospital last year conferring regularly with Governor Charlie Baker and spelling out the threat on national television as sick patients piled into intensive care units.

This fall Slavin now a former hospital chief has been spending afternoons at Hanscom Field in Bedford learning to pilot a Cessna.

“You need to look up at the horizon” Slavin’s flight instructor Nate Weinsaft advised him as they sat in the cockpit.

Slavin had little time to consider his next act during his 18 years as Mass. General’s president. He worked to address health disparities and expand the reach of the nation’s largest research hospital while steering it through a series of crises. The last was the most brutal.

In late December 2019 he began hearing worrisome reports. His infectious disease and emergency preparedness teams were tracking “a very contagious and lethal respiratory virus” emerging on the other side of the world he recalled. “They thought it had the potential to become a problem not only in China but more broadly.”

Two months later sick Biogen executives who attended a conference at a Boston hotel were turning up at the Mass. General emergency room asking for COVID-19 tests. “We knew the disease had arrived here in Boston so we needed to swing into action” Slavin said.

Slavin who grew up in Malden and worked at Mass. General for almost his entire career drew on lessons from past crises — the stream of burn victims from the Station nightclub fire in West Warwick R.I. the gravely injured at the Boston Marathon bombing. But the pandemic was unique both in its grinding intensity and its toll on patients and staff alike.

“The adrenaline was pumping” Slavin said. “When the chips were down the people at this hospital responded.”

Before the coronavirus surges had abated a roster of boomer chiefs at Boston’s teaching hospitals — Betsy Nabel 69 at Brigham & Women’s; Sandra Fenwick 71 at Boston Children’s; Michael Apkon 61 at Tufts Medical Center; and Slavin himself — had handed their jobs to younger successors (though some are also boomers). So did medical leaders elsewhere in the state along with scores of front-line doctors and nurses.

Even before the crisis Slavin said he’d contemplated retiring. Now his hospital was in the midst of a $3 billion fund-raising campaign a $1.9 billion building project and a clinical integration with Brigham & Women’s and other hospitals that would bring a loss of autonomy.

While he has supported the consolidation strategy Slavin concluded that a younger hospital president should see that and all of the multiyear projects through to completion.

Slavin delayed announcing his retirement. But his final crisis at the hospital made him realize “that if I was going to have another chapter given the fragility of my life and my own mortality I needed to do it sooner rather than later.”

In politics a generational challenge

Mike Capuano is trying to put his primary defeat behind him and live life at a normal pace. He served 10 terms in Congress representing his home town of Somerville and parts of Boston and Cambridge. Then he was upset by Pressley a Boston city councilor who shared most of his policy views but was able to mobilize younger first-time voters.

Today the ex-congressman who’ll turn 70 in January works half time as a business lobbyist for law firm Foley & Lardner. He’s rebuilt a stairway in his basement puttered on the golf course and spent time with his family at a vacation home near Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire.

“I sit out on my porch and have a glass of wine at the end of the day” he said in an interview. “The pace of my life is much slower and I like it. ... All of a sudden I realized I don’t have to go to every chicken barbecue.”

Capuano said the district he represented for two decades has changed. He acknowledged he’s not in step with today’s identity politics and worries about the nation’s growing polarization. “I know who and what I am” he said. “I consider myself a good solid progressive liberal but I’m not a socialist. ... I didn’t want to be a 70-year-old hippie.”

On Capitol Hill in Washington meanwhile Senator Ed Markey is still racing to meetings negotiating with colleagues on climate change measures. He invited Ocasio-Cortez to lunch in the Senate dining room soon after her election and they cosponsored the Green New Deal that became a centerpiece of Markey’s reelection campaign. The senator said he isn’t interested in scaling back now because “you need a mission.”

Markey who’s kept all his Red Sox ticket stubs from the “Impossible Dream” season can seem like a throwback to an earlier era. But he’s proved to be a remarkably durable politician joining fellow Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders of Vermont in a small den of liberal lions who speak the language of a younger generation.

Acutely aware of that generation’s impatience Markey beat back a 41-year-old challenger former representative Joe Kennedy III in a closely watched primary last year. He did so by appealing to younger voters as a fellow activist and “disrupter” who’s been legislating for decades on the same issues that consume them.

“The tactics might change but the issues that resonate — climate change nuclear nonproliferation and justice — haven’t changed” Markey said. “It’s always been the agenda of young people.”

Many gave Markey long odds against a fresh-faced challenger and a member of the Kennedy dynasty to boot. Markey however said he never saw it that way reminding voters of his days as a mop-haired young congressman railing against the status quo. In the end he benefited from a turnout of young voters — two-thirds of college students cast ballots in 2020 many motivated by issues like climate change and racial justice.

“The experts the pundits the cognoscenti all decided that I couldn’t win because they were using the wrong frame to look at the race” Markey said. “As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said ‘It’s not your age it’s the age of your ideas’ that are important. And in that race I was the youngest guy.”

A police chief ‘second-guessed and scrutinized’

More than four years into David MacDonald’s tenure as Newton’s police chief the shocks hit. First came COVID-19 “the backdrop to everything” he said. Then came the uproar over race and policing.

Things got tense in the spring of 2020 as Newton like cities across the country grappled with Black Lives Matter protests and struggled to come to terms with the reckoning that followed the killing of George Floyd a Black man. MacDonald backed police reforms. He thought Floyd’s murder by a white Minneapolis officer was “unconscionable” saying “people of color get the short end of the stick” too often.

But an incident in Newton that came to light in the weeks after Floyd’s killing engulfed the city’s police — and MacDonald — in controversy. Five officers had stopped a Black resident a former Northeastern deputy athletic director named Tim Duncan at gunpoint while searching for a suspect in a fatal Boston shooting. Duncan spoke publicly about the encounter but it took more than two weeks — and prodding from MacDonald — before police filed their field report.

Detectives apologized to Duncan. Mayor Ruthanne Fuller issued a statement denouncing “systemic racism” in society. “Newton is not immune” she wrote “and the Newton Police Department is not immune.”

MacDonald who grew up in Newton and rose through the ranks after joining the department in 1993 was named police chief in 2015 by Setti Warren the city’s first Black mayor and immediately started building bridges. He created a post of community outreach officer to stay in touch with all parts of the city and brought in students of color from local colleges like Pine Manor and Lasell as department interns.

Now he was being grilled at meetings by council members he saw as “grandstanding” while a citizens group called for defunding his department. One council member citing a move to disband the Camden N.J. police force asked why that couldn’t be done in Newton. MacDonald was dumbstruck; his department handled about 32000 police calls a year and got fewer than a dozen civilian complaints.

MacDonald said city officials who offered words of support in private conversations remained silent when his department was being criticized. “While we were being second-guessed and scrutinized I had nobody publicly coming out and saying anything in my defense” he said.

Soon after Fuller became mayor she canceled preliminary planning for a new police headquarters something MacDonald supported. Then on a Sunday night in June the mayor told him that she was cutting funds out of a line item in the police budget to fund a reform task force.

That was the last straw for MacDonald. Two days later he resigned ending a contract that would have expired at the end of next year. Mayor Fuller said she was surprised when MacDonald gave his notice. But she conceded “this was a very difficult time to be a police chief.”

MacDonald wasn’t alone. Ninety-eight police chiefs in the state have stepped down over the past year more than triple the total in previous years according to the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association. Many like MacDonald are younger boomers who took early retirement.

The former Newton chief now spends much of his time working on projects around the house and helping his mother and in-laws with chores. He said he’s considering his next step whether to return to running a police department or working in some other capacity.

“I have too much training and experience to sit on the sidelines” he said.

For boomer bosses ‘retirement is a transition’

Priscilla Douglas studied organizational behavior at Harvard. She was a White House fellow worked at General Motors with quality guru W. Edward Deming and helped Xerox shift from an analog to a digital business. Then she became an entrepreneur running a successful executive coaching firm in Somerville for the past two decades.

But like many boomer leaders Douglas — who’s also an art lover scuba diver and world traveler — recoils from the traditional idea of retirement. She belts out the line “I’m not dead yet” from Monty Python. While she began scaling back in 2017 she’s retained a corps of smaller clients and serves as a director on nonprofit boards.

Douglas doesn’t give her age explaining that “people discriminate” but she identifies proudly as a boomer. “Retirement is a transition” she said. “The key is the capacity to reinvent and reimagine who you are.”

Born in Cambridge she was raised on a pig farm in Bedford the youngest of six children and the only girl. She tended the vegetable garden and helped with chores while also taking piano and dance lessons and spending hours in the library.

Rather than climb a single ladder Douglas pursued an eclectic career from special assistant to FBI Director William Webster to a Cabinet secretary for consumer affairs under former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld to a Vertex vice president for learning and development.

She brought to each role the perspective of an outsider who could spot opportunities or flaws in policies or strategies. “It has to do with how you see the world” said Douglas. “If you have that [outside] perspective you have the capacity to see things and figure things out that others don’t.”

Ultimately she jumped off the corporate merry-go-round and launched her own firm P.H. Douglas & Associates coaching senior executives at Fortune 500 companies. Her approach was to help clients gain clarity and move forward. “I don’t care what the root of the problem is” she said. “I care about what you want to do” and how to achieve it.

Douglas who divides her time between Somerville and Martha’s Vineyard has been trying to downshift in recent years to allow herself more time to travel overseas.

Her wanderlust took a pause during the pandemic but the lockdown enabled her to finish writing a book “Woke Leadership” published earlier this year. Drawing on lessons from her own career and leaders she’s met along the way Douglas points toward a new era of leadership that is “alert and attending to important issues of social and racial justice.”

Can the boomers create a path to that era? Douglas thinks her generation has left a mixed legacy of greater opportunity and unfinished business. But she believes boomer leaders who are enlightened still have a role to play. “They don’t have to move aside if they’re not old school” she said. “They can share their wisdom and give back.”

BlackRock has prioritized investments in environmentally and socially conscious companies in the U.S. but has continued to pour money into Chinese companies that don't meet those standards Consumers' Research executive director Will Hild told Fox News.

WATCH:

""It's going woke here in the United States … while it's funneling U.S. investment dollars over to China"" Hild said.

Since China is considered a developing economy and the United States is a developed economy Chinese corporations are subject to less strict guidelines on green and equity initiatives putting American companies at a disadvantage according to Hild.

LARRY FINK'S BLACKROCK TO BENEFIT FROM GOVERNMENT ESG PUSH

Consumers’ Research a nonprofit consumers watchdog group recently kicked off a multimillion-dollar campaign that ""highlights the ties between BlackRock and the Chinese government"" according to its website. The campaign will feature television and billboard ads as well as a digital component.

""BlackRock has nearly 10 trillion in management that's made up of pension funds 401(k)s institutional investments like college endowments"" Hild told Fox News.

Out of all the $103 trillion of assets managed in the world BlackRock manages close to 10%. That's more than Apple Alphabet Amazon Saudi Aramco and Microsoft combined.

""BlackRock treats U.S. corporations completely differently than it treats their Chinese companies and the investments that they make over there"" Hild said.

Democratic mega-donor George Soros recently wrote a similar message in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.

""Pouring billions of dollars into China now is a tragic mistake"" Soros wrote. ""It is likely to lose money for BlackRock’s clients and more important will damage the national security interests of the U.S. and other democracies.""

BlackRock Investment Institute's chief investment strategist Wei Li told the Financial Times in August: ""China is under-represented in global investors’ portfolios.""

""It should be represented more in portfolios"" she said. The institute also recommended increasing allocation to Chinese assets.

""The Chinese market represents a significant opportunity to help meet the long-term goals of investors in China and internationally"" BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter.

The BlackRock China Fund which BlackRock uses to invest in Chinese holdings is valued at around $1.6 billion.

As recently as the past two years BlackRock has invested in Chinese companies that the Commerce Department blacklisted over human rights concerns.

BlackRock holds a $15 million stake in Hikvision and a smaller investment in iFlytek FOX Business previously reported. Both are implicated in China’s persecution of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region. Hikvision is one of the largest surveillance technology manufacturers in the world and iFlytek produces vocal recognition software.

""These are companies that were put on a blacklist by the United States government in 2019 … and yet BlackRock sees them as a good investment"" Hild told Fox News.

The joint outlay will more than quadruple Ionity’s high-power charging points in Europe to at least 7000 by 2025 the group said in a statement Wednesday. The company didn’t specify the spending split between BlackRock and different carmakers.

BlackRock’s Global Renewable Power platform will be the first non-automotive member of the consortium. Ionity which also includes Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz was set up in 2017 to help alleviate concerns over driving longer distances with electric vehicles.

The company currently operates more than 1500 fast-charging points with 350 kilowatt-hour capacity along European highways. The new investment will help extend the network to building stations near major cities and busy trunk roads as well as improve the charging experience Ionity said.

The investment which also includes contributions from existing shareholders will enable Ionity to more than quadruple the number of high-power 350 kilowatt charging points to 7000 by 2025 Ionity said on Wednesday.

Ionity did not provide a detailed breakdown of the funding round in which existing investors Volkswagen Daimler BMW Ford and Hyundai also participated.

BlackRock's investment in Ionity makes it the venture's first shareholder from outside the automotive industry highlighting the growing interest in the EV sector

""Ionity really stood apart in terms of the maturity of the business and the sophistication of the existing partnerships"" David Giordano Global Head of Renewable Power at BlackRock told Reuters.

Founded in 2017 to accelerate the installation of charging stations along European motorways Ionity now operates more than 1500 charging points in 24 countries.

BlackRock's investment in Ionity makes it the venture's first shareholder from outside the automotive industry highlighting the growing interest in the EV sector which not only covers production of cars but also vital infrastructure.

""It's the coupling of the energy and mobility sector in particular that makes it an attractive asset"" Ionity CEO Michael Hajesch said.

He said that Ionity was likely to seek additional manufacturers for its hardware which is so far mainly being built by ABB and Australia's Tritium as part of the expansion plan.

Asked whether Ionity would pursue an initial public offering (IPO) or a deal with a special acquisition purpose company (SPAC) in its next growth phase Hajesch said this was difficult to predict due to the market's dynamic development.

The new company is backed by an endowment of AED100-million.

KUEC will include ‘Innovation Acceleration and Startups’ and ‘KU Ventures’ which will support establishing and operating non-IP technology companies. KUEC also includes the Endowment Fund that will allocate funds for investments and operations.

The mission of KUEC is to boost and speed up business engagement with the University to accelerate innovation and create impact on the University's scientific research assets and resources. Furthermore KUEC will also aim to encourage technology investors and entrepreneurs to partner with the University to commercialize its growing patent portfolio in areas such as energy advanced manufacturing health artificial intelligence and robotics through creation of technology startups.

Established and structured in consultation with three partners KUEC will leverage the support of the leading asset manager BlackRock and global financial services leader JPMorgan. On the innovation side Techstars will play a pivotal role in growth and scaling of UAE startups.

BlackRock will invest the endowment assets on behalf of KUEC in a diversified global portfolio while J.P. Morgan will provide custodial services to KUEC supporting the asset management part of the endowment. Techstars will focus on reviewing Khalifa University’s patents conducting research to identify commercial suitability and viability as well as in market assessment and validation that will then lead to development of prototypes and use cases.

KUEC will work in collaboration and partnership with Khalifa University’s Technology Management and Innovation Office to help generate commercial outputs of University intellectual property and introduce university spin-outs to the market. Similarly KUEC will work with the University’s Finance and Business Development Office to ensure external partners and entities benefit from university resources and assets.

Dr. Arif Sultan Al Hammadi Executive Vice-President Khalifa University said: “The Khalifa University Enterprises Company will usher in a new research-education-economy ecosystem paradigm in Abu Dhabi the UAE and the region. In line with the best practices of some of the globally high-ranked universities which have similar companies to maximize their economic development mission we have launched this new entity not only to work within our mandate and benefit the country and the region but most importantly to realize the vision of our leaders in creating a knowledge-based economy. The intellectual innovation and financial revenue coming out of KUEC will advance and enhance the University’s mission in research and innovation.”

Paschalis Bouchoris Managing Director Country Head for BlackRock in Dubai said: “We are delighted to be able to support the university with this endowment. The commitment to supporting innovation and entrepreneurship will inevitably benefit not just the students but also the broader economy. We thoroughly look forward to watching the endowment flourish.”

Bouchoris’ responsibilities include BlackRock's business operations strategy and senior client relationships across the Middle East (ex-Saudi) region. In his previous role at BlackRock since May 2015 he led the activity of Financial Market Advisory (FMA) in Southeastern Europe and Middle East and served as a senior oversight in multiple client engagements with financial and official institutions focusing on risk management and policy advisory capital markets asset valuations and transactions.

""J.P. Morgan has been providing custodial services to some of the most prestigious University endowments and foundations for many years and we are delighted that the Khalifa University Enterprise Company has selected us to partner with them for this important initiative."" – Timothy Peters head of Securities Services CEEMEA at J.P. Morgan.

""Techstars' global reach coupled with our passion of supporting the development of entrepreneurs provides a highly engaged experience to unlock their entrepreneurial potential as we support these teams through validating and invalidating their theories to launch new ventures for growth"" said Esther Lim Director of Engagement for Techstars.

Leading global universities have played a vital role in translating intellectual property into successful business ventures. According to PitchBook a research and technology company covering private capital markets between 2006 and 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) produced 907 company founders as alumni or current students creating 780 companies – the third most among all universities in the world. An earlier MIT study in 2015 reported that 30000 companies founded by MIT alumni were active as of 2014 employing 4.6 million people and producing annual revenues of US$1.9 trillion equivalent to the world’s 10th largest economy.

The newly launched Khalifa University Enterprises Company is expected to work along similar lines encouraging innovation and stimulating the creation of technology startups while further motivating students and alumni to explore entrepreneurship based on university research outputs."

US private equity giant Blackstone which owns the majority of Butlin’s parent company Bourne Leisure is understood to have already selected investment bankers to conduct an auction next year.

It comes as the travel industry reacts to the impact of the new Omicron Covid-19 variant which could trigger a fresh wave of demand for UK holidays that do not involve the costly PCR tests paperwork and a potential requirement to self-isolate upon return from abroad.

Butlin’s was established 85 years ago by Billy Butlin who had visited Barry Island in Wales and “felt sorry for families staying in drab guest houses with nothing much to do”.

Butlin set up his first park in Skegness Lincolnshire in 1936 with the aim of creating a new type of seaside break which would provide a range of activities and entertainment. That resort still trades today along with two others at Bognor Regis in West Sussex and Minehead in Somerset. At one point there were nine camps seven hotels and even a Butlin’s in the Bahamas. A camp on Barry Island opened in 1966 but closed 30 years later.

For decades Butlin’s was famous – or notorious - for competitions to find the holidaymaker with the knobbliest knees or most glamorous grandmothers. It struggled with a downmarket image and was widely lampooned.

However in recent years it has been trying to position itself as a rival to the likes of Center Parcs with millions of pounds invested in new features such as pool complexes and improved accommodation alongside moves into new markets such as live music weekends for fans and a bigger push into conferences and events.

The decision to look at selling off Butlin’s comes less than a year after a majority stake in Bourne Leisure which also owns Warner Leisure Hotels and Haven Holidays was acquired by Blackstone for about £3bn.

It is thought that Bourne Leisure and Blackstone have concluded that Butlin’s is “non-core” to their future objectives. Some analysts had predicted the move for some time.

Bourne Leisure’s accounts for 2020 show the firm slumped to a £151m pre-tax loss compared with a profit of £145m in 2019. The accounts stated: “The group like many others has been affected by the impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on the UK’s economy mainly through the short-term closures of some of our sites.”

The three resorts reopened their doors in May this year and Butlin’s recently announced that its summer 2022 lineup would include the likes of dance group Diversity.

The company’s accounts also said that during 2020 it refunded site fees to its owners during the lockdowns and offered its holidaymakers cash refunds for any cancelled breaks.

It is thought that investment bank Rothschild has been retained by Bourne Leisure and Blackstone to oversee the sale which could prompt bids from rivals in the leisure sector.

Bourne Leisure and Blackstone both declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2hvbGlkYXktY2FtcC1jaGFpbi1idXRsaW5zLXRvLWJlLXB1dC11cC1mb3Itc2FsZS1hcy1zdGF5Y2F0aW9ucy1ib29tLTEyNDgwMDU50gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnNreS5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1wL2hvbGlkYXktY2FtcC1jaGFpbi1idXRsaW5zLXRvLWJlLXB1dC11cC1mb3Itc2FsZS1hcy1zdGF5Y2F0aW9ucy1ib29tLTEyNDgwMDU5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Holiday camp chain Butlin's to be put up for sale as staycations boom,"The owner of Butlin's is preparing to put it up for sale amid a boom in British staycations sparking a potential bidding frenzy for the country's best-known chain of holiday camps.

Sky News has learnt that Bourne Leisure which also owns Haven and Warner Leisure Hotels recently picked investment bankers to conduct an auction of Butlin's next year.

The move comes less than 12 months since privately owned Bourne Leisure sold a majority stake to Blackstone the private equity giant in a deal valuing the group at about £3bn.

Butlin's likely valuation in a sale was unclear this weekend but bankers and private equity investors said there would be ""a deluge"" of interest in acquiring the brand and its three sites.

The chain was established in 1936 by Billy Butlin who - according to its official history - ""felt sorry for families staying in drab guest-houses with nothing much to do"" during a trip to Barry Island.

He acquired a plot of land in Skegness Lincolnshire and opened the first eponymous resort which is among the three that still trade today.

In its heyday Butlin's operated from nine sites across the UK entertaining a million holidaymakers each year with knobbly knees competitions and glamorous granny contests.

Hundreds of staff across its resorts became known as Redcoats.

The brand became such an entrenched part of Britain's popular consciousness that it provided the inspiration for Hi-de-Hi! the long-running BBC sitcom.

Its fortunes waned with the explosive growth of opportunities for Britons to holiday abroad but has enjoyed something of a resurgence in recent times.

Butlin's other sites today are at Minehead in Somerset and Bognor Regis the traditional seaside town close to the South Downs National Park.

The pandemic has triggered rapid growth in the number of staycations paving the way for a string of deals in the sector.

Earlier this month Sun Communities a New York-listed real estate investment trust paid £950m for Park Holidays substantially exceeding its owners' initial price expectations.

The Canadian owner of Parkdean Resorts a bigger rival to Park Holidays by number of sites has instructed bankers at Morgan Stanley to prepare a review of options that most observers expect to result in a sale next year.

Other recent deals in the sector have included the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners buying Away Resorts - the owner of well-known holiday parks such as Whitecliff Bay on the Isle of Wight and Sandy Balls in the New Forest.

CVC subsequently combined Away Resorts with Aria another operator.

Bourne Leisure which is run by chief executive Paul Flaum is said to have decided that Butlin's is sub-scale and therefore non-core to its growth plans.

Rothschild is understood to have been retained by Blackstone and Bourne to oversee the Butlin's sale.

The sector's other big players are expected to explore offers for Butlin's although it may end up being sold on a standalone basis to a financial buyer.

The latest funding comes on the heels of a $160 million round in August that boosted the company's valuation to $890 million according to investor website PitchBook. Ample is now valued at more than $1 billion according to a source familiar with the financing.

The seven-year-old company has raised more than $275 million from a deep roster of investors including the venture arms of global energy companies Royal Dutch Shell Repsol and Eneos according to PitchBook. The latest round was joined by Banco Santander.

Ample operates automated swapping stations which it says can replace a depleted battery with a fully charged one in less than 10 minutes

Ample has partnered with ride services company Uber offering battery swapping services initially to Uber drivers in California with plans to expand the partnership to Europe. It also is entering the Japanese market in partnership with Eneos.

Ample operates automated swapping stations which it says can replace a depleted battery with a fully charged one in less than 10 minutes -- far less time than it takes the typical EV battery pack to recharge.

The battery swapping concept is not new. Although Tesla Inc initially tested then withdrew a plan to offer battery swapping to customers EV maker Nio Inc lets customers swap batteries at more than 200 locations in China. Honda Motor Co has partnered with Yamaha Motor Co Ltd and scooter maker Piaggio to develop swappable batteries for light electric vehicles."

The Boeing CST-100 Starliner toy block building set by the Polish toymaker Cobi is 19% off on Amazon right now down to $22.80 from its usual price of $27.99.

With accent stickers and several movable parts this replica looks pretty authentic. (However the toy features only five seats while the real Starliner spacecraft is made to seat up to seven passengers.) The building set comes with 227 blocks as well as two astronaut minifigures clad in realistic blue Boeing flight suits.

Cobi Boeing CST-100 Starliner: $27.99 $22.80 at Amazon Save 19% on this Starliner building set for Cyber Monday! The 227-piece building block set comes with two astronaut minifigures.

The two included minifigures appear to be (loosely) based on Boeing astronaut Chris Ferguson and NASA astronaut Sunita Williams who had been assigned to fly on the first and second crewed Starliner missions respectively at the time this set was released. (Cobi has not specified or confirmed this detail however and Ferguson has since withdrawn from his Starliner mission.)

Not included in Cobi's Starliner building set is the European service module which will provide the power and propulsion elements for the capsule or the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket that is set to launch the capsule into space.

Boeing's first uncrewed Starliner mission failed to reach the International Space Station with its debut uncrewed test flight in 2019 and the company is now targeting to launch its second attempt a mission called Orbital Flight Test 2 sometime in the first half of 2022.

Fast forward to 2021 and there is a raft of new startup airlines that offer new business models and in some cases improvements like refined booking paths — but with seats and cabins that feel like they bought them straight out of the Blah Airlines catalogue.

Given the crushing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation however perhaps we should call these carriers the “clean slate startups”. After all when you launch with a bare bones cabin interior the only way is up.

Avelo

Avelo’s model seems to be “Allegiant but with 737s”: flights from Burbank to airports that you’d need to look up (MFR FNL and PSC anyone?) and from its East Coast base in New Haven to Floridian snowbird destinations.

The livery is fresh enough and the “refreshingly smooth” tagline and reasons to fly Avelo are fine (if a little cringe when it comes to the “soul of service”) and its clear simple booking path and options selection are to be praised.

Onboard Avelo’s 737s have disparate interiors with a variety of seats. RGN contributor Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren experienced some very thick pre-slimline seats (at 29” ouch) while some aircraft have slimlines which appear to be Acro Series 6.

Welcome onboard! AVELO’S 737-800s are made up of 189 seats making it one of the denser 737s out there yet somehow legroom feels plentiful. pic.twitter.com/hWbeUJqhbJ — Emiliano Padilla (@iTripReport) April 28 2021

Regardless of seat the cabin is just blue-and-greige front to back.

Breeze

David Neeleman’s latest airline Breeze Airways with its blue-on-blue livery looked to be a breath of fresh air as it opened up its “network of nonstop routes between underserved destinations in the US”.

The airline launched with ex-Azul Embraer E190s though where the passenger experience is grey-on-beige which RGN contributor Jason Rabinowitz describes as “surprisingly muted”.

But there are signs that Breeze will pick up at least in the cabin stakes: it is the launch customer for new seats from Safran the Z110i economy class and Z600 business class recliner on its forthcoming Airbus A220s.

Play

The successor to Iceland’s whimsical WOW Air is Play which looks — externally at least — as wacky and red as WOW was wacky and purple.

Indeed with bright red pantsuit-sneaker-tshirt uniforms one might have expected something exciting when it comes to the interiors.

But inside it’s just grey-on-grey-on-grey nose to tail. With the WOW DNA that can’t help but feel a bit disappointing.

The one bright spot is its menu which features some local Icelandic treats like Egils Appelsín orange soda and a variety of liquorices.

aha!

A new entrant to the “much more exciting as a brand than as actual #PaxEx” club is ExpressJet’s new aha! airline operating from Reno to a set of secondary cities in California Oregon and Washington.

ExpressJet’s tiny Embraer 145 regional jets aren’t exactly renowned for their passenger experience and the real-world experience doesn’t yet show any visible improvements.

At what point does onboard #PaxEx start to matter?

In fairness if you’re flying from Eureka/Arcata or Bend/Redmond to Burbank or Reno you’re probably grateful for a nonstop to the LA area. If you’re flying from New Haven to Florida you’re happy not to have to schlep to New York. And if you’re in Iceland over winter and can get a cheap flight to Spanish sunshine destinations you may not mind what the plane taking you to some much-needed vitamin D looks like as you munch your liquorice.

And that’s the rub: there’s a point at which passenger experience starts to matter when it comes to choosing flights. With so much consolidation over the last twenty years especially in the US it seems like all new entrants have to do is offer convenience to get their foot in the door.

These past couple of years have been difficult for the movie industry but Tom Cruise kept working throughout  even during strict restrictions that forced most of his peers to some time off. He recently wrapped the seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise and as announced a while back he’s marching through with the eighth. That the movies will shoot back to back was never a secret.If you’re a fan of Cruise’s work or you simply assumed Cruise had already given the seventh film his best in terms of physical stunts this one is for you. Earlier this week the actor was spotted at Duxford Airfield in Cambridge UK where he took off in a Boeing biplane. Once at 2000 feet (610 meters) high he let himself dangle off the wing while a production crew in another aircraft shot footage.That plane is the same 1941 Boeing B75N1 Stearman biplane Cruise was seen flying in a while back no doubt in preparation for this daredevil stunt. The embedded tweet from Fox News below has more photos of it: at points Cruise was hanging upside down on the wing while at another the aircraft flipped and he was sitting upright on the wing almost casual-like.For safety reasons (duh) Cruise was secured to the aircraft with a harness. This doesn’t take anything from his accomplishment or the fact that he remains the one actor in Hollywood who’s bold enough to risk it all for a convincing stunt. Or reckless enough it’s a matter of perspective.As for the story behind this new aircraft stunt  it will be another while until we get it. As of the time of press Mission: Impossible 7 is coming out in theaters in September 2022 while the eighth movie won’t be out until July 2023."

As a nutritional psychiatrist faculty member at Harvard Medical School and author of ""This Is Your Brain on Food"" I study how our gut bacteria can trigger metabolic processes and brain inflammation that impact memory. Existing studies point to the idea that we may be able to reduce the possibility of dementia by avoiding foods that can compromise our gut bacteria and weaken our memory and focus. Here are the foods I try to avoid or cut back on to fight inflammation and promote brain health sharp thinking and good decision-making:

1. Added sugars

Photo: Berntsen | Twenty20

The brain uses energy in the form of glucose a form of sugar to fuel cellular activities. However a high-sugar diet can lead to excess glucose in the brain which studies have linked to memory impairments and less plasticity of the hippocampus — the part of the brain controlling memory. Consuming unhealthy processed foods like baked goods and soda which are often loaded with refined and added sugars — often in the form of high-fructose corn syrup — floods the brain with too much glucose. Although each body has different needs the American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than 25 grams of added sugar per day and men stay under 36 grams added sugar per day. (To figure out if a packaged food contains added sugars and how much check the ""added sugars"" line in the Nutrition Facts panel.)

2. Fried foods

French fries tempura samosas fish and chips and chicken-fried steak. Is your mouth watering? I get it. Still when it comes to brain health it pays to reduce the amount of fried foods you eat. In fact one study including 18080 people found that a diet high in fried foods was linked to lower scores in learning and memory. The likely reason: These guilty pleasures cause inflammation which can damage the blood vessels that supply the brain with blood. Another study looked at 715 people and measured their levels of depression and mental resilience. It also documented their level of fried food consumption. Sure enough researchers found that those who consumed more fried foods were more likely to develop depression in their lifetime. If you're eating fried foods daily switch to weekly. If it's a weekly habit try enjoying them just once a month. If you don't eat fried foods you're already on your way to happier times!

3. High-glycemic-load carbohydrates

Even if high-carbohydrate foods — for example bread pasta and anything else made from refined flour — don't taste sweet your body still processes them in much the same way it does with sugar. That means they can also raise your risk for depression. Don't panic I'm not going to suggest eliminating carbs from your diet completely! But the quality of the carbs you eat matters. In 2018 researchers sought to evaluate which particular carbohydrates if any had an association with depression. They administered a questionnaire called the ""carbohydrate-quality index"" to 15546 participants. ""Better-quality"" carbohydrates were defined as whole grains foods high in fiber and those ranked low on the glycemic index (GI). The GI is a measure of how quickly foods convert to glucose when broken down during digestion; the faster a food turns into glucose in the body the higher its GI ranking. Researchers discovered that people who had the highest score on the carbohydrate-quality index meaning they were eating better-quality carbs were 30% less likely to develop depression than those who were eating high-GI carbs. High-GI carbs include potatoes white bread and white rice. Honey orange juice and whole-meal breads are medium-GI foods. Low-GI foods include green vegetables most fruits raw carrots kidney beans chickpeas and lentils.

4. Alcohol

I often encounter people in my practice who live stressful lives. The ""work hard play hard"" mindset often leads to heavy drinking on weekends as a way to relieve stress. While drinking might make them relax in the moment they pay for it the next morning when they wake up jittery with brain fog. Archana Singh-Manoux a research professor and director at the French Institute of Health and Medical Research and her colleagues followed 9087 people over 23 years to see how alcohol related to the incidence of dementia. In 2018 in the British Medical Journal they reported that people who had abstained from alcohol completely or who consumed more than 14 drinks per week had a higher risk of dementia compared to those who drank alcohol in moderation. In general men who consume more than 14 drinks per week or more than four drinks in a single day at least once a month are considered to be heavy drinkers as are women who drink more than seven drinks per week or three drinks per day. But different people (and their brains) respond differently to alcohol abuse. When I work with anxious patients who drink I always ask them to consider the contexts in which they might be using alcohol in an unhealthy way — for instance using drinking as a means of coping with something they are trying to avoid — and to consider moderating the amount they drink.

185 seniors and 62 juniors were elected to the University’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa this spring according to Stephen Merriam Foley associate professor of English and comparative literature and the secretary of the University’s chapter.

Click to jump to the list of elected juniors or seniors.

Phi Beta Kappa according to Foley is the nation’s “oldest and most prestigious academic honors organization.”

Founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary “Phi Beta Kappa seeks to encourage intellectual distinction among undergraduates by recognizing academic excellence in the course of a broad liberal education” reads a press release announcing the elected students.

According to Foley only 10% of higher education institutions in the U.S. have Phi Beta Kappa chapters. Established in 1830 Brown’s chapter is the sixth oldest in the country.

Students are selected through a “highly selective merit-based invitation process” that aims to honor “the best and brightest liberal arts and sciences undergraduates” according to the honor society’s website.

At Brown the top 12% of students in any graduating year will be elected to Phi Beta Kappa Foley wrote in the press release. 3% of these students are elected during their junior year while the remaining 9% are elected as graduating seniors.

Until 2022 only the top 10% of students in each class were elected to Phi Beta Kappa The Herald previously reported. The chapter expanded the society in hopes of making elections more inclusive and “reflective of the student body at Brown” Richard Rambuss professor of English and chapter president told The Herald at the time.

Students were notified of their election to the society in an email sent on March 31. Some students like Owen Lockwood ’25 had not heard of the society until receiving the email. “I did not know what (Phi Beta Kappa) was but after looking it up and consulting with my parents I was moderately happy about it” Lockwood wrote in an email to The Herald.

“I feel that there aren’t many opportunities to be recognized for your academic record at Brown so I was happy to receive some type of academic honors” Larisa Esposito ’24 who was inducted to Phi Beta Kappa last month wrote in an email to The Herald.

In addition to Phi Beta Kappa “I appreciate that Brown offers other types of recognition for students who have excelled in other ways like doing research or getting involved in the broader community” Esposito added. “Making distinctions among students based on academic performance alone is becoming an outdated measure.”

In order to qualify for Phi Beta Kappa at least 40% of a candidate’s course work must take place in the arts humanities social sciences cognitive linguistic & psychological sciences or public health The Herald previously reported.

Esposito appreciated this approach as “receiving a well-rounded education with the opportunity to explore multiple departments is what attracted” her to Brown she wrote.

In previous years students who were elected to Phi Beta Kappa were required to pay a one-time $85 membership fee to officially join the society. But this year this membership fee was waived to all students by “a partnership between the Rhode Island Alpha of Phi Beta Kappa and the College” according to an email sent out to elected students.

“Given that the membership fee was waived for students who were elected this year I didn't see a reason not to join” Esposito added.

“I think Phi Beta Kappa is useful as a sign of academic achievement on a resume and I am hoping that it connects me with a community of other college students and alumni in the future” Esposito wrote.

Those elected from the class of 2024 are as follows:

That infamous philosophy entered the world after Poirier repeatedly tried guillotine chokes against Benoit Saint Denis at UFC 299 against the advice of his coaches who could be heard in his corner telling him “no more guillotines” after the first round. Poirier has a nasty guillotine choke and he never hesitates to use it even if the move almost always ends with him in a bad position after his opponent slips free from the submission.

It turns out cameras actually missed the rest of the interaction between Poirier and his head coach Mike Brown at UFC 299 which is where he told the Louisiana native to stop looking for that same submission.

“They actually didn’t play it in between the rounds after the first round I said ‘No more guillotines’ and then they switched to the other corner” Brown told MMA Fighting. “But right after I said that Dustin said ‘No but I can hit it! I can hit it!’ I just replied ‘You crazy bastard.’

“I literally said that and then he went and jumped another one. They didn’t play that part but there was more words said after I said don’t jump the guillotine.”

Poirier ultimately beat Saint Denis by knockout but he’s been rather adamant that a failed guillotine attempt won’t stop him from going for the choke again in the future.

Despite never finishing a fight with a guillotine Brown knows Poirier is effective with the technique because he’s witnessed it in the gym hundreds of times over the years.

“He puts a lot of guys to sleep in the gym to be honest” Brown said. “He does have a very good one. He just hasn’t hit them in the fight.”

While his instructions to stop going for guillotine chokes got a lot of attention around the Saint Denis fight Brown admits that Poirier’s love of the submission actually got a bigger reaction out of him during a different matchup a couple of years ago.

“The fight where I was losing my mind is the fight with [Dan] Hooker” Brown said. “Because he had lost the first two rounds and then he was battling back and then he was jumping guillotine in those later rounds and had he got stuck on bottom in any one of those rounds he would have lost the third round and wouldn’t have won the decision.

“But somehow he wouldn’t hit the guillotine but he would somehow scramble to get back to his feet and start dropping bombs on him and doing damage and then somehow stealing the round anyway. He would somehow find a way to make it work. He made us sweat and bite our nails in that one that’s for sure.”

Poirier’s next chance to land a guillotine choke comes at UFC 302 on June 1 when he faces reigning lightweight champion Islam Makhachev in the main event.

Back in 2019 when he faced then-champion Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 242 Poirier famously went for his guillotine choke — and for a moment looked as if he might become the first person to hand the undefeated Russian a loss. It wasn’t meant to be however as Nurmagomedov escaped and used his top position to rain down punishment on Poirier before eventually securing a rear-naked choke submission of his own to finish the fight.

Now five years later Poirier faces Nurmagomedov’s protege Makhachev and Brown admits it would be rather poetic if a guillotine ends up winning him the UFC lightweight title.

“It absolutely could happen” Brown said. “He’s done so much in the sport. I almost feel like he doesn’t have anything more to prove but this is the one box he has to check. I feel like he’s a champion even though he hasn’t won a title a true UFC title. He’s won the interim. I feel like he’s a champion in my eyes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starving brown pelicans overwhelm bird rescue facility in Fairfield,"FAIRFIELD -- A wildlife crisis is playing out in the Bay Area and along the California coast. Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

The center says any pelican found acting strangely should be reported immediately to local animal control.

Actress Yvette Nicole Brown 52 and her fiancé Anthony Davis found love with each other when they weren’t looking. The couple who announced their engagement in December 2023 discussed their relationship and upcoming wedding on Getting Grilled with Curtis Stone. During the interview Brown encouraged women who are waiting for partners not to settle.

“To be my age to be single as long as I was single and to have waited — you know I didn’t just grab a guy I waited until I found the guy my heart loves that’s a testimony and that’s also aspirational and inspirational to women that are in my position” Brown told Stone during their chat.

She continued “I would love for a 40-something or a 50-something woman to see this story and go ‘Okay it’s right for me to wait for the right one or to not just marry whoever asks me first if I don’t feel it.’ It is still possible.”

While the actress is open to sharing her story she still wants to be intentional about retaining a level of privacy.

“So now I’m trying to thread the needle about how much do I share to encourage people without giving away what is special and important to me?” Brown asked.

The couple met initially when they were in their 20s while in an acting class at church and reconnected in recent years. Brown said she wasn’t actively looking for love but clearly love was looking for her. They were platonic friends and then things blossomed organically according to the actress.

“In life sometimes things happen and you think ‘Okay I’m done with dating. I’m not gonna deal with this anymore’ and then in comes somebody who’s pumping your heart helping you breathe and you don’t even realize it” she said.

During the interview Davis said friendship continues to be the foundation of their loving relationship. When they pivoted to talks about their upcoming wedding Brown admitted that she no longer fantasizes about an idyllic white wedding. Therefore she’s going into wedding planning a bit blind.

“I’m of a certain age and had stopped dreaming of weddings and you know I’m not one of those girls who has a vision board of ‘This is my dress.’ I did that in my 20s it didn’t happen. I was done” she said. “It’s been 30 years since I dreamed about a wedding or where I was gonna hold it or whatever so I’m clueless.”

Davis is similarly not stressing about the wedding and said he’d marry Brown whether it be “at the justice of the peace” or a fancy “vineyard.” He had one catch however when it came to the bride.

“It has to be you.”"

Poker rooms are becoming nearly as rare in Las Vegas as keno lounges 3-to-2 blackjack and escorts willing to work on credit.

The closure of Flamingo’s poker room was supposed to be temporary as additional dealers were needed for the World Series of Poker held at Rio.

Alas Flamingo’s fate had already been sealed. Management waited until the last possible minute to inform staff the Flamingo’s room was going the way of Faro.

Which you may not have even known was a thing in Las Vegas casinos until this sentence. Here’s more.

On the bright side the dealers from Flamingo’s poker room will largely be absorbed by other Caesars Entertainment poker rooms at Caesars Palace and Bally’s.

Rio Linq and Planet Hollywood have all seen their poker rooms close recently and that’s just in the Caesars Entertainment family.

Even the iconic poker room at Binion’s (home of the original World Series of Poker) moved then closed. It’s unknown if it will return.

While some mistakenly believe these poker rooms are closing due to COVID a more accurate assessment would be they’re closing under the cover of COVID.

Poker rooms have a very small margin and since most don’t make casinos significant amounts of money they’re more of an amenity for guests like sportsbooks and beauty salons.

Oh and buffets another increasingly rare casino amenity. Casinos used the pandemic to dump them as most lose money. Caesars Entertainment says its buffets lose an average of $3 million a year.

As with keno lounges casinos are filling up the valuable real estate formerly occupied by poker rooms with slot machines.

The number of poker tables in Las Vegas decreased a whopping 33% between January 2020 and January 2021. Back in 2010 Vegas had about 1000 tables.

While Caesars Entertainment nixed the poker room at Flamingo it’s not going away entirely at the company’s Las Vegas resorts.

It was recently confirmed the World Series of Poker will move to Paris and Bally’s in 2022.

By then it’s expected Bally’s will be rebranded Horseshoe. (Bally’s Corp. recently purchased Tropicana and a rebrand could be in the offing.)

Poker is still very much a thing in Las Vegas. This year’s WSOP Main Event drew 6650 players. That’s off from the tournament’s peak in 2006 (8773) but still a respectable turnout.

Poker enthusiasts continue to have a number of rooms to get their flop fix in Las Vegas of course.

Resorts World is the newest poker room on The Strip and poker rooms can also be found at Westgate Wynn Aria and Bellagio.

Poker is unlike other games in a casino as players compete against each other not the house. (The casino takes “rake” or percentage of each pot to help keep the lights on.)

Poker has its own lingo customs and superstitions.

Poker players are also some of the most colorful characters you’ll see in any casino. Related: The vast majority of poker players are male—fewer than 5% of WSOP Main Event competitors are female.

We can’t think of a way to elegantly end this story so we’ll just keep cranking out poker trivia until our carpal tunnel kicks in.

A pair of aces in poker is called “pocket rockets.”

The first poker tournament ever televised was in 1973 on CBS.

A pair of 9s in poker is called a “German virgin.” (It sounds like “Nein nein.” We told you poker is mostly men.)

You have a 0.00015% chance of being dealt a royal flush or roughly the same as your odds of hooking up with Ariana Grande.

A legendary poker player Doyle Brunson once said “Poker is war. People pretend it is a game.”

Wow we had no idea how quickly we would fatigue sharing poker trivia.

Anyway the Flamingo poker room is closed.

The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement figures show the casinos posted a collective gross operating profit of more than $310 million in July August and September of this year.

That is more than twice the $151 million profit they reported in the third quarter of 2020 when they were still operating under state-imposed capacity restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic.

For that reason James Plousis chair of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission said the results are not directly comparable.

Instead he compared them to the third quarter of 2019 before the pandemic hit and found the casinos did nearly 30% better in the third quarter of this year.

""Through efficiencies every operator posted a profit in the third quarter a great accomplishment coming out of an extremely challenging period"" he said in a statement. ""Atlantic City's recovery is gaining momentum and is on track for an impressive year. The properties are to be commended for how they handled this challenge both for their customers and employees and are now rebounding from it.""

Gross operating profit reflects earnings before interest taxes depreciation and other expenses and is a widely accepted measure of profitability in the Atlantic City casino industry.

The Borgata had the highest operating profit at $57.2 million up from $2.3 million a year earlier. Tropicana's profit was $48 million up from $18.2 million; Hard Rock had a $46 million profit up from nearly $21 million; Harrah's had a profit of nearly $44 million up from $19.3 million; and the Ocean casino had a $37 million profit up from $24 million.

Caesars had a $27.6 million profit up from $17.5 million; Resorts had a $16.1 million profit up from $7.7 million; and Golden Nugget had a $14.3 million profit up from $7 million.

Bally's posted a $2 million operating profit in the third quarter of this year compared with a $13 million profit last year when it was still owned by Caesars Entertainment. The casino is now owned by Rhode Island-based Bally's Corp.

""We are pleased that the north end of the Atlantic City Boardwalk -- 'North Beach' -- continues to lead the market with Hard Rock Atlantic City Ocean Casino Resort and Resorts showing the majority of the increase in comparison to 2019"" said Joe Lupo Hard Rock's president. ""This positive growth shows the importance of investing in the city and that working collaboratively together can have a positive impact in our community.""

Among internet-only entities Golden Nugget Online Gaming had a profit of just over $9 million down from $9.4 million a year earlier. Caesars Interactive Entertainment New Jersey had a profit of nearly $5 million up from $4.8 million and Resorts Digital's profit was $3.8 million down from $6 million in the third quarter last year.

In terms of hotel occupancy Ocean had the highest average room price at $331 while Resorts had the least expensive at nearly $148.

Ocean and Hard Rock had the highest occupancy rate for the quarter at more than 96%; Caesars was over 93% full. Golden Nugget had the lowest occupancy rate at 64%.

The occupancy rate for the city's nine casinos as a whole was just over 81%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9ub3YvMjgvYmFjay1pbi10aGUtc2FkZGxlLWFmdGVyLWEteWVhci1hd2F5LXJvZGVvLXJldHVybnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Back in the saddle: After a year away rodeo returns to Las Vegas,"Back in the saddle: After a year away rodeo returns to Las Vegas

After a remarkable 35-year ride Las Vegas was bucked from hosting the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

But just like a cowboy thrown from the back of a bucking bronco the city has dusted itself off and is ready to get back in the saddle.

More than 168000 rodeo fans are expected to pack the Thomas & Mack Center Dec. 2 to 11 for the annual event that moved to Texas last year because of COVID restrictions here.

“Of course we’re going to take all the proper precautions but there’s no intention of scaling back” said Allen Rheinheimer general manager of the NFR. “I think everything is on track to be one of the better events we’ve ever had.”

The return of the rodeo during a traditionally slow tourist period will mean packed hotels casinos and bars concerts and other special events such as Cowboy Christmas a Western shopping extravaganza.

“Everyone is excited to be back in Las Vegas — from competitors to spectators staff contractors and everyone else” Rheinheimer said. “There’s no town like Las Vegas to host this event.”

Kaycee Feild a champion bareback bronc rider said the Thomas & Mack is an incomparable setting for the rodeo with the fans seated seemingly right on top of the competitors.

“Las Vegas is its own animal” said Feild noting the city’s excitement and energy.

Ryan Growney general manager of the South Point said the resort will once again be “Vegas cowboy central” for the rodeo.

Several rodeo events will take place at the South Point including the $15 million World Series of Team Roping along with a number of entertainment offerings Growney said.

“We are thrilled to be welcoming back the National Finals Rodeo to Las Vegas” Growney said. “We believe this will be the largest year yet. We plan for these two weeks all year long because it means so much to us as a property as well as to the city of Las Vegas.”

Earlier this year the National Finals Rodeo Committee which oversees the NFR came to terms with Las Vegas Events a nonprofit organization that works to bring sporting events to the area to have the rodeo here through 2025.

Each year the NFR welcomes the top 15 contestants in bareback riding steer wrestling team roping saddle bronc riding tie-down roping barrel racing and bull riding to compete.

Aside from the competitions the NFR can be described as a wider “Western lifestyle festival” which attracts a segment of consumers not afraid to spend money Las Vegas Events President Pat Christenson said.

“The (NFR) customer spends almost 50% more than the average visitor” Christenson said. “What’s great about Vegas is that it’s so value driven. You can get great value or you can stay at one of the higher-end hotels. If you don’t have a ticket to the rodeo you can go to a viewing party.”

Cowboy Christmas a Western expo and interactive experience will run in conjunction with the rodeo at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Some rodeo fans will also attend country music concerts scheduled for early December.

Acts include Reba McEntire and Brooks & Dunn at Caesars Palace the Just Dave Band at Treasure Island and George Strait at T-Mobile Arena.

“There will be over 200 events with this and 65 of them are concerts” Christenson said. “Nobody can duplicate what Las Vegas has to offer. Nobody knows better how to take care of the NRF fans or visitors in general. If we’ve done one thing well it’s to continue to grow the event outside of the arena.”

The purse for this year’s rodeo will be more than $10.2 million nearly 10 times what it was in 1985 the first year the rodeo took place in Las Vegas.

Along with the rodeo Las Vegas has grown over the years as a city and a tourist destination.

In the mid-1980s Las Vegas boasted about 50000 hotel rooms. Today it has close to 170000 hotel rooms two major professional sports franchises and welcomed over 42 million visitors in 2019.

“Vegas rolls out the red carpet for NFR” Rheinheimer said. “It’s been a great marriage over the years. We hope to just continue to improve this event in Las Vegas every year. I’m over the moon about being back.”

Because of the continuing pandemic fans will be required to wear masks but there is no vaccine requirement.

After missing out on the rodeo in 2020 Christenson said Las Vegas tourism officials and business owners are ready to put on a great show.

“There’s going to be a lot going on” Christenson said. “We’re going to serve a lot of whiskey and beer shine a lot of boots and sell a lot of cowboy gear. I think having two years to prepare to host again we’re ready. This is their Super Bowl and Las Vegas is the place to have it.”

Johnson gifted his own custom-made truck to a Navy veteran from Culver City who is active in community causes and cares for his 75-year-old mother.

Johnson presented the truck to Oscar Rodriguez who collapsed in grateful tears as he received the gift.

Johnson chose Rodriguez as part of a special screening for his new film ""Red Notice"" in a theater. Someone from a gym where Rodriguez used to work as a trainer nominated him and film producers invited him to the screening. At the show Johnson surprised Rodriguez.

Johnson later explained on Instagram why he chose Rodriguez:

He deserves a lot more than my personal truck.



Kindness matters to me so thanks @ORodri240 for being so kind to so many people.



You said it right just before you drove away ~ it’s just love.



That’s all it is brother.

Just love.



Enjoy your new truck dude 🛻👊🏾

""I gathered as much information as I could about everyone in the audience and ultimately Oscar's story moved me. Takes care of his 75 year old mom. Personal trainer. Leader at his church. Provides support and meals for women victimized by domestic violence. Proud & humble Navy veteran. Kind human being.""

The Rock says the original plan was to gift Rodriguez the Porsche Taycan he drives in the movie - but Porsche said no.

So instead he gave away his own personal Ford Raptor truck.

Rodriguez told Eyewitness News he is a fan of Johnson particularly for his positivity and how he inspires others. He hopes to use the truck to pay it forward.

""I just hope and pray that this will inspire other people will lift other people up"" he said.

Rodriguez also posted his reaction on social media.

""I woke up today counted my blessings"" he said. ""It's Thanksgiving. There's just so much to be thankful for.""

""Just grateful that The Rock hooked me up with this whip. I'm gonna use it baby. I'm gonna use it to encourage people and help people. And bring a lot of cheer to people. Rock you the man.""

A self-described mix of ""an Elvis Presley and a Liberace ... on a motorcycle"" Evel Knievel's death-defying stunts brought a level of fame reserved for rock stars in the 1970s. With his signature star-spangled leather jumpsuits devil-may-care attitude and unmistakable swagger Knievel thrilled millions worldwide and became the role model for a generation of kids who crashed their bikes and skinned their knees on homemade ramps and suburban streets across America.

At the peak of Knievel's popularity his incredible motorcycle jumps over cars buses and even sharks earned him a lavish lifestyle replete with sports cars jewels and his own private jet. The ""last gladiator in the new Rome"" Knievel packed venues. Evel Knievel toys flew off the shelves. Still the world-famous daredevil continued to push his skills and his body to the limit with bigger stunts and higher stakes and he paid the price in blood and broken bones.

Yet by the decade's close Knievel would find himself on the pop culture scrap heap. Like the fallen hero of a modern-day Greek tragedy Knievel king of the stuntmen was brought low by the same hubris that had driven him from copper mines of Butte Montana to the top of the world. Despite the shattered relationships a shattered reputation and his shattered body Knievel soldiered on through the following decades with no regrets.

Williams who died on Sunday aged 79 was left a tetraplegic and confined to a wheelchair after a road accident in France in 1986.

The courage energy and determination with which he dealt with this cruel roll of fate's dice drew admiration from his family friends colleagues and the wider public.

With technical guru Patrick Head he created from scratch one of the greatest Formula One teams of all time.

Williams captured seven drivers' titles the last claimed by Canadian Jacques Villeneuve in 1997 while the team's nine constructors' crowns places Williams second only to mighty Ferrari.

His noted dry wit and charm indefatigable spirit and resilience served him well on his journey from being a trainee sales rep for Campbell's soup earning £10 a week to the pinnacle of the high-octane world of F1.

Francis Owen Garbett Williams was born in South Shields in northeast England on April 16 1942.

In his early days in motor racing he had to conduct business from his local red telephone box when cash wasn't flowing.

He established Frank Williams Racing Cars in 1966 competing in F3 and F2 and F1 with a borrowed chassis from 1969.

The death of his first driver Piers Courage driving for Williams at the Dutch GP at Zandvoort in 1970 was said to have marked him for life.

The first all-Williams built F1 car had an inauspicious start when with Henri Pescarolo at the wheel it was destroyed in a crash in 1972.

With funding an ever-present problem and having lost control of his company he left with Head to set up the team that is still racing today in 1977.

Clay Regazzoni drove a Cosworth-powered Williams to its first F1 success fittingly at the British Grand Prix in 1979.

Australian Alan Jones won the team's first drivers' title the following season. Williams also collected the constructors' championship that year.

'Life has to go on'

Keke Rosberg took the 1982 title with five more captured in a golden period between 1987 and 1997 all after Williams' ill-fated 1986 dash to catch a flight in France that led to the car crash.

""I was late for a plane I didn't need to be late for I got the French time mixed up with the English time"" he was to recall.

Williams lost control of the rental car causing it to leave the highway and drop 2.4 metres into a field. Williams suffered a spinal fracture between the fourth and fifth vertebra after being pressed between his seat and the crushed roof.

Williams was consigned to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.

""But life has to go on"" he said. ""I was able to continue in the business I was already in but generally speaking it's been a handicap in the true sense of the word.""

At the height of their powers Ayrton Senna who had won three titles with McLaren came on board for the 1994 season only to perish in a horrific high-speed crash at Imola.

Williams had a deep connection with the Brazilian great and was never able fully to come to terms with his death.

""Frank had a love affair with Ayrton"" his daughter Claire who would later head the team told The Sun newspaper in 2019.

""He got into his heart got into his mind and he always wanted to put him in his race car. Dad's wish then came true but it ended in the worst possible way.""

Not for the first time personal anguish failed to diminish Williams' single-mindedness to succeed with Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve capturing the 1996 and 1997 world championships. He was knighted in 1999 and became Sir Frank.

""It's been a great journey one I'd love to do again if I was younger. I wouldn't try and do anything different except try and avoid the accidents"" Williams told the BBC in 2010.

His death comes after his family ended 43 years of involvement in the team in September 2020 following its sale to Dorilton Capital.

Former Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone told AFP shortly before the sale that the team had lost its raison d'etre when Williams stepped down from the board in 2012.

Both of them were among the co-founders of the Formula One Constructors' Association in 1974.

""Frank was hands-on in the way he managed the team.

""He could get things done.""

The plan would take effect if Alden gains control of more than 10% of Lee's stock in the next year. The Davenport Iowa-based company said the plan would allow its other shareholders to buy shares at a 50% discount at that point or possibly get free shares for every share they already own. Lee owns 12 newspapers in Nebraska and 10 in Iowa in addition to dozens of newspapers in other states.

According to a report from the nonprofit Poynter Institute""The hedge fund has developed a reputation for slashing staff in newsrooms and other departments and selling off real estate at outlets it owns. It announced cuts at Tribune as soon as the deal closed. Besides investing little in news it lags the industry in technology upgrades.""

Alden said last week that it already owed more than 6% of Lee's stock. The plan Lee adopted Wednesday would make it more expensive for Alden to acquire a controlling stake.

In internal trainings companies from Disney to Lockheed-Martin ask their employees to “challenge colorblind ideologies” and “deconstruct their white male privilege.” Firms spend vast sums of money on such trainings on diversity-related speakers and on maintaining a progressive image. Employees find themselves wondering why their workplace has transformed into a progressive propaganda center.

Much has been made of the propagation of certain ideas—call them social-justice ideology critical race theory or wokeness—in American institutions. But surprisingly little attention has been paid to the question of why institutions “go woke.” Some address this question in philosophical or ideological terms noting the continuity between these ideas and the work of certain twentieth-century intellectuals from the Frankfurt School in the 1920s to the critical race theorists of the 1980s. But a historical and sociological analysis can help explain why institutions accepted these ideas as legitimate in the first place.

Race-conscious policy has become a self-sustaining force in the modern workplace. Where companies once adhered to a paradigm of “compliance” in which they adopted affirmative action to satisfy a new legal regime they now follow the rule of “diversity” which encourages race-consciousness as an end in itself. If social-justice ideology is the food that universities and businesses give to their students and employees diversity is now the air that they breathe the set of taken-for-granted assumptions without which woke ideas would be ignored. The story of diversity’s institutionalization in American corporate culture tells us much about how we got to this current moment—and how we can move beyond it.

The story starts in the civil rights era—not with marches sit-ins and the broader social movement but with the sprawling bureaucracy that this movement produced. Lyndon B. Johnson’s landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically expanded the responsibilities of the executive and judicial branches compelling regulators to intervene in education housing and welfare. It also created new regulatory entities such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to carry out its mandates. “Civil rights ideology” writes journalist Christopher Caldwell “especially when it hardened into a body of legislation became most unexpectedly the model for an entirely new system of constantly churning political reform.”

The new regime however well intentioned came with a complexity that private enterprise struggled to understand. As sociologists Frank Dobbin and John Sutton have argued the machinery of civil rights suffered from many of the problems that plague the rest of the U.S. regulatory state. It was ambiguous in that it broadly prohibited discrimination without clearly articulating what that meant; it was continuously expanding so corporations constantly had to update their awareness of relevant rules; and it was fragmentary in that it was carried out by redundant and often conflicting agencies at different levels of government. Such terms as “affirmative action” and “discrimination” were rarely defined their meanings always in flux.

Still enforcement took off in the 1970s as both political parties embraced the new apparatus. The doctrine of disparate impact enshrined by the Supreme Court’s unanimous 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. lowered the burden of proof for bias. Richard Nixon set up “goals and timetables” for corporate affirmative-action commitments and established hiring quotas for federal contractors Gerald Ford promulgated regulations mandating bilingual education and Jimmy Carter consolidated enforcement power under the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) while welcoming “hundreds of complaints” against employers for various violations. Under all three presidents the EEOC aggressively targeted some of America’s biggest employers including AT&T General Electric and Ford.

Facing the dual challenges of inscrutable regulation and aggressive regulators businesses responded by complying with the new mandates for race-consciousness under the Civil Rights Act’s Title VII. They implemented race-conscious policies to avoid the ire of regulators and the risk of lawsuits or federal investigations. Diversity consultants Rohini Anand and Mary-Frances Winters note that corporate trainings were primarily legalistic affairs “a litany of dos and don’ts and maybe a couple of case studies for the participants to ponder.” As civil rights regulations grew so did corporations’ tools for complying. In 1970 Dobbin observes fewer than 20 percent of firms had written equal-employment or affirmative-action rules; by 1980 after a decade of heavy-handed enforcement nearly half had done so.

Yet large majorities of the country opposed affirmative action which became a chief target of Ronald Reagan. On the campaign trail in 1980 he identified affirmative action as an example of government overreach and micromanagement promising to roll back “bureaucratic regulations which rely on quotas ratios and numerical requirements.” Once Reagan took office an entrenched bureaucracy a hostile Congress and courts frequently thwarted his ambitious agenda. He did however ease compliance pressures for a time. William Bradford Reynolds Reagan’s appointee to run the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division publicly opposed the use of quotas and endorsed colorblindness in hiring. Then–EEOC chairman Clarence Thomas shifted the focus from big systemic cases to individual instances of discrimination and tried to minimize the use of “goals and timetables.” The OFCCP downshifted and both agencies saw their staffing and funding levels slashed.

If corporations were still complying with affirmative action merely because of legal pressures this regulatory relaxation should have induced them to reverse course. But astonishingly they strengthened their commitment to affirmative action even filing amicus briefs and sending telegrams to Reagan in support of it. A 1985 survey of Fortune 500 companies that Dobbin cites found that 95 percent would “continue to use numerical objectives to track the progress of women and minorities” even if such objectives were no longer imposed. A 1986 survey found that despite reduced enforcement 90 percent of firms planned to keep their affirmative-action programs unchanged while the other 10 percent planned to expand them. Once a product of compliance with government regulation race-conscious corporate policy had taken on a life of its own.

“The doctrine of disparate impact enshrined in a 1971 Supreme Court decision lowered the burden of proof for bias.”

Corporations were not going to give up race-conscious policy just because Reagan told them to but they needed a rationale for continuing to pursue it. The Reagan administration unwittingly handed them one with Workforce 2000 a 1987 report commissioned by the Department of Labor and authored by two fellows at the Hudson Institute that unexpectedly became a bestseller. The report’s blockbuster finding: by the end of the millennium only 15 percent of those entering the workforce would be white men while the large remainder would be women and minorities. This pending demographic tidal wave gave business leaders a new reason to care about race- and sex-conscious policy—namely the need to create a workplace that could cater to a wide variety of workers.

Thus the diversity paradigm was born. R. Roosevelt Thomas the godfather of workplace diversity management argued that affirmative action had been designed to help women and minorities enter a monolithically white and male labor market. But by 1990 women immigrants and minorities were part of the workforce and Workforce 2000 argued would soon be the overwhelming majority of new entrants. “Women and minorities no longer need a boarding pass” wrote Thomas. “They need an upgrade.” Building a corporate culture that helped them achieve their full potential meant “managing diversity”—not only ensuring that the new heterogeneous workforce was as productive as the old homogeneous one but extracting the added value that this heterogeneity could bring. As one academic puts it diversity management is “aimed at maximizing every individual’s potential to contribute towards the realization of the organization’s goals through capitalizing on individual talents and differences within a diverse workforce environment.”

The shift from compliance to diversity constituted a regime change. Compliance was naturally limited: businesses followed the rules to avoid legal and cultural strife. But diversity was potentially unlimited: one could always do more to make the corporate culture more welcoming to members of various identity groups. Unlike compliance diversity had a business case: it was said to be the key to survival in the twenty-first-century economy. And diversity came to dominate discussions of race-consciousness in the workplace. One analysis of professional management journals found that discussion of diversity-related concepts was more or less nonexistent prior to 1987 but after Workforce 2000 appeared it took off—a trend that has persisted.

While the business case for diversity still commands the support of corporate leaders it is empirically lacking. Workforce 2000’s most sweeping conclusion—that by the turn of the century white men would make up just 15 percent of new entrants to the workforce—was wrong. In reality those entering the workforce by 2000 would look much like those in 1987. Even today the workforce remains majority white particularly at the top end of the skill distribution where the economy is growing fastest. The demographic tidal wave never came.

Meantime research generally doesn’t support the notion that diversity is good for the bottom line. Meta-analyses of the literature on measures of cultural or demographic diversity among employees routinely yield mixed findings reporting no effects or even small negative effects of such measures as racial and sexual diversity on team performance. Cultural diversity—that is the immigrant share of the workplace—can sometimes have small positive effects on innovation but those effects are both modest and contingent on other factors. Evidence from studies that randomly assign students to new businesses is similarly equivocal. One study based on Dutch students found a U-shaped relationship between team diversity and business performance suggesting that there can be both too little and too much diversity. Another based on MBA students at Harvard found that greater gender and race diversity resulted in worse performance by randomly assigned teams.

“Research generally doesn’t support the notion that diversity is good for the bottom line.”

Perhaps diversity improves business performance in some situations but it clearly doesn’t do so all the time. That’s unsurprising: diversity introduces new perspectives which can spur innovation but it can also make teamwork more challenging. Diversity is far from the “killer app” that its proponents make it out to be.

If the findings on diversity and productivity are ambiguous the evidence for whether diversity trainings or similar programs succeed is unambiguously negative. Research on online diversity trainings finds limited durable behavioral change. A 2016 report from the EEOC found that harassment training had little effect on workplace behavior. An analysis of some 700 companies found that diversity trainings and diversity evaluations for management can actually result in fewer minorities represented among management. And at least some evidence exists that adopting diversity goals and teaching about stereotypes can actually serve to reinforce stereotypes.

In short race-conscious policy is not fundamental to business success. Yet every year businesses spend billions on diversity initiatives which they believe are both urgently necessary and good for their bottom line. Why did they adopt a belief based on faulty evidence—and why do they persist in that belief?

Compliance had a rational basis: engage in (or appear to engage in) affirmative action to avoid legal trouble. Diversity’s rational basis—to compete in an ever more diverse economy—appears to be a mirage. Instead diversity seems to have survived because corporations have been unwilling to drop an entrenched practice even after justification for its original purpose receded. Diversity was a norm that had become by the 1990s “institutionalized.”

In a classic 1977 paper sociologists John Meyer and Brian Rowan argue that an organization’s behavior is structured not only by the pursuit of efficiency or productivity but also by the social context in which that organization exists. That social context—including everything from public opinion and the law to the “views of important constituents” and “knowledge legitimated through the education system”—often results in the adoption of practices that determine an organization’s structure. These practices are not necessarily adopted because they are optimal for profit-making though but because they are simply what is done. As Meyer and Rowan remind us corporations don’t always do things to enhance the bottom line; they also create and participate in “ceremonies” and “myths.” And failure to do so can endanger their social position.

History suggests that by the time Ronald Reagan came to power and began to ratchet back affirmative-action enforcement race-conscious policy had become institutionalized in the sense that followers of Meyer and Rowan (often called the “neo-institutional” school of sociology) mean. Diversity emerged not because it served the bottom line but because race-consciousness was simply what was done: it was an end in itself after which the business case was always a post-hoc justification.

As conditions have changed since the 1990s workplace diversity has evolved. Where diversity management was once the watchword human-resources officers now talk about “diversity equity and inclusion” while still insisting that race-consciousness is an essential principle of business success. Most firms have followed the trend to appease their employees. As liberal views and employability (as measured by education) have become closely correlated firms compete for skilled workers by adopting woke corporate cultures making wokeness a form of nonpecuniary benefit. In the process the demands of diversity become increasingly excessive. Corporate executives routinely spend their weekends “dismantling whiteness” in elaborate performances.

The transition from compliance to diversity converted race-consciousness from a legal mandate to a feature of doing business and thereby legitimated the pursuit of race-focused political agendas in the workplace. When employees demand or employers proactively grant that the company should tweet about Black Lives Matter or hold segregated training events it is partly because they have adopted the superficial logic of diversity agreeing that race-conscious policy is fundamental to profitability.

The institutionalization of diversity also explains why worker and activist demands have grown more extreme from the awkward multiculturalism of the 1990s office to the outright struggle sessions of today. Compliance had limits: though firms competed to prove their level of compliance a fundamental relationship existed between what regulators said and what companies did. The transition from compliance to diversity marks the moment at which race-conscious corporate policy became unmoored from rational purpose and mutated into a myth. Unlike compliance diversity is unlimited—unbounded by a rational goal and pursued for its own sake. Organizations have no capacity to reject new diversity initiatives; more diversity is always better. In fact because diversity is institutionalized questioning its efficacy at achieving its stated goals gets you nowhere (except fired). Radical ideas leak from the academy into the corporate world as diversity easily absorbs ever more elaborate definitions of race-conscious policy.

In a recent essay political scientist Richard Hanania argued that wokeness is a direct product of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its outgrowths. An anti-woke agenda Hanania reasons must therefore strike at the root of the post–civil rights regime tearing up the laws and rules that perpetuate it.

That argument is incomplete. Yes contemporary racial progressivism is linked genealogically to the post–civil rights dispensation. But even if the post–civil rights regime of aggressive federal oversight and disparate-impact enforcement were undone tomorrow wokeness would persist—just as it did when Reagan sought to draw back the regulator’s reach slightly and just as it did under the Trump administration.

Legal solutions do exist to check the excesses of institutionalized diversity. As Hanania notes corporate decision-makers can’t ignore the cudgel of state power: compliance concerns may not be dominant any longer but organizations must still follow the law. Because American civil rights law remains ambiguous broad and unevenly enforced it is exploited by a class of personnel experts with a vested interest in perpetuating extreme forms of racial progressivism. Overbroad lawmaking begets arbitrary and capricious administration inducing firms to go further and further in fear of the long arm of the law. Clarifying what compliance with civil rights laws really means then could help firms that want to follow the rules without succumbing to insanity. Such regulatory reforms are almost certainly more desirable—and more electorally palatable—than wholesale assaults on the civil rights state including its many benefits.

Undoing the corporate diversity regime which doesn’t generate profits and permits harmful radicalism to seep into the workplace should be the ultimate goal. One plausible approach is to heighten the contradictions between colorblindness which still commands the support of most Americans and nominally remains the law of the land and the color-consciousness that has come to dominate workplaces. Racial discrimination remains illegal under Title VII; while the battle to enforce its actual language will be difficult successful legal action would endanger the diversity paradigm. Making clear to firms that if they are too woke they will face lawsuits from disgruntled employees may prove sufficient incentive to curb the worst excesses. An overly woke workplace can count as a “hostile environment” too particularly in the hands of a skilled litigator and a judiciary that has grown more conservative over the past half-decade.

Regulators could facilitate this process. An elite consensus in favor of affirmative action stymied Reagan’s reform efforts. But contemporary wokeness by contrast seems comparatively more polarizing especially among elected Republicans who see it as an inviting political target. Hanania rightly emphasizes that the Trump administration could have been far more aggressive on this front and future administrations should consider the Reagan agenda—both its strengths in theory and the barriers to its implementation in practice.

All this is simply a sketch of what could be done. To move forward however it is important to understand how we got here.

In July 2020 the Seattle-based carrier opened a gleaming new 6-story office building called ""The Hub"" across from its corporate headquarters with an open-to-the-public company store (and a Starbucks) on the first floor. But because the pandemic was just taking hold when The Hub opened there's been barely any publicity about the store and thus few non-employee shoppers.

This holiday season should be much different. More people are traveling and word is spreading about the unique logo and branded gear on the shop's shelves for Alaska Airlines and its sister regional carrier Horizon Air.

""This is the best of the best for company swag. says Karen McAvinew Manager of Retail Operations for Alaska Airlines. She says the shop is a short drive or a manageable 1-mile walk from SEA airport and offers a view of the Alaska Airlines hangar and a peek-a-boo view of the 780-foot aerial walkway at SEA that is the longest arial walkway over an existing taxiway.

While most of the glassware apparel accessories and gift items in the store can also be found in the airline's online shop we discovered plenty of in-store bonuses during our pre-Thanksgiving shopping excursion alongside several pilots who had stopped in before their flights.

Model Airplanes

After more than a decade as a financial consultant and money manager Alejandro Cardot had a knack for spotting the flaws in investment pitches. So when a relative e-mailed in 2019 asking whether it was worth joining the hordes of Canadians flocking to private debt funds he went into deep-dive mode.

Mr. Cardot had little experience in private debt especially here in Canada – he’s originally from Venezuela but lives in Montreal where he earned an MBA at McGill. Over the years however he’d developed finely tuned radar for salesmen who overpromise and underdeliver. And when he came across David Sharpe the chief executive of Bridging Finance Inc. his radar started to ping.

When touting his company Mr. Sharpe suggested in a television interview that Bridging had found a sweet spot in debt markets: lending to mid-sized Canadian companies that had been ignored by the big banks. It was a strategy he claimed had allowed Bridging to generate annual returns of 8 per cent with not a single down month or a loss on any of its loans.

But Bridging dealt with some of the least stable borrowers out there Mr. Cardot thought to himself. How could this possibly be true?

What is Bridging Finance and who are its leaders?

Bridging Finance failed to account for bad loans potentially boosting its management fees: Receiver

Mr. Cardot began digging. While Bridging disclosed very little about its loan book some of its borrowers were publicly traded or in bankruptcy proceedings and therefore obligated to disclose their relationships with lenders. The deeper he combed through U.S. court records and piles of regulatory filings the more implausible Mr. Sharpe’s statements became.

Mr. Cardot believed this warranted some kind of regulatory intervention. He became intrigued by the possibility of receiving a reward through the Ontario Securities Commission’s whistle-blower program and filed an official written complaint about Bridging and several other private debt funds. This was unfamiliar territory for him. “In Venezuela” he says “if you do whistle-blowing bad things will happen for sure.”

He had no way of knowing that by the time he filed his complaint on Feb. 12 2021 alleging “Bridging Finance’s returns are not real” the OSC had already been on Bridging’s tail for a full year. Privately investigators had been asking to see its loan documents since February 2020 and had even gone so far as to interview top Bridging officials.

It would be another three months before the OSC’s investigation became public knowledge. But on April 30 the regulator asked an Ontario judge for permission to put Bridging under the control of a receiver and the next morning – a Saturday – it was announced to the world. In an instant Mr. Sharpe’s professional world collapsed. So did his personal life: His wife Natasha was one of the company’s owners and had been its chief investment officer. As for Bridging’s 26000 investors – the vast majority of them retail buyers – their portfolios were upended and their investments frozen indefinitely.

The allegations that have come to light since both in court filings and through The Globe and Mail’s reporting have been harrowing. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bridging’s struggling loans were allegedly never revalued boosting the Sharpes’ management fees. Nearly half of Bridging’s loan portfolio didn’t pay cash interest and instead deferred the payments – something financiers refer to as a game of “extend and pretend.” The OSC and the receiver PricewaterhouseCoopers have also alleged the problems ran deeper than playing fast and loose with valuations. About $19.5-million in Bridging funds ended up in Mr. Sharpe’s personal bank account. Part of that money was then transferred to Liechtenstein a known tax haven. Another $1.9-million appears to have been used for home renovations and $228000 was used for payments to Tesla Motors and for leases on a 2013 Bentley GT Mulliner and a 2018 Bentley Bentayga.

The scandal has rocked Bay Street. Bridging once seemed unstoppable and its track record was catnip for aging retail investors desperate for sizable but stable yield in a world of stubbornly low interest rates. Bridging had also partnered with one of Bay Street’s best-known money managers Sprott Asset Management which put Bridging’s funds in front of some of Canada’s top investment advisers and helped make them available for sale by every major bank and independent brokerage. By the time of its receivership Bridging had amassed $2-billion in assets under management. The Sharpes looked like the masters of risk.

A Globe investigation has found that was mostly a mirage. Despite Mr. Sharpe’s background in compliance and securities law the hard-partying CEO consistently blurred the lines between his friends and Bridging borrowers and repeatedly signed off on huge loans to arguably unworthy debtors. Natasha Sharpe meanwhile could be wildly optimistic about Bridging’s chances of recovering money from weak borrowers despite her reputation as a risk expert and an intimidating negotiator. And the OSC has alleged some investor funds flowed into her bank account as well.

The Sharpes were both sent an extensive list of questions about the evolution of Bridging Finance and The Globe’s reporting. Ms. Sharpe declined to comment for this story. In a statement Mr. Sharpe’s lawyer said he “is not going to argue the issues related to the receivership of Bridging Finance in the media. Mr. Sharpe disagrees with the OSC’s allegations and will address Bridging Finance issues where appropriate through proper legal channels.”

PwC is currently trying to salvage what it can from the troubled loan portfolio and sell the company but that’s a challenge because the receiver has already discovered Bridging’s largest loan is likely worth a fraction of its book value. As it stands investors are expected to lose between $800-million and $1-billion according to people familiar with the sale process.

While the OSC has yet to bring a case against any individuals the affair has already had an impact – and exposed a major loophole in asset management. So-called alternative investments – private debt real estate infrastructure and the like – have seen their popularity soar as retail investors scour for decent yields. But because these assets are privately managed they face much less external scrutiny meaning investors must put their faith directly in the fund managers. Bridging’s collapse has exposed just how fraught that relationship can be.

It has become clear the Sharpes weren’t masters of risk at all; they were masters of marketing themselves. Self-promoters are everywhere of course. The big question here is why no one on Bay Street saw through the Sharpes – or if they did why they weren’t willing to call David and Natasha out.

Bridging’s early reputation was built on Natasha Sharpe’s pedigree. Raised in Kingston she earned four university degrees including a PhD in epidemiology before taking a job at Coopers & Lybrand (now part of PwC) in 1999. Two years later she moved to Bank of Montreal’s risk management division and then into corporate finance underwriting loans for mid-market commercial clients.

During her time at BMO Ms. Sharpe won the backing of some influential internal figures and was tagged as a high-potential employee putting her on track to become a senior executive. But in 2010 Sun Life Financial wooed her away to fill the newly created role of chief credit risk officer. A year later she was named to Canada’s Top 40 Under 40.

Despite being pursued by the insurer her time at Sun Life was short-lived and she left in 2012. Not long after Ms. Sharpe started Bridging Finance with financial backing from Jenny Coco whose family-owned company Coco Group is best known for its road paving business. The two women met in January 2009 when BMO underwrote Coco Paving’s acquisition of the Ontario and Quebec road-paving assets of Lafarge SA and quickly developed a tight bond. In 2011 Ms. Sharpe joined Coco Group’s board of directors – a post she relished because it was “the only paving company of any size in the world run by a woman” she told The Globe at the time. The following year Ms. Coco and her brother Rock-Anthony became majority shareholders in Bridging with Ms. Sharpe holding the remaining minority stake. Ms. Coco is also godmother to the Sharpes’ son.

Ms. Coco was sent an extensive list of questions about her relationship with the Sharpes and her ties to Bridging. She declined to comment.

A year after Bridging was created David Sharpe joined as chief operating officer. A graduate of Queen’s Law with an MBA Mr. Sharpe had held several posts as corporate secretary or chief compliance officer at firms including Mackenzie Financial Corp. Citigroup and CI Financial. He had also spent four years at the Mutual Fund Dealers’ Association where he was director of investigations.

The Sharpes believed they’d found a gap in the lending market: mid-sized Canadian companies starved for credit in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Early on Bridging focused on a specific type of lending known as factoring – small short-term loans that weren’t overly complex. One of Bridging’s early borrowers for instance sold 2x4s to Lowe’s. Many retailers don’t pay their receivables for a few months which can leave suppliers strapped for cash. To alleviate the crunch Bridging would buy the receivable at a discount and pay the 2x4 supplier up front then wait to collect the full cheque from Lowe’s.

Bridging’s other business line was known as asset-based lending focusing on high-cost short-term loans to less established companies. To help manage the inherent risk Bridging often charged annual interest rates around 12 per cent and the Sharpes told investors they didn’t like to extend credit for long periods. In fact the company’s name refers to bridge loans which are often paid back in a year or less.

The Sharpes also claimed they had bulletproofed their loan portfolio by ensuring they’d be repaid first if something went wrong. Bridging demanded personal guarantees from its borrowers too something the Sharpes referred to as “boot collateral” – assets that could fit in the boot of a car. If a loan went bad Ms. Sharpe was known to be tough – if not a little ruthless – when collecting that collateral instructing underlings to “throw it in the boot.”

From the outside Bridging looked enticing: Natasha was a credit risk specialist with a history at some of Canada’s largest financial institutions. She also stood her ground in an industry rife with chummy men. David meanwhile was a smooth talker with a long history as a rule enforcer. Yet money management is built on personal relationships and the Sharpes still needed some assistance opening doors.

In 2014 help arrived in the form of Sprott Asset Management. The two firms teamed up to launch the Sprott Bridging Income Fund with Sprott focused on marketing and the Sharpes focused on risk management and investing.

The partnership was formed right as the business of managing money was rapidly evolving. Because interest rates were stuck at obscenely low levels and because an increasing number of investors were starting to choose low-cost exchange traded funds over mutual funds money managers began offering alternative investment funds that specialized in private credit real estate and infrastructure. While these options were more expensive for investors – Bridging’s cost about two per cent annually plus an incentive fee if the annual return beat a certain threshold – the expectation was that they’d deliver outsized returns.

Amid this shift the Sprott Bridging Income Fund had a first-mover advantage. It also had a unique feature that did wonders for sales. Specialized funds typically locked in investor money for a specified time frame – sometimes five years or more. Investors in the Sprott Bridging fund meanwhile could sell on a monthly basis. That was extremely appealing to older higher-net-worth retail investors who by virtue of their wealth are considered “accredited” investors authorized to put money into riskier products – even if they aren’t always savvy enough to know exactly what they’re getting into.

As the partnership deepened a couple of notable developments put Bridging on a new path. For one Kevin Westfall who’d run Bridging’s factoring business left in 2015 nudging the company toward higher-risk lending. (Mr. Westfall did not return multiple requests for comment.) Then late in 2016 the Sharpes shuffled their roles with David taking over as CEO so Natasha could focus on her chief investment officer duties. The move created a puzzling chain of command: Natasha now reported to David even though she was a co-owner of the company and he wasn’t.

Faint cracks also began to show inside the firm and widened over time according to former employees. In essence there was Team David which specialized in sales and Team Natasha which focused on risk. Members from both squads sat on the eight-person credit committee – as did Jenny Coco the majority owner – and each person had one vote.

At the same time David began to replace Natasha as Bridging’s public face – and to become a public figure writ large. In 2018 around the time Bridging hit $1-billion in assets under management he was elected to the Queen’s University board of trustees helping pave his way into Bay Street’s upper echelons.

All this coincided with an increased focus on Canada’s troubling treatment of Indigenous peoples. As a member of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte Mr. Sharpe began to talk about his Indigenous roots and positioned Bridging to help fund wealth creation for First Nations. In the spring of 2019 the company launched a new fund dedicated to financing Indigenous economic development. A month later David made a $250000 personal donation to Queen’s to fund the Indigenous Knowledge Initiative. When the gift was announced Jim Leech – former head of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and the university’s then-chancellor – tweeted: “You are a great Canadian David - proud to be a friend.”

Talking about his Indigenous identity was a major departure for Mr. Sharpe. Few knew that he’d grown up in subsidized housing in Brampton Ont. where he leaned hard into hockey culture. As a goalie he earned a full athletic scholarship to play for the Ferris State University Bulldogs in Michigan but played just 12 games before quitting school and returning to Canada. He also appeared in the 1986 cult-classic hockey movie Youngblood starring Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze which was shot in Toronto. When marketing Bridging funds he also loved to tell people he’d been invited to try out for the New York Rangers.

In recent years Mr. Sharpe has said he avoided talking about his Indigenous background for so long because he was ashamed. He has publicly described his childhood home as a “battlefield” where he learned to defend himself with his fists. In a 2018 speech to the Children’s Aid Foundation he spoke candidly about learning to “live in two worlds.”

That notion would become a recurring theme as Bridging’s popularity exploded – not just for David but for Natasha too. The stories the Sharpes told about their prudent no-BS approach to lending proved to be at odds with the true state of Bridging’s portfolio.

Around 2015 David Sharpe became enamoured by an obscure businessman named Sean McCoshen. Based in Winnipeg Mr. McCoshen had a record of business failures and a vague unverifiable résumé. Yet he’d remade himself as an adviser to First Nations communities and earned millions brokering loans for them. Much like with Jenny Coco the professional relationship blurred into a personal one with the Sharpes vacationing with Mr. McCoshen and his son.

As the two men grew closer Mr. McCoshen’s dream of building a railroad from Fort McMurray to the ports of Alaska became a central part of Bridging’s loan portfolio. David publicly supported the project claiming it would spur economic development for Indigenous communities along its route. But no one really knew the depths of the financial entanglement between Bridging and the railway until this summer when the receiver revealed that Mr. McCoshen’s company known as A2A owed Bridging $208-million making it the largest loan in the lender’s portfolio. Bridging also had an equity stake in A2A it valued at $109-million. Meanwhile the railway had just $1-million in cash and few hard assets.

Even more startling the OSC alleges that a company controlled by Mr. McCoshen transferred a total of $19.5-million to Mr. Sharpe’s personal chequing account between 2016 and 2019 – often shortly after Bridging had advanced loans to Mr. McCoshen’s projects. According to the receiver $25.5-million in Bridging funds were also sent directly to Mr. McCoshen’s personal bank account. Through his lawyer Mr. McCoshen declined to comment for this story.

Even if these payments can ultimately be explained the A2A loan doesn’t align with the principles Bridging used to swear by. While Bridging did require Mr. McCoshen to personally guarantee the loan much of his wealth was tied to the rail project creating a circular backstop. In financial statements filed in court Mr. McCoshen’s largest asset was his $4-billion equity stake in A2A a value ascribed by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. in the fall of 2020. Yet A2A filed for creditor protection this summer and without this asset Mr. McCoshen’s net worth was pegged at negative $96-million.

Mr. McCoshen is also closely tied to another of Bridging’s largest loans to Bondfield Construction Co. Ltd. which was one of Ontario’s largest builders of public infrastructure until it collapsed in 2019. The OSC’s investigation revealed Bridging quietly assigned the loan to Mr. McCoshen at no cost which means another loan is ultimately backstopped by the troubled rail project. As well Bridging lent one of Mr. McCoshen’s numbered companies $9-million to procure a 2002 Bombardier Challenger jet. In all Mr. McCoshen has ties to more than $500-million worth of Bridging’s loans about one-quarter of its assets under management.

Beyond Mr. McCoshen The Globe has discovered a web of connections between Bridging borrowers advisers and Sharpe family friends potentially creating conflicts of interest. Adrian Montgomery the CEO of Bridging borrower Enthusiast Gaming served as trustee of the trust that holds many of the Sharpes’ assets including their home in Toronto’s tony Rosedale neighbourhood. He was also appointed as chair and interim CEO of cannabis producer MJardin Group Inc. a major Bridging borrower after it ran into financial difficulties in 2019. Mr. Montgomery declined to comment for this story.

Investment bank Canaccord Genuity Corp. meanwhile brokered a 2019 loan between Bridging and Enthusiast and has also been the gaming company’s lead financial adviser and an adviser to MJardin. In September 2018 Stuart Raftus who runs Canaccord’s Canadian wealth management division took a $3.75-million personal loan from Bridging according to court filings and documents obtained by The Globe. A spokesperson from Canaccord told The Globe the loan was repaid “well before the receivership.”

There was also a discrepancy between Mr. Sharpe’s professional image and his after-work behaviour. Around retail clients and in media interviews Mr. Sharpe was measured and cogent the picture of a conservative lender. After work however he was known to drink heavily and turn belligerent even with employees. One said they learned not to answer his calls or texts after 8 p.m. because he could be volatile. The next morning however Mr. Sharpe sometimes didn’t remember his behaviour or simply acted like nothing happened. Mr. Sharpe declined to comment on these allegations.

Through it all the Sharpes maintained their risk-averse façade. “We do the most conservative form of asset-based lending and accounts receivables also known as factoring” David said in a BNN interview in 2019. “We’re very binary at Bridging Finance” he added. If a loan has stopped paying cash interest “we write it down…We want to be very transparent in that case.” And he stressed that Bridging had never experienced a loan loss.

This messaging helped draw in retail investors who poured at least $1.5-billion into Bridging funds. They may not have fully understood private credit even if they were “accredited” but they could trust a track record. The marketing pitch also helped win over influential investment advisers; by the time the receiver took over every big Canadian bank had some exposure to Bridging funds. Advisers at Toronto-Dominion Bank were particularly smitten investing $276-million worth of client assets the most of any bank or independent brokerage according to a breakdown obtained by The Globe. “The allegations against Bridging Finance are very serious. As the OSC’s investigation into Bridging Finance is ongoing we do not feel it is appropriate to comment publicly” the bank said in an emailed statement.

With investor funds pouring in Bridging started making serious money on its management and incentive fees. In 2016 the company’s earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization was $2-million. By 2019 it had jumped to $43-million according to internal figures obtained by The Globe. To cash in on this growth Bridging’s owners hired Raymond James to explore a sale.

That’s when Gary Ng appeared.

Mr. Ng was another obscure Winnipeg-based businessman who’d been making the rounds publicly referring to himself as an “admiral” who was amassing a “fleet” of independent firms. A year earlier he’d surprised Bay Street by acquiring Vancouver-based money manager PI Financial Corp. for $100-million and over dinner at Sotto Sotto in Toronto’s Yorkville neighbourhood Mr. Ng expressed interest in acquiring Bridging. In August 2019 the Cocos and Natasha Sharpe sold a 50-per-cent stake to him for $50-million.

Early in 2020 however PI discovered some issues with the collateral Mr. Ng had posted when he purchased the money manager. An investigation revealed Mr. Ng had forged documents and wasn’t worth anywhere near what he’d said he was. This spelled trouble for Bridging which – unbeknownst to investors– had lent Mr. Ng $100-million from its funds during the same time period he was negotiating the purchase of his 50-per-cent stake.

This wasn’t the first time Bridging had done something along these lines.

A year earlier Bridging had agreed to end its Income Fund partnership which meant it had to buy out its co-manager. (By that point Sprott’s alternative investing arm had gone through a management buyout of its own and was renamed Ninepoint Partners LP.) At the time the breakup was described as a business decision. The OSC alleges there’s more to the story.

Court filings show that a few weeks before the divorce was announced Ninepoint spotted a strange transfer: $20-million had been moved out of the Ninepoint Bridging Income Fund and was then repaid from two separate Bridging funds. Ninepoint also noticed that Bridging may have collected a special fee from one of the fund’s borrowers but kept the money for itself instead of sharing it.

In an interview with the OSC this February Ninepoint co-CEO John Wilson described the alleged transfers as “very unusual movements of capital out of the fund” and added “We didn’t understand exactly what would have caused that to happen.” Even though all the money came back Ninepoint couldn’t get “satisfactory answers” from Bridging.

When asked about the transfers both David and Natasha Sharpe along with a few other Bridging employees gave the OSC a wholly different explanation telling the watchdog Ninepoint was facing financial difficulties and wanted to be bought out so it could make loan repayments.

Emails filed in court appear to support Ninepoint’s version of events. In May 2018 Ninepoint sent Bridging a formal letter outlining its concerns about the transfer of funds. Mr. Wilson also met with David Sharpe and Bridging’s chief compliance officer Andrew Mushore to discuss the matter. In an email to colleagues and Ninepoint’s legal counsel afterward he wrote: “Andrew (and to a limited extent Dave) attempted to explain away the $20M transfer out of our fund - I won’t go into the details let’s just say it was a fairly poor and transparent attempt to cover up what they had done.”

Bridging ultimately bought out Ninepoint’s stake in the management contract for $45-million and the way this payment was sourced is now under scrutiny. Much like the loan Gary Ng used to buy his Bridging stake the OSC alleges the buyout was misappropriated because it was paid for with investor funds and disguised to look like the money came from elsewhere.

Whether it will ever be returned to investors could depend on the OSC’s ongoing investigation. The Ng loan however was partially repaid by the Cocos and Natasha Sharpe as part of a deal to buy back his $50-million stake in Bridging for $5 in March 2020.

Bridging’s woes have only snowballed since then however.

Two weeks after buying out Mr. Ng Canada entered its first COVID-19 lockdown. As markets tanked panicked investors filed redemption requests amounting to 10 per cent of Bridging’s assets under management. With the economy in free-fall the lender couldn’t sell its illiquid loans fast enough and it was forced to gate its funds and lock investors in.

The matter went unresolved for months but by September 2020 Bridging was able to secure a $126-million cash infusion from institutional investors. Under the terms of the participation note as the funding was known the new investors ranked senior to all existing investors and they were entitled to cash interest payments regardless of whether the borrowers themselves were paying in cash or deferring their payments.

That same month the OSC issued a summons for Bridging to produce more loan documents and compelled David and other officials to appear for interviews with investigators. Around this time Mr. Sharpe instructed a Bridging employee to contact the company’s IT service provider and delete company e-mails that contained specific search terms one of which was “Sean McCoshen” the receiver has alleged. According to court documents 34000 records were targeted for destruction.

Mr. Sharpe also started moving around money. Four days after his first sit-down with the OSC he closed the BMO chequing account that had allegedly received Bridging funds lent to A2A; a month later in December 2020 $4.7-million of this money was moved offshore to a trust firm Liechtenstein according to the receiver.

There was a significant shuffle inside Bridging too. In January of this year members of Mr. Sharpe’s circle were promoted to senior roles including Robb Cacovic to co-CIO alongside Natasha.

Then everything came came crashing to a halt at the end of April when the court stripped control of Bridging away from the Sharpes.

With Bridging up for sale and major losses expected the easy target for investor rage is the Sharpes themselves. David and Natasha allegedly exploited the secrecy afforded to private debt managers and misled people about the true state of Bridging’s finances. One glaring instance may be the emergency cash infusion Bridging obtained to fund its redemptions. The loan cost around 13 per cent annually and ranked the new institutional backers ahead of all existing fund investors. Instead of giving long-standing clients full disclosure of the deal they say they leaned on legal advice that determined they didn’t need to say much about it.

Other times David Sharpe contorted facts until they were unrecognizable. In 2019 during a BNN interview Mr. Sharpe was asked about the troubled Bondfield loan and replied by saying it had been sold to a family in Western Canada. In reality the loan was assigned to his good friend Mr. McCoshen at no cost.

Yet Bridging also didn’t operate in a vacuum. There were multiple parties who either took the Sharpes at their word or failed to ask questions at all.

KPMG LLP is central to this line of inquiry. As the auditor of Bridging’s investment funds for the past two years it’s one of the few external parties who had access to detailed loan information. In its 2020 audit KPMG earmarked $31-million in expected loan losses for the Bridging Income Fund and $12-million for the Mid-Market Fund. (Combined the two funds have $1.5-billion in assets under management.) The A2A loan and equity position meanwhile could see Bridging lose hundreds of millions of dollars

It’s possible KPMG relied on documents that supported the Sharpes’ credit analysis such as McKinsey’s $4-billion valuation for the A2A railway. Even then it would be hard to justify keeping every loan but one at its original value.

When Bridging went hunting for emergency funding last year it gave institutional investors a rare look at its books. One of them R.C. Morris & Co. (RCM) grouped the loans in Bridging’s two largest funds into three tranches: A B and C. RCM described C loans as “bad” with Bridging “unlikely to collect” on the principal according to a presentation obtained by the Globe.

By RCM’s measure just 21 per cent of Bridging’s loans warranted an A rating; 44 per cent were given a C. Most of those loans also had deferred interest payments or a “payment in kind” – IOUs that would be collected when the full loan was eventually repaid.

In response to questions from The Globe KPMG said it “takes its role responsibilities and obligations as an auditor very seriously on every engagement. Our obligations under our Code of Professional Conduct prohibit us from discussing client confidential matters.”

Ninepoint meanwhile also allegedly got a glimpse of some questionable behaviour when it was bought out of the co-management contract in 2018. There’s nothing to suggest Ninepoint was aware of the full extent of Bridging’s behaviour. But rather than tell its clients – or perhaps even a watchdog – about what it had uncovered it accepted the buyout without disclosing the backstory to those it helped bring into Bridging’s flagship fund.

“Ninepoint has always acted with the highest standards of diligence integrity and transparency” co-CEO John Wilson wrote in a statement to the Globe. “We fully cooperated with the OSC’s investigation of Bridging Finance. We never had knowledge of the allegations made by the OSC against Bridging Finance. We are very pleased that the OSC is taking a strong position in this case.”

Mr. Wilson also noted that its disagreement with Bridging Finance “was commercial in nature and related to fees.”

Then there are the assorted investors advisers and brokerage compliance departments who played a role in the debacle. With debt investments fat returns are synonymous with higher risk and at eight per cent annually Bridging’s were rather juicy.

The notion that such great returns could come with minimal risk is what initially sparked Mr. Cardot’s curiosity around private debt and sent him searching for answers in the far corners of the internet.

It might have been too much to ask individual investors to do the same. But all the signs pointed to the fact that Bridging was too good to be true – especially for anyone who was supposed to know better. For all the blame the Sharpes deserve Bay Street also let itself get fooled.

No matter your status the program offers perks to being a member. And with it being free to join why wouldn’t you take advantage?

Still you might have questions regarding the program how it works and the benefits for members. Here’s everything to know about the VIFP program.

The basics are simple. For each day you sail you earn points within the program. Sail more and you’ll earn more points putting you in a higher status level. From there each status level comes with more benefits for your cruise.

For more details about the program and answers to common questions we have you covered below…

What Is the VIFP Club?

The VIFP Club is the loyalty program for Carnival Cruise Line. (VIFP stands for Very Important Fun Person.) As a member of the program passengers earn points for each day that they cruise with Carnival. The more a person cruises the more points they earn which leads to a higher status level in the VIFP Club.

With higher status a passenger earns perks and rewards including everything from special fares to freebies on the ship to expedited boarding and much more.

Why Should I Join the VIFP Club?

When it comes to Carnival’s loyalty program there is really no reason not to join. Membership is completely free and can only benefit you by providing rewards. It’s also simple to sign up. Since you are going to be cruising anyway (which is exactly how you earn points toward higher status) not being a part of the VIFP Club doesn’t make much sense.

How Do I Sign Up for the VIFP Club?

You can sign-up to register as a VIFP member on Carnival’s website whether you’ve taken cruises in the past or never sailed before. It is free to join and takes just seconds to sign up. As well you can get an account when you book your first cruise. Having trouble signing up? You can also call Carnival at 1-888-227-6482 to register.

How Do I Earn Points?

Earning points is simple. For each night that you cruise you earn one point. So a seven-night cruise earns you seven points. Take a three-night trip? That’s three points. Over time the points you earn add together to increase your status in the program.

In addition you may see other opportunities to earn points possibly without taking a cruise. According to the VIFP Club’s terms and conditions Carnival may “offer opportunities to earn extra VIFP Points through participation in different promotions contests or sweepstakes.”

The most common and reliable way to earn by far however is to sail on the cruise line.

Do I Earn Points for Booked Cruises?

No points are earned for sailed nights only. So if you sailed a seven-day cruise last summer and have a five-day cruise booked for next year then you will only have seven points as a member not 12.

Do I Earn More Points for Spending More on a Room?

While you might think you’d earn higher status for spending more money on your cruise that’s not the case. Whether you a sailing in an interior cabin or a top-of-the-line suite they both earn you one point per day for your VIFP status.

That’s not to say that Carnival couldn’t do something like award double points to suite guests as an incentive to book a higher-grade cabin. For now at least even if you book the cheapest room on the ship or the best cabin available you’ll earn points just like everybody else aboard.

Do VIFP Club Points Expire or Does the Status Level Drop?

At least right now VIFP Club points don’t expire. So if you earn 25 points within the program but then don’t sail for a few years you’ll still have the same point level and status as before. This is different than loyalty programs like with airlines where the points you earn often “drop off” after a length of time. If you’ve earned Gold status then you don’t have to worry about being dropped back to Red status just because you don’t sail for a while.

So even if you are only an occasional cruiser or only sail Carnival sometimes there’s still a reason to be a member and rack up those rewards.

What Status Levels Are There in the Carnival VIFP Club?

Within the club there are five different status levels for passengers to earn. Each is known by a color which is shown as the background of your Sail & Sign card. (Around the ship you might see people showing off their status with their card in a lanyard!)

Blue (First Sailing) : This status is earned on a person’s first cruise. It’s where everyone starts.

: This status is earned on a person’s first cruise. It’s where everyone starts. Red (Second Sailing-24 Points) : Earned from a second Carnival sailing through 24 points.

: Earned from a second Carnival sailing through 24 points. Gold (25-74 Points) : Gold membership is awarded to those with 25-74 points in the VIFP Club.

: Gold membership is awarded to those with 25-74 points in the VIFP Club. Platinum (75-199 Points) : The second-highest status Platinum is awarded for 75-199 points.

: The second-highest status Platinum is awarded for 75-199 points. Diamond (200+ Points): Have more than 200 nights sailed? That earns Carnival’s highest status of Diamond level.

What Are the VIFP Club Benefits?

As you would expect different membership levels provide different benefits. The higher your status the more benefits you earn.

The good news is that no matter your status there are benefits to enjoy. You don’t have to be a Diamond member to get a freebie.

Perks and rewards range from a free bottle of water in your room to priority check-in/boarding Carnival souvenir gifts collectible pins priority debarkation and priority reservations.

Do I Get Special Fares for Being a Member?

Yes. As a VIFP member you will often see pricing that is different from the headline prices advertised to the general public.

One thing to watch however is that we have personally seen rates actually be higher with the VIFP number entered than when searching without. While we are far from Diamond members it was strange to see the higher rates. That’s why we would suggest searching with and without the club number entered just to be sure you’re getting the best rate.

What If I Reach a New Status During a Cruise?

Say you have 20 nights sailed giving you Red status in the VIFP Club but you are embarking on a seven-night cruise. At the end of the cruise you’ll have 27 points enough to be granted Gold status.

In this case Carnival grants passengers the higher status at the start of the cruise. So while you board with 20 points you’ll still be given the Gold status at the start of the trip giving you extra benefits.

According to Carnival’s website:

“Notwithstanding the foregoing in the event a Member books a Cruise in which such Member will attain the necessary VIFP Points to reach a new Level during or by the end of such Cruise (a “Crossover Cruise”) CCL may in its sole discretion offer such Member the Benefits offered to Members of the higher Level during the Crossover Cruise.”

What If I Have a Past Cruise Without Points?

Typically points are automatically applied to your account within 14 points of the end of the trip. Passengers normally don’t have to do anything.

There might be times where points don’t apply automatically or there might be cruises you took in the past that haven’t been added. In that case you can login into your Carnival account. From there click on “My Cruises” and scroll down to “Claim a Past Cruise”. Enter your information about your missing cruise and it will be reviewed to add the trip to your VIFP profile.

Is Carnival’s VIFP Club Worth Joining?

The VIFP loyalty program doesn’t offer a ton of benefits until reaching Platinum status which is reached only after 75 nights of sailing. Even so there are some benefits to joining at lower levels. For instance even Red status members receive a complimentary bottle of water in the cabin that would otherwise be a charge.

That said given it’s free to join there’s no real reason not to sign up. At the very least you can get a few freebies while passengers that sail Carnival regularly can see some even bigger perks.

So in our opinion it’s definitely worth joining Carnival’s VIFP Club. We don’t see a downside.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS92aWRlby8yMDIxLzExLzI4L2Rha2FyLWNhcm5pdmFsLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtY3VsdHVyZXMtb2Ytc2VuZWdhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video.

In recent years an internet legend has grown up around this deal which holds that Pepsi briefly possessed the sixth-largest fleet in the world. In one way that isn’t far off. According to an analysis of Jane’s Fighting Ships 1989-90 a country operating a squadron of 17 submarines would have tied with India for possessing the seventh-largest fleet of attack submarines.

In 1989 PepsiCo Inc. the maker of Pepsi acquired 17 submarines a cruiser a frigate and a destroyer from the Soviet Union. In recent years an internet legend has grown up around this deal which holds that Pepsi briefly possessed the sixth-largest fleet in the world. In one way that isn’t far off. According to an analysis of Jane’s Fighting Ships 1989-90 a country operating a squadron of 17 submarines would have tied with India for possessing the seventh-largest fleet of attack submarines.

Yet in any real sense the story is false. What PepsiCo acquired were small old obsolete unseaworthy vessels. The Pepsi navy no more conferred military power than a rusting Model T could have been a Formula 1 contender. What’s more the ships themselves were immediately turned over to a Norwegian shipyard to be scrapped. PepsiCo was more a middleman than a maritime power.

Most interpretations of the story get its meaning wrong too. The Pepsi navy is sometimes portrayed as an embarrassment for the USSR. Far from it. The multinational firm and the country founded by Vladimir Lenin were business partners and in 1989 Pepsi executives were bullish on Soviet prospects. PepsiCo acquired the rusting fleet as part of a multibillion-dollar bet on the long-term stability of the Soviet Union an enormous market that had little to trade immediately besides raw material and the promise of future profits.

The Pepsi navy isn’t a story from the era of Soviet collapse. It’s from the brief moment right before when the Soviet Union looked likely to survive even though the Cold War had ended. The rusting submarines were one way in which Soviet leaders and Western corporations could establish world peace and a new post-communist prosperity led by business.

American leaders hoped that exposure to Western business could transform the Soviet Union into a country just like theirs. Pepsi executives influenced U.S. policymakers to gain a major advantage in its rivalry with Coca-Cola. Soviet officials saw the deal as part of a larger strategy of external trade that could help revitalize their creaking economy. In the end almost nobody got what they wanted.

Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev tries a cup of Pepsi alongside U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon in Moscow in 1959.

The Pepsi navy begins with one man’s driving ambition to sell soda to Soviets. Bluff hearty and ambitious Donald Kendall started as a worker in a Pepsi-Cola bottling plant but he swiftly climbed the corporate ladder becoming head of the company’s international division by 1957 when he was only in his mid-30s.

As a corporate executive engaged in international business Kendall filled a role sometimes slighted by scholars. Theorists can make international relations seem far removed from everyday experience: nuclear strategy treaty negotiations human rights principles.

Yet formal interactions between governments are only a small part of international relations. Most of what happens among countries concerns something far simpler and more direct: business. International business executives and their attendant lawyers accountants and fixers handle the complexities of cross-border trade and investment but such complex deals still chase a simple goal: making money.

There’s no mystique in that ambition which may explain why it’s written about far less often than the deals of politicians and diplomats. Yet it is the Donald Kendalls not the Henry Kissingers who steer much of international relations. The constant pressure business executives exert as they dig for profit can wear away at even the supposedly rock-solid foundations of national policy. If the quest for profit proves compatible with official objectives so much the better; if not then executives will try to manufacture opportunities to pursue their narrow interests.

These pressures manifest in unexpected ways. In the late 1950s as Kendall assumed his executive role U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower tried to use propaganda to counter the early advantages of the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Soviet leaders could point to the country’s sizzling postwar economic growth rates which outpaced U.S. growth so substantially that even leading American economic textbooks assumed that the USSR would soon overtake the United States. Soviet triumphs in space including the launch of the first artificial satellite Sputnik exemplified the communist world as the wave of the future—and American racial apartheid in the South made the United States seem like the champion of an imperialist past.

One part of Eisenhower’s counteroffensive involved organizing the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow. Eisenhower bet that showing the ordinary bounties of American living as showcased by the wares of such leading brands as Kodak General Electric and Pepsi-Cola would convince the Soviet people that peace was desirable—and more important that they would be better off under capitalism.

The most notable part of the exhibition came with the visit of Eisenhower’s vice president the anti-communist zealot Richard Nixon who escorted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on a tour of the pavilion. The two sparred over the relative merits of their systems in front of a media entourage who broadcast their exchanges.

Eisenhower’s vision of holding an exhibition that would shake the foundations of communism was a bust. But three other men got what they wanted from the display. Khrushchev demonstrated to his domestic audience that the Soviet Union could excel in peaceful competition. Nixon received a huge poll boost and media plaudits for defending the American system.

Kendall was the third. In 1999 he recounted that he had told Nixon the night before the visit that some at Pepsi-Cola headquarters viewed participating in the exhibition as a waste of money. The next day Nixon deftly guided the Soviet premier to the Pepsi booth. Pepsi photographers recorded Nixon and Khrushchev drinking the soda together.

Even though Khrushchev’s verdict on the soda was ambivalent (Time magazine recorded his reaction as “skeptical”) the publicity coup accelerated Kendall’s career. In 1963 Kendall became the company’s president and chief executive officer.

Kendall was now positioned to repay Nixon for the favor. Nixon needed it. He was then best known as a loser both in the 1960 race for president to John F. Kennedy and then humiliatingly the 1962 California governor’s race.

Kendall handed Nixon a lifeline: a promise that whatever law firm took the politician on as a partner would also receive Pepsi-Cola’s legal accounts. The prominent New York law firm Mudge Stern Baldwin & Todd leapt at the sweetener. The deal enriched Nixon and gave him excuses to travel around the country and globe as a Pepsi representative. Thanks to Kendall Nixon was rich and laying the groundwork for a political comeback.

Kendall’s role as a political sugar daddy paid off when Nixon won the presidency in 1968. The most visible return on Kendall’s investment came when the businessman used his relationship to broker one of the first deals between the Soviet Union and an American firm in the Cold War period. In the 1920s U.S. companies like Ford Motor Co. had been prominent in the Soviet Union which idolized American management practices but they exited the market before World War II.

In 1972 Kendall and Soviet officials announced a deal that would exchange equivalent values of Pepsi for Soviet vodkas made by Stolichnaya and Sovetskaya. Not only would Pepsi become the first American soft drink available in the USSR but the deal also locked Coca-Cola out of the Soviet market.

Nixon’s friendship paved the way for the deal. In 1971 U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger’s deputy Alexander Haig lobbied Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin to have the Soviets accept a trade delegation Kendall would head. In one of his regular phone calls with Nixon and his aides Kendall asked Kissinger (whom he greeted with “Hello handsome”) to press Kremlin leaders to finalize the deal. The Soviets got the message: This deal mattered to Nixon personally.

In a 1975 meeting in Geneva Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko wondered why the Soviets had Pepsi but not Coca-Cola. Dobrynin diplomatically observed that it was because “their chairman is more energetic.” Kissinger more bluntly said it was because Kendall “was a friend.”

Kissinger was not always so generous. In a 1973 meeting with the AFL-CIO’s foreign-policy adviser Kissinger thanked organized labor for their support of the president’s foreign policy and exclaimed “The businessmen in this country are a disgrace. Look at Kendall of Pepsi-Cola he would sell the country for a contract.”

The Pepsi-for-vodka swap may have been consistent with Nixon’s policy of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States but it was also a triumph for Kendall. The 1972 PepsiCo annual report featured a two-page photo spread of Kendall standing in front of the iconic St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow’s Red Square with a quote that made him sound more like a statesman than an executive: “I have long believed that trade between nations could help to build bridges of greater understanding between different cultures and economic systems.” Kendall was asserting that private enterprise could succeed in ways that the Kissingers of the world could not—that he could have both the profits of a salesman and the mystique of a statesman.

The deal faced obstacles. The cumbersome Stolichnaya-for-soda swap resulted from the difficulties of trading with a communist country outside the normal trading rules of the capitalist world. Because Soviet currency the ruble could not be traded on international markets and the Soviet Union hoarded its reserves of hard international currencies every deal involved complicated time-consuming and risky exchanges of material goods not the simple ease of currency.

Other obstacles were political. Jewish groups in the Soviet Union boycotted Pepsi charging that the deal placed profits before the rights of Soviet citizens of Jewish descent locked inside the country. (Soviet policy required Jewish emigres to pay exorbitant fees.) Activists in Congress linked U.S.-Soviet trade and human rights to block a planned 75 percent reduction of U.S. tariffs on imports including those of Stolichnaya.

Political and economic challenges could also combine especially as detente crumbled later in the 1970s. PepsiCo aggressively marketed Stolichnaya as an authentically Soviet vodka. That left the brand open to boycotts when Cold War tensions ran high as when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan or a Soviet fighter jet shot down a Korean Air Lines passenger aircraft in 1983.

Still Pepsi’s Soviet market grew and by 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev took power in the USSR Pepsi had built 16 bottling plants there.

What were the Soviets getting out of all this? For Soviet leaders after Joseph Stalin trade with the West offered many advantages something they repeatedly made clear. Khrushchev stressed Soviet openness to trade when he met a delegation of U.S. state governors weeks before the American exhibition opened in Moscow.

Trade in such raw materials as gold and oil offered the Soviet Union the ability to earn hard currency which it could use to purchase advanced equipment (or when the harvest failed food) on world markets. Yet Soviet leaders conscious of their disadvantages relative to the leading technologically sophisticated capitalist countries also found commercial dealings to be a promising way to import more sophisticated technology. In 1966 for example the Italian automaker Fiat signed an accord to build a major automobile factory in a partnership with Soviet industry an investment whose impact in real terms far exceeded that of the Pepsi deal.

In the early 1970s Soviet leaders hoped that the Pepsi agreement would be only the first in a series of more such deals with the United States Western Europe and Japan. Reform-minded technocrats calculated that the occasionally pragmatic Nixon administration offered a window to accelerate Soviet growth. When the U.S. Congress tied human rights to the trade deal it weakened those reformers and detente—which were dealt another blow by the ascent of the hard-line anti-communist U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

Gorbachev’s ascent meant a return to the broad Soviet policy of international relaxation economic cooperation and domestic reform. Yet circumstances had changed. Western businesses were now warier of the political risks associated with trade with the Soviet Union. They had also learned at great cost about the less dramatic but real headaches involved with doing business in the Soviet Union: customs hassles contract violations truculent workers a primitive financial system and creaking logistics.

Despite those hardships American brands including McDonald’s Pizza Hut (also owned by PepsiCo at the time) and even Baskin-Robbins cautiously entered the liberalizing Soviet market. Even Coca-Cola entered the market (in a limited way with its flagship Coke at first only available in hard-currency stores open to tourists) when Pepsi’s exclusive deal expired.

There were some secondary benefits from entering the Soviet market: Pepsi ran television ads in the United States implying that its sodas had caused glasnost. The more important bet was on the long term. Executives like Kendall still thought that such hassles would be worth building a business that could be profitable as the reforming Soviet economy took off. Corporations got the best of all worlds: the ability to out-compete bumbling Soviet firms while using clout to exclude foreign rivals.

1989 turned out to be an axial year. Tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in June. The Berlin Wall fell in November. Less remembered but almost as important to observers at the time was that the Soviet Union held meaningful elections for its new legislative body the Congress of People’s Deputies another step that seemed to confirm the power of Gorbachev and reformers.

That was the environment in which PepsiCo concluded the deal that delivered the Pepsi navy. The ruble was still worthless internationally and Stolichnaya’s growth prospects were more limited than in 1972 so enlarging Pepsi’s sales in the USSR meant turning to new sources of revenue.

These were the circumstances in which PepsiCo struck the deal for the submarines and other vessels. The novelty of the submarine trade grabbed headlines even at the time but PepsiCo never even took possession of the watercraft. As the Associated Press reported in July 1989 PepsiCo was just the middleman for the vessels bound for the scrap heap which went to a Norwegian ship-breaker instead.

Indeed there was little notable about the sale of the submarines except that it involved Pepsi. The Soviet navy had begun selling its obsolete and unseaworthy vessels for scrap in the late 1980s one component of a flood of scrap exported from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Economist reported in 1990 that the Eastern bloc glut had contributed to scrap prices’ slide from 70 British pounds (over $100 at the time) per ton to less than 40 pounds per ton in only a few months. By then a Soviet Whiskey-class submarine could be had for $50000 or a destroyer for $400000. Even at those prices they were hardly worth the cost of ship-breaking not least because Soviet ships could contain loads of asbestos. Hard-liners in the West warned that such deals could simply help fund Soviet naval modernization making the Soviet navy of the 1990s a far more formidable foe.

The sale of the Pepsi vessels for scrap may have been worth a few million dollars which brought the Soviet navy much-needed hard currency. Yet it was a sideshow. The real soda-for-ships deal involved ships that would work. Initially PepsiCo arranged for its vodka countertrade arrangement to include two 28000-ton Soviet oil tankers which PepsiCo bought in a joint arrangement with a Norwegian shipping firm run by a friend of Kendall’s. In April 1989 according to the Financial Times PepsiCo joined a similar bigger deal with a Soviet trade organization and two Norwegian firms valued at nearly $2.6 billion to deliver as many as 85 Soviet-built ships over a decade. (The reported value of the deal varies by source possibly because American firms that were engaged in bartering could understate their true value to avoid tariffs and taxes.)

Pepsi announced the deal would double its sales of soda inside the Soviet Union over a decade and enable it to open Pizza Huts in the country. The Norwegian partners would handle the marketing of the Soviet ships (and bear the risks of selling the vessels). And the Soviet Union would receive not only a market for its ships but also investment by the Norwegian partners to overhaul shipyards where the vessels would be built.

With a reformist government moving forward executives such as Kendall assured themselves that the future looked bright for their investments in the Soviet Union. But one consequence of liberalization was a new wave of public criticism. Anatoly Sobchak the democratic mayor of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) attacked the expanded Pepsi deal as an exercise in “gigantomania” that would destabilize the market. Kendall ruefully observed in early 1991 that it had been easy to do business with the centralized economy before Gorbachev but “Dealing in a democracy in the Soviet Union today is much more difficult.”

Yet the fact that those objections could be voiced seemed only to confirm that reform was real and that progress was possible. On July 30 1991 U.S. President George H.W. Bush announced major steps toward full trade normalization. “My country stands ready to assist in this new Soviet revolution” Bush said. But Bush cautioned “Western governments—with their own strapped resources—are limited in what they can do. So we must bring together the businessmen from Europe and America and their partners from all across the Soviet Union.” Finally Kendall’s vision would be realized: Western capitalism would end the Cold War and get rich in the process.

Less than three weeks later hard-line forces launched a coup against Gorbachev. Within months leaders of key Soviet republics dissolved the union. On Dec. 25 1991 Gorbachev resigned as president of the USSR which vanished with the stroke of his pen.

To be sure Pepsi’s interests in Russia didn’t disappear. In 2020 PepsiCo reported revenue of $3 billion in Russia its third-largest market behind Mexico and the United States. In 2004 Kendall received the Order of Friendship for his contributions to Russian commerce from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yet there was no longer any mystique. Russia was now just one developing and newly competitive market among many.

The Pepsi navy has been remade as part of a narrative in which Soviet collapse was inevitable a can-you-believe-this story about an American victory lap over a terminally ill enemy. It fits the era of economic chaos that followed when the Russian economy crumbled oligarchs plundered industries and resources and military stockpiles—with functioning weapons not rusted submarines—really were traded on the black market.

But the thesis that foreign economic trade and investment could transform a moribund communist economy was tried in the People’s Republic of China at about the same time. Chinese technocrats wagered that international firms would bring new techniques and experience. And just as the Soviets gave Pepsi a monopoly in exchange for these benefits China granted Coca-Cola exclusive rights to its market in 1978.

Perhaps the Soviet Union could not have managed what China accomplished. Yet the idea that only one communist juggernaut could succeed was far from obvious at the time. Had events unfolded the way Kendall hoped and Gorbachev planned the 1990s might have been a decade of democratization and economic growth for a strengthening Soviet Union. And the story of how Pepsi scrapped 17 Soviet submarines to cement its hold on the Soviet market would have been just one among thousands about how American investments helped a former foe become an economic competitor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjgvY29tcGFyaXNvbi1iZXR3ZWVuLWFsdHVnLWFuZC1idHItNG12MS1hcm1vcmVkLXBlcnNvbm5lbC1jYXJyaWVycy_SAWpodHRwczovL2J1bGdhcmlhbm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI4L2NvbXBhcmlzb24tYmV0d2Vlbi1hbHR1Zy1hbmQtYnRyLTRtdjEtYXJtb3JlZC1wZXJzb25uZWwtY2FycmllcnMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparison between Altug and BTR-4MV1 armored personnel carriers,"The comparison article were made by Defense Express.

KYIV ($1=27.09 Ukrainian Hryvnia) – BMC’s Altuğ 8×8 is the latest Turkish armored personnel carrier which was first demonstrated publicly only a few months ago. It is positioned as the top solution of the Turkish defense industry in the field of wheeled armored vehicles absorbing the most technological developments.

Defense Express during the SAHA exhibition in Istanbul had the opportunity to see Altuğ in detail and compare it in absentia with the latest Ukrainian serial armored vehicle – BTR-4 and its more powerful version BTR-4MV1 which unfortunately has not interested the Ukrainian military.

The first thing that catches your eye is the dimensions of the Turkish Altuğ whose height on board is 2.65 meters and with a combat module of almost 4 meters.

For comparison the height of the BTR-4 is 2.8 meters which is primarily due to the desire to make the car less visible on the battlefield.

And at first glance it seems that inside the much larger Altuğ has much more space. But in reality this is not the case the car which is designed for 3 crew members and 9 fighters does not differ much in internal volume.

And the main reason for this height of the case – in providing mine protection thanks to the V-shaped bottom. At a time when the BTR-4 only after additional measures the flat bottom was reinforced with another armor plate with spaced armor.

At the same time in Altuğ the use of a V-shaped bottom has resulted in all hydropneumatic suspension components being outside the armored hull and a ground clearance of 40 cm.

In general Altuğ has good passability including overcoming trenches over 2 meters wide. And all the wheels of the armored personnel carrier are rotary which makes the car quite maneuverable.

But the Turkish armored personnel carrier unlike the Ukrainian does not float. The maximum depth of the ford for it is only 120 cm however given the geography of Turkey this figure is not a global negative factor.

The approach to arming the machine also needs attention. At the SAHA exhibition Altuğ was demonstrated with a combat module for 12.7×99 mm and 7.62×51 mm machine guns. This is the so-called version of the APC (armored personnel carrier) which in NATO countries is an armored personnel carrier in the sense of a combat vehicle whose main task is to safely deliver fighters to the battlefield.

At the same time there is a version with a combat module for a 35-mm automatic gun. This module from Aselsan is a modified version of the module from the promising crawler BMP Korhan. The more armed version of the Altuğ was designated the IFV [infantry fighting vehicle] – an armored infantry vehicle.

Another interesting feature of Turkish design is the maximum use of ceramic armor. The machine in all projections is additionally protected by panels which in case of damage can be easily replaced in the field.

But this is not the only means by which Turkish developers have protected their cars as much as possible. Attention was paid to reducing the visibility of Altuğ in the thermal range. In particular the heat from the engine is dissipated in the wheel arches and the exhaust gases are directed downwards.

A huge bet was made on the use of modern protection systems. These include laser radiation sensors an acoustic shot detector an active protection complex and an REB complex for suppressing radio-controlled landmines. The machine is also integrated into the digital military control system type C4I.

Unfortunately we did not see any ceramic armor or similar level of additional protection systems on any Ukrainian armored personnel carrier or infantry fighting vehicle. Although some developments in these areas in Ukraine already exist and may well compete in effectiveness with Western models.

Interestingly the weight of the Turkish armored vehicle remains a mystery. And although BMC does not disclose the weight of Altuğ it is most likely about 30 tons. And this is much more than the BTR-4 even in the MV1 version which weighs about 23 tons.

The maximum speeds of Ukrainian and Turkish armored personnel carriers are the same – up to 110 km / h. But if the 450-horsepower German Deutz is installed in the BTR-4 then the American 711-horsepower Caterpillar is installed in the Turkish armored personnel carrier. Interestingly Ukrainian and Turkish developers focused on one transmission supplier – Allison. In any case the maximum speeds of cars are the same – up to 110 km / h.

In general what conclusions can be drawn after such a correspondence comparison of Altuğ with BTR-4? The naked eye can see the difference when providing high mine protection crosses the size requirements. And the weight of 30 tons the rejection of amphibians and the widespread use of the latest technologies allow ensuring the reliable safety of the crew from enemy fire.

It should be emphasized that the “recipes” for which Altuğ was created are not Turkish know-how but follow modern Western trends in the development of armored vehicles. The same solutions can be seen in models such as the latest versions of the Finnish Patria or the German Boxer.

Of course these “recipes” are not a panacea. However they fully reflect the vector in which the world moves in the creation of such machines and in seeing their place on the battlefield.

AMMAN — Jordanians marched in downtown Amman on Friday in protest against the signing of a declaration document of intent by Jordan the UAE and Israel.

During the demonstration near Al Husseini Mosque in downtown Amman after Friday prayer the demonstrators called on the government to revoke the declaration.

The demonstrators who held banners with slogans rejecting normalisation and going ahead with the deal also called for severing the 1994 Wadi Araba peace treaty.

Stressing on their rejection to deal with the ""Zionist entity"" the protestors called on the Jordanian government to focus on alternative local solutions and sources for water supply other than increasing reliance on Israel.

Last Monday Jordan the UAE and Israel signed a declaration of intent to negotiate the feasibility of a joint energy and water project.

The declaration of intent aims to conduct a feasibility study in 2022 for the joint project under which Jordan could get 200 million cubic metres of water a year.

A solar plant is to be built under the project and electricity will be provided to Israel.

Jordan receives 35 million cubic metres of water annually in accordance with the peace treaty in addition to the 10 million cubic metres outside the treaty that was agreed upon in 2010.

For other sources Jordan depends on the collection of rainwater and groundwater. The water share per capita in Jordan is 80 cubic metres compared with a global average of 500 cubic metres per capita.

Omar Shoshan chairman of the Jordanian Environmental Union noted that there will be no direct benefit from the project for the environmental sector especially in terms of climate change in Jordan as it will not help mitigate or improve the impact of the noticeable climate change in the Kingdom.

Shoshan also highlighted the importance of the National Water Carrier Project which he described as “sustainable and important” as it works greatly with the adaptation to the scarcity of water resources and climate change in the Kingdom.

“It would have been best to rely on local sources to confront the problem of climate change and its impact on the water sector by cooperating with international partners to carry out the National Water Carrier Project without delay” he added.

Following the announcement of the deal several Jordanians voiced their rejection of the declaration.

Mohammad Alawad a Twitter user tweeted in Arabic saying that the National Water Carrier Project must be implemented as it is “the largest water project in the Kingdom and would make great profits”.

He said the priority should be focusing on alternative local resources.

Twitter user Sondos tweeted in Arabic voicing her anger over the signed deal: “This agreement makes the future of Jordan's water security dependent on the Israeli occupation and we as Jordanians completely reject all kinds of normalisation with Israel.”"

Junior members of local musical theatre group Burnham Excellent Entertainment Society (BEES) one of Somerset’s longest running drama groups performed the show on Saturday November 27th at 7pm and Sunday 28th November at 3pm in the Princess Theatre.

The club’s Vikki Hart says: “With this being BEES’ first time back on stage in two years due to the pandemic we were excited to bring audiences a zany but shortened musical adapted specially for junior performers based on the 1951 Disney film and the novels by Lewis Carroll.”

“Audiences followed Alice as she navigated the curious world of Wonderland on her journey of self-discovery encountering the ever-tardy White Rabbit the grinning Cheshire Cat a cool Caterpillar a Mad Hatter a Queen with quite a temper and many more of literature’s beloved Wonderland characters.”

This musical includes favourites from the Disney cannon such as “I’m Late” “The Unbirthday Song” and “Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah” in a charming updated retelling of the Lewis Carroll classic.

Vikki adds: “Whether this is your first experience with Alice or your hundredth you’ll lose your head (and your heart) for Alice in Wonderland Jr!”

“BEES would like to thank Burnham-on-Sea & Highbridge Town Council and Sedgemoor District Council because without their valued funding assistance this year’s production would not be possible.”

Those appearing were: Alice Eva; Caterpillar/Two of Clubs Bethan; Cheshire Cat 1/Daisy Gracie; Cheshire Cat 2 Evelyn; Cheshire Cat 3 Cameron; Dodo/Ace of Spades George; Lily Xanthe; Mad Hatter/Lobster Amelia; March Hare/King of Hearts/Lobster Hannah; Mathilda Ava; Queen of Hearts Maisie; Rose Grace; Sea Creature Florence; Sea Creature Edie; Sea Creature Belle; Small Alice Mia; Tweedle Dee/Violet/Three of Diamonds Lillie; Tweedle Dum/Doorknob/Petunia/Four of Hearts Elissa; White Rabbit Robyn.

That’s because Turner Construction Company which just signed a 13-year 75000-square-foot lease is actually building the new Tishman Speyer tower on the far West Side. Turner is the general contractor on the BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group-designed skyscraper with a top-to-bottom landscaped spiral of exterior terraces.

Turner is moving its worldwide headquarters to the third floor of the tower aka 66 Hudson Boulevard between West 34th and 35th streets. It will relocate from 375 Hudson St. in January 2023.



The deal brings The Spiral’s 2.8 million square feet to 54 percent leased with a year left before it’s completed.

Turner handles $12 billion of construction each year worldwide. Tishman Speyer President and CEO Rob Speyer called the firm “an incredible partner as we built The Spiral introducing technology safety and workforce innovations that make it a new standard for modern office development.”

Turner CEO Peter Davoren said the building “will provide us with an environment that so well defines our vision and the future of the company.”

The Spiral will also be home to COVID-beating vaccine maker Pfizer the anchor tenant with 746000 square feet.

Large leases were also signed by law firm Debevoise & Plimpton and AllianceBernstein.



Terms of the Turner deal were not released. Asking rents in the tower have been reported as ranging from $110 per square foot at the base to $225-plus per square foot at the top.

A CBRE team of Mary Ann Tighe Rob Hill Brendan Herlihy and Elliot Bok advised Turner on the deal. Tishman Speyer was repped by an in-house leasing team.

When news broke last week that Chubb signed on as the first tenant at 550 Madison Ave. — a deal that we first forecast three months earlier — observers Realty Check included were curious what the lease terms were.

The first tenant at a new development or redevelopment typically gets a more favorable deal than those that follow.

We’ve now learned that Chubb will enjoy 12 months of free rent as part of a 20-year term according to sources.

Once the 12 months are up the rent will increase in stages from $110 to $140 per square foot on floors 10 to 17 and from $160 to $190 per square foot on floors 36 to 38.

For a street where nobody wants to shop anymore — as lots of off-base media reports claim — it’s remarkable how the prime stretch of Madison Avenue north of 59th Street continues to draw luxury retailers even as some others move away.

The newest arrival will be Italian menswear maker Kiton at currently vacant 692 Madison Ave. between East 62nd and 63rd streets. Kiton just signed a lease for a three-level 3400-square-foot boutique next door to scarf and bag emporium Hermès — which will soon move into a much larger space at 702 Madison.

“This deal is a true testament to luxury retail in the city” said broker Marc Sitt of Kassin Sabbagh Realty who with Dorel Melloul represented the landlord at 692 Madison the Ezair family.

“With Hermès opening their new flagship this corridor will be more vibrant than it was in previous years. We’re happy we structured a lease which made sense for everyone” Sitt added.

Hermès will soon house its men’s and women’s collections in one building at 702 Madison.

Kiton is expected to move in next summer. The store will also remain at 4 E. 54th St. a building owned by Kiton.

The Madison Avenue asking rent was $1.2 million per year.

Kiton was repped by Cushman & Wakefield’s Alan Wildes and Ian Lerner. Sitt also credited Kiton lawyer Massimo D’angelo for playing an important role in the deal.

Other recent nearby retail transactions include Celine at 650 Madison Ave. and Balenciaga at 620 Madison.

Prolific architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox has renewed its lease and expanded at Tishman Speyer’s 11 W. 42nd St. KPF added 38000 square feet on the entire seventh floor bringing its total in the 1928-vintage building — known for its fine views and abundance of natural light — to more than 100000 square feet.

The rent started in the low $60s per square foot sources said. As part of the deal KPF will enjoy one year of free rent on the expansion floor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uZXJvb2YuY28ubnovbmV3cy9jaHJpc3RjaHVyY2gtc2hvcHBpbmctY2VudHJlLXNhbGUtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1yZXRhaWwtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtNDA1NjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christchurch shopping centre sale highlights retail investments All things property under OneRoof,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.oneroof.co.nz/news/christchurch-shopping-centre-sale-highlights-retail-investments-40562 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uZXJvb2YuY28ubnovbmV3cy9jaHJpc3RjaHVyY2gtc2hvcHBpbmctY2VudHJlLXNhbGUtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1yZXRhaWwtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtNDA1NjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

CB,Chubb Limited,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI4L3dhbnQtdG8td29yay1pbi1pdC1sb29rLWZvci1hLXBhaWQtYXBwcmVudGljZXNoaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to work in IT? Look for a paid apprenticeship,"When Cartomu Kabba graduated from high school last year instead of continuing education or looking for a job she landed a paid apprenticeship to combine the best of both worlds. “I felt like this was a good path because I was more interested in learning and working at the same time since I felt that would be more effective for me” said Kabba.

The 19-year-old Bronx resident heard about paid apprenticeships from Code Nation a program that teaches people how to code. She applied through Multiverse a platform that matches apprentices with 12- to 18-month opportunities among their 300 clients who often offer salaries between $50000 and $70000 per year. Kabba created a profile and was matched with insurance company Chubb.

She started her 12-month apprenticeship this past March on a remote team working on Blink a startup within Chubb and has been focusing on bringing insurance to consumers in a digital channel.

“I’m getting a dual learning experience on the technical side of using data and the business side on how a company grows from the very beginning” said Kabba. “I’ll be learning how to create a database from scratch instead of only understanding the analytics”

Although apprenticeships are often associated with skilled trades they’re now emerging for these kinds of white-collar jobs. According to the US Department of Labor apprenticeships combine on-the-job training with instruction to prepare workers for highly skilled careers are typically paid and involve a structured training plan with an intention to master specific skills.

Kabba’s days toggle between working on tasks and learning a skill for another project like Python or Microsoft Azure along with attending monthly Multiverse boot camp sessions. The boot camps are taught by Multiverse coaches — she’s already learned Excel SQL Power Bi Python and basics of data analytics. On a monthly basis Kabba meets with her Multiverse coach to review objectives to focus on to improve technical skills like Python and soft skills like engagement.

“I think the apprenticeship will definitely help pave the way for a future full-time job because I have real-life experience and that’s always very important in a workplace especially in a field like data where change is very rapid” she said.

Multiverse concurs: Most apprentices (87 percent) remain at their companies full time after completion of the program and many are offered the apprenticeship on that basis.

Phyllis Mooney executive director of career services at Pace University said these hands-on learning and working opportunities typically provide phenomenal insight into a company’s culture leadership preparation and unmatched networking opportunities.

4 Cartomu Kabba says her paid apprenticeship supported by Multiverse will eventually lead to “a future full-time job.” Stefano Giovannini

“A lot of employers use these programs to pipeline full-time talent. It’s also relevant work experience for your resume if you move on from the host employer. The learning is constant as is the feedback” said Mooney.

It’s a win-win according to Gorick Ng Harvard career adviser and author of “The Unspoken Rules” (Harvard Business Review Press). “Apprenticeships are internships with the promise of mentorship pay and learning. That’s a great deal! For employers apprenticeships are a great way to build your leadership bench not to mention a loyal workforce.”

4 Phyllis Mooney executive director career services at Pace University claims employers use apprenticeship programs as a “pipeline” to develop talent. Stefano Giovannini

Apprentices can reap several additional benefits aside from the pay and continuous learning and work aspects. Ng said “Financial capital — money — isn’t the only thing you can get from an apprenticeship (or really any work experience). This is also your chance to build your human capital (what you know and can do) social capital (who you know) and reputational capital (who knows you and for what).”

Access to apprenticeships isn’t limited to college-age adults. After working in retail for 10 years 30-something Steven Hubbard had his sights set on an IT career but there’s that pesky catch-22: You can’t get a job without experience and you can’t get experience without a job.

In 2015 he applied for a full-time role at Maxx Potential a consulting firm offering apprenticeships in technology. Apprentices get assigned a highly skilled mentor a peer buddy a development coach and they have access to network with other apprentices through meet-ups and study groups like hangouts for crypto.

By acquiring new skills and learning about the cloud databases programming securities and how domain name systems work all while getting paid Hubbard felt prepared to ace job interviews when he left Maxx in 2017.

“They’re [employers are] saying ‘Tell me what you would do during this situation.’ Well I can tell you what I actually did.”

“Without Maxx Potential and that support network and learning system I wouldn’t have been able to transition into what I’m doing now or it would have been incredibly difficult” said Hubbard.

Since completing the apprenticeship he landed full-time roles as a front-end web developer and solutions architect nearly doubling his salary every time he scored a new job. Now the Richmond Va. resident is employed as an enterprise architect for Cockroach Labs a Chelsea-based company that helps organizations manage their data.

Kimberly Mahan founder and partner at Maxx Potential said most apprenticeships last around 14 months during which time apprentices advance to higher levels in quality assurance and testing application maintenance and support information security software development and data management and reporting.

‘“We operate like any other consulting firm. We’re building the minor league — a farm feeder system to senior consulting firms” said Mahan. “We create an environment where folks are always learning. Think about it before you sign [student] loan papers.

We can get you experience so you can get in — and most employers have tuition reimbursement programs so you can get your degree later. What you need to get into the door more than anything is real-world experience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVoaWdocmVwb3J0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI4LzIyODA1MzMyL2Jyb25jb3MtY2hhcmdlcnMtbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW0taG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLW9ubGluZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Denver Broncos vs Los Angeles Chargers live stream 2021 for Week 12,"The Denver Broncos can get right back into the thick of the AFC West battle with a win this week over the visiting Los Angeles Chargers. A win would put all three AFC West teams a game back from the Kansas City Chiefs. That would be a much better place than Denver has been by Week 12 in each of the last give seasons.

Game Preview

In a bit of a surprising move the Broncos went ahead and activated Bradley Chubb off of injured reserve on Saturday making him eligible to play against the Chargers. He had a setback during practice this week but Denver went ahead and activated him anyway to play.

We have partnered with Homage to bring fans Denver Broncos apparel. We appreciate your support!

Head coach Vic Fangio noted that he would be on a pitch count but this fan worries they are once again rushing Chubb back too soon. There will be a lot of fan angst on Twitter if Chubb hobbles off the field during the game. Staying healthy for long stretches of time has been a thing with Chubb so fans are rightfully concerned the issue has less to do with Chubb being injury-prone and more to do with coaches impatiently pushing him back onto the field too quickly.

Anyway I digress. A healthy Chubb on the field is a better situation for the Broncos than him not being on the field. I like Malik Reed but he has been a liability at times in run support and Chubb is definitely the better of the two in both run defense and rushing the passer. I just hope Chubb doesn’t aggravate his injury and it caused him to miss several more games when resting one additional week would have meant him being ability the rest of the season.

Here’s how to watch.

Instead of a relatively unobstructed view of Cedar and Rattlesnake mountains overlooking the city now anyone looking that way will see a large yellow crane. It’s waiting in eager anticipation to help build a controversial Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple that a group of local residents are trying to stop in Park County District court.

Later this month a final hearing will be held in the lawsuit that was filed by neighbors of the proposed temple site and others trying to block its construction.

The decision made by Johnson County Judge John R. Perry coming out of the May 23 hearing will likely determine if construction of the temple can begin.

In the meantime the church seems ready to start as soon as it’s able with a host of large shipping containers with components of the temple being moved to the temple site off Skyline Drive.

Outrage

Many in Cody expressed outrage on social media this week that not only had the crane been moved to the proposed site but so have modular units for the proposed Cody LDS temple. These storage units contain materials for the 101-foot-tall temple’s construction.

The church announced in a press release this week that because the previous spot the containers were stored is no longer available it had to move them to a site adjacent to where the temple will be built.

As first reported by Cowboy State Daily in 2023 these items were being stored at Y-Tex Corp. a business owned by a member of the church who had donated the land for the temple.

“This new storage location will avoid future crossings of public roads with these modular units during the temple construction” said Jimmie Edwards second counselor for the LDS Cody Wyoming Stake in a press release. “The church is not yet commencing construction of the temple.”

The church owns the temple property and is fully allowed to use the site to keep the containers there.

But many locals say the optics look bad and that it serves as evidence that construction of the temple is inevitable.

Others defend the project saying it’s hypocritical that critics aren’t similarly outraged about two historic buildings that were torn down in the city earlier this year.

Not So?

The nearly 10000-square-foot temple sparked controversy mainly because of the size of the building and its steeple on an almost 5-acre piece of land overlooking Cody. Some living in the neighborhood say the steeple will destroy their viewshed and the temple will have other negative impacts like ruining the night sky and creating more traffic.

The temple dispute is a topic that has dragged on for more than a year in Cody. The issue has riled up the community causing a clear divide between those who support and oppose the project.

Cody resident Dylan Wood who runs youth ministries in town said he’s very disappointed with how some people have been speaking about the temple online particularly those he knows to be of the Christian faith using scripture in what he sees as a distrustful and hateful manner.

“There’s been some really hateful stuff from people who are ‘Christians’ and it really hurts my heart” he said.

Wood said people need to remember the Ten Commandments which state that “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

Although he’s under no illusion that Cody is perfect Wood said many people seem to prefer being upset about something rather than appreciating the positivity in the community around them. Five years down the road after the temple is finished Wood believes the community will have already forgotten about it.

Carla Egelhoff an organizer with Protect Our Cody Neighborhoods (POCN) a group fighting the church in court hasn’t forgotten about the temple yet. Egelhoff said she isn’t personally bothered by the materials being moved to the temple site but has no idea if the church is telling the truth about why it is moving them.

Optimism

Egelhoff said she believes her group’s case is strong. POCN is challenging the decision made by the Cody Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) to allow construction of the temple last August.

“POCN has entered compelling legal arguments based on the Wyoming State Statutes and Cody city ordinances in support of a decision to reverse the PZB decisions and remand the conditional use permit and the site plan back to the City of Cody” Egelhoff said.

If the judge doesn’t rule in POCN’s favor Egelhoff said the group will consider filing an appeal with the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Egelhoff also mentioned how the Cody City Council approved a number of changes as a result of how the temple approval process played out. Most notably this includes more deference to the city’s master plan and notification to landowners in a larger range around a proposed project for a conditional use permit (CUP).

According to the Cody Enterprise  under the new code if 20% or more of the property owners object to a project the PZB can only make a recommendation to the city council which then gets the final decision. In the past only Planning and Zoning Board members had a final say on CUPs.

“The change of number of neighbor notifications and handling of nearby affected property owners input is welcomed at this time” Eglehoff said. “Significant opposition to requests that are outside of current zoning ordinances ought to be addressed by elected officials. More opportunities for citizen participation will be positive for Cody into the future.”

Also when a site plan is under consideration there now must be approval from the majority of the board not just the members present at a meeting which aligns with Wyoming law. This had been a major source of contention at a meeting last summer where a majority of the board members present at a meeting rejected its site plan not the board as a whole.

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

When President Russell M. Nelson said “the highest and noblest work in this life is that of a mother” in the April 1999 general conference he was talking to all women past present and future.

He along with other Church leaders honors mothers and women all around the world. In honor of Mother’s Day in the United States on Sunday May 12 listed below are quotes from each member of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about motherhood and womanhood.

Every woman a mother

President Russell M. Nelson | The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

“No one can duplicate the influence of a mother. ... Anytime I use the word ‘mother’ I am not talking only about women who have given birth or adopted children in this life. I am speaking about all of our heavenly parents’ adult daughters. Every woman is a mother by virtue of her eternal divine destiny.”

Demolished church being replaced,"JENISON MI – People driving along busy Baldwin Street over the past week may have noticed a cross-adorned steeple sticking out of a pile of rubble.

The work demolishing a church and accessory building are part of a project to build a private daycare and early learning center for children 6 weeks old through kindergarten on the property at 1675 Baldwin St. in Georgetown Township.

The facility will be operated by Primrose Schools an Atlanta-based chain with more than 500 early childhood education centers across the U.S. including one in Michigan near Ann Arbor.

Officials with Primrose Schools say the demolition is complete and the school is expected to be open a year from now. They anticipate having capacity for up to 200 children and will also provide an afterschool program.

“Children at Primrose schools benefit from the exclusive time-tested Balanced Learning approach” Primrose Schools officials said in a statement to MLive/The Grand Rapids Press. “Created from the best early education wisdom it balances purposeful play with nurturing guidance from teachers to encourage curiosity creativity confidence and compassion.”

The 3.68-acre site was formerly home to the First Reformed Protestant Church which sold the property to real estate development firm EIG14T in September 2023 for $925000 according to Ottawa County property records.

Officials with the First Reformed Protestant Church could not be reached.

Primrose Schools said it wouldn’t have been feasible due to building size and cost to refit the existing church and accessory building for the early childhood education center.

According to township planning documents there is no record of when the church was built. Records show there was an addition to the main church building in 1987 and that the additional building was constructed on the site in 1997.

Since the 1980s the church has had different designations including Baldwin Heights Baptist Solomon’s Porch Community Church and finally First Reformed Protestant Church.

The church changed hands to the First Reformed Protestant Church in May 2021 when it purchased the property for $750000 from Solomon’s Porch Community Church according to Ottawa County property records.

That same year the Association for Covenantal Reformed Education had received special land use approval for a proposed private K-12 school on the property but that school never came to fruition according to township documents."

With the team’s merry-go-round of general manager candidates and general inactivity the offseason trajectory for the Mets had not been trending in the right direction heading into Thanksgiving weekend. In the span of just a few hours however the team drastically altered the course of its immediate future with a flurry of Friday night moves that cost over $120 million in guaranteed money.

The Mets added a trio of hitters—infielder Eduardo Escobar and outfielders Mark Canha and Starling Marte—in rapid succession striking quickly under new general manager Billy Eppler to overhaul the team’s offense. Beyond the cluster in which these additions occurred perhaps the most striking aspect to the moves is that they seem so ... pragmatic?

This is a franchise whose dysfunction and at times downright buffoonery has spawned its own adjective—”Metsiness”—to illustrate its tendency to stand in its own way. But in adding three quality if not cream-of-the-crop free agents who receive plaudits for their clubhouse presence New York has quickly infused a degree of competency and stability that will go a long way toward raising the floor for the franchise in the years to come—and could be a catalyst to a quick turnaround following a disappointing 2021.

First a look at the players who have been acquired. Marte is the most impactful (and expensive) of the bunch. A two-time Gold Glove award winner entering his age-33 season he led the majors with 47 stolen bases last season and set career highs in wRC+ (134) on-base percentage (.383) and walk rate (8.8%) while splitting time between Miami and Oakland. Handing out a four-year deal to a 33-year-old center fielder is a dicey proposition yet Marte remains strong enough defensively to stay at the position for the immediate future and his offensive profile—especially when factoring in an improved batting eye—is one that could age well. Marte undoubtedly had other teams after him and agreeing to a fourth year might have been a deciding factor in the Mets' being able to land him.

Canha another former A's outfielder entering his age-33 season has been among the most underrated hitters over the last few seasons. He’s batted .249/.366/.441 over the past four seasons and is strong defensively. He Marte and Brandon Nimmo should form a formidable defense in the grass.

Aside from a miserable pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign Escobar has been an above-average regular since 2017 with at least 21 home runs in each non-abbreviated season. His ability to play any position except shortstop in the infield gives New York some flexibility going forward as they're going to have to make some hard decisions about a few of their incumbent position players.

The trio’s arrival in Queens complicates matters for Jeff McNeil J.D. Davis and Dominic Smith whose paths to playing time are now murkier. Even if the Mets don’t add any more pieces there is no clear path to regular at-bats for any of them. Having too many competent hitters is a good problem for a team that scored the fourth-fewest runs in the majors last season.

These additions may help the club’s run prevention as much as it does the offense. The Mets had fielders playing out of position frequently last season with McNeil and Smith frequently manning the outfield. Though a primary third baseman throughout his career Davis is not strong defensively and Escobar should represent an upgrade at the hot corner.

Those defensive improvements should help attract more pitching which the Mets assuredly still aim to do. The team is reportedly eyeing Kevin Gausman as a priority as well as Jon Gray after missing out on Steven Matz (much to the chagrin of owner Steve Cohen).

The offseason is still in its early stages but with this trio of acquisitions the Mets have now spent $124.5 million on major league free agents while the rest of the National League East has spent a combined $8 million—all of which went to new Braves catcher Manny Piña. As things stand the defending champions are surely the team to beat in the division in 2022 but they are not without their major question marks this winter.

And it’s not as if Atlanta had a stranglehold on the East all season long—quite the opposite in fact. The NL East as a whole was perhaps the most disappointing and least formidable in the league. In being aggressive on the free agency market the Mets have positioned themselves to be the best-equipped club to give the Braves a run for their money. Given the need for depth across multiple positions the decision to add Marte Canha and Escobar for the money it would likely have taken to sign somebody like Kris Bryant appears to be a wise decision.

New York still has lots of needs and these moves are not without their fair share of risk. But the Mets went from looking like a rudderless captainless ship to a team with a semblance of a plan over the course of Black Friday. Given how the second half of the season collapsed like a house of cards that’s progress enough.

Penulis : Jefri Asmoro Diyatno

Cinta menurutku hanyalah istilah belaka dan itu sangat misterius. Kata orang-orang untuk menemukan cinta itu jangan terburu-buru atau kau akan merusak jalan ceritanya sendiri. Jalan ceritanya sendiri tidak bisa ditebak misalnya jika kau berencana untuk tidak jatuh cinta kepada siapapun secara tiba-tiba kamu bisa jatuh cinta kepada seseorang. Cinta itu datang tanpa aba-aba sangat misterius kan?

Saking misteriusnya jatuh cinta tidak pernah bisa direncanakan. Tuhan merencanakan. Kita adalah korban. Kecewa adalah konsekuensi. Bahagia adalah bonus. Berpisah adalah kesedihan air mata dan hati yang terluka.

Hati yang terluka bukan datang karena perpisahan saja tetapi juga kegagalan. Iya gagal gagal memilikimu. Memilikimu adalah mitos paling menyedihkan di dunia ini. Aku sering merasakan sedihnya hidup tapi yang paling sedih ialah berharap memilikimu. Oh Tuhan.

Pasrah kepada Tuhan mungkin jalan satu-satunya dan disaat pasrah aku mencoba berpikir positif. Mungkin maksud Tuhan baik aku dibuat jatuh cinta kepadamu agar aku berdoa kepada-Nya setiap malam. Cintaku padamu tidak lain untuk menambah keimananku.

Untuk menutup kalimat-kalimat sampahku aku ingin mengutip kata-kata dari sahabatku ""Cinta itu sewajarnya saja cinta bisa ngecewain pada waktunya"".

Haha apakah aku sekarang galau? Ya enggak lah. Yakali aku galau.

Terimakasih cinta ❤️

I'm Matt Turner the editor in chief of business at Insider.

Goldman Sachs polled its interns earlier this year on everything from posting to TikTok to the climate crisis. One takeaway: 21% said they'd invested in cryptocurrencies.

Given that Wall Street and its workforce are typically heavily regulated and tracked I found this striking. In the past financial institutions have waged war on their staffers communicating on encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Now they're facing a generation that's bypassing brokerage accounts to make investments from their crypto wallets.

At the same time these firms are looking to get in on the crypto craze themselves with Citigroup this week appointing an executive to lead a new crypto team. That could create new conflicts of interest and lead to a clampdown.

Until then as Reed Alexander and Alex Morrell reported this week young Wall Streeters are making bank on crypto. Read on for a Q&A on their reporting.

Reed Alexander and Alex Morrell take us inside their reporting on how young Wall Streeters are making crypto trades — and what banks' compliance departments are saying about it.

What prompted you to look into young Wall Street trading crypto?

Reed: Alex and I had seen headlines about senior folks on Wall Street making bank on personal crypto trades. We were curious what junior bankers and financial advisors were up to — and how their firms might be thinking about oversight. Wall Street typically has a lot of rules around what workers can invest in but we discovered that few have any guidelines in place right now that pertain to digital assets.







How are these Wall Streeters able to get around red tape and invest in crypto?

Reed: Cryptocurrency is still very much an emerging asset class and many on Wall Street are scratching their heads over how to police it. Using digital wallets instead of their brokerage accounts is one avenue they're taking to buy crypto without having to turn over any information about their investments to their employers. But it's unclear how long this flexible environment may last.

How are banks responding to these crypto trades their employees are making?

Alex: It's something of a mixed bag but primarily it's watch and wait right now. Since most banks don't have significant business operations involving crypto they're not taking great pains to clamp down on employee trading. That could change if banks get the go-ahead from regulators to embrace digital currencies. We're already seeing some signs of this at places like Goldman Sachs which has been more eager to pursue crypto than some of its competitors.

April Koh has built a mental-health unicorn backed by Tiger Global by age 29. But the irony of Spring Health the startup she founded in her senior year at Yale was that the mental health of some of its employees deteriorated amid a rush to take on more customers.

In a moment when many are reevaluating their priorities and putting a greater emphasis on their mental health the story reflects a broader debate about startup culture. At Spring Health moving fast sometimes contradicted the self care it was selling.

Read what current and former Spring Health staffers are saying.

Clubhouse was the breakout app of the pandemic a place for creators to talk over a trendy and social audio platform. But now the app is struggling to stay relevant and keep its users happy.

""No one really talks about it anymore"" one venture capitalist said. And it isn't for a lack of funding. Its user base is dwindling and so-called drama rooms are hobbling the app.

Here's what happened to the VC-darling app of the pandemic.

During the Reddit meme-stock boom earlier this year retail traders slated short-sellers as sworn enemies.

Many predicted the end of an era. ""Wall Street's Most Reviled Investors Worry About Their Fate"" blared one New York Times headline.

But today some short-sellers are thriving more than ever.

Here's why the demise of short-sellers has been greatly exaggerated.

The CPR. The dead.' A moment-to-moment account of the Waukesha Christmas Parade that turned into ...,"This story was republished on Jan. 5 2022 to make it free for all readers

Last Sunday morning Lauren Janke and her partner Robin Frievalt woke early expecting a busy day. There were holiday lights to put up. A buyer was coming for their basement freezer.

Then they were taking Janke's two sons Everett 11 and Tatum 7 to watch the high school marching bands floats cheer squads and Dancing Grannies at the Waukesha Christmas Parade. The parade had been canceled in 2020 another casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now the event's return seemed a hopeful sign. Traditions could be resurrected.

But Frievalt a 37-year-old with a bachelor's degree in nursing had a weird feeling. Large gatherings bothered her. These days any big event any crowd carried the potential for violence — even a parade for gosh sake.

Almost a year had passed and authorities were still arresting people from all over the country in connection with the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. The divisive trial of Kyle Rittenhouse on charges of shooting three people during last summer's racial unrest in Kenosha had just ended in acquittal. From the beginning it had seemed certain that whatever the verdict half the country would be furious.

""Are you sure we should go?"" Frievalt wanted to ask Janke.

But her partner and the boys had been looking forward to the parade. So Frievalt kept her doubts to herself. She even tried to muster holiday cheer stringing lights around the outside of their house and through the bushes in the front yard.

She felt the air cooling. A wind had kicked up.

Janke 40 drove the mile and a half from their home to the parade route around 2 p.m. two hours before the start and set up four chairs. Many spectators had already staked out positions along Main Street.

Janke realized it would be crowded. They'd have to park at least a couple of blocks away.

Crowds lined Main Street early

The Christmas Parade Nov. 21 would be Waukesha's 58th. The event's web page listed more than a dozen sponsors and offered a holiday wish:

""Comfort and Joy.""

A Girl Scouts group would be marching along with sports clubs businesses high schools Carroll University and of course the justifiably famous Milwaukee Dancing Grannies.

Virginia ""Ginny"" Sorenson had been with the Dancing Grannies for 19 of her 79 years. She was as committed as they came bad back and all. She would be near the back of the group holding a banner. Tamara Durand a mere 52 was young enough to be Sorenson's daughter. She was making her debut with the Grannies.

Behind the Grannies in the parade order would be the Citizens Bank float. Walking beside the float would be Jane Kulich a 52-year-old teller at the bank who was a mother and grandmother herself.

Previously Kulich had worked as a caregiver for Visiting Angels a group that provides in-home care for seniors.

A few minutes before 4 p.m. Janke Frievalt and the boys found a parking spot a couple of blocks from the parade route.

Crowds already lined Main Street in front of the familiar landmarks: People's Park restaurant the Steaming Cup coffee shop and Five Points Pub.

The wind had knocked over their chairs and that section of the route now felt too crowded so Janke and Frievalt moved to a new spot half a block farther down the route. They were in front of a little driveway leading to Realty Executives at 431 W. Main St.

Right on time the first marchers passed carrying the parade banner. Janke had filled a Thermos with hot chocolate for the boys. Some of the marchers were throwing candy and a little boy offered Janke's sons some from the handful he'd gathered.

Some hospitals already full

At 4 p.m. Amy Zosel an emergency medicine specialist for Froedtert Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin arrived at the hospital for the start of her shift. She asked colleagues how the day had gone so far.

There's a superstition at the hospital as there is among many of the agencies that deal with disasters. Never say a day has been ""slow."" Never.

Instead Zosel's colleagues told her it had been kind of quiet. The patient volume had been ""pretty low"" said Dina Derocher 38-year-old nurse manager in the emergency department.

The same could not be said for ProHealth Waukesha Memorial Hospital a little more than a mile from the start of the parade. The hospital's emergency department has been ""absolutely packed"" for much of the year said Mark Schultz director of emergency medical services.

Many hospitals in Wisconsin and around the nation had been strained by the periodic surges in COVID-19 patients. These patients have been sicker and stayed longer than other patients putting pressure on emergency departments.

""It was another complicated day"" said Schultz. ""We were boarding patients in the ER because everything's full.""

Over at Children's Wisconsin hospital the main emergency department was completely full and patients were arriving with the usual assortment of weekend injuries: broken bones lacerations and respiratory problems.

Children were waiting up to an hour to be seen.

More: Help and support arrived early and continue flowing in.

More: How you can help those affected.

More:What we know so far about the victims.

More:What we know about the suspect.

'Stop! Stop!'

About 35 minutes into the parade a voice came over the Waukesha police radio. Report of two people fighting around White Rock School.

One-third of a mile away Waukesha Police Detective Tom Casey was working traffic control at the staging area for the parade when he heard a horn honking. The detective stared up White Rock Avenue and watched the waiting crowd of parade participants part making way for a red Ford Escape.

The Escape was bearing down on the detective and on marchers just starting the parade route.

Casey stepped out into the driver's path pounding on the hood.

""Stop"" the detective ordered.

The driver slowed but ignored the command steering the SUV to the right so that it brushed back Casey and entered the parade route.

Yelling ""Stop! Stop!"" the detective pounded his fist against the driver's window but the SUV kept going passing marchers. As Casey gave chase the driver sped up.

By the radio Casey informed officers that the red Ford Escape had entered the parade. He put out an urgent call for squad cars.

About three blocks away at the intersection of West Main and North Barstow streets the driver of the Escape braked for a moment. Officer Bryce Butryn thought the driver was about to stop then turn right onto Barstow and exit the parade route.

Then Butryn heard the SUV's tires squeal. The driver accelerated straight into the parade marchers.

Frantic calls burst from the radio.

""There's a car going westbound pushing parade-goers down. A red Escape. I couldn't stop it ...""

Then a male voice shouting for an ambulance. ""GASPAR AND MAIN!""

The same voice now breathless. ""We have multiple casualties! Main and Gaspar. We need multiple (ambulances).""

Bodies flying in the air

Half a mile farther down the parade route a whimsical little tow truck passed Frievalt Janke and the boys.

""Oh isn't that cute"" Janke said thinking the truck resembled the character Mater from the computer-animated movie ""Cars.""

Suddenly to her right came a chorus of screams. Janke and Frievalt turned abruptly.

They saw the red SUV weaving in and out of the parade marchers veering from one side of the street to the other.

""I saw three bodies — boom! boom! boom! — all flying in the air"" Frievalt said. ""Then — thump! thump! thump! — landing. I didn't realize in that split second what had happened.""

The SUV must be part of the parade she remembers thinking. Maybe the driver has lost control.

Janke stared at the SUV and it looked to be heading straight toward her and her family. It was only 15 feet away. She could see the driver's face. His eyes were focused straight ahead. ""I was scared shitless for lack of a better word"" she said.

For a few seconds everything went silent Frievalt said. It felt as if time stopped.

Then ear-splitting screams. Legs rushing past. Chairs toppling.

In the street an awful stillness. Blood pooling silently around motionless bodies.

Janke's arms reached out instinctively hands grabbing her two sons legs in full flight heading away from the street away from the shattered parade.

In the same moment Frievalt bolted in the opposite direction onto a roadway strewn with bodies. Her mind kept telling her ""This can't be real"" but her nursing instincts had already determined that it was. Ahead of her she saw ""a body a body a body a body"" she said.

Janke and her sons raced into the small parking lot beside Realty Executive. They found themselves against a brick wall. ""I just saw that car hit that person and they flew off the hood of the car"" Everett said. ""Why would somebody do that?"" Tatum the 7-year-old was crying.

Janke and Frievalt together four years are engaged to be married. They know each other well enough that Janke was not surprised to see her partner sprint away from her toward the injured. That's who she is Janke told herself.

Frievalt reached the body of a middle-aged man. He was lying on his back face up eyes open and fixed on the darkening sky. He looked dazed. She saw blood spreading out from the back of his head.

""What day is it?"" she asked.

""Sunday"" he said.

She asked his name and he told her. She asked what year he was born and again he answered.

Finally she asked ""Are you hurt?""

""No"" he said. ""No. No. Nope.""

She told him not to move and covered his body with a blanket. Somebody passed her towels and she slipped them gently under his head.

There was a girl on the ground beside the middle-aged man. Their heads were almost touching. The girl's eyes were open but when Frievalt pointed her cellphone light at them the pupils did not move.

Later Frievalt would guess that the girl was between 10 and 14 but at the time it never crossed her mind. The girl appeared to have head trauma. There was an abrasion on the side of her eye. Blood was beginning to seep into both eyes.

A woman screamed madly and Frievalt asked her to calm down. She turned back to the girl. When Frievalt asked the same questions she'd posed to the injured man the girl said nothing. Her breathing was labored.

Frievalt held the girl's hand then placed her right hand over the child's chest. The girl's eyes kept closing.

""It's going to be OK"" Frievalt told her. ""I'm right here. You need to keep your eyes open. I'm not going anywhere.""

She pulled a blanket over the girl. Frievalt kept thinking how cold and windy it was and how much colder it must feel for the people who lay injured. Two other women crouched down to help the girl.

""Stay with her"" Frievalt told them. ""I'll be right back.""

Witnesses rush to safety

At the realty office Janke and her sons stood against the wall outside spellbound for what felt like minutes. Then someone opened the office door and Janke her sons and other traumatized witnesses rushed inside.

Janke told the boys to stay put and she dashed back to their chairs by the street and retrieved Frievalt's work and personal cellphones.

The realty office filled with students from Catholic Memorial High School many crying into cellphones as they contacted parents and friends.

At 4:46 Janke texted the father of her two sons.

""Hey. We just saw the scariest thing at the Christmas Parade. A car whipped through the crowd and hit multiple people. It was horrific.""

""Wow!!! Are the boys OK? Was it fast and how far away from you was it?"" the father texted back. She assured him they were all safe though she could not see Frievalt.

Neither Janke nor Frievalt knew that further down Main Street the red Escape approached the Wisconsin Avenue intersection still running over pedestrians. A desperate Waukesha officer fired his gun hitting the Escape three times.

At Froedtert Hospital the ""quiet day"" ended with a phone call. A nurse told Zosel that a doctor had called from the Christmas parade where he'd been off-duty watching his daughter march. Now he was searching for her. There'd been a mass casualty event.

Zosel called the doctor. He still hadn't found his daughter. His voice was frantic breathless. He said there were maybe 30 to 40 people injured.

""I'm coming to help as soon as I find my daughter"" said the doctor who asked not to be named.

""Don't come in"" Zosel said.

Then she heard the doctor say ""OK I found her. She's safe. I'm coming in to help.""

Zosel told him ""You're totally fine to go home and be with your family.""

The doctor would not hear of it. He was on his way in.

Word spreads of mass casualty event

Word of the disaster spread quickly to area hospitals though the initial information was vague and confusing. There had either been a shooting a car running into the parade or both.

Emergency department nurses from ProHealth Waukesha Memorial Hospital had been at the parade and phoned to alert their colleagues just over a mile away. A mass casualty event had taken place.

Two maybe three minutes after the calls the first patient arrived. ProHealth Waukesha would receive 33 more.

Many arrived in the backseats of police cars or other vehicles. Some arrived in ambulances. In the earliest moments of the disaster there wasn't time for triage the process of grouping casualties according to the urgency of their needs.

""You get no information about them. You have no advance warning. They simply are here"" said Schultz the hospital's director of emergency medical services.

""They came in so fast there was no break in the action"" Schultz continued. ""As fast as you could get people out of vehicles they kept arriving.""

Schultz and the other medical staff treating the patients focused on the two priorities: clearing airways so the patients could breathe and staunching the bleeding.

Through the door came a myriad of injuries: severe head trauma broken arms and legs trauma to the chest and abdomen.

Behind the scenes hospital staff moved patients from the emergency department who did not need to be there. Units all over the hospital were taking on these patients so that space could be cleared for the parade casualties.

Of the 34 patients that ProHealth Waukesha ultimately received one was dead on arrival. One arrived wearing a tourniquet a device used to stem the flow of blood from a severe arm or leg injury.

""The sickest patients were unconscious"" Schultz said. ""Some were actively seizing.""

Aurora Summit Medical Center some 15 miles from the parade route ""was extremely full"" that Sunday even before doctors received word of the disaster at the Christmas parade said Thomas M. Derrig medical director for the hospital's trauma program.

There were COVID-19 patients plus it was deer hunting season and the hospital was treating victims of accidental shootings and falls from tree stands.

Derrig was picking up his daughter from a tennis lesson when he received the mass casualty notice.

""It's something you spend a good portion of your professional life getting ready to manage but at the same time you hope it doesn't occur because it means something horrific has happened"" Derrig said.

As he drove his daughter home his mind was already at the hospital running through scenarios for possible injuries. He too had been told to expect either a possible shooting or a possible incident of a vehicle hitting pedestrians.

The two cause very different injuries. Shootings leave doctors treating patients with penetrating wounds; they need to reach operating rooms quickly. A car hitting people causes blunt trauma injuries that must be handled more conservatively. Some of the most serious injuries are internal and not immediately obvious.

But there was one difference between these injuries and ones that typically result from being hit by a car Derrig said. Usually a car's driver has hit the brakes before striking victims at least slowing the vehicles and reducing the impact. There is no indication that happened.

Within the first hours Derrig said the hospital had four surgeries underway simultaneously.

Lisa Heinz Aurora Summit's nurse and trauma program coordinator was to have had Sunday off but received the mass casualty call as she and her husband sat down to a chili dinner.

The hospital holds mass casualty drills every year complete with mock patients wearing makeup to simulate their injuries. Although drills cannot fully prepare medical staff for the unexpected Heinz knew she had an experienced crew. Her job was to manage the flow of patients through the 21-bed emergency department.

The unit was bustling but never felt out of control. One physician assistant from the neonatal intensive care unit even volunteered to handle phone calls from relatives of the injured.

At Children's Wisconsin Hospital some 14 miles from the scene officials were told to expect as many as 45 patients. Still they had some time to prepare. Most of the 18 parade patients they would treat that evening had been taken to other hospitals first and then referred to Children's.

Amy Drendel medical director of emergency medicine and a professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin studied the board listing all of the emergency room patients calculating who could be moved and where.

They needed to free up emergency beds.

More and more injured

Back on Main Street Frievalt went from one injured person to the next. She stopped to help maybe eight maybe 12 victims in all. Some already had small groups of volunteers huddled around them.

Still she crouched beside each of the injured asking her questions trying to determine conditions.

""It got worse"" she said. ""A lot of them couldn't even talk.""

People were performing CPR on one man.

Police approached the injured asking volunteers: Are they alive? Are they breathing? Do you know CPR?

Officers finally were able to triage patients with different colored tags including red for the most seriously injured and black for the dead.

Frievalt approached one little boy who looked to be about 10 years old and was standing by the body of a woman. The boy was sobbing. The woman did not appear to be bleeding but may have had broken legs.

""What's your name?"" Frievalt asked. ""Is this your mom?""

The boy said it was.

""We're going to take good care of her"" Frievalt said.

In truth she felt helpless. ""There was nothing I could do Most of them had head trauma. I just wanted to keep them comfortable and warm and have them know they were not alone.""

Finally Frievalt reunited with Janke and the boys. Janke was jolted by the expression on her partner's face: pure fright. The two women and the two boys headed home.

At 5:28 Frievalt texted her mother in Slinger. She told her mom that they had been in the middle of an attack. ""It was all in front of me. I am so thankful to be alive. I have blood on my hands.""

A little after 5:30 p.m. Frievalt Janke and the boys arrived home.

Mothers and fathers remained calm

The injured just kept coming. Around 5:53 ambulances pulled into Froedtert Menomonee Falls Hospital with two patients the hospital's first. Reports from ambulances had not been detailed.

""We still didn't know what kind of injuries we were getting"" said Jim McCullough the day -shift charge nurse in the emergency department.

Night-shift charge nurse Courtney Lauer had come in early arriving just two minutes before the first ambulance. She went straight to triaging patients.

Four arrived by ambulance a fifth by car.

As he worked McCullough forced himself not to imagine the chaotic scene the injured were coming from.

Only after he finished work around 7:30 p.m. and returned home did he think about the disaster.

""It's a parade"" he said. ""It's supposed to be somewhere hundreds of people are enjoying the time together. You can't go anywhere now without having to keep your guard up.""

Doctors at Froedtert and Children's Wisconsin which are next door to one another waited for referrals from other hospitals.

All staff at Children's were notified of the expected surge in patients. The first of the injured arrived around 5:30 p.m.

""We got nine critical patients in the first hour and four critical patients in the second hour"" said Mo Luetje a specialist in emergency medicine and assistant professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin. ""That's a lot of critical patients.""

The doctors at Children's treated bone fractures head and abdominal injuries and road rash a condition worse than it sounds. Victims of road rash have skidded or been dragged over the street ripping off a portion of the top layer of skin.

Given the brutal injuries Luetje found one fact remarkable. She cannot remember hearing a single child cry.

That night her work included explaining to parents where their children were in the treatment process whether they were on their way to an operating room or having an MRI taken.

Despite all they'd seen and heard the mothers and fathers ""were extremely calm.""

Six children from the parade were sent to operating rooms that first evening. Another two would go the following day.

Doctors at Froedtert and Children's said the patients referred to them arrived having received the highest level of treatment in the field and at their first hospitals.

""Exceptional care was provided to these children"" said Drendel the medical director of emergency care at Children's.

At ProHealth Waukesha Schultz worked for 14 hours maybe 15. When he returned home it was almost 2 in the morning.

He thought about the numerous members of the medical staff who'd come in on their days off and those who worked hard even as they worried about family and friends who had been at the parade. They had to be wondering: Where is my family? Where are my friends? Will one of them be the next patient I see?

'The blood. The CPR. The dead.'

Five parade-goers died Sunday.

The dead included Virginia ""Ginny"" Sorenson the veteran member of the Dancing Grannies and Tamara Durand the rookie.

A third member of the group Leanna Owen 71 also perished. She had managed an apartment complex and was known among the tenants for her kindness.

The Dancing Grannies also lost Wilhelm Hospel 81 whose wife Lola performed with the group. Hospel helped transport the group to events and made sure the dancers all had what they needed.

The fifth fatality was Jane Kulich the 52-year-old teller who had been marching with Citizens Bank float behind the Grannies. The causes she'd cared about most in life were animal welfare children and human rights.

Sunday evening Janke and Frievalt could not sleep.

""It was the eyes I looked into"" Frievalt said. ""The blood. The CPR. The dead. That's why I couldn't sleep.""

Scenes replayed in Janke's mind over and over: the SUV swerving the moment when she looked into the eyes of the driver. ""I almost felt I could see the way he was moving the steering wheel"" she said.

Frievalt felt sick on Monday. She couldn't eat. And she felt guilty for feeling sick. She remembers thinking: What right do I have to feel bad when other people have lost a parent or a child?

Monday evening both women went to the candlelight vigil at Cutler Park. At that point authorities said five parade-goers were dead and more than 60 injured.

Police had named the driver who'd been taken into custody a Milwaukee man named Darrell E. Brooks 39. Earlier in the month a woman told police that Brooks purposefully ran her over with his vehicle after a fight. He'd been released from custody in that case.

Those were the facts but they hardly began to cover what had happened. At the vigil a friend told Janke that she and her 5-year-old son had seen one of the SUV's tires run over a woman's head.

On Tuesday Frievalt woke up and told herself: Today is a new day. I'm going to cherish my life. I'm going to go back to work. I need to be distracted. I need to keep on living my life.

Still it was early days in the recovery.

Tuesday evening Frievalt Janke and the two boys drove into Milwaukee. There was more news on the radio.

A sixth person who'd been struck by the SUV at the Christmas parade was dead: 8-year-old Jackson Sparks of Mukwonago who was marching with his 12-year-old brother Tucker. They were representing the Waukesha Blazers baseball team.

Jackson was in third grade.

On Saturday (November 27) Ono shared an article titled “Beatles Fans Think ‘Get Back’ Dispels The Idea That Yoko Ono Broke The Band Up” on Twitter where she has 4.6 million followers.

The director’s three-part film charts the making of the band’s penultimate studio album ‘Let It Be’ and shows their final concert on London’s Savile Row rooftop in its entirety.

The archive footage in Jackson’s documentary shows Ono apart from The Beatles during the recording sessions for ‘Let It Be’ and busying herself with her own tasks contrary to reports that she was involved while they were making the album.

Ono has been blamed for breaking up of The Beatles since the group called it quits in 1969.

Peter Jackson also revealed this week that Disney wanted to remove all swearing from his The Beatles: Get Back documentary but were convinced otherwise by Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney.

Speaking to NME Jackson recalled Starr and McCartney’s first reactions to the documentary who to the director’s surprise didn’t ask for any changes to be made.

“When they got to see the finished thing I was expecting notes” Jackson said. “It would’ve just been normal to get a note saying: ‘Oh that bit where I say that – could you cut that out?’ Or ‘could you shorten the conversation there?’ And I didn’t get a single note. Not one request to do anything.

“One of them said that they watched it and found it one of the most stressful experiences of their entire life. ‘But I’m not gonna give you any notes.’”

Jackson described how the “truthful” aspect was very important to the band who along with George Harrison’s former wife Olivia refuted suggested changes by Disney to remove all the swearing.

“Paul describes it as being very raw” Jackson added. “He said to me: ‘That is a very accurate portrayal of how we were then.’ Ringo said: ‘It’s truthful.’ The truthfulness of it is important to them. They don’t want a whitewash. They don’t want it to be sanitised.

“Disney wanted to remove all the swearing and Ringo Paul and Olivia said: ‘That’s how we spoke. That’s how we talked. That’s how we want the world to see us.’”

In NME’s five-star review The Beatles: Get Back is described as a “long and winding but utterly unmissable epic” which succeeds because of its “lax editorial policy”.

India’s electric vehicle (EV) market is having a great year. EVs accounted for as much as 2 per cent of all new vehicle sales between January and August 2021. Seven states including Assam and Odisha have announced EV policies. While this growing interest in electric mobility bodes well for India we still have a long way to go to wean our passenger road transport sector off oil.India had around 65000 fuel retail outlets in FY19. Their number has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5 per cent over the last decade to cater to the country’s rising oil demand. This trend is unlikely to change in the near future. A study by the Council on Energy Environment and Water ( CEEW ) shows that India’s passenger vehicle and two-wheeler ownership will increase 2.9 times and 2.2 times respectively between 2016 and 2030. If EV sales continue to grow at the current pace to reach a 4 per cent sales share in 2030 oil demand from the passenger road transport sector will still more than double in the same period. This means India will need to add around 80000 new fuel retail outlets assuming their throughput and economics remain the same in 2030.What if India reaches a 30 per cent EV sales share by 2030 in line with the Clean Energy Ministerial’s (CEM) EV30@30 campaign? It will still need around 60000 new fuel retail outlets to cater to a nearly two-fold increase in oil demand. Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in particular are expected to contribute significantly to oil demand as motorisation levels increase. CEEW’s 2019 pan-India mobility shows that such cities have a higher share of private vehicles due to inadequate public transport systems.Some research groups project a growth rate that surpasses even the CEM's target. In this scenario EVs could account for 80 per cent of two-wheelers and three-wheeler sales 70 per cent of taxi sales 40 per cent of bus sales and 19 per cent of private car sales by 2030. Even so India’s oil demand will increase 1.5 times by 2030. This will add 40000 new fuel retail outlets in 2026 of which as many as 30000 will still be needed in 2030.This means India will need to significantly scale up its EV ambitions to reduce its dependence on oil to power passenger road transport. Targeting an ambitious 67 per cent EV sales share by 2030 can advance the peaking of the sector’s oil demand to 2026. But achieving this requires aggressive EV policies to capitalise on India’s competitive advantage and iron out barriers to EV uptake.First India will need regulatory policies to accelerate the phase-out of internal combustion engine (ICE)-based vehicles. The world's leading EV markets – the US EU and China – have demonstrated the effectiveness of stringent fuel economy norms and zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandates in accelerating demand for EVs. Electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers are already cost-competitive in the Indian market today and offer a variety of use-cases. It is time for India to take bold measures to accelerate EV adoption in these segments.Second the vehicle scrappage policy should be made mandatory and linked with schemes and programmes for EV transitions. Incentives must be graded based on the energy efficiency of new vehicles purchased against certificates of deposit. Offering users who opt for fuel-efficient vehicles and EVs better incentives could accelerate the adoption of energy-efficient vehicles in the fleet thus reducing the demand for oil.Third the government should diversify revenue sources to compensate for reduced petrol and diesel sales. CEEW’s research shows that a 30 per cent EV sales share in 2030 will lead to annual losses of INR 1.1 lakh crore in central and state government revenues. Policymakers should explore alternative revenue sources through schemes such as feebates and congestion pricing.Ambitious policies and a carefully drafted EV roadmap are both paramount for ensuring the Indian passenger transport sector’s energy security and managing trade-offs resulting from the transition. To achieve sustainable economic growth and the vision of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat the time to act on these policies is now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9tYWhhbmFkaS1jb2FsZmllbGRzLXRvLXNldC11cC01MC1tdy1zb2xhci1wbGFudC1pbi1vZGlzaGEvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODc5NDkzNTEuY21z0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL21haGFuYWRpLWNvYWxmaWVsZHMtdG8tc2V0LXVwLTUwLW13LXNvbGFyLXBsYW50LWluLW9kaXNoYS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODc5NDkzNTEuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mahanadi Coalfields to set up 50-MW solar plant in Odisha,"Find this comment offensive?

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Imagine flying across the Atlantic to the United Kingdom and stopping in one of England’s traditional pubs. There’s no need for that flight now as downtown Andalusia is home to The B Craft Beer and Wine Pub.

Kyle and Kim Baumgartner wanted to bring something unique to the community and have accomplished just that with the city’s newest hangout spot. The former Coca-Cola plant has been redone and given an entirely new look.

Local residents Kyle and Kim Baumgartner bought the former Coca-Cola plant and have converted it into their own business which will affectionately be known as The B.

The B will be opening to the public soon with plans of holding a grand opening in January.

“We plan to embrace the nostalgia of the building. It will be a family-friendly upscale venue. The original stainless steel tank in which syrup was stored has been moved downstairs and is incorporated into the design of the indoor patio” Kyle said.

Coca-Cola products were bottled in the facility from the 1950s until 1980 which is the last time the building was in operation.

“It was time for people in Andalusia who travel out of town for nightlife to experience a place that encompasses some of our favorite places in bigger cities” Kyle said. “We will offer an upscale setting for adults wanting an evening out to a family wanting to enjoy a beautiful sunny day on our patio or at sundown enjoying live entertainment” Kim added.

Although the last two years have been a tough journey for the couple all of their hard work and dedication is coming to fruition. “2020 and 2021 have been the most challenging years we have ever faced together. Without a doubt everyone will see it’s been worth the blood sweat and tears to finally open” Kim said.

The B will be open to the public four nights a week with strict rules and regulations in place. “The pub is for 21 and over only but the outdoor and indoor patio areas are available for anyone under 21. No solicitation is allowed and there will be no tobacco products of any kind including vaping on the property” Kim said.

The upstairs has been converted into a loft-style setting the Baumgartners use as their living arrangements.

“We have gone to great lengths to offer a place like no other. It was very important to us both for The B not only to reflect both our personalities but also to bring our love for the big city entertainment venues to our growing small town” Kim said.

Kyle said he has always wanted to own a pub. “Bringing some of the traditional pub settings along with encouraging conversation among individuals is what The B is all about. We want people who come in as strangers to leave as friends. We love having the opportunity to offer an upper scale and fun environment for everyone.”

Two Andalusia locals developed the name of the business and its logo.

The B’s logo was designed by local resident Robert Evers.

“I have to say we can’t take credit for either but are forever grateful for those who sparked the idea and created the end result. Our friend Bill Alverson knew our idea from the get go and immediately said ‘You should call it The B after Baumgartner and use a cool vintage bee for your logo.’ Kyle and I both agreed it was perfect. Thanks to Robert Evers the hexagon bee logo was created and is just perfect” Kim said.

They are looking forward to the opportunity of owning and operating the newest establishment in the City of Andalusia. “I’m most excited about having the ability to do something I love while spending time with my family. It is the most amazing way to enjoy your entire community. So much in the building has been repurposed” Kyle said. “There is a lot of historical significance here and we want to preserve that.”

Planning ahead the couple sees great things for the business and referenced an iconic theme song from a 1980s hit television show.

“We see The B being that place in five years where everybody knows your name and they’re always glad you came. That place where you can see our troubles are all the same because you wanna be where everybody knows your name. Sound familiar?” Kyle said.

The Baumgartners hope to partner with another business in the future and share the warehouse space at the facility.

There will be an outdoor entertainment area where events can be held in a patio atmosphere and an outdoor dance floor. “Our outdoor green space features a life-size chess board for when a dance-off just won’t cut it” Kim said. There is also an area for food trucks. The business will feature an area with large-screen televisions for sports events and will regularly feature live music.

Kim said they are very excited about their menu. “The B will be offering a constant rotation of craft beers along with domestic favorites extensive wine options and seasonal cocktail choices. Our menu will consist of charcuterie boards gourmet sausage dogs hot pretzels and some fun bar snacks. As a given we will have non-alcoholic drink choices as well.”

The B’s menu will contain some usual bar favorites including charcuterie boards sausage dogs and pretzels in addition to several alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

City of Andalusia Mayor Earl Johnson said “The B will complement the other businesses that have located in the downtown district. Taprooms are very popular with millennials and frankly we think The B like our other downtown entertainment venues will become a regional destination. These are super popular in the bigger cities but we are the first city of our size in Alabama to offer something like this.”

Johnson added that the proposed agreement with the Baumgartners is similar to agreements with Big Mike’s and Clark Theatres.

The B Craft Beer and Wine Pub is located at 239 Church Street in downtown Andalusia and is open from 3 until 10 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday and 1 until 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. For more information call The B at 334-923-1687.

The Baumgartners are looking forward to operating their own business in downtown Andalusia.

“We have had an overwhelming amount of support and excitement from the area and are looking forward to our newest endeavor. We are in a way opening our home to our patrons so we expect as much respect from our patrons as we plan to give to them” Kyle and Kim Baumgartner said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZWlnbnBvbGljeS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yNy9wZXBzaS1uYXZ5LXNvdmlldC11c3NyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pepsi's Soviet Submarine Fleet Was the Endpoint of Business Dreams,"In 1989 PepsiCo Inc. the maker of Pepsi acquired 17 submarines a cruiser a frigate and a destroyer from the Soviet Union. In recent years an internet legend has grown up around this deal which holds that Pepsi briefly possessed the sixth-largest fleet in the world. In one way that isn’t far off. According to an analysis of Jane’s Fighting Ships 1989-90 a country operating a squadron of 17 submarines would have tied with India for possessing the seventh-largest fleet of attack submarines.

In 1989 PepsiCo Inc. the maker of Pepsi acquired 17 submarines a cruiser a frigate and a destroyer from the Soviet Union. In recent years an internet legend has grown up around this deal which holds that Pepsi briefly possessed the sixth-largest fleet in the world. In one way that isn’t far off. According to an analysis of Jane’s Fighting Ships 1989-90 a country operating a squadron of 17 submarines would have tied with India for possessing the seventh-largest fleet of attack submarines.

Yet in any real sense the story is false. What PepsiCo acquired were small old obsolete unseaworthy vessels. The Pepsi navy no more conferred military power than a rusting Model T could have been a Formula 1 contender. What’s more the ships themselves were immediately turned over to a Norwegian shipyard to be scrapped. PepsiCo was more a middleman than a maritime power.

Most interpretations of the story get its meaning wrong too. The Pepsi navy is sometimes portrayed as an embarrassment for the USSR. Far from it. The multinational firm and the country founded by Vladimir Lenin were business partners and in 1989 Pepsi executives were bullish on Soviet prospects. PepsiCo acquired the rusting fleet as part of a multibillion-dollar bet on the long-term stability of the Soviet Union an enormous market that had little to trade immediately besides raw material and the promise of future profits.

The Pepsi navy isn’t a story from the era of Soviet collapse. It’s from the brief moment right before when the Soviet Union looked likely to survive even though the Cold War had ended. The rusting submarines were one way in which Soviet leaders and Western corporations could establish world peace and a new post-communist prosperity led by business.

American leaders hoped that exposure to Western business could transform the Soviet Union into a country just like theirs. Pepsi executives influenced U.S. policymakers to gain a major advantage in its rivalry with Coca-Cola. Soviet officials saw the deal as part of a larger strategy of external trade that could help revitalize their creaking economy. In the end almost nobody got what they wanted.

Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev tries a cup of Pepsi alongside U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon in Moscow in 1959.

The Pepsi navy begins with one man’s driving ambition to sell soda to Soviets. Bluff hearty and ambitious Donald Kendall started as a worker in a Pepsi-Cola bottling plant but he swiftly climbed the corporate ladder becoming head of the company’s international division by 1957 when he was only in his mid-30s.

As a corporate executive engaged in international business Kendall filled a role sometimes slighted by scholars. Theorists can make international relations seem far removed from everyday experience: nuclear strategy treaty negotiations human rights principles.

Yet formal interactions between governments are only a small part of international relations. Most of what happens among countries concerns something far simpler and more direct: business. International business executives and their attendant lawyers accountants and fixers handle the complexities of cross-border trade and investment but such complex deals still chase a simple goal: making money.

There’s no mystique in that ambition which may explain why it’s written about far less often than the deals of politicians and diplomats. Yet it is the Donald Kendalls not the Henry Kissingers who steer much of international relations. The constant pressure business executives exert as they dig for profit can wear away at even the supposedly rock-solid foundations of national policy. If the quest for profit proves compatible with official objectives so much the better; if not then executives will try to manufacture opportunities to pursue their narrow interests.

These pressures manifest in unexpected ways. In the late 1950s as Kendall assumed his executive role U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower tried to use propaganda to counter the early advantages of the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Soviet leaders could point to the country’s sizzling postwar economic growth rates which outpaced U.S. growth so substantially that even leading American economic textbooks assumed that the USSR would soon overtake the United States. Soviet triumphs in space including the launch of the first artificial satellite Sputnik exemplified the communist world as the wave of the future—and American racial apartheid in the South made the United States seem like the champion of an imperialist past.

One part of Eisenhower’s counteroffensive involved organizing the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow. Eisenhower bet that showing the ordinary bounties of American living as showcased by the wares of such leading brands as Kodak General Electric and Pepsi-Cola would convince the Soviet people that peace was desirable—and more important that they would be better off under capitalism.

The most notable part of the exhibition came with the visit of Eisenhower’s vice president the anti-communist zealot Richard Nixon who escorted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on a tour of the pavilion. The two sparred over the relative merits of their systems in front of a media entourage who broadcast their exchanges.

Eisenhower’s vision of holding an exhibition that would shake the foundations of communism was a bust. But three other men got what they wanted from the display. Khrushchev demonstrated to his domestic audience that the Soviet Union could excel in peaceful competition. Nixon received a huge poll boost and media plaudits for defending the American system.

Kendall was the third. In 1999 he recounted that he had told Nixon the night before the visit that some at Pepsi-Cola headquarters viewed participating in the exhibition as a waste of money. The next day Nixon deftly guided the Soviet premier to the Pepsi booth. Pepsi photographers recorded Nixon and Khrushchev drinking the soda together.

Even though Khrushchev’s verdict on the soda was ambivalent (Time magazine recorded his reaction as “skeptical”) the publicity coup accelerated Kendall’s career. In 1963 Kendall became the company’s president and chief executive officer.

Kendall was now positioned to repay Nixon for the favor. Nixon needed it. He was then best known as a loser both in the 1960 race for president to John F. Kennedy and then humiliatingly the 1962 California governor’s race.

Kendall handed Nixon a lifeline: a promise that whatever law firm took the politician on as a partner would also receive Pepsi-Cola’s legal accounts. The prominent New York law firm Mudge Stern Baldwin & Todd leapt at the sweetener. The deal enriched Nixon and gave him excuses to travel around the country and globe as a Pepsi representative. Thanks to Kendall Nixon was rich and laying the groundwork for a political comeback.

Kendall’s role as a political sugar daddy paid off when Nixon won the presidency in 1968. The most visible return on Kendall’s investment came when the businessman used his relationship to broker one of the first deals between the Soviet Union and an American firm in the Cold War period. In the 1920s U.S. companies like Ford Motor Co. had been prominent in the Soviet Union which idolized American management practices but they exited the market before World War II.

In 1972 Kendall and Soviet officials announced a deal that would exchange equivalent values of Pepsi for Soviet vodkas made by Stolichnaya and Sovetskaya. Not only would Pepsi become the first American soft drink available in the USSR but the deal also locked Coca-Cola out of the Soviet market.

Nixon’s friendship paved the way for the deal. In 1971 U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger’s deputy Alexander Haig lobbied Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin to have the Soviets accept a trade delegation Kendall would head. In one of his regular phone calls with Nixon and his aides Kendall asked Kissinger (whom he greeted with “Hello handsome”) to press Kremlin leaders to finalize the deal. The Soviets got the message: This deal mattered to Nixon personally.

In a 1975 meeting in Geneva Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko wondered why the Soviets had Pepsi but not Coca-Cola. Dobrynin diplomatically observed that it was because “their chairman is more energetic.” Kissinger more bluntly said it was because Kendall “was a friend.”

Kissinger was not always so generous. In a 1973 meeting with the AFL-CIO’s foreign-policy adviser Kissinger thanked organized labor for their support of the president’s foreign policy and exclaimed “The businessmen in this country are a disgrace. Look at Kendall of Pepsi-Cola he would sell the country for a contract.”

The Pepsi-for-vodka swap may have been consistent with Nixon’s policy of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States but it was also a triumph for Kendall. The 1972 PepsiCo annual report featured a two-page photo spread of Kendall standing in front of the iconic St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow’s Red Square with a quote that made him sound more like a statesman than an executive: “I have long believed that trade between nations could help to build bridges of greater understanding between different cultures and economic systems.” Kendall was asserting that private enterprise could succeed in ways that the Kissingers of the world could not—that he could have both the profits of a salesman and the mystique of a statesman.

The deal faced obstacles. The cumbersome Stolichnaya-for-soda swap resulted from the difficulties of trading with a communist country outside the normal trading rules of the capitalist world. Because Soviet currency the ruble could not be traded on international markets and the Soviet Union hoarded its reserves of hard international currencies every deal involved complicated time-consuming and risky exchanges of material goods not the simple ease of currency.

Other obstacles were political. Jewish groups in the Soviet Union boycotted Pepsi charging that the deal placed profits before the rights of Soviet citizens of Jewish descent locked inside the country. (Soviet policy required Jewish emigres to pay exorbitant fees.) Activists in Congress linked U.S.-Soviet trade and human rights to block a planned 75 percent reduction of U.S. tariffs on imports including those of Stolichnaya.

Political and economic challenges could also combine especially as detente crumbled later in the 1970s. PepsiCo aggressively marketed Stolichnaya as an authentically Soviet vodka. That left the brand open to boycotts when Cold War tensions ran high as when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan or a Soviet fighter jet shot down a Korean Air Lines passenger aircraft in 1983.

Still Pepsi’s Soviet market grew and by 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev took power in the USSR Pepsi had built 16 bottling plants there.

What were the Soviets getting out of all this? For Soviet leaders after Joseph Stalin trade with the West offered many advantages something they repeatedly made clear. Khrushchev stressed Soviet openness to trade when he met a delegation of U.S. state governors weeks before the American exhibition opened in Moscow.

Trade in such raw materials as gold and oil offered the Soviet Union the ability to earn hard currency which it could use to purchase advanced equipment (or when the harvest failed food) on world markets. Yet Soviet leaders conscious of their disadvantages relative to the leading technologically sophisticated capitalist countries also found commercial dealings to be a promising way to import more sophisticated technology. In 1966 for example the Italian automaker Fiat signed an accord to build a major automobile factory in a partnership with Soviet industry an investment whose impact in real terms far exceeded that of the Pepsi deal.

In the early 1970s Soviet leaders hoped that the Pepsi agreement would be only the first in a series of more such deals with the United States Western Europe and Japan. Reform-minded technocrats calculated that the occasionally pragmatic Nixon administration offered a window to accelerate Soviet growth. When the U.S. Congress tied human rights to the trade deal it weakened those reformers and detente—which were dealt another blow by the ascent of the hard-line anti-communist U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

Gorbachev’s ascent meant a return to the broad Soviet policy of international relaxation economic cooperation and domestic reform. Yet circumstances had changed. Western businesses were now warier of the political risks associated with trade with the Soviet Union. They had also learned at great cost about the less dramatic but real headaches involved with doing business in the Soviet Union: customs hassles contract violations truculent workers a primitive financial system and creaking logistics.

Despite those hardships American brands including McDonald’s Pizza Hut (also owned by PepsiCo at the time) and even Baskin-Robbins cautiously entered the liberalizing Soviet market. Even Coca-Cola entered the market (in a limited way with its flagship Coke at first only available in hard-currency stores open to tourists) when Pepsi’s exclusive deal expired.

There were some secondary benefits from entering the Soviet market: Pepsi ran television ads in the United States implying that its sodas had caused glasnost. The more important bet was on the long term. Executives like Kendall still thought that such hassles would be worth building a business that could be profitable as the reforming Soviet economy took off. Corporations got the best of all worlds: the ability to out-compete bumbling Soviet firms while using clout to exclude foreign rivals.

1989 turned out to be an axial year. Tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in June. The Berlin Wall fell in November. Less remembered but almost as important to observers at the time was that the Soviet Union held meaningful elections for its new legislative body the Congress of People’s Deputies another step that seemed to confirm the power of Gorbachev and reformers.

That was the environment in which PepsiCo concluded the deal that delivered the Pepsi navy. The ruble was still worthless internationally and Stolichnaya’s growth prospects were more limited than in 1972 so enlarging Pepsi’s sales in the USSR meant turning to new sources of revenue.

These were the circumstances in which PepsiCo struck the deal for the submarines and other vessels. The novelty of the submarine trade grabbed headlines even at the time but PepsiCo never even took possession of the watercraft. As the Associated Press reported in July 1989 PepsiCo was just the middleman for the vessels bound for the scrap heap which went to a Norwegian ship-breaker instead.

Indeed there was little notable about the sale of the submarines except that it involved Pepsi. The Soviet navy had begun selling its obsolete and unseaworthy vessels for scrap in the late 1980s one component of a flood of scrap exported from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Economist reported in 1990 that the Eastern bloc glut had contributed to scrap prices’ slide from 70 British pounds (over $100 at the time) per ton to less than 40 pounds per ton in only a few months. By then a Soviet Whiskey-class submarine could be had for $50000 or a destroyer for $400000. Even at those prices they were hardly worth the cost of ship-breaking not least because Soviet ships could contain loads of asbestos. Hard-liners in the West warned that such deals could simply help fund Soviet naval modernization making the Soviet navy of the 1990s a far more formidable foe.

The sale of the Pepsi vessels for scrap may have been worth a few million dollars which brought the Soviet navy much-needed hard currency. Yet it was a sideshow. The real soda-for-ships deal involved ships that would work. Initially PepsiCo arranged for its vodka countertrade arrangement to include two 28000-ton Soviet oil tankers which PepsiCo bought in a joint arrangement with a Norwegian shipping firm run by a friend of Kendall’s. In April 1989 according to the Financial Times PepsiCo joined a similar bigger deal with a Soviet trade organization and two Norwegian firms valued at nearly $2.6 billion to deliver as many as 85 Soviet-built ships over a decade. (The reported value of the deal varies by source possibly because American firms that were engaged in bartering could understate their true value to avoid tariffs and taxes.)

Pepsi announced the deal would double its sales of soda inside the Soviet Union over a decade and enable it to open Pizza Huts in the country. The Norwegian partners would handle the marketing of the Soviet ships (and bear the risks of selling the vessels). And the Soviet Union would receive not only a market for its ships but also investment by the Norwegian partners to overhaul shipyards where the vessels would be built.

With a reformist government moving forward executives such as Kendall assured themselves that the future looked bright for their investments in the Soviet Union. But one consequence of liberalization was a new wave of public criticism. Anatoly Sobchak the democratic mayor of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) attacked the expanded Pepsi deal as an exercise in “gigantomania” that would destabilize the market. Kendall ruefully observed in early 1991 that it had been easy to do business with the centralized economy before Gorbachev but “Dealing in a democracy in the Soviet Union today is much more difficult.”

Yet the fact that those objections could be voiced seemed only to confirm that reform was real and that progress was possible. On July 30 1991 U.S. President George H.W. Bush announced major steps toward full trade normalization. “My country stands ready to assist in this new Soviet revolution” Bush said. But Bush cautioned “Western governments—with their own strapped resources—are limited in what they can do. So we must bring together the businessmen from Europe and America and their partners from all across the Soviet Union.” Finally Kendall’s vision would be realized: Western capitalism would end the Cold War and get rich in the process.

Less than three weeks later hard-line forces launched a coup against Gorbachev. Within months leaders of key Soviet republics dissolved the union. On Dec. 25 1991 Gorbachev resigned as president of the USSR which vanished with the stroke of his pen.

To be sure Pepsi’s interests in Russia didn’t disappear. In 2020 PepsiCo reported revenue of $3 billion in Russia its third-largest market behind Mexico and the United States. In 2004 Kendall received the Order of Friendship for his contributions to Russian commerce from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yet there was no longer any mystique. Russia was now just one developing and newly competitive market among many.

The Pepsi navy has been remade as part of a narrative in which Soviet collapse was inevitable a can-you-believe-this story about an American victory lap over a terminally ill enemy. It fits the era of economic chaos that followed when the Russian economy crumbled oligarchs plundered industries and resources and military stockpiles—with functioning weapons not rusted submarines—really were traded on the black market.

But the thesis that foreign economic trade and investment could transform a moribund communist economy was tried in the People’s Republic of China at about the same time. Chinese technocrats wagered that international firms would bring new techniques and experience. And just as the Soviets gave Pepsi a monopoly in exchange for these benefits China granted Coca-Cola exclusive rights to its market in 1978.

Perhaps the Soviet Union could not have managed what China accomplished. Yet the idea that only one communist juggernaut could succeed was far from obvious at the time. Had events unfolded the way Kendall hoped and Gorbachev planned the 1990s might have been a decade of democratization and economic growth for a strengthening Soviet Union. And the story of how Pepsi scrapped 17 Soviet submarines to cement its hold on the Soviet market would have been just one among thousands about how American investments helped a former foe become an economic competitor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb2NhLWNvbGEtcHV0cy10cnVja3MtYmFjay1vbi10aGUtZmVzdGl2ZS1yb2FkLzQ3NDI3MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola puts trucks back on the festive road | Advertising,"After a year's hiatus the Coke lorry is resuming the brand's traditional tour around the UK originally inspired by the ""Holidays are coming"" advert from 1995 created by WB Doner. The trucks subsequently featured in many of Coca-Cola's Christmas campaigns.

Much like previous years the truck will be stationed alongside a snowy winter wonderland setting where visitors can take photos and receive a small can of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. This year Coca-Cola is planning to ""stop off at as many cities around the UK as possible"" with the cities revealed over the next few weeks via its social media or website.

The tour started in Scotland at the Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow (24-25 November). It will move on to The Metro Shopping Centre in Gateshead on 26 November before visiting the White Rose shopping centre in Leeds (27-28 November) and Xscape Castleford Yorkshire on 1 December.

N2O which has a history of working with the brand on other activations is delivering the project.

Jeremy Grantham legendary investor and pioneer of index fund investing expects today’s sky-scraping stock market to come crashing back to earth.

Grantham recently told Bloomberg that investors who enthusiastically drove the stock market to new heights during a global recession are in for a shock.

“When the decline comes it will perhaps be bigger and better than anything previously in U.S. history” he warned.

Grantham predicted the dotcom collapse and the 2008 meltdown of the real estate market — he’s also in charge of about $60 billion as the investment chief at asset management firm Grantham Mayo & Otterloo — so he’s worth listening to.

Before Grantham’s predictions have a chance to come true let’s look at a few safe haven stocks in GMO’s portfolio. One of them might be worth buying with some of your extra pennies.

United Health (UNH)

UnitedHealth’s quarterly dividend payout currently $1.45 per share and the performance of its stock which is roughly 30% this year suggest that the company is currently in strong financial shape.

But the insurance and healthcare leader is well positioned to weather any long-term financial tumult as well.

Regardless of what happens to the economy Americans will still need healthcare. Millions of them are already UnitedHealth customers.

UnitedHealth is a diversified company. In addition to its thriving insurance business it also provides software and information technology to a number of clinics and hospitals.

As the medical tech space continues to grow so should UnitedHealth’s profits.

U.S. Bancorp (USB)

U.S. Bancorp is the parent company of U.S. Bank one of the country’s largest banking institutions.

Betting on bank stock might seem counterintuitive when a stock market correction is expected to hammer investors’ finances but banks tend to do well in rising interest rate environments: As rates increase the profit margin or spread earned by banks widens.

Rather than turning itself into a casino through the kinds of risky derivative plays that tanked some of its competitors in 2007-2008 U.S. Bancorp has instead been focused on innovating and providing digital service for its customers.

The increased efficiency and lower operating costs that result should be music to investors’ ears.

Since the beginning of 2021 U.S. Bancorp stock has risen by about 31%. Of course if you’re on the fence about jumping in at the current price some apps might give you a free share of U.S. Bancorp just for signing up.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Despite the push for more healthy food and beverage consumption Coca-Cola’s dominance of the soft drink market remains unmatched.

Story continues

But the company’s offerings extend far beyond liquid sugar.

Coke also sells popular bottled water brands Dasani and Smartwater big-name juices like Minute Maid and Simply and international coffee products Costa and Georgia.

What makes Coca-Cola an interesting defensive play is the company’s consistently impressive profit margin which has averaged 23.6% over the last decade. That’s largely the result of Coke’s ability to tinker with portion sizes and prices and having the capital to invest in greater productivity.

A faltering stock market shouldn’t change any of those dynamics.

This year Coke’s quarterly dividend payout hit $0.42 almost double what it was a decade ago. The company’s stock is up roughly 4% since the beginning of the year.

Don’t forget inflation

Grantham says portfolios also need protection from inflation which hit a 31-year high in October.

""This is the first time that inflation the number one predictor of a market downturn since 1925 is being ignored” he said.

At times of high inflation investors often turn to real assets which tend to hold their value. That’s why collectibles — diamonds wine fine art — are taking up an increasing amount of room in modern portfolios.

Investing in fine art no longer requires you to outbid a gaggle of millionaires at some stuffy auction house.

A new platform allows you to purchase shares of modern masterpieces by artists like Andy Warhol Banksy and even Claude Monet — without breaking the bank.

The comments surrounding Zach Wilson’s return coming out of Jets’ headquarters this week sound more like unfounded wishful thinking than anything else.

What is at stake?

Wilson’s confidence…?

Possibly Wilson’s career…?

Maybe even Robert Saleh’s job…?

“He’s working he’s seeing a bunch of different receivers running at a different tempo than when he left too” Saleh told reporters. “Everyone’s gotten a little bit better around him and so just him reacquainting himself with the offense and his teammates but it’s been a good week of preparation.”

Saleh also mentioned that Wilson was already making the right reads prior to his injury. He’s hopeful Wilson continues to make improvements in the speed of his game and remains cognizant in his footwork. The more reps he gets in his return Saleh said the better he’ll be.

How does Saleh know that? How can he build the expectation “the more reps he gets in his return the better he’ll be?”

What if instead Wilson plays the same as he did before the injury if not worse? What will that do to Wilson’s confidence level?

Then there are the comments from offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur.

“The improvements that I believe he’s made the last three days compared to where he was a month ago you could see it like I said in those three days and hopefully it will carry over to Sunday.”

Keyword is hopefully.

There is nothing more delicate for a coach to balance expectations while building confidence in his players. However there is nothing in Wilson’s past performance that would logically suggest he will be that much better this week against Houston.

READ: Ex-Jets’ Scout Says Mike White Proves Zach Wilson Is a Bust

Mix in the fact that Wilson is coming off a knee injury that sidelined him for a month and add in the fact Wilson will be facing one of the most experienced and respected defensive minds in the game Texans’ defensive coordinator Lovie Smith. Odds are Wilson will look the same as before if not worse.

Smith is one of the “fathers of the Tampa 2” defense and he is revered in league circles in his role. Wilson should expect a plethora of exotic blitzes and pass coverages. It is the same defense that caused rookie Trevor Lawrence to throw three interceptions when Jacksonville faced the Texans earlier this season.

What will it do to Wilson’s confidence level if he has a bad game against Houston?

Is it really a good idea to be racing Wilson back out there playing on a newly mended knee that gives him something even more to think about when he drops back to pass on a 2-8 team?

What if he blows out his knee the same way Robert Griffin III did?

To Saleh’s point about how he is “hopeful Wilson continues to make improvements in the speed of his game.” This is the real issue that surrounds Wilson and the Jets ability to evaluate talent.

This is the real issue nobody dares to address. The game is not going to slow down for Wilson. He lacks the skill set to slow the game down.

It was clear as day on Wilson’s college game film that he had an average arm and his downfield ball placement was all over the road. Receivers were jumping and sliding too often to catch his passes. His deep balls were up for grabs. Nothing we have seen from him at the Jets is different than who he was at BYU.

However the difference is when Wilson was at BYU he had receivers running wide open or receivers who were just standing there waiting for his passes. Wilson was able to take advantage of a soft schedule and put up stats against many defenders who will not even sniff an NFL tryout and the Jets fell for it.

None of that exists in the NFL. Passing windows are tight and defensive backs close them quickly.

No amount of wishful gibberish “mental reps” or illogical propaganda is going to correct the fact Wilson lacks the arm strength the ability to put the football consistently where it needs to be downfield and the resulting decisiveness that is needed to be a successful NFL QB.

Jets’ fans need to set their expectations accordingly.

The incumbent federal government quite obviously is fully cognizant of the national education crisis as over 22.84 million children were still out of schools and as much as 41 percent of fifth grade students unable even to read simple stories in basic languages.

According to the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM) 2018-19 the literacy rate in the country was stagnant at around 60 percent with the urban literacy rate at 74 percent and rural literacy rate at 51 per cent. Literacy in Punjab province is slightly higher at 64 percent as compared to Sindh and Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa (including merged districts) at 57 percent and 55 percent respectively while this rate was even lower at 40 percent in Balochistan area-wise largest and sparsely populated province of the country.

Furthermore literacy rate for male population was reported to be at 71 percent while that of female literacy rate was substantially lower at 49 per cent. According to figures available from official sources school attendance across Pakistan was reported to be around 60 percent while Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) at primary level was 87 percent and Net Enrolment (NER) was 66 per cent. Likewise middle level GER and NER were 63 percent and 38 percent respectively while matric level GER and NER figures were placed at 57 percent and 27 percent respectively. Gender Parity Index (GPI) in literacy was only 0.69 overall while at the primary and secondary levels the figures were 0.92 and 0.89 respectively.

One of the major concerns of the authorities concerned at the federal and provincial levels was how to mitigate the loss of exacerbated learning with over 50 million learners affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic during financial 2020-21. This situation entailed higher risk of increase in out- of- school children widening of gender disparities and flaring learning poverty.

The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training which had taken a lead on several initiatives for improving education quality and access as well as for mitigating the education losses during the COVID-19 pandemic was allocated an amount of Rs Rs 4.7 billion. The Ministry has also undertaken the ASPIRE programme initiative for effectively countering the education inequities at inter-provincial and inter-district levels for lagging areas all over Pakistan.

Concerted efforts as such were direly needed to focus on reducing the huge number of out-of-school children (22.8 million exacerbated to 50 million due to COVD-19). Provincial governments are required to make concerted serious efforts to strengthen modules for training for training of both teachers and education managers to deal with similar challenges in the future. Improving gender parity and literacy rate were obviously the areas of special focus in the education sector.

As for the measures being taken at the federal level for improving the overall education sector in the country as many as 23 projects were included in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) 2020-21 including 20 ongoing projects and 3 new projects which were initiated by the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training. These projects aimed at introducing a uniform curriculum capacity building of teachers and principals recruitment of teachers establishment renovation and up-gradation of schools and colleges improving gender disparity education voucher scheme improving educational assessment system and Knowledge Economy Initiative.

The federal government was apparently committed to strengthening the education system and investing in human capital development. Projects initiated by the incumbent federal government for human capital included Tele School for Grades 1-12; National Education Action Plan for COVID-19; Establishment of National Curriculum Council Secretariat; Balochistan Human Capital Investment Project; Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa Capital Investment Project; Punjab Human Capital Investment Project and; Sindh Early Learning Enhancement through Classroom Transformation.

As for the measures being initiated or planned by the federal and provincial governments under PSDP 2021-22 are concerned the federal government was attaching due priority to the strengthening of the basic and college education system. Towards this end 24 development projects including 20 ongoing projects for Basic and College Education with an allocation of Rs 4873.74 million were listed in the PSDP for the ongoing financial year.

Under PSDP 2021-22 the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training which had taken a lead on several initiatives for improving education quality and access as well as for mitigating the education losses during the COVID-19 pandemic was allocated an amount of Rs Rs 4.7 billion. The Ministry has also undertaken the ASPIRE programme initiative for effectively countering the education inequities at inter-provincial and inter-district levels for lagging areas all over Pakistan. A substantial amount of Rs 4 billion was in the process of being disbursed to reduce imbalances in education quality and access.

Two major programmes namely Response Recovery and Resilience Project and Pandemic Response Effectiveness in Pakistan have also been launched for addressing disparities disruption in education continuity and learning losses due to continued prevalence of the pandemic. Interactive and digital content for tech-based media was also in the process of being created updated contextualized and disseminated through television radio and prevalent education technology platforms. Similarly other programmes included provision of basic education missing facilities establishment or upgradation of boy’s and girls’ schools and colleges knowledge economy initiatives teachers training institutes and such like.

The National Curriculum Council Secretariat has also been set up for ensuring effective coordination among federating units in development and reviewing of the Single National Curriculum from Grade pre-1 to XII Teachers Training Modules Standards for Quality Education and National Curriculum Framework. Updating the national curriculum by adopting new knowledge relevant to the needs of the 21st century and focusing upon creative and critical thinking instead of rote learning was also the priority agenda of the incumbent federal government."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - WhatsApp has won regulatory approval to double the number of users on its payments service in India to 40 million a source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Friday.

The company had requested that there should be no cap on users of its payment service in India.

Instead the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)this week told the company it could double the user base to which it can offer its payment service - currently restricted to 20 million - the source said.

WhatsApp is owned by Facebook which recently changed its name to Meta.

The source said the new cap would still hinder the company's growth prospects given that WhatsApp's messenger service has more than 500 million users in India the company's biggest market.

It was not clear when the new cap would come into effect.

WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment while the NPCI declined to comment.

WhatsApp competes with Alphabet Inc's Google Pay SoftBank- and Ant Group-backed Paytm and Walmart's PhonePe in India's crowded digital market.

The NPCI gave WhatsApp approval to start its payments service last year after the company spent years trying to comply with Indian regulations including data storage norms that require all payments-related data to be stored locally.

WhatsApp has almost reached its user base of 20 million for payment services said the source who declined to be identified as the details are private.

Online transactions lending and e-wallet services have been growing rapidly in India led by a government push to make the country's cash-loving merchants and consumers adopt digital payments.

It's a lost art not many understand she said but it was as if her life led her directly to the unique and complicated hobby of creating paper from natural fibers. An artist for as long as she can remember MacAllister stumbled upon a papermaking class while studying at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts in college. Then her grandfather offered his basement to serve as her sprawling studio.

As she worked more and more on what she called a ""lost art"" it became clear that it was a practice she would never give up.

""I love what you can do with it that you can just fill a book with anything or sculpt with it"" MacAllister said. ""It's so much more than people realize. ... You can do so much with paper and really turn it into anything.""

Now a mom of two still who works full time MacAllister makes and sells her wares on the side as The Paper Merchant. She and her family live in the Marshfield home that was once her grandfather's where her papermaking takes up the entirety of its three-room basement.

Childlike joy: Braintree artist Molly Fabiano brings whimsical illustrations to life

Making paper is a messy complicated and time-consuming process that most choose to forgo in favor of a quick trip to Staples or an online order. It takes hours for a single sheet of paper to be fully ready for use and days for that paper to be turned into one of MacAllister's photo albums notebooks or paper lanterns.

Unlike commercially produced paper no two sheets of MacAllister's paper are the same. When examined closely the papers are different even from one side to the other. But no matter their texture thickness color or pattern they're all unique and delicate.

""People tell me they're so hesitant to write in a book or use a page but it's just paper"" MacAllister said. ""It's meant to be written on. I like to consider a book an empty vessel.""

Childlike whimsy: Braintree artist Molly Fabiano brings illustrations to life

All paper starts with some type of natural fiber like Philippine gampi Thai kozo bamboo or denim. Once the raw material arrives MacAllister cuts it soaks it and boils it to break down the fibers. A 1-pound bundle of fibers will make roughly 100 pieces of paper.

She then transfers that to a homemade beater her husband made which turns it into a wet goopy pulp. It's at the pulp stage that color or other ingredients – like banana peels or seaweed – can be added to give the paper pattern and dimension. The pulp then goes into a flat bin with water and a formation aid.

Once that mixture is ready MacAllister strains it through a very fine mesh transfers it to interfacing fabric and then transfers it again to a massive piece of acrylic on the wall. There it will dry and 12 hours later peel off as a sheet of paper. It can take MacAllister up to two hours to make 24 pieces of paper – as many she includes in a standard notebook – not including the process to make the book covers and bind them all together.

""I love the process she said. ""When I'm just pulling page after page it's soothing. It's messy and gross and sloppy but you just go with it.""

The third and most set-back room in the basement is filled with at least eight paper cutters binding supplies wooden lamp frames and other materials to turn raw sheets of paper into usable objects.

""It's a very long involved process"" she explained. ""I start with the raw materials and then have to do something with the paper once I have it. It becomes a book or a lamp. There are a lot of steps.""

MacAllister takes custom orders and sells her products at Hingham's Artisans in the Square. She can be reached at the.paper.merchant@comcast.net.

The biggest - and loveliest - television night of the year welcomed back a studio audience and doubled-down on the wow factor of last year's set and costumes.

The show kicked off with a big screen-saluting opening medley of Hakuna Matata and The Lion Sleeps Tonight.

Inspired by the Disney classic The Lion King Ryan Tubridy and the young stars of the show travelled to the plains of Africa via Canon Mooney Gardens in Ringsend and the Late Late's home base. Like the entire night it was big colourful and exactly what viewers needed at the end of a tough week. And year.

But the best - friendship guests surprises - was still waiting in the long grass with viewers also finding over €3.3m to give to the Late Late Toy Show Appeal along the way.

The first toy tester was superhero-loving mischief-making five-year-old Alanna La Fontaine from Cork whose enthusiasm for her new role was as infectious as her laugh.

Alanna was followed by Róisín Dolan aged five from Leitrim. She dazzled with her knowledge of dinosaurs before it all became a little too much in one of those too-cute moments that makes the year's wait worth it for fans at home and around the world.

The youngest star of the night was Lorcan Ryan aged four from Clonmel Co Tipperary. He presented his credentials as a budding chef suggesting his own RTÉ show could be in the offing in a year or two.

A super-charged dance number from the Kieran brothers - DJ Calum and his 'Hype Man' Jackson - saw them gobsmacked as new equipment arrived to enhance their future sets. The young Dubs' reaction was music to everyone's ears.

Eight-year-old LEGO master Finn Ryan from Waterford then shared his story of how the blocks helped him as he was receiving treatment for cancer in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin. Having rung the bell after finishing his treatment Finn rang it again in solidarity with other children who are still in hospital.

There was a big treat to come - a trip for Finn and his family to LEGO in Denmark. His eyes grew wider as the details were revealed and his lovely modest ""thank you"" at the end was a Toy Show moment to treasure with all the rest.

Nine-year-old fashionista Abigale Heavey from Galway was more than ready for her close-up as she put the toys - and her host - through their paces.

Eleven-year-old William Woods from Cavan shared his loved of farming showing like all his co-stars that the place is in good hands.

Fourteen-year-old harpist Úna Walsh from Wexford then dazzled with her performance of A Million Dreams one of the best musical numbers - and most-deserved bows - in Toy Show history.

Sports-mad best pals Darcy Henry (nine) and Poppy Moore (10) from Coolock were surprised by Olympic gold medallist Kellie Harrington who revealed that even she applies for Toy Show tickets every year. The champ's message to all the children watching was ""just be yourself"". As ever the show was always about just that.

The performance of Can You Feel the Love Tonight? answered its own question while the Ryan Tubridy and Paudie-led cover of Harry Styles' Treat People with Kindness was indeed ""a place to feel good"".

More dreams came true when 12-year-old Isabella Sydney from Ennis Co Clare received a trip to Paris - including the Louvre and Eurodisney - for all the family in arguably the sweetest screen moment this year.

Bon voyage to Isabella Sydney

But the biggest surprise was saved until near last as Ed Sheeran joined the Toy Show Appeal Choir for a cover of his song Leave Your Life. Hearts melted - again! - and there were laughs as the superstar revealed that one of his backing singers wasn't a huge fan of Bad Habits. Not taking it personally he then invited all the members of the choir to his Irish gigs in 2022.

After the break the chart-topper duly filled in his application for future Toy Show co-host playing the drawing game Pencil Nose with budding Cork rappers Jamie Forde and Coben Cullen. ""Thanks for having me guys"" he smiled. Same time next year then?

Picture perfect

The show closed with a rendition of The Circle of Life the lyric ""it moves us all"" never more at home than in the Late Late Toy Show studio.

""From the team and myself we truly hope you had a brilliant Toy Show night"" said Ryan Tubridy signing off. ""That you enjoyed yourselves that it's brought you all some laughter brought you together.""

All of the above.

It's fair to say it was another night to remember for The Late Late Toy Show.

Here are some of the top moments from the mane event in the TV calendar...

The Toy Show roared to life with a wild opening number

There was magic in the air as Lion Tubridy and his pals opened the show with an utterly joyous and rambunctious rendition of Hakuna Matata. Ryan was really hitting those high notes!

What could we possibly need more than a problem-free philosophy in this day and age? Tubs' pun-filled introduction couldn't help but bring a smile to our faces.

Safari so good.

The superhero we all need

The first toy tester of the night arrived in style. True star-in-the-making Alanna LaFontaine rolled in on a Batmobile and her infectious giggle soon won over hearts around the country. She had her superhero stance nailed to boot.

In true Toy Show fashion Alanna was constantly getting distracted by one of the dolls - and we soon found out why.

""You're determined to get to those dolls and I swear to god..."" Ryan warned before getting a hearty blast of bubbles to the face. Her reluctance to exit stage left was amazing.

""Can I say goodbye?"" ""No!""

Legend.

Róisín's dinosaur knowledge blew everyone away

""Why do you like dinosaurs so much?"" ""Because they're cool.""

And so we were introduced to fledgling palaeontologist Róisín Dolan. Her breathless and rapid-fire naming of all the types of dinosaurs some of which we hadn't heard before had us impressed.

""You have a very intense gaze"" Ryan remarked at one stage before asking the studio audience: ""Isn't she a superstar?"" We couldn't agree more.

Brothers DJ Calum and Hype-man Jackson stole hearts

Is there anything we love more than a dance party? The Toy Show pumped up the volume with DJ Calum his younger brother and hype-man Jackson and some seriously impressive dancers mixing modern dancing with traditional Irish.

When DJ Calum told Ryan about his ambitions to make a career out of playing music (""I want to DJ the main stage at a music festival in front of thousands of people"") Ryan bestowed him with a full suite of top-notch equipment. A clearly emotional Calum was taken aback by the gesture but just when we thought our hearts couldn't get any fuller he told everyone how much his little bro' means to him.

""He's just the best he's really funny I just love him!""

Pass the tissues.

Brave Lego-master Finn rang the bell

The inspirational Finn Ryan told Ryan about battling cancer in 2018 and explained all he was able to play with in hospital was Lego.

When he rang the bell in St John's Ward in Crumlin to signal that he was cancer-free his extended family couldn't be there so Ryan prompted him to ring a bell of hope for all the other children who are still sick.

Finn took to the task with plenty of gusto so much so that he broke the bell but continued on regardless.

When Ryan asked him if he would like to go to Denmark Finn nonchalantly shrugged but he was soon bowled over by the news that he was due to fly to Legoland with his family. A very well deserved treat for Finn and Toy Show moment for the ages.

The future is bright for fashionista Abagail

The wonderful Abigail Heavey a budding fashion designer with a penchant for ""bling and sparkle"" opened her segment by demanding of a similarly faux-fur coat-clad Ryan: ""Why did you take my style?"" He soon lost the jacket and asked Abigail what she thought of travelling to Dublin.

""I cannot handle the traffic! How do people live in Dublin!""

Saying what we're all thinking Abagail.

Fergal stole the show by singing Ave Maria in Italiano

It was truly unexpected when 10-year-old Fergal casually jumped off his toy car and launched into Ave Maria in Italian. What a voice! DJ Calum's increasingly impressed expressions in the background mirrored how we were all feeling.

The talent on this show was spectacular.

Olympic gold-medalist Kellie Harrington surprised two besties Poppy and Darcy saying she was delighted to meet ""these two champs"". The Dublin boxer said she applies to go to the Toy Show every year (""the tickets are like gold dust"") but now she finally had her chance to be part of the magic.

She made the best of it as she gave young viewers around the country some great advice. ""Just be yourself and surround yourself with all your friends and be very positive"" she said.

""In the middle of the grey skies you were a rainbow for the country this year"" Ryan told her. Very well said.

Paudie impressed with Treat People with Kindness

Ryan teamed up with Paudie O'Callaghan for an awe-inspiring performance of Harry Styles' uplifting track Treat People with Kindness. While Ryan got the chance to show off his singing range it was of course the kids that stole the show particularly the brilliant Paudie.

They showed what great pals they are when Paudie encouraged a reluctant Ryan to go down the tiny slide in studio. Just adorable.

Ed Sheeran

This year's Toy Show went out with a bang with surprise guest Ed Sheeran who joined the Toy Show Appeal Choir for a cover of his song Leave Your Life.

Ed was suitably impressed by his talented backing singers and offered them and their families tickets to his Irish tour next year. Having watched the full show from behind the scenes it was clear Ed was a newfound Toy Show fan. ""It's so wonderful"" he said.

A fitting end to a top-notch show.

If you want the best possible image quality the UHD 4K edition is a great choice. Whether your TV can display a particular resolution depends on the input source and image aspect ratio.

In this article you’ll see how to access the above source and aspect ratio settings and how to enhance image quality on your Samsung TV.

Checking the Resolution for the Input Source

Your Samsung TV can show several different resolutions. But the size and image quality depend on the source of the image. For example if you’re using Roku devices you’ll have several options depending on which player you’re using.

The same goes for the quality of your Blu-ray Player or your Xbox. It’s entirely up to the quality of the device connected to your Samsung TV. If you want to check the resolution for a specific source here’s what you do:

Grab your Samsung Remote and press the Home button. Use the left and right keys to select Source. Click on the specific source for example Comcast or PlayStation. The current resolution shows up in the top right corner of the screen. Make sure to give it a few moments to appear.

You can repeat the process for each source to find out the correct resolution. You can change the resolution for each input source by adjusting the picture size on your Samsung TV. This term is often referred to as the Aspect Ratio.

Adjusting the Picture Size on a Samsung TV

Both older and newer Samsung smart TVs let you change the resolution by changing the Picture Size. Depending on what kind of input source you’re using you’ll have several different options when it comes to resolution. Here’s what you can expect in terms of Picture Size on your Samsung TV:

16:9 – This is the standard widescreen aspect ratio.

– This is the standard widescreen aspect ratio. 4:3 – It’s the Low Definition aspect ratio and it usually gets used when watching old VHS movies and footage.

– It’s the Low Definition aspect ratio and it usually gets used when watching old VHS movies and footage. Fit to Screen – This setting displays the whole image based on screen size so that nothing gets cut off.

Custom – You can set your customized Picture Size and adjust it any way you like.

If you use the Custom picture size you can also access the Zoom and Position feature. This feature means you can zoom in on any part of the image and position it any way you prefer.

How to Change the Picture Size

Here are the steps you need to follow to change the Picture Size on your Samsung TV:

Press the Home button on your Samsung remote. Select Settings. You’ll already be on the Picture menu. Click on Picture Size Settings. Select Picture Size and choose the size you want. If you select Custom you can then access the Zoom and Position option as well.

In addition to manually adjusting display size the Samsung TV recognizes the picture size automatically. Just follow the steps above and select Auto Wide under Picture Size.

Enhancing Your Samsung TV Image Quality

Everyone wants the best possible image on their TVs. With Samsung TVs you’re already getting a lot of value and quality. However you can do things to make your viewing experience even more customized and enjoyable like picking the viewing mode. Samsung TVs usually include the following image preset options:

Standard – This is the mode your TV comes in and is generally compatible with many different image environments.

– This is the mode your TV comes in and is generally compatible with many different image environments. Dynamic – You get a brighter and clearer image. It’s great for watching sporting events.

– You get a brighter and clearer image. It’s great for watching sporting events. Natural – This setting relieves the strain on your eyes.

– This setting relieves the strain on your eyes. Movie – This viewing mode is ideal for watching movies and TV shows.

Access to the above image settings gets done by pressing the Home button on your remote and going to the Settings menu. Select the Picture Mode option and try out the available viewing modes. You can also access the Expert Settings to adjust the brightness backlight level and other settings manually.

Creating the Perfect Samsung TV Image

The resolution on your Samsung TV will mostly depend on what you’re watching. Is it an old movie or are you using a 4K HD-capable streaming device?

Regardless when you don’t have a say in the source image quality you can still do something about it which is change the aspect ratio zoom in setting and change the viewing mode. In that respect a Samsung TV gives you a lot of options to try out."

Prawn Nebula- is a massive stellar nursery located about 6000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. It emits extremely faint light with such wavelength that the human eye cannot detect it.

Also known as IC 4628 the Prawn Nebula is an emission nebula. Its gas has been energized or ionized by the radiation of nearby stars.

As mentioned in the blog “The radiation from these massive stars strips electrons from the nebula’s hydrogen atoms. As the energized electrons revert from their higher-energy state to a lower-energy state by recombining with hydrogen nuclei they emit energy in the form of light causing the nebula’s gas to glow.”

The Prawn Nebula lies south of the star Antares in the constellation Scorpius the Scorpion. Hubble’s focused view captures just a small portion of the vast star-forming region. Credits: NASA ESA J. Tan (Chalmers University of Technology) and ESO; Processing; Gladys Kober (NASA/Catholic University of America)

The new devices are only available in the Chinese market and should take several months to reach other regions. The fact is that the Reno6 series still feels like a recent launch for global customers. In addition to the new smartphones the company is bringing today a new limited edition gift box with accessories for the Reno7 smartphones.

Oppo’s special gift box carries the “Meteor Treasure Limited Gift Box” moniker. It contains a customized mobile phone case two metal chains and a starry sky projection lamp. The entire package is worth 699 Yuan ($109) but you can get it for just 19.9 Yuan if purchased with the Oppo Reno7 series. This is a limited-time offer therefore it is available in very limited quantities so you’d want to hurry if you’re looking to grab one.

So what is exactly inside of the new gift box? It includes a transparent case for the Oppo Reno7 with a shooting star pattern. The case has a couple of metal eyelets using which one of the metal chains can be installed. It will allow you to carry the devices as if they were a purse or will simply help you to improve the grip of the handset.

The case is paired with a night lamp. This one isn’t your regular lamp though as it’s capable of projecting nebula and starry sky effects all over your room creating a mesmerizing little light show. The lamp is a product of a collaboration between Oppo and POCOMO. (Nothing to do with Xiaomi’s POCO).

Below you can check the Oppo Reno7 and Reno7 Pro specifications in case you’ve missed their respective launch.

COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbWVsbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2VuLXVzL3N0b3J5L2Nvc3Rjby1leGVyY2lzZS1iaWtl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Exercise Bike: Is It Crazy to Buy an Exercise Bike from Costco?,"If you’re looking to purchase food in bulk at a steep discount Costco is the place for you. I’ve known restaurateurs who’ve stocked their commercial-grade refrigerators with purchases sourced from Costco’s food aisles and I’ve spoken with owners of private gas stations who’ve made towering purchases of candy and soda at Costco then marked them up substantially at their places.

Costco however isn’t the first place that comes to mind for quality fitness products — or fitness products of any level of quality. It’s not like I’d be inclined to do my fitness shopping at Walmart or Target either mind you. It’s simply a matter of knowing that retail shoppers driven by the pursuit of rock-bottom prices are probably the least likely consumer segment to make a spur-of-the-moment high-dollar purchase of an item like an exercise bike while they’re simultaneously bagging an economy size box of Twix.

Which begs the question: What sort of exercise bikes are available for purchase at Costco and are any of them any good?

That’s a good question! Can Costco be the redeemer of both my wallet and my wellness all at an exceptionally low price?

Well the only way to find out is to see what sort of exercise bikes Costco has available for purchase and compare them to some of the options at other stores. A cursory check of the Costco website reveals a grand total of five fitness bike options available to members across three different bike categories — upright recumbent and spin.

Let’s start with the upright bikes: How do Costco’s compare with those available at fitness retailers?

Straight out of the gate Costco has upright bike options for individuals who prefer flywheel resistance and people who prefer magnetic resistance. For the life of me I’ve never met anyone familiar with the feel of an authentic outdoor bicycle who prefers magnetic resistance to flywheel resistance. No matter how much quieter a bike with magnetic resistance might be a bike with flywheel resistance will always feel better to me.

Anyway the ProForm Folding X-Bike Elite may appear like a flimsy substitute for a beefier upright bike and that’s because it is. However its lack of size is respectfully reflected in its inexpensive price tag of $149.99 and it has more than enough bells and whistles to make it an attractive entry-level purchase for people who aren’t sure if indoor biking is going to become a permanent fixture in their lives. It offers 10 levels of flywheel resistance a foldable design and a six-month membership to iFIT which allows you to access the workouts of personal trainers through your iPhone or tablet while your bike automatically adjusts its resistance to equate with the terrain your trainers are traversing. It also provides its users with a couple of two-pound weights which isn’t much but it’s consistent with some of the weight offerings of bikes that cost several times as much.

At another retail store you could probably get a much sturdier upright bike like this fancy Schwinn offering which costs about three times as much. The Schwinn is definitely hardier and has 25 different resistance settings as opposed to 10 along with MP3 compatibility and a much fancier LCD screen. It can also support individuals who are 50 pounds heavier — 300 pounds compared with 250 pounds — so individuals who are starting from a point that’s deeper in the hole will benefit from the heftier frame.

Okay Costco’s upright bike doesn’t exactly seem like a piece of junk. So what about in the recumbent category?

Here Costo pulls no punches. They offer an XTERRA SB 550 at a sales price of $699.99. It features flywheel resistance with 20 different settings MP3 compatibility a backlit LCD screen and a built-in cooling fan. In the recumbent category this is essentially a top-of-the-line bike. The only way you’re going to do better is if you’re prepared to spend more money on a recumbent bike than you are on a first-class Alaskan cruise while shelling out thousands of dollars for a touch screen and an adjustable reading station.

Awesome! It appears that Costco isn’t afraid to offer top-of-the-line fitness equipment if the situation calls for it. How does their spin-style bike option stack up?

If you’re an authentic Costco member it appears that membership does indeed have its privileges when it comes to spin bikes. Costco offers its members a substantial discount on the Echelox EX-5s spin bike. It provides 32 levels of resistance with access to instructor-led classes through its HD flip screen. The resistance of the bike is of the magnetic variety which doesn’t personally appeal to me but I’m not prepared to nitpick when Costo is offering a huge discount on what is ordinarily a $1500 bike. While this bike doesn’t have the widespread reputation of a Peloton it’s generally considered to be just one rung below it.

Whoa! Costco doesn’t necessarily offer worse products than a lot of fitness retailers!

They’re not necessarily of an inferior quality but Costo is unlikely to devote nearly as much floor space to fitness equipment as the vendors that specialize in such products. This means you don’t have many testing models at your disposal to compare side-by-side. That said Costco’s corporate buyers are under pressure to stock items that are going to move from the shelves just the same as the buyers of any other big-box store. This may not always result in Costco offering the Cadillac option in every category but it appears that you can find some quality fitness equipment at inviting discounts as you wander Costco’s aisles looking for 20-pound barrels of pretzels.

Always remember it’s nice if your exercise bike comes standard with all of the gimmicks but those of us who remember an era before such creature comforts were commonplace know that adequate pedal resistance and 30 minutes to spare are all it takes to achieve an adequate workout. Instructor-led workouts and MP3 compatibility are pleasant touches but it doesn’t matter how many fit people you watch from the seat of your bike whether it’s inside of a gym or from the comfort of your own living room. No one on that expensive monitor can do the work for you. Whether it’s a $100 backlit LCD or a $2000 HD touchscreen you have to do it yourself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2Nvc3Rjby1ob2xpZGF5LXBhcnR5LWlkZWFzLTM3MDAzMjgz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How to Stock Up for Your Holiday Parties at Costco,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/costco-holiday-party-ideas-37003283 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2Nvc3Rjby1ob2xpZGF5LXBhcnR5LWlkZWFzLTM3MDAzMjgz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtYmVzdC1uZXctY29zdGNvLWJha2VyeS1pdGVtcy1mcm9tLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Best New Bakery Items Costco Added in 2021 — Eat This Not That,"It's nearly impossible to walk through Costco without noticing the sweet smells of warm buttery pastries… compliments of the warehouse brand bakery!

The Surrey home is Edward and Sophie’s official residence and the royals gathered to discuss The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award.

On the Custodian of the Crown’s official website it is noted: “Prince Edward is the royal patron of the British Paralympic Association and one of the most active members of the Royal Family in the activities of the world organization of the Duke of Edinburgh Award.”

In Romania Margareta is the Royal Patron of The Duke of Edinburgh International Award Romania; and Prince Radu is the Royal Patron of the National Paralympic Committee of Romania.

According to the Custodian of the Crown’s website Edward and Sophie last visited Romania in 2013 and met with Margareta and Prince Radu at the Elizabeth Palace.

Margareta and Prince Radu were in the United Kingdom for a four-day visit last week. Among their engagements included a private audience with The Queen at Windsor Castle on 24 November; the unveiling of a bronze bust of King Michael of Romania—Margareta’s late father—at the Romanian Embassy in London to mark the centenary of his birth; and meetings with financial and Olympic representatives to discuss the links between the UK and Romania.

Margareta became the Custodian to the Crown of Romania following her father’s death in 2017. However as Romania abolished its monarchy in the 1940s she is not known as Queen Margareta; and as the Romanian monarchy abided by Salic Law—meaning women could not inherit the throne—it would be up to a referendum which has been discussed by Romanian politicians in recent years to both restore the monarchy and change the laws of succession that would allow Margareta to inherit.

In her new Hallmark Channel Christmas movie Christmas at Castle Hart Lacey Chabert’s character lives out a fairytale when she travels to Ireland for the holidays and ends up falling in love with an earl. For the actor the experience of filming the movie at an actual castle in Ireland was like finding herself in a real-life Hallmark movie.

A cast of mistaken identity leads to romance in Christmas at Castle Hart which also stars Stuart Townsend. Chabert plays a recently divorced woman named Brooke Bennett who travels to Ireland where she plans to search for her Irish roots. Instead she ends up meeting the charming Aiden Hart the Earl of Glaslough (Townsend) in a pub. But things get complicated when Brooke and her sister Margot (Ali Hardiman) are mistaken for high-profile event planners and they end up being hired to host an epic Christmas party as his castle. Aiden and Brooke begin to fall for each other but how will he react when he learns she’s now who he thinks she is?

‘Christmas at Castle Hart’ was filmed in Ireland

Christmas at Castle Hart which was filmed on location in Ireland is likely to inspire more than a few viewers to start planning a vacation to the Emerald Isle. For Chabert making the film offered her a chance to spend time in a country she’d never had a chance to visit.

“I thought everything was so beautiful. I was in complete awe” the actor said during a Nov. 22 Facebook Live with her co-star Townsend. “I had never been to Ireland before and I’d always wanted to visit. I was just absolutely thrilled to have the chance to be there to work there.”

For Townsend making Christmas at Castle Hart was a homecoming after several years away. The return was particularly special because he got to both reunite with his family in Ireland and bring his two sons with him on the shoot.

“For me [filming in Ireland] was amazing because it’s my country. It’s where I’m from” he said. “But I hadn’t been back for about three years. So I got to go home … it was just a really beautiful experience.”

Filming for Christmas at Castle Hart took place at Dromoland Castle in County Clare. It’s a 19th-century castle that’s now a five-star hotel. The actors also had the opportunity to stay at the castle while they worked on the film.

“We got to film in the castle and stay at Dromoland Castle” Chabert said. “It was dreamy … I felt like I was actually living a Hallmark movie with that experience.”

Townsend agreed.

“We honestly had some of the most spectacular locations you can find in Ireland” said the Queen of the Dammed actor. He added that filming in the castle was “extraordinary.”

“That castle is something people spend their whole lives saving up to go to. So for me I just felt really blessed that we got to stay there” he said.

Overall Christmas at Castle Hart “showcases the beauty of Ireland and the magical nature of Ireland” Townsend said.

“We get to take you guys with us on an Irish adventure” Chabert said. “It was such an amazing experience.”

Christmas at Castle Hart airs Saturday Nov. 27 at 8 p.m. ET on Hallmark Channel.",,,,,,

SUPPLIED

DBD Engineering Plc became the first small and medium-size enterprise (SME) to be listed on the Growth Board of the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) following its listing in September this year.

The CSX’s Growth Board was set up in 2015 to assist SMEs in raising capital to expand their business.

Founded in 1995 and one of the oldest engineering and construction companies in Cambodia DBD provides design construction installation and maintenance services to national and international companies.

Backed by around 700 employees and its track record the company is also involved in building reputable shopping malls in the Kingdom.

DBD was one of the companies that benefited from the first Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia’s “Excellence Programme” which was organised in 2017 followed by the second in 2020.

The programme is geared towards providing professional consultations to budding business entities to help them achieve sustainable business growth.

The listing exercise has brought benefits to DBD – from the injection of additional capital to an increased ability to attract talent and contribute to the national economy.

Seven main advantages of an IPO

Long-term and large-scale capital financing

Local companies can raise capital from investors through an initial public offering (IPO) which is a better and safer source of financing compared to bank loans.

Bank borrowing requires collateral while in an IPO exercise a company’s assets reputation and revenue-generating capacity are essential.

Moreover the company must pay interest even if it does not make any profits.

While in the issuance of securities the company is obliged to pay dividends only when it makes a profit.

This does not mean that companies should not rely on bank loans both options are good if they are used effectively.

Tax incentives

The government offers tax incentives to a listed company including the exemption of tax liability and the reduction of tax on profits.

Good governance with better management

Going public ensures companies – even family-run concerns – have a standardised governance framework with clear committee structures one of the most necessary elements for the issuance of equity.

Transparency

Public listing allows for financial integrity with the reporting of figures and financial statements made transparent to protect investors.

Even business owners who are reluctant to open up their books or disclose financial statements to the public and tax authorities are required under the laws to do so once they are listed on the bourse.

Companies can face penalties or may even have to cease operations if they flout the laws.

Trust and reputation

A listed company can leverage its public listing status to bid for major projects as it will have established a stronger reputation and built greater trust among investors giving it an edge over its competitors.

Tapping potential investors

Compared to a non-listed company of a similar size a listed company can find it easier to source investment partners or strategic investors.

They are more transparent have a clear management structure practise good governance make financial information available and ensure the proper payment of tax.

These factors make it easier for investors to make an investment decision.

The issuer’s shares have more liquidity than those of the non-issuer because investors can buy shares in a company that is already listed on the CSX – such DBD Engineering’s shares – or the shares the company will additionally issue.

Promoting the national economy

Raising capital through the issuance of equity securities can also fuel a country’s economic growth due to revolving capital flows through the optimal utilisation of idle capital.

In this regard those who have less capital can also invest in the stock market rather than keeping their money unused thus creating more job opportunities for locals.

These are the main benefits that have taken DBD Engineering to the next level after the IPO.

(File)

Australia’s newly-appointed Test captain Pat Cummins has revealed that he was asked to share any secrets he might have had before he was handed the leadership role by the selection panel.

Cummins was made Australia’s 47th Test captain ahead of Ashes series after Tim Paine stepped down last week and took an indefinite break from cricket following the ‘sexting scandal’.

While Cummins was choosen for the top job former skipper Steve Smith was handed the vice-captaincy three years after he was suspended for a year for his role in the ball-tampering scandal that rocked Australian cricket in 2018.

Asked if cricket Australia panel had asked him “anything like a confession” before being appointed as captain Cummins replied in an affirmative.

“Yeah there were a couple of questions. I won’t go into detail” Cummins told ABC sport during an interview but did not share the details.

“It was a really good open discussion. We talked about a lot of different things. So we both left it feeling really comfortable” said the 28-year-old Cummins.

The five-person panel comprised selectors George Bailey and Tony Dodemaide former Australia batter and current CA board member Mel Jones CEO Nick Hockley and chair Richard Freudenstein.

Australia had little time to prepare for the Ashes with the pace trio of Cummins Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc lacking in game time in red-ball cricket as they were busy with the ICC T20 World Cup.

However Australian bowling coach Andrew McDonald said he won’t accept any excuse from his pace bowling unit as the opening Test begins on December 8.

“…It was always going to be a shortened prep and less than ideal switching formats and quarantine and all that stuff” McDonald said during Australia’s first practice session on Sunday.

“But I think the art of the modern-day cricketer is to be able to adapt to that. There’ll be no excuses from our end and I’m sure there’ll be no excuses from England’s end either.” The members of Australia’s Ashes squad who had participated at the T20 World Cup in UAE are currently training at their quarantine centre in Gold Coast.

“We’ve had fantastic facilities up here. The weathe has been challenging at times but we’ve still been able to get out into the centre. Also these guys have got a lot of Test experience to draw upon” McDonald told news.com.au.

“So changing formats is something that they’ve been able to deal with across their careers. I think we’ll be really really really well-prepared.”

Alabama needed a big drive to stay in the game against the Auburn Tigers in the Iron Bowl. Bryce Young and the Crimson Tide delivered and in a huge way.

Down 10-3 in the fourth quarter one touchdown is all they needed and they would get it at the cap of a 97-yard touchdown drive.

Young and company took over with just over a minute remaining in the game.

A few great passes later Young found Jameson Williams’ replacement Ja’Corey Brooks down the sideline for a touchdown pass.

The game is now tied at 10 with this one now going into overtime.

Photo credit: OnScene.TV

Authorities Sunday identified four men who were being held in the “flash mob” robbery of at least $400 of merchandise from a Lakewood Home Depot but more suspects are still at large.

Meanwhile the Los Angeles Police Department lifted a citywide tactical alert early Saturday that had been in effect due to a spate of such robberies throughout the city and surrounding communities.

The Home Depot arrests were made following a traffic stop in Beverly Hills 34 miles to the northwest at approximately 2:20 a.m. Saturday according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Beverly Hills police had spotted a red vehicle in the 400 block of North Rexford Drive with front-end damage matching the description of the vehicle used in the Friday evening robbery.

According to the the sheriff’s department the car contained four males all dressed in dark clothing with “new tools in the vehicle possibly from Home Depot.”

Detectives took the suspects into custody and brought them to the sheriff’s Lakewood station where they were booked on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.

The suspects were identified as Everett Lestorkindle 22 of Hawthorne and Los Angeles residents Bronz Jackson 20 Shawn Jones 19 and Daniel DeHughes 19.

Lestorkindle Jackson and Jones were being held in lieu of $20000 bail and are due Tuesday in court Tuesday. DeHughes was being medically treated prior to being booked.

“There are still several more suspects and suspect vehicles being sought in this flash mob burglary and many more like it” the sheriff’s department statement said.

Home Depot employees told Fox11 a group of up to 20 males between 15 and 20 years old pulled up to the store in as many as 10 cars put on ski masks and began stealing sledgehammers and crowbars.

“We tried to stop them” worker Luis Romo told the station. “We closed the front entrance and they put their sledgehammers up and whoever got in the way they were going to hurt them.”

The group threatened one customer “but he got away” Romo said.

The crime was another in a series of so-called “flash mob” or smash-and-grab robberies across the County with several on Black Friday.

A large group of thieves entered the Bottega Veneta store at 8445 Melrose Place near the border with West Hollywood and stole an unknown amount of items before fleeing.

According to KCAL9 a total of six smash-and-grab robberies took place Friday in the Fairfax District Beverly Grove and Hancock Park.

As of Sunday afternoon the LAPD had not confirmed how many robberies took place across the city on Black Friday.

On Wednesday robbers attacked a security guard and stole designer handbags worth an estimated $25000 from the Nordstrom store at the Westfield Topanga mall in Canoga Park. That same day “flash mob” suspects entered several stores at the Beverly Center grabbed merchandise without paying and ran out according to the LAPD.

Those crimes occurred two days after a smash-and-grab robbery by a mob of at least 20 people at the Nordstrom store at the Grove shopping center in the Fairfax district. The suspects in that robbery fled the scene in at least four vehicles.

Police arrested three suspects in South Los Angeles following a chase. Officers recovered several items of clothing at least one cash register and gloves from their vehicle.

Also Monday at about 9:45 p.m. six suspects entered a CVS Pharmacy on South Vermont Avenue in South Los Angeles and stole three cash registers taking about $8500 in cash police said.

Last Sunday storefront windows of the Louis Vuitton and Saks Fifth Avenue stores in Beverly Hills were smashed during attempted burglaries.

Hall Talk Harrison's Emerging Darkness and Dexter's Reaction to That Big Reveal,"In Sunday’s episode of Dexter: New Blood Dexter’s greatest fear may have become reality.

While Harrison was being hailed as the savior of his high school for thwarting a potential shooting Dexter’s suspicions over his son’s story led him down an unsettling rabbit hole. With the help of police photos and crime-scene spatter Dexter deduced that Harrison was actually the instigator of the conflict and later found what he believed to be the real weapon used on the teen’s classmate Ethan: a straight razor — the same blade used by the Trinity Killer when he sliced up Rita and left her for dead. (Click here for a full Episode 4 recap.)

If Harrison does indeed have a dark passenger of his own does that mean Dexter will take on the role of Harry and teach his own son “the code”? It’s possible teases star Michael C. Hall.

“I think that possibility is a part of the fun and the richness of that relationship” Hall tells TVLine. “There are opposing things that are happening simultaneously for Dexter when it comes to Harrison and the dark passenger. On one hand it’s Dexter’s deepest fear that his son has the dark passenger and on the other hand it’s his deepest wish which makes parenting tricky.”

—

Considering that Dexter went into hiding to escape his dark death-filled past the emergence of Harrison “turns Dexter’s life upside down” says showrunner and executive producer Clyde Phillips. “Dexter’s been living this abstinent monastic lonely life by choice and suddenly here’s his son who’s a young man filled with anger and issues of abandonment and pain but yet somehow is able to socialize.”

Any parent might be on the lookout for abnormalities in his or her child but having both suffered bloody traumatic experiences Dexter’s “curious” (to say the least) as to what effect the past has had on the boy.

Dexter New Blood Episode 4 Debra

“There’s a phenomenon called inherited trauma and Dexter has it” says Phillips. “He wonders if Harrison has it too or if he was too young to remember. And we’ll learn the truth of what that is. Obviously it’s the more entertaining truth. If Harrison had nothing and no memory then we have no story” he teases.

When Dexter pieces together that Harrison might share some of his more violent traits the look on his face is… complicated. Is he frightened beyond belief? Relieved maybe?

“As is always the case with Dexter when presented with an either-or scenario — is it this or is it that? — it’s usually both” says Hall. “He’s experiencing a sense of horror and a sense of relief and a sense of a wish being fulfilled and a sense of the forbidden. It’s all of these things.”

Between Dexter’s return to his old ways and Iron Lake’s missing persons case (what is Kurt Caldwell up to at that cabin?) “Jim Lindsay” will certainly have his hands full for the remainder of the series. As for Harrison what he remembers exactly and what similarities he shares with his father will continue to be explored in upcoming episodes.

“We don’t know if it’s a dark passenger but there is a darkness in Harrison that will emerge” hints Phillips. “I’ll just leave it at that.”

In this day and age there is no shortage of subjects for ""spirited debate"" whether it's on social media in the beauty shop at the liar's table at the local diner or around the dinner table.

You know the sensitive subject list - right vs. left all things COVID Cardinals/Cubs (although Cub fans are kinda quiet these days) and especially Missouri vs. Illinois.

But there is one debate that has raged through the ages and I see it as my duty to see if I can throw some gas on that fire.

Here goes - who has the best maid rites in the universe - Maid Rite in Quincy or the Mark Twain Dinette in Hannibal?

For the uneducated the maid rite (if you live in Iowa it's a loose meat sandwich but who really cares what they call it?) is some combination of seasoned ground beef pickles and onions - and don't ever EVER call it a Sloppy Joe.

Maid Rite on North 12th in Quincy has become an institution in business since 1928.

Quincy Maid Rite Quincy Maid Rite loading...

The Mark Twain Dinette on North 3rd in Hannibal has been a fixture in America's Hometown since 1942.

Mark Twain Dinette Mark Twain Dinette loading...

Yes a check of Maid-Rite's corporate website shows both establishments as franchisees so you may ask wouldn't the sandwich you get at either place be the same?

I believe I speak for everyone when I say that that kind of logical thinking has no place in this debate.

So what say you? Who has the better Maid-Rite? Quincy or Hannibal?

I don't want to sway you one way or the other but let's just say I prefer my maid-rite with a half-foot of onion rings and a frosty mug of root beer - just sayin'.

Tractors light up for Aurora parade,"John Deere meets Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer as tractors celebrate the season.

Aurora’s third annual lighted tractor parade attracted a crowd to the courthouse square as Mayor Marlin Seeman turned on the lights.



15 tractors took part in this year’s parade as local farmers decorated both classic tractors and modern machines with lights.

That included one decked out to look like Rudolph complete with the glowing red nose and antlers.



The parade was part of the Aurora Chamber of Commerce's Come Home to Christmas event that celebrates local businesses.

A number of young people also took part in the parade including several who have now taken part all three years since the Aurora Chamber started this event.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8xMS8yOC93aGF0LWlzLWNhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLXBpcGVsaW5lLXByb3Bvc2Fscy1pb3dhLWFnLWV0aGFub2wtZW1pc3Npb25zLzg3MTc5MDQwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What we know about three carbon capture pipelines proposed in Iowa,"Three companies have proposed building multibillion-dollar pipelines across Iowa to move carbon dioxide so it can be sequestered deep underground potentially cutting greenhouse gas emissions from ethanol fertilizer and other industrial ag plants.

The projects are controversial netting roughly 750 comments to the Iowa Utilities Board through February. Many have been objections with Iowans questioning whether the pipelines are needed are safe and should be allowed to cross valuable farmland that's been passed down through generations.

Here's what we know so far about the projects.

What's been proposed?

Three companies — Summit Carbon Solutions Navigator CO2 Ventures and Archer Daniel Midlands Co. partnering with Wolf Carbon Solutions — want to build pipelines that will be used to move carbon dioxide captured from ethanol fertilizer and other agricultural industrial plants.

The companies plan to use pressure to liquify the carbon dioxide transport it and then inject it deep underground where it will be permanently sequestered. Summit Carbon plans to sequester carbon in North Dakota; Navigator CO2 and ADM in Illinois.

Summit and Navigator have started the process to get hazardous liquid pipeline permits from the Iowa Utilities Board. Summit says the project which the company calls the world's largest will cost $4.5 billion; Navigator $3 billion.

No details are available on the cost of ADM's project.

Summit has filed a petition with state regulators requesting a pipeline permit and the utilities board has started reviewing the request.

Where would the pipelines be built?

Summit an Ames company that calls its project Midwest Carbon Express proposes building about 680 miles of pipeline across 29 of the state's 99 counties. Altogether it would travel 2000 miles across and into four other states: Minnesota North Dakota South Dakota and Nebraska.

Texas-based Navigator CO2 which calls its project Heartland Greenway System wants to build roughly 900 miles of pipeline across 36 counties. Altogether it would cross 1300 miles and also reach into Illinois Nebraska Minnesota and South Dakota.

Summit says it would sequester carbon from 31 biofuels plants; Navigator has reached agreements with about 20 ethanol and fertilizer plants.

ADM a Chicago-based agricultural company and Denver-based Wolf Carbon have proposed capturing carbon dioxide from ADM's ethanol plants in Cedar Rapids and Clinton and moving it through a 350-mile pipeline to Illinois where it would be permanently sequestered.

Why are the projects proposed?

The companies say the projects would help ethanol and other energy-intensive ag industries remain viable as the nation seeks to cut net greenhouse emissions in half by 2030 to address climate change.

Summit says carbon sequestration would help lower ethanol's carbon footprint to net zero by 2030 and allow it to be competitive in California and other states with low carbon fuel standards.

Ethanol is important in Iowa the nation's largest producer of the renewable fuel and its largest corn grower. About half the crop is used each year to make ethanol. But the industry faces a rocky future given President Joe Biden's push toward electric vehicles to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. Most U.S. gasoline is blended with 10% ethanol.

More:Will Biden's push for electric vehicles kill ethanol? Not if he wants to cut carbon emissions now its supporters say

Summit says it has the capacity to capture up to 12 million metric tons of carbon annually an amount equal to removing 2.6 million vehicles from the road each year.

Navigator says its pipeline has the capacity to capture about 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually the equivalent of removing 3.2 million vehicles from the road.

ADM and Wolf expect to transport 12 million tons a year.

Are the pipelines a good environmental solution?

The White House says carbon sequestration projects likely will be needed needed to meet President Joe Biden's climate goal of net-zero emissions economywide by 2050.

But Mark Jacobson a Stanford University civil and environmental engineering professor said that carbon capture systems so far have failed to meet the promises of significantly reduced emissions.

For example a carbon capture system at a Texas coal power plant cut emissions 55% the first year and 70% after three years. But the company which used the carbon to extract oil claimed it would capture 90% or more of the emissions Jacobson said.

The picture worsened when the emissions from coal mining and other activities were taken into account said Jacobson who calculated there would have been a 12% reduction in carbon emissions over 20 years had the plant not closed.

Instead of trying to extend ethanol's viability Carolyn Raffensperger an Iowa environmental lawyer said Iowa should focus on transitioning the state's farming economy away from producing renewable fuel and the corn and soybean crops needed to make it.

Iowa also is the nation's largest biodiesel producer in the nation and taps soybean oil along with used cooking oil grease and animal fats to make it. The state is the second-largest U.S. soybean grower.

The drive toward electric vehicles raises questions ""about the long-term future of Iowa corn production"" Raffensperger said.

Are there other carbon sequestration pipelines in the U.S.?

The nation has about 5000 miles of existing carbon sequestration pipelines with the carbon dioxide mostly used to squeeze more oil out of existing wells a process called enhanced oil recovery.

Iowa has no carbon capture pipelines.

How will the pipelines affect land?

Summit and Navigator will seek right-of-way easements both permanent and temporary from landowners. Permanent easements would be 50 feet.

The companies promise to restore the land — and the underground drainage tiles — to the same conditions that existed before construction.

Both companies say they'll reimburse landowners for rights-of-way access based on market values. And they plan to pay farmers the same percentages for crop damage: 100% of the crop damage the first year; 80% the second year; and 60% the third year.

At meetings with Summit and Navigator and in IUB comments Iowans have expressed doubt the companies would fully restore underground drainage or restore farmland to its existing productivity.

ADM and Wolf haven't released details about their project yet.

More: Critics of $4.5 billion carbon capture pipeline say Branstad appointees have conflict should recuse themselves

Iowa has about 30 million acres of cropland pastures and other ag land. And drainage tiles lie under an estimated 9 million acres to shed excess water an investment that improves crop yields.

Kevin Lambert who farms near Dayton said land that Dakota Access trenched through to bury its pipeline continues to produce fewer bushels of corn and soybeans than before the pipeline. Now his land could be in the path of Summit's carbon capture pipeline.

""I never imagined another pipeline would come through"" so soon after Dakota Access Lambert said. ""It's kind of sad. … We'll see the repercussions for years to come.""

Can Iowans in the proposed pathway of the pipeline refuse?

Yes. But Summit Navigator and ADM-Wolf can ask the three-person utilities board to grant eminent domain powers if they're determined to serve a public purpose. That would force unwilling landowners to grant easements at fair market values.

Iowa landowners fought the use of eminent domain in the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The battle reached the Iowa Supreme Court which decided the state was justified in allowing the use of eminent domain.

Are the pipelines safe?

Iowans who oppose the projects point to a carbon dioxide pipeline leak a year ago in Mississippi that sickened dozens of nearby residents. A recent Huffington Post story said Satartia residents were engulfed inside a greenish cloud and within minutes were ""gasping for air nauseated and dazed.""

Cars shut off since they need oxygen to burn fuel. Drivers scrambled out of their paralyzed vehicles but were so disoriented that they just wandered around in the dark the article said.

“It was almost like something you’d see in a zombie movie. They were just walking in circles” Terry Gann a Yazoo County sheriff officer told the publication.

Ted Schettler science director of the Science and Environmental Health Network told the Register that concentrated levels of carbon dioxide are dangerous. ""It's an asphyxiant"" he said often used to euthanize livestock before the animals are slaughtered.

""CO2 is heavier than air and settles to the ground and displaces oxygen"" Schettler said. ""People who are caught in a pure CO2 cloud that might be released from a pipeline"" face ""a real threat to safety and survivability"" he said.

What does Summit say about safety?

Jimmy Powell Summit's chief operating officer said at a public meeting this fall that the Mississippi carbon dioxide pipeline also contained hydrogen sulfide gas which made the leak much more dangerous.

Summit's pipeline will capture ""the purest form of CO2 that's available"" he said. ""It's not analogous to the situation in Mississippi.""

Powell said Summit plans to take extra precautions to ensure the pipeline is safe such as X-raying every weld in the pipeline even though the federal government requires that only 10% be tested.

In a board filing Summit said it will ""exceed the number of valves"" that can close to limit CO2 releases than required by federal regulations.

""Note that CO2 is neither explosive nor flammable (it is used as a fire suppressant)"" Summit said in the filing. ""If released CO2 will disperse as a gas and no overland flow will occur.""

The company noted ""there has never been a death caused by a CO2 pipeline.""

Summit said it also would ensure that first responders along the pipeline have the training and equipment needed to respond to a leak.

Would the pipeline help farmland values?

Many Iowans questioned the impact the pipelines would have on their farmland values in filings with the Iowa Utilities Board in addition to raising concern about safety for the farmers and families who live near them.

""This pipeline will not add one dollar to the real estate value"" wrote C.J. Schelling of Hull who called the pipeline a ""permanent scar"" on his land that will last generations.

""Farmland has traditionally been a sound investment but who would want to buy a farm that has a hazardous material pipeline on it?"" said Don Johannsen who owns a farm in Cherokee County. ""No one unless they can buy it at a bargain.""

More:Net-zero emissions by 2050? Controversial proposal could make Des Moines a leader of climate action

Justin Kirchhoff president of Summit Ag Investors said capturing carbon makes ethanol ""more profitable and viable"" as the nation reduces carbon dioxide from its transportation fuel supply.

Ethanol demand helps support prices for corn. And Iowa farmland values are calculated in part by their ability to produce the crop called the Corn Suitability Rating. Depending on the county Summit anticipates paying between $100 and $160 per corn suitability rating point for easements it said in a filing.

For example Summit said it would pay $45000 for a five-acre easement on a farm with a rating of 75 in Floyd County.

Do the projects improve Iowa's economy?

Proponents say the projects would help support thousand of jobs at Iowa ethanol plants some of the best-paying in rural Iowa as well as beef poultry and other livestock producers who use a high-protein livestock feed that's an ethanol byproduct.

An economic study completed for the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association found that the ethanol and biodiesel industry supports about 37000 Iowa jobs when farming trucking livestock production and other indirect positions are factored in.

Summit says the pipeline project would create up to 17000 construction jobs for the entire project and up to 460 permanent positions. Navigator says its project would create 8000 construction positions and 80 permanent jobs.

Why are some Iowans asking Summit to release its landowner mailing lists?

Opponents to the project are pushing Summit to release its mailing lists of landowners in the pipeline's proposed pathway so they can more easily organize efforts to stop the project.

Summit asked the Iowa Utilities Board in August to keep its mailing lists of landowners confidential to protect landowners' privacy. It also said the release would serve no public purpose but it would help its competitors.

In a December order the board agreed to keep the names of thousands of individual landowners secret saying property owners' rights to privacy outweighed the public interest. It did however order Summit to release the names of businesses cities counties and other government entities that own land in the proposed pathway.

The board said Summit's 31 mailing lists contain 15000 names.

The board was split over the decision: Richard Lozier and Josh Byrnes ordered that individual landowners' names and addresses be kept confidential. Geri Huser dissented saying she would release the property owners' mailing addresses but not their names.

Jennifer Easler the Iowa Attorney General's consumer advocate asked in a filing for the mailing lists to be released saying they would enable landowners who oppose the project to mount a joint defense.

She said the mailing lists were culled from public records and unlikely to provide a competitor an advantage since proposed maps of the pipeline pathways have been released.

All of the board members rejected Summit's concerns about competition.

How will the projects be financed?

Kirchhoff said Summit would look to loans both private and potentially government-backed and investors to build the pipeline.

Summit announced in July that Deere & Co. the giant Moline Illinois farm equipment manufacturer was a ""strategic investor"" in its carbon capture project and about 30 state and regional ethanol plants have agreed to participate in the project.

Also billionaire oil tycoon Harold Hamm’s Continental Resources said in March that the company will invest $250 million in the project.

Kirchhoff said the company would share the added income that ethanol plants get from selling their low carbon fuel for higher prices. California for example provides about $200 in credits for every metric ton of carbon that's sequestered he said. And producers of dirtier fuels that don’t meet California’s standards have to buy those credits to comply.

Kirchhoff said part of the company's revenue would come from federal tax credits which provide about $50 for each metric ton of carbon that's sequestered.

Navigator's Elizabeth Burns-Thompson said ethanol fertilizer and other companies will pay Navigator to move their carbon dioxide through its pipeline like buying a ticket on a bus. The low-carbon fuel premiums and tax credits will remain with local companies Burns-Thompson said and they will use some of the revenue to pay for Navigator's pipeline services.

BlackRock a New York investment company is providing some of the project's financial backing and Valero Energy a large Texas oil company with a dozen Midwest ethanol plants including five in Iowa is among the commercial participants.

Are there conflicts of interest?

Critics of Summit's project say two state utilities board members appointed by former Gov. Terry Branstad have a conflict of interest and should recuse themselves from decisions about the project which has hired Branstad as an adviser.

Summit hired Branstad who was the U.S. ambassador to China under President Donald Trump in March to provide ""oversight leadership and guidance on public policy matters affecting stakeholders.""

Branstad who left the state's top job in May 2017 to assume his ambassadorship appointed Huser in 2015 as a board member and chair and Gov. Kim Reynolds reappointed her in January. Huser is serving a two-year term as chair and a six-year term as a board member.

Branstad appointed Lozier to the board in 2017. Lozier will serve through April 2023. Reynolds who served as Branstad's lieutenant governor appointed Joshua Byrnes the third board member in November.

The utilities board said board members ""are subject to judicial ethics requirements similar to those required for district court judges"" and ""will make their decision whether there is a conflict of interest that prevents them from participating in the hearing that considers the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline at the appropriate time.""

Since then he's converted diesel tractors to electric power custom-built electric tractors and assembled an experimental electric tractor for Ford New Holland as early as 1995. Today as founder of Solectrac Heckeroth is finally seeing electric tractors taken seriously by both customers and other manufacturers.

California-based Solectrac has sold about two dozen of its battery-powered tractors since 2018 and has accumulated about $1 million worth of back orders because of pandemic-related issues.

""The biggest problem with electric cars is the weight of the batteries"" says Heckeroth who has a background in solar power and electric vehicles. ""I realized very quickly that weight on a tractor is actually an asset that improves traction.""

More than 14 countries and over 20 cities have proposed or enacted bans on the sale of cars and in some cases light trucks powered by fossil fuels; the bans will go into effect from five to 20 years from now. Heckeroth expects a ban on small gasoline- and diesel-powered tractors to follow especially in large cities. The push to reduce air pollution is primarily driving the market but he lists a number of benefits an electric tractor offers over its diesel counterpart.

""In addition to being cleaner and quieter an electric tractor is much more efficient since all the energy goes into work; whereas in a diesel tractor much of it is wasted as heat"" he explains. ""In addition maximum torque is available immediately rather than at rated engine speed. Finally since the power source has just one moving part they require very little maintenance. Even the batteries are projected to last 10 years pending operating cycles and depth of discharge.""

Solectrac currently offers a 30-hp. compact and a 40-hp. utility model. The company just introduced a 70-hp. vineyard and orchard tractor which addresses the specific needs of that specialty market with its narrow width and greater horsepower.

Monarch Tractor

Equipped with an electric drivetrain capable of providing 40 hp. of continuous power and short-duration peak power up to 70 hp. the Monarch combines electrification automation machine learning and data analysis to bring a fully electric driver-optional smart tractor to the farm in a single platform.

""Monarch Tractor is moving farming toward a safer sustainable future by eliminating harmful emissions reducing the need for herbicides and keeping workers out of harm's way with its driver-optional capabilities"" says Carl Mondavi Monarch Tractor chief farming officer.

The California company recently received a minority investment from CNH Industrial that will share Monarch Tractor's electric and autonomous tractor technology across CNH's portfolio of ag brands.

""This partnership underscores our commitment to rapidly improving our alternative propulsion and precision-farming portfolio while extending our world-leading sustainability credentials"" says Scott Wine CEO CNH Industrial.

Kubota Prototypes

Kubota recently released two prototype machines powered by lithium-ion batteries that will be tested in France later this year. One is a compact tractor while the other is a mini excavator. The company says the maximum output of both machines will be equivalent to that of models with diesel engines.

Fendt e100 Vario

AGCO has looked to its Fendt division to take the lead in electric tractor production. The company has already developed a 75-kW (100 hp.) electric tractor. Known as the Fendt e100 Vario the all-electric compact tractor operates up to 10 hours under actual operating conditions and can be recharged to 80% in just 40 minutes.

""The technology developed by the auto industry has been a big driver in development of electric tractors"" says Tom Turner AGCO strategic marketing manager for high-horsepower tractors pointing to higher-capacity batteries with faster charging cycles. ""Now we're just trying to get ahead of the curve.

""The Fendt e100 is similar in size and power to the Fendt 200"" he adds. ""Thanks to its quiet and emissions-free operation we see real potential for an electric tractor that size particularly among small farms and livestock operations and for use in urban and residential areas. Compact tractors aren't typically used a long distance from home or the shop; they often spend a fair amount of time idle.""

Like Heckeroth Turner points out that an electric tractor eliminates the cost of fuel oil DEF etc. and the batteries can be charged via renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power for an even lower cost of operation. Thanks to the three-point hitch hydraulic remote valves and PTO an electric tractor can operate any existing implement as well as electric-powered implements being developed.

John Deere GridCON

Unfortunately Turner doesn't see electric tractors going much higher than 100 hp. or much longer than a few hours on a charge with current technology. John Deere has attempted to remedy those issues with its cable-powered prototype GridCON. Unlike its earlier battery-powered prototypes the fully electric autonomous tractor provides up to 400 hp. (300 kW) and is powered by an electric cable connection from the field border to the tractor via a drum that carries more than 1000 yards of cable.

""The biggest challenge for battery electric tractors is available energy capacity in batteries today compared with the energy required for typical farming operations"" says Dennis Muszalski director module and electrification system engineering John Deere. ""During the critical windows of planting and harvesting availability of equipment is paramount. Our customers can't afford any delays due to limitations of battery capacity resulting in frequent and lengthy recharging.""

Although prices aren't available yet for prototype models the Monarch has a base price of $50000. Solectrac tractors currently list for about 20% more than a comparable diesel model. However the lower maintenance costs should offset much of that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3R0aXNoZmFybWVyLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMTk3NDE3ODguam9obi1kZWVyZXMtbmV3LWRlc2lnbi1zbWFydGVyLTZyLWZvdXItc2l4LWN5bGluZGVyLXRyYWN0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Deere's new design and smarter 6R four and six cylinder tractors,"In addition to the original range four brand new models will include the four-cylinder 6R 150 aimed particularly at mixed farms and the six-cylinder 6R 185 a specialist transport tractor for farmers and contractors who spend more time on the road. These new 6R tractors will be available to customers around the world by mid-2022 and host a number of new features that boost performance and looks.

A key new 6R Series feature is the integrated one-click-go AutoSetup system which makes tractor and implement settings much quicker and easier. The operator can save up to 90% of display clicks in the field and the tractor is always perfectly adjusted mostly on its own.

All the required settings can be pre-planned and managed in the cloud including agronomic data such as field boundaries guidance lines and prescriptions. Once the tractor crosses the field boundary the stored profile is automatically available and even temporary drivers can be consistently accurate and avoid mistakes.

While AutoSetup makes the driver’s life easier John Deere has also increased operator comfort. Among other features the dashboard behind the steering wheel has disappeared which not only improves forward visibility but also operator control using the armrest and right-hand console. All settings and indicators are provided on the corner post display.

Loader work

Another new feature is the E-joystick which is particularly useful for front loader work. With this the operator can freely configure the layout of the buttons and can easily change the direction of travel using the reverser button while a special hand detection system replaces the former safety flap.

For front loaders there is a dynamic weighing system that allows weighing on the move without having to stop. In addition the 'return to position' feature enables the loader to be placed into the correct position with one click while 'level to horizon' avoids spilling the bucket load.

IPM (Intelligent Power Management) has been made smarter on the new 6R Series. This means that in addition to IPM functioning in transport and pto applications it also delivers additional horsepower in hydraulic applications as required. The four-cylinder models can now deliver up to 20hp 'extra' power and the six-cylinder models have up to 40hp on top of the rated power when using hydraulic fans pumps and the most power-hungry hydraulic implements such as wrapping balers slurry tankers and drills.

In late 2022 a new StarFire satellite receiver will offer even more precision-ag performance. No matter which level of correction signal accuracy farmers choose this new receiver will provide superior signal stability when operating in shaded areas pointed out John Deere.

Another highlight of the latest 6R Series tractors is a new look. The hood and mirrors are well known from John Deere’s larger tractor series while the name and numbering system has also been adopted from the 7R 8R and 9R Series models. The 6R range name is now followed by a separate indication of the rated engine horsepower.

To meet individual customer requirements the 6R Series has been extended by four new tractor models. Chief of these are the compact and efficient 6R 185 that delivers up to 234hp with IPM and is specially designed for transport work plus the 6R 150 with a four-cylinder engine and high payload which is the perfect all-rounder for mixed farms.

There are also more transmission options available in this new range. In addition to AutoQuad Plus and the AutoPowr infinitely variable transmission customers can now choose the CommandQuad option for four-cylinder models.

New 6R 185

The new 6R 185 is aimed at farmers and contractors looking for a compact versatile and powerful six-cylinder tractor to be used mainly for transport but also capable of handling demanding hydraulic power requirements. It delivers up to 234hp maximum power with Intelligent Power Management in transport pto and hydraulic applications.

The 6R 185 is also an agile tractor due to its short wheelbase of just 2.76m which makes it more compact than the larger 6R Series models with a 2.8 or 2.9m wheelbase. This feature combined with the 6.8-litre John Deere PowerTech PSS engine and highly efficient AutoPowr transmission makes this tractor particularly fuel efficient on the road.

The 6R 250 flagship model has already set a new efficiency standard in transport applications and John Deere is convinced that the 6R 185 will be a worthy heir in this class.

New 6R 150

Mixed farms that prefer four-cylinder tractors but do not want to sacrifice power is the name of the game for the 6R 150. These have a maximum power rating of 165hp (177hp with IPM) making them the largest four-cylinder model in the series.

Tyre size has also been increased with rear wheel options available up to 650/65 R38. Its short wheelbase of only 2.58m makes this machine particularly manoeuvrable and ideal for loader work.

With a low empty weight of 6.5 tonnes and a total permissible weight of 10.45 tonnes the 6R 150 can provide a high payload of four tonnes. It therefore can offer the performance of a six-cylinder tractor with the advantages of a four-cylinder machine ie compact dimensions and light weight combined with agile and versatile performance.

For lifting heavier equipment rear hydraulic lift capacity has been increased by 12%. The 6R 150 also offers a larger 155-litre hydraulic pump which combined with the dynamic weighing system provides considerable front loader performance advantages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhcm1lcnNqb3VybmFsLmllL25ld3MvZmVhdHVyZS90b3ktcmV2aWV3LWpvaG4tZGVlcmUtb3BvbHktZnVuLXRvLXBsYXktd2l0aC1hbGwtdGhlLWZhbWlseS02NTg5MzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toy review: JOHN DEERE-OPOLY- fun to play with all the family,"What is your name?

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are the only two US airlines impacted by new travel restrictions to southern Africa.

Both airlines fly non-stop between the US and Johannesburg South Africa with United planning to also fly to Cape Town South Africa starting December 1.

Flights to South Africa were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic but both airlines resumed flying in 2021.

New international travel restrictions being implemented by the US government will affect the two US airlines that fly between the US and southern Africa.

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are currently the only American airlines serving South Africa from where travel will be restricted from November 29. Both airlines currently fly to Johannesburg South Africa's largest city while United had planned to resume flights to Cape Town in December.

Delta confirmed to Insider that is not currently planning any service changes in light of the new restrictions.

""The health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority"" the statement on Delta's website reads. ""Delta will continue to work closely with our government partners to monitor the new COVID-19 variant and any travel restrictions.""

United did not immediately return Insider's request for comment on how the travel restrictions would impact its flights.

The two airlines among the largest international carriers in the US had both flown to South Africa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and suspended flights to the country in March 2020. Flights only resumed in 2021 well after South Africa reopened its borders to international visitors.

Delta stopped flying between Atlanta and Johannesburg on March 22 2020 and resumed the route on August 1 2020. At a range of nearly 7500 nautical miles the Atlanta-Johannesburg route is the longest in the Delta network and is served by an Airbus A350-900 XWB aircraft one of the newest in the airline's fleet.

United launched its route between Newark and Johannesburg in June as part of a minor expansion to Africa during the pandemic that also saw flights between Washington DC and Accra Ghana launched in May. Flights between Washington and Lagos Nigeria are also scheduled to launch on November 29.

Ghana and Nigeria are not affected by the new US travel restrictions.

United began its non-stop flights between Newark and Cape Town in December 2019 just four months before the pandemic forced that route to be temporarily suspended. Flights are scheduled to resume on December 1 but it's unclear whether they will actually fly given the new restrictions.

Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft are used for both United routes with each boasting a distance of nearly 7000 nautical miles that make them among the longest in United's network.

No airlines American or otherwise currently fly between the US and the other seven southern African countries slated to be impacted by the Biden administration's restrictions including Zimbabwe Botswana Lesotho Mozambique Eswatini Malawi and Namibia.







Repatriation flights for US citizens have not yet been announced by either airline for Americans to return home without having to transit through third countries. Qatar Airways and Emirates two global airlines that earned a reputation for flying repatriation flights during the early months of the pandemic have both said they will not fly travelers from some southern African countries.

South African Airways stopped flying between the US and South Africa on March 29 2020 and has not resumed flights in part due to the pandemic and in part because of its financial restructuring initiatives.

American citizens and foreign nationals flying to the US will need to show a negative COVID-19 test before boarding their flight. The validity of the test required to travel will depend on the vaccination status of the traveler.

Unvaccinated travelers to the US will need to take their test ""no more than [one] day before travel"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccinated travelers to the US will need to get tested no more than three days before travel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hZXJvc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS9kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLWF0bGFudGEtZGl2ZXJ0ZWQtYm9zdG9uLXRlY2huaWNhbC1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucy0yMDIxLTExLTI4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Delta flight from South Africa to Atlanta diverted to Boston for ""technical specifications""",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/delta-flight-south-africa-atlanta-diverted-boston-technical-specifications-2021-11-28/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hZXJvc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS9kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLWF0bGFudGEtZGl2ZXJ0ZWQtYm9zdG9uLXRlY2huaWNhbC1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucy0yMDIxLTExLTI4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmZ0b25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI3L2RlbHRhMTUtbWVldC10aGUtc2FsZXMtbWFuYWdlci1lbG9pbmEtYmFkZG9vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta@15: Meet the Sale's Manager Eloina Baddoo,"Delta Air Lines is the longest-serving U.S. airline to Africa and will celebrate its 15th anniversary of flying to Accra this December. Heading-up the airline’s sales team in Ghana is Eloina Baddoo who joined the company in 2017 as an intern.

She is one quarter of an all-female sales leadership team on the continent joining her counterparts in Nigeria Senegal and South Africa – making up the four countries from which Delta flies nonstop to the United States. As Delta approaches its African milestone we spoke to Eloina about how she rose through the ranks of the airline in Ghana and where she’ll be traveling to on her next flight.

What attracted you to working at Delta?

During my first year in college the Managing Director for Ghana gave a presentation at one of our student forums. Hearing about Delta being the first U.S. airline to operate nonstop flights from Accra to New York captivated me and got me dreaming of working for the airline.

How long have you been at Delta and how did you become the sales manager?

I have been at Delta for four years. The General Manager at the time nominated me for this role after working with me for about two years.

Tell me more about your job.

I like to say I am the face of Delta in Ghana. Together with my team I manage Delta’s commercial operations in Ghana Liberia and Cote D’Ivoire. We maintain good relationships with our existing customers establish new ones provide support for our trade and corporate partners and market the company across the countries. Everything we do is focused on serving our customers and building our business in Africa.

What is your favorite part of your job?

Traveling attending and organizing events meeting new people providing solutions to complex customer requests and keeping our customers happy.

Have you experienced any obstacles in your career and how have you overcome these?

I started my career at Delta as a business intern and transitioning from a junior staff to a managerial role challenged me. Fortunately I had some great mentors who guided me through that phase and encouraged me to reach my full potential. My international colleagues also offered their support and even today they are always on standby to help when I call on them.

What changes have you seen in aviation / travel since you started your career?

Speaking for the Ghanaian market passengers are no longer driven only by price they are concerned about the travel experience quality of the service and health and safety. They have also developed an interest in digital tools to book their own travel rather than preferring face-to-face support. Within airlines I have noticed an increase in IT and digital investments despite the current financial straits. I’m proud that Delta is always leading the industry in digital innovations.

What one thing have you learned in your current job above everything else?

Customer service should not be underrated because people never forget how you make them feel.

Why should people choose Delta?

We have the best customer service in the industry. The sincerity of our concern for customers has been proven during and after the pandemic through the innovative policies we introduced and always putting their health and safety first.

Where is your favorite place to travel?

Atlanta – the weather is great and the people are very sociable and friendly.

What are your hobbies? How do you unwind after a busy day?

My afterwork routine is to hit the couch to watch a telenovela with sugared popcorn and ice cream. I enjoy traveling teaching Sunday School making desserts and doing small home DIY projects.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2F2aWF0aW9uLWdpZnRzLWFsYXNrYS1haXJsaW5lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Even if you're not an avgeek you'll love holiday shopping at the Alaska Airlines company store,"There's a ""secret"" shop just down the road from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) that avgeeks (aviation geeks) and Alaska Airlines fans will want to add to their itineraries.

In July 2020 the Seattle-based carrier opened a gleaming new 6-story office building called ""The Hub"" across from its corporate headquarters with an open-to-the-public company store (and a Starbucks) on the first floor. But because the pandemic was just taking hold when The Hub opened there's been barely any publicity about the store and thus few non-employee shoppers.

This holiday season should be much different. More people are traveling and word is spreading about the unique logo and branded gear on the shop's shelves for Alaska Airlines and its sister regional carrier Horizon Air.

""This is the best of the best for company swag. says Karen McAvinew Manager of Retail Operations for Alaska Airlines. She says the shop is a short drive or a manageable 1-mile walk from SEA airport and offers a view of the Alaska Airlines hangar and a peek-a-boo view of the 780-foot aerial walkway at SEA that is the longest arial walkway over an existing taxiway.

While most of the glassware apparel accessories and gift items in the store can also be found in the airline's online shop we discovered plenty of in-store bonuses during our pre-Thanksgiving shopping excursion alongside several pilots who had stopped in before their flights.

Model Airplanes

The shop stocks – and displays on a wall – model airplanes in various scales of almost every current Alaska and Horizon livery flying including the More to Love livery that celebrated the joining of Alaska Airlines and Virgin America the Salmon Thirty Salmon depicting yup a salmon the ""Honoring Those Who Have Served"" plane and livery celebrating ""Captain Marvel"" ""Toy Story"" Disney and other promotions and partnerships. Prices range from about $30 to well over $100 and we spotted some models in the shop that show as sold-out online. Models of Alaska Airlines' new Pride plane and one celebrating Seattle's new professional ice hockey team the Seattle Kraken should land soon.

Be sure to look up. Hanging from the shop is a display of many collectible airplane models that have been discontinued.

Drinkware and Votives

McAvinew says that in addition to t-shirts and other branded clothing Alaska Airlines' drinkware is a top seller including everything from shot glasses tumblers coffee mugs and wine glasses to all manner of water bottles. Two branded hand-blown candle votives (""Dream"" and ""Cabo"") by Seattle's Glassybaby which donates part of its proceeds to non-profits are available online and in the shop. This year there's a special edition in-store-only Glassbaby votive ($78) as well.

In addition to child and teen-sized t-shirts and hoodies the kids' section in the shop has toys Alaska Airlines' plush huskies Lego-like construction kits and more. We couldn't resist the kid-sized sunglasses ($6) that have a pilot cap plastic panel up above.

However November is also National Diabetes Awareness Month which is recognized to offer resources and highlight the effects of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes is characterized as the lack of insulin production while type 2 diabetes which accounts for 90-95 percent of all diabetes cases is caused by the body’s ineffective use of insulin.

Dr. Colin Washington MD/MPH likened diabetes to a marathon over a sprint.

“Once on this journey it is important to remember that lifestyle changes do not need to occur overnight but we must continue to focus on ever-improving behaviors” said Washington an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine at Emory University.

The National Diabetes Statistics Report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2020 states that 32.4 million Americans including children have diabetes. African American adults are 60 percent more likely than Caucasian adults to be diagnosed with diabetes.

According to the World Health Organization diabetes is a significant cause of kidney failure blindness heart attacks strokes and limb amputation.

“We must look [within the community] to learn how to manage our risk until a solution is found” said Washington.

One necessity during this tempting holiday is having a support system of loved ones and medical practitioners.

“It is important to maintain a healthy sphere of influence around those with diabetes to allow for the best opportunity for their diabetes care to be a success” said Washington. “It is also important for those caring [for others] with diabetes to remain in close contact with their healthcare providers.”

Several factors including obesity hypertension high cholesterol and cigarette smoking contribute to the overwhelming diagnosis of African Americans. This Thanksgiving consider a vegetable medley instead of mashed potatoes or substituting fat-free broth for butter.

“As access to healthy foods becomes more difficult we must continue to rely on our community to provide the tools to try [to] minimize the risk of developing diabetes” said Washington.

Dr. Washington insists everyone remember that there is no hiatus for diabetes during the holiday season.

“Thanksgiving is a time for many to come together over a wonderful meal and celebrate all that we are grateful for” Washington said. “But during this time we must also remain grateful for our health and continue to do everything we can to preserve it.”

Yes they most definitely should. Accepting the cash subsidy from the government will help lift people from poverty allowing them to enjoy some basic necessities in life including having three meals a day.

As of 2020 roughly one in five Hongkongers or 1.65 million people were living in poverty the highest number in 12 years.

It is the poor people who have suffered the most during the pandemic; many have lost their jobs or become homeless.

Should consumer vouchers be given to all Hongkongers?

Low-income families in Hong Kong are having a tough time earning enough money to pay for rent education and groceries.

In 2020 the government gave out HK$316.4 billion in four rounds of subsidies from its anti-epidemic fund to support businesses that had been negatively affected by the social distancing regulations. Many shops and restaurants were shut down for months on end.

Unemployment stood at 6 per cent in the final quarter of the year with 245800 people out of work as the city battled the fourth wave of the coronavirus. And the number of people living below the poverty line increased from 1.49 million to 1.65 million.

Around one-fifth of Hongkongers live in poverty. Photo: SCMP/ May Tse

However the government said that its interventions “created an alleviating effect for the underprivileged and effectively suppressed the would-be sharp rise in the poverty rate in a deteriorating economy”.

The implementation of these measures lifted nearly 1 million people from poverty and reduced the overall poverty rate by 15.7 per cent.

Take a look at Hong Kong’s latest Poverty Situation report

This shows low-income families should continue to receive cash subsidies from the government.

How will this help Hong Kong to grow as a city?

Helping the poor can reduce their financial burden and boost businesses and industries. It’s a win-win for everyone.

How helpful was Hong Kong’s consumer voucher scheme?

Against: Teresa Kwok 16 South Island School

The latest figures show that 1.65 million Hongkongers were living in poverty last year. Pro-welfare political parties and organisations argue that the government should continue to offer cash subsidies to low-income people. This is because Hong Kong’s wealth inequality is one of the highest in the world and the pandemic is still having a serious impact on the city’s economy they say.

I don’t agree. Providing handouts is not sustainable in the long term.

One of the main causes of Hong Kong’s poverty rate hitting a 12-year high is the Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of Hongkongers mainly in tourism hospitality and retail industries have lost their jobs over the past two years.

One in five women in HK lives in poverty

But there is good news emerging from a pandemic-ravaged world. Many countries are opening up and preparing to resume normal life. I believe Hong Kong will follow suit early next year so ongoing cash grants for the underprivileged won’t be necessary.

Encouraging all eligible Hongkongers to be fully vaccinated will be more useful because achieving herd immunity will encourage the government to lift all social distancing restrictions and reopen Hong Kong to the outside world.

Only around 70 per cent of Hongkongers are fully vaccinated. Photo: SCMP / May Tse

Also it’s a fact that too much welfare including cash subsidies discourage people from contributing to society. They become dependent on handouts and stop looking for jobs. They lose their motivation leading to a decrease in productivity. Hence allocating more money for education and training programmes will be more beneficial than giving handouts to the public.

Ongoing cash subsidies may help alleviate poverty to a certain extent but this won’t be effective over a long period of time.

It will mean Hong Kong facing a severe financial crisis in the future including huge deficits in education health and other crucial sectors. Instead the government should allocate more funds for programmes that help people find higher-paying jobs and raise their living standards.",,,,,,,,,

The sneaky blaze began shortly before noon in the long-gun range at the Rockland Indoor Shooting Education Center -- commonly known as ""The Rise"" -- beneath the Dollar General store and other businesses in the North Middletown Road shopping center Pearl River Fire Chief Jim Morrison said.

The range was occupied at the time Morrison told Rockland Video Productions.

The shopping center was evacuated and area roads were closed as flames spread into a ""void space"" between the ceiling of the gun range and the floor of the stores above travelling ""all the way across the whole length of the building"" the chief said.

It continued to burn beneath Dollar General and the Dunkin Donuts next door past nightfall causing problems for firefighters who couldn't get to it he said.

""The way the building was constructed we're not able to get to the where the seat of the fire is"" Morrison explained shortly before 5:30 p.m. ""Every time we open a space there's another space.""

Now they tell us inflation might be happening — but it’s the fault of greedy corporations! And those companies must be punished.

Corporate greed is why your Thanksgiving turkey and energy prices were and are more expensive this year alleges Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. Corporate greed is also why Dollar Tree is finally raising its prices after 35 years from $1 to $1.25 for most items says a senior staffer for Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt. And corporate greed (and possibly malfeasance!) is why prices at the pump remain high suggested Biden who has asked the Federal Trade Commission to probe “potentially illegal and anti-competitive behavior” in the oil and gas industry.

Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers lined up 2.5 miles of streets on Thursday morning to enjoy the pleasure and amusement brought by the annual Thanksgiving parade.Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade this year made a full return following a much shorter and mostly virtual one last year at the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic.New Yorkers are facing a kind of new normal in their life amid continuous pandemic inflation pressures and safety measures.The parade featured 15 giant character balloons 28 floats 36 novelty and heritage inflatables more than 800 clowns ten marching bands and nine performance groups a host of musical stars and the one-and-only Santa Claus according to an earlier release by Macy's.Six new floats made their debut including Birds of a Feather Stream Together by the streaming service Peacock Celebration Gator by Louisiana Office of Tourism Gravy Pirates by the Kraft Heinz Company Magic Meets the Sea by Disney Cruise Line.The event was subject to tight security measures with a number of late spectators being kept one block away from the route of the parade.Days ago a vehicle plowed through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee of Wisconsin killing six people and injuring over 60.U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday called Al Roker one of the hosts of the Macy's Thanksgiving parade saying ""My message is after two years you're back America's back.""Measures were still in place to contain risks from infections of the coronavirus as the 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases has been hovering around 90000 in the United States.Parade staffers and volunteers were required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and wear masks while some singers and performers could take their masks off.Macy's and the New York City also encouraged spectators to cover their faces though there was no mandate for inoculation.The Thanksgiving holiday also came at a time when Americans have been facing sticky inflation pressures.Macy's a household retail brand is offering discounts to woo shoppers via both online and offline channels.Macy's could sometime pass higher costs of fashion apparels to customers and raise sales prices while it faces a ""price ceiling"" for commodity items such as basic T-shirts or denim jeans according to Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette.Macy's has been running tests in the last three months to see which kinds of goods are sensitive to price changes and which ones could fetch higher prices without hurting sales much.U.S. low-end retail brand Dollar Tree Inc. on Tuesday announced that it would raise benchmark unit price to 1.25 U.S. dollars from 1 U.S. dollar at its stores all across the country following earlier pricing tests.""Now that's 125 cents. There's no more 99 cents. Everything is going up all over the world"" said a Brooklyn resident who only gave his name as Jose who bought some plastic cups and gift bags from a Dollar Tree store along Hamilton Avenue in Brooklyn on Thursday afternoon.""If you go to the supermarket and you pay 50 U.S. dollars or 75 U.S. dollars you get nothing"" Jose said.""When you have a big family like three or four kids that's very hard"" he said.The price of turkey has gone up from 1.29 dollars per pound last year to the current 1.89 dollars to 2.49 dollars according to Jose.Jose said his holiday wish is all of the family would be healthy.

In an interview with Times of Malta Gordon Cordina mapped out the economic dominos that would come tumbling down were Malta to have its financial quarantine extended.

In June members of a global anti-money laundering watchdog voted to add Malta to its so-called grey list.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Malta have since agreed on a series of reforms that must be implemented to prove the country is effectively combating financial crime.

Studies have suggested that greylisting can seriously hamstring a country’s economy however opinions vary over what if any impact this is having on Malta.

“Much depends on credibility. If the country is perceived by external investors credit rating agencies and our interlocutors as being on a credible path to resolution then day-to-day business should go on as it is doing now not without hiccups not without new questions being asked but it will go on and go on relatively unchanged” Cordina said.

However if Malta loses its credibility in the international sphere or suffers some serious deterioration in the way it is perceived then Cordina warns this is where symptoms may begin to show.

Government sources have indicated that Malta hopes to be off the grey list by around this time next year.

In fact “18 months” is the time frame that the country’s lead experts have been using when addressing financial sector conferences in recent weeks.

That said senior political advisers concede that the country’s fate is still largely unknown as its anti-money laundering regime still lays on the surgical table for FATF evaluators to poke and prod.

Whether the work of the siloed institutions can converge and coalesce into a national effort that meets the seismic expectations of the Paris-based FATF will next be discussed in summer 2021.

Delays could start a chain reaction that would have serious repercussions

Back at BOV’s Valletta headquarters Cordina said delays could start a chain reaction that would have serious repercussions on the country.

The first step he said would be requesting more documentation for business operations. And more forms lead to higher costs of doing business.

Local operators have already had to deal with some of this but the weight of this paperwork burden would grow if Malta remains untrusted.

This triggers step two which would see a loss of new investment because of this increase in the cost of doing business rendering Malta less attractive.

And thirdly the process could lead to loss of existing investment too as operating in Malta becomes too cumbersome.

“But I am not seeing any evidence of this in an obvious way at present” the Cambridge University-educated economist said.

“Let’s face it. If you are an investor who has been considering coming to Malta say a year ago wouldn’t you have factored in the possibility of greylisting into your plans? The prospect of greylisting wasn’t so much of a surprise a year ago. Markets would have already factored it in.”

Using BOV to illustrate his point Cordina said that in the bank’s conversations with correspondent (foreign partner) banks the possibility of greylisting had featured in the lead up to the actual decision taken in summer.

However in a sense ‘greylisting’ had kind of started about three years earlier when the European Central Bank had directed BOV to begin a process known as derisking which sees a bank limiting its exposure to businesses deemed to pose too much risk.

BOV shed several clients during this process but still retained some in relatively risky sectors like gaming.

“We cannot say no to the entire sector. Gaming is still an essential part of our economy. It would be easier to just not touch the sector but I don’t think that would be a good idea given the economy we operate in. The fortunes of this economy and of this bank are after all intertwined” Cordina said.

There will be international partners who are ready to listen to this story and there will be others who are not Cordina said.

Difficulties would be compounded however if Malta’s greylisted status was to prolong.

“Let’s say there is a market expectation that we get out in ‘x’ months then there will be questions and once those questions are asked it becomes difficult for the bank to prove it is covering its risk” he said.

Ultimately Cordina said this is the problem of being greylisted: it doesn’t mean that business is not done with greylisted countries but foreign interlocutors want further assurances and that costs time and money and can close off certain sectors.

Cordina’s professional experience spans 25 years covering banking policymaking and academia. His main area of academic interest at the University of Malta where he is still a visiting senior lecturer is the growth and dynamics of economies that like Malta’s are prone to heightened risks.",,,,,,

WHO classifies COVID Omicron variant as 'variant of concern'

The World Health Organization on Friday officially classified a new strain of the coronavirus first found in southern Africa as a global ""variant of concern"" following initial detection reports that sent markets into a tailspin. Preliminary evidence suggests the newly-named Omicron variant presents a higher risk of reinfection and may also be more transmissible than other strains the WHO said. Strains are only labeled as ""variants of concern"" when they have higher rates of transmissibility or virulence or higher levels of resistance to vaccines and other treatments.

5. France open to discussing autonomy for Caribbean island of Guadeloupe

France has signaled its willingness to discuss granting autonomy to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe French minister for overseas territories Sebastien Lecornu said Friday. This announcement comes in the wake of violent protests against Guadeloupe's COVID-19 restrictions and requests from local officials. In a video Lecornu said there are ""no bad debates"" and that the government is ""ready to talk."" France first colonized Guadeloupe in 1635 and the island became known for its prosperous sugar plantations and use of slave labor. Guadeloupe became an overseas department in 1946 giving it the same legal status as the departments that make up European France.

6. Planes from South Africa may have brought Omicron to Amsterdam

At least 15 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed after two planes from South Africa carrying over 600 passengers landed in Amsterdam Friday. It remains unclear whether any of those cases are instances of the new Omicron variant. Infected passengers will be required to quarantine at a hotel for at least five days. The Dutch government re-imposed a partial lockdown earlier this month sparking riots and had already planned to tighten those restrictions starting this weekend. Under the new policy most businesses will have to close at 5 p.m. and remain closed until 5 a.m.

7. Black Friday spending continues to rise but shoppers aren’t packing stores like they used to

This year's Black Friday spending could exceed last year's by 6.2 percent according to one industry analyst but the Golden Age of stampeding shoppers is likely behind us. Increasingly Americans prefer to shop online especially after last year when COVID-19 restrictions on brick-and-mortar retailers didn't stop spending from increasing by over 8 percent. Retailers have also moved away from massive one-day sales toward spreading deals across the entire holiday season. Labor shortages expensive gasoline and supply-chain issues also led to higher prices and put a damper on in-person shopping this Black Friday.

The New York Times The Associated Press

In a statement issued Friday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other members of Democratic House leadership characterized comments made by Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) as ""Islamophobic"" and ""deeply offensive and concerning."" The statement also urged House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other members of House Republican leadership ""to take real action to confront racism."" In a video posted last Saturday Boebert joked about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) being mistaken for a terrorist and referred to Omar as a member of the ""jihad squad."" Omar was born in Somalia and is a Muslim.

When people think of artificial intelligence the images that often come to mind are of the sinister robots that populate the worlds of “The Terminator” “i Robot” “Westworld” and “Blade Runner.” For many years fiction has told us that AI is often used for evil rather than for good.

But what we may not usually associate with AI is art and poetry – yet that’s exactly what Ai-Da a highly realistic robot invented by Aidan Meller in Oxford central England spends her time creating. Ai-Da is the world’s first ultra-realistic humanoid robot artist and on Friday she gave a public performance of poetry that she wrote using her algorithms in celebration of the great Italian poet Dante.

The recital took place at the University of Oxford’s renowned Ashmolean Museum as part of an exhibition marking the 700th anniversary of Dante’s death. Ai-Da’s poem was produced as a response to the poet’s epic “Divine Comedy” – which Ai-Da consumed in its entirety allowing her to then use her algorithms to take inspiration from Dante’s speech patterns and by using her own data bank of words create her own work.

Ai-Da’s poem was described was “deeply emotive” by Meller and includes the following verse:

“We looked up from our verses like blindfolded captives

Sent out to seek the light; but it never came

A needle and thread would be necessary

For the completion of the picture.

To view the poor creatures who were in misery

That of a hawk eyes sewn shut.”

Meller said that Ai-Da’s ability to imitate human writing is “so great if you read it you wouldn’t know that it wasn’t written by a human” and told CNN that when Ai-Da was reading her poem on Friday evening “it was easy to forget that you’re not dealing with a human being.”

“The Ai-Da project was developed to address the debate over the ethics of further developing AI to imitate humans and human behavior” Meller told CNN. “It’s finally dawning on us all that technology is having a major impact on all aspects of life and we’re seeking to understand just how much this technology can do and what it can teach us about ourselves.”

Meller said one key thing he and the team that work with Ai-Da have learned while developing her is that the project hasn’t taught them how “human she is – but it’s shown us how robotic we are as humans.”

As Ai-Da has learned how to imitate humans based on our behavior Meller says the project has shown just how habitual human beings are and how we tend to repeat actions words and patterns of behavior – suggesting that it is we in fact who are robotic.

“Through Ai-Da and through the use of AI we can learn more about ourselves than ever before – Ai-Da allows us to gain a new insight into our own patterns and our own habits as we see her imitate them right in front of us” Meller told CNN.

Not only can Ai-Da read and write poetry – she is also capable of creating artworks too and made one for the Dante exhibition titled “Eyes Wide Shut” which was crafted in response to an incident in Egypt in October when Egyptian security forces detained Ai-Da and wanted to remove the cameras in her eyes due to concerns over surveillance and security.

“The incident showed just how much nervousness there is in the world around technology and its advancements” Meller said.

Meller is aware too of the concerns over the increasingly advanced development of artificial intelligence and the potential for using algorithms to manipulate populations but he said that “technology on its own is benign – it’s those that control it whose intentions could be morally and ethically questionable.”

According to Meller when it comes to worries about where the future of AI will take us “the biggest fear we should have should be of ourselves and the human capability to use technology to oppress not of the AI itself.”

Meller thinks that Ai-Da can be a pioneer in the world of AI and that what she produces – whether it’s poetry artworks or something else – will push the boundaries of what can be achieved in technology and will allow us to learn more about ourselves than ever before all through the eyes of a robot."

Jillian Horton is a physician and the author of the national bestseller We Are All Perfectly Fine: A Memoir of Love Medicine and Healing.

I first met Rob Sargeant 20 years ago when we were residents in the internal medicine program at the University of Toronto. He was already a force of nature: Fresh out of medical school he was happily married to his sweetheart Karen – a partner at a Bay Street law firm – and raising the first of his two sons. Like our classmates we were driven and intense pushing ourselves to inhuman limits planning for bright futures.

But even in that field of highly accomplished people Rob – or “Sarge” as most people called him – stood out. There was something about him I admired maybe even envied.

He was funny in a dry Jon Stewart-esque way. He had a better repertoire of swear words than I did. He was confident but never arrogant. And he exuded the uncomplicated joy of a person doing something he loved in a place where he belonged.

The four years of our fellowship training passed quickly and when it was over Rob took a staff job at St. Michael’s Hospital a place we both adored. I on the other hand had another calling afterward: my husband and I packed our things into a U-Haul and I said tearful goodbyes to Toronto and my friends there. It was time for me to go home to Winnipeg where just a few hours’ drive away my family was slowly imploding.

My oldest sister Wendy suffered a brain tumour at a young age and had been left permanently and profoundly disabled. Her life had been one long drawn-out tragedy – first there was the tumour that torched her future and scorched her life to the ground and then there were all the years after when that tumour’s endless complications slowly took her personhood away. And yet she remained a hilarious and spirited person one who mourned her deep losses but also dwelled in acceptance.

I went into medicine because of Wendy. Her experiences with the medical system had often been cold and uncaring and I wanted to correct that by teaching student doctors – I saw it as a powerful way to channel my anger at her mistreatment and to positively shape the behaviour of future generations of doctors.

After a life of suffering Wendy died in her sleep in 2015. So I’d long harboured a special hatred for brain tumours and their ghastly consequences. Their brutal insults always felt personal to me.

Perhaps that is another reason why last year more than a decade after I left my friends from residency behind in Toronto an out-of-the-blue message shook me to the core. A beloved mentor whom Rob and I shared sent me a text – the first of many I’d receive over the next year that would rattle me as both a doctor and a human being.

Rob had a brain tumour. But even worse: It was inoperable. The Sarge had a terminal disease.

In the years after I left Toronto Rob and I both became career medical educators – I as an associate dean at the University of Manitoba and he as section head of Internal Medicine at St. Michael’s. We’d see each other at the occasional conference and were in touch a handful of times a year.

I joked that I was Rob’s talent pipeline because I would send my best medical students his way and when they came home they would always regale me with stories about Rob: his brilliance his sense of humour and his legendary “fluid and electrolyte” rounds – medical code for beers after work. My thank-you e-mail chains with Rob were always peppered with copious swears and fond recollections of people who’d taught us to practice our craft with skill and care. We’d been buddies in bad times – they were the origin of our bond – and so ours was a shared language which gave life to memories I thought we’d have years to parse.

Then in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic Rob started experiencing “foot drop”– a condition in which the toes drag on the ground when walking. It was a Friday morning when a physician friend saw him walking abnormally from a distance in the hall; he pulled Rob aside and murmured that he’d meet him in his office in 20 minutes.

There he found red flags on Rob’s physical exam – his reflexes on the side of his dragging foot were too vigorous a sign that localized the problem to his brain or spinal cord and not the less worrisome peripheral nervous system. The doctor ordered an urgent MRI persuading the radiologist to squeeze Rob in that night.

Rob was the attending physician on the internal medicine unit that week. So that day in vintage form he carried on with his work until it was time to go down to the scanner and present himself – not as a physician but as a patient.

When the scan was finished Rob got dressed and passed by the radiology reading room on his way back to check on his ward patients. But then he spotted his colleague who had organized the MRI sitting alongside the radiologist and staring intently at the computer screen. Rob’s colleague wasn’t supposed to be at the hospital – he’d said he would be at home and would phone him later with results – but the radiologist had called Rob’s doctor back to the hospital while Rob was still on the table in his gown. The scanner had generated a sequence of images of a dark shadowy mass in a place deep inside their friend and colleague’s brain as frightening as a hand grenade sitting where no surgical instruments could reach.

How many times had Rob and I been the messengers of terrible results like that? Hundreds. Thousands. We were experts at giving that news.

We liked it to unfold as a controlled explosion. We didn’t want our patients to see us whispering to the oncologist in the hall with unmistakable grim looks on our faces. Everybody knows what is about to happen when they see those looks and so you try to set the stage to say the right words at the right time in a quiet space or a private room. But in another sense there is no right time to learn you have a brain tumour no right time to see the traces of tears in your colleague’s eyes as they utter words you yourself have only ever delivered and not received. Being on the receiving end of those words – that was a new skill for Rob unwanted uncharted.

I wrote to him as soon as I found out. I told him how profoundly sorry I was; I told him I couldn’t stop thinking about him since I found out the worst news I’d heard that year which was really saying something. I sent him my thoughts my fandom my props my love my solidarity and a piece I had written about my family’s personal window into his special hell. I sent him swear words as was our norm but this time they were deployed out of anger. Despite all my years of being a doctor it was all I could think of to do.

I was surprised to see his reply pop up in my inbox just a few hours later.

“Thank you very much for this Jill – and for sharing you own personal journey with this wretched disease” he said. “I’m still navigating my approach to all of this but so far your prior piece and this email rings true.

“I’m so grateful that you reached out to me. ‘Old’ friends are often the best friends.”

In the days that followed I couldn’t get Rob off my mind. I teared up thinking back to our youthful bravado as we used to roam the hospital halls as residents as if our patients were firmly ensconced on the other side of a sorting line assuming for the sake of self-preservation that our health as doctors was any different somehow more dependable than theirs.

I couldn’t stop picturing him coming out of that CT scanner at St. Michael’s seeing his two colleagues sitting in the dim light of the monitors their faces etched with the awful news he then immediately surmised.

But my continued conversations with him left me with plenty more to consider.

“Just letting my old buddy know you’re on my mind so often these days” I wrote to him about a week later.

“Thanks Jill” he replied. “I really do feel the love and support. I’m hanging in. Have you noticed recently how beautiful a sunrise can be? My new hospital bed is in an alcove in our home and the world comes to life around me. Amazing. I missed a ton of shit by just focusing on work all of the time.

“Steady on.”

What he’d missed because of work – those words burrowed into my head. They pierced something raw inside of me the memory of a pile-up of years when the kids were small and the hospital always seemed to get dibs on our time. What exactly did we trade it all for?

Our work it turns out is also progressive metastatic terminal. It stalks us even when we go on vacation. It intruded on bath times and bedtimes and snack times and family time. Work is our privilege but also our master – maybe even our addiction if we’re being honest. We always seemed to give it the best parts of us.

What did we subsidize it with? Where were we for the sunrises?

When you are a doctor and a colleague is sick there is an intolerable urge to do. Rob’s cancer is called a glioblastoma multiforme a type of brain tumour that invokes a reflexive cringe from any physician because it is so notoriously difficult to manage. I found myself fantasizing about using my connections in the U.S. to help locate someone anyone who could operate on him. But it was delusional a kind of magical thinking. We had all the same connections. People who were more powerful than me were already looking to move mountains for him but in the end it didn’t matter because a mountain is no match for an asteroid.

I became consumed with one question: What could I do that wouldn’t be redundant or maudlin? Then it dawned on me: I could create.

The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada had just recruited me to lead a series highlighting the work of its members. And I realized I could interview Rob to leave a permanent love letter for his family friends and the generations of students he had taught. The CEO of the organization embraced the idea immediately and Rob and his wife Karen agreed as well. So in a matter of a few days I’d booked a ticket found the perfect cameraman and was preparing for a journey back to Toronto to see my old friend.

But I didn’t want to talk to Rob about his death. I wanted to talk about his wild oversized big-hearted swear-filled life. So in the middle of packing my suitcase I e-mailed my friend Harvey Chochinov a psychiatrist known around the world for his work on what he has coined “Dignity Therapy.” I wanted to tease things out from Rob that I don’t always talk about with my critically ill patients in the hospital and so I asked Harvey for his advice. He sent me a list of questions that form the backbone of his work: Are there specific things that you would want your family to know about you and are there particular things you would want them to remember? What have you learned about life that you would want to pass along to others? In creating this permanent record are there other things that you would like included?

“Dignity therapy is a way of helping people create their own legacy shaping how others will remember them” Harvey told me recently. “It’s been shown to enhance end-of-life experience.”

How I hated thinking of the words “end-of life” in the context of Rob. But these were the questions I needed to ask if I was going to do justice to Rob’s legacy. And I was determined to do just that.

I flew east to Toronto back to our old stomping grounds my first time outside of Manitoba since the start of the pandemic. I arrived at Rob and Karen’s house in midtown Toronto on a Tuesday morning after a fitful sleep at a downtown hotel.

Their son Matthew let me into the house. Rob was behind him just out of sight in the alcove where they had set up his hospital bed the one where he watched the sunrise. Matthew excused himself to help his Dad and a few minutes later with his son pushing his wheelchair my old friend emerged. My eyes filled with tears as we embraced. His face was rounded from high-dose steroids but I was inexplicably relieved to see that his grin was unmistakably that of the same old Sarge.

That afternoon with the cameras rolling Rob and I explored the deeper lessons of his life. There were multiple recurring themes – humility perseverance legacy – and his humour was sharp and irrepressible. He told me the story of his illness nestling it in a much bigger picture; we talked a lot about how much meaning he has found in his life as a teacher. He came back again and again to his deep well of gratitude – for the people who were caring for him for the expressions of love from his students over the years for his family for his career and life in medicine. We recorded for more than an hour our conversation periodically punctuated by his left hand’s subtle epileptic seizures which he endured without complaint.

At the end of the afternoon he was spent – chemotherapy often siphons off most of a person’s energy – and I wanted to let him rest. But I did not want to say goodbye. We shared a long hug shedding a few more tears. Then as I lingered briefly at the door we promised each other we’d see each other again soon.

It was a hot day in June and I decided impulsively to walk back to the hotel a straight-line trek of several kilometres south toward Toronto’s waterfront. As I passed each subway stop and neighbourhood I found myself overcome by memories of the Toronto of my youth and the times I spent with Rob and our many classmates. I thought about the irony of walking down Yonge Street while no longer young.

After an hour or so it dawned on me that by coincidence my route was taking me past Mount Pleasant Cemetery where Rob told me he’d taken his family a few weeks ago to choose his burial plot. When I lived in Toronto Mount Pleasant had only ever been an idea to me a rapid sequence of images flashing through windows between subway stations like a stop-motion animation; sometimes our patients would be buried there but we’d always feel like it had nothing to do with us. Now as I walked past its stone archway and weeping willows it was suddenly indisputably relevant our mortality unmistakably real.

A song popped into my mind: Rufus Wainwright’s In A Graveyard which was released in 2001 the same year Rob and I were interns. Back then I had that song on perpetual repeat sometimes listening in the dark with tears of anguish staining my cheeks surrounded by so much suffering and death at the hospital and overwhelmed by the same powerlessness I now felt about my friend.

Wandering properties of death ... Worldly boundaries of dying Were for just a moment never ours

Twenty years. How could 20 years have passed? Twenty years is the time it takes for many of us to really reach our academic prime. We produce our best work. We hit our life’s stride. We become experts in our field. We finally develop as much wisdom as knowledge. I wanted Rob to enjoy this phase and the ripe fruits of his labour to see everything he had grown from seed.

But Rob won’t get to see it all. Many of our teachers never do.

In medicine the Hippocratic oath is sacred. The fundamental promise associated with it is well-known – first do no harm – but the full ancient Greek medical text is long and has many more directives.

In particular it makes special note of our relationship with our teachers. It asks us “to hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my life in partnership with him.” Those relationships – medicine’s sisterhood and brotherhood – are one of the true highlights of the profession. The oath reminds us that we are part of a chain of learning one that stretches back to Aristotle and reaches forward until the end of time. Part of that deal is therefore that we do not get to meet all the generations we influence or who influenced us.

But even if we never get close enough to see their faces we know they are there. And Rob can at least see their shapes off in the distance see how many of them are applauding and holding their brilliant humble curse-filled teacher in their hearts.

The Sarge has had a very hard year. I hope he gets see these words in print and all the words of support and love I know that it will prompt. Because yes he was right he missed so much because of work. But look what he accomplished through it. What a difference he made to the world through his offering.

We cannot escape the worldly boundaries of dying. But maybe – in addition to our children – there are a handful of ways we can live on. Maybe one way is through the eyes of a friend who will remember us with every sunrise for the rest of their life.

And maybe another one is teaching.

She starts Monday at the Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC working alongside retiring CEO Dirk Draper for about two weeks before taking over the top job Jan. 1. She has spent the past 2½ years as a management and leadership consultant after spending more than 20 years in economic development corporate communications and government affairs in her native Tennessee and Ohio mostly in Cincinnati a metro area more than twice the size of Colorado Springs.

""I wanted this job because of the opportunity. I like to be part of a winner and Colorado Springs is a growing region. I have worked in rural communities and major metro areas. All of these brought me to Colorado Springs at just the right time"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""I have built my career on regionalism and seeing El Paso County and Colorado Springs work so closely together is intriguing to me. I want to be part of a team that helps solve our growing pains.""

Julie Calvert CEO of the Cincinnati Convention and Visitors Bureau called Reeder Kleymeyer ""a transformative leader who is passionate about the community where she lives and works. She is a leader who gets involved and cares. When she is involved she gets things done. She also has the gift to grow people to make them their best selves but isn't the kind of person who tells you what you want to hear. She encourages people to lean in and hear more.""

Reeder Kleymeyer said she took the job ""looking for a greater quality of life in addition to a quality of career. I grew up in a much smaller area than Greater Cincinnati and welcome the challenge to grow the Colorado Springs (area). I sought the opportunity to be in a mid-size fast-growing region where I could greater influence change and make a difference in the community. I am an avid outdoors person and gain peace from nature so the West was calling and I answered. I have loved my time in Cincinnati. But it just cannot compete with the Colorado Springs mountain views.""

Brian Hodgett vice president of government and community affairs for Proctor & Gamble who worked with Reeder-Kleymeyer to spin off the economic development arm of the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber into a separate organization she later headed described her as ""a force of nature with a strong personality — when she walks into a room you know it. She is someone who leaders of both large and small companies see as someone they respect and could talk to.""

Reeder Kleymeyer described the chamber's application and interview process — a field of 170 candidates — as one of the most thorough of which she had been a part. She plans to spend her first year as CEO listening and learning about the chamber's legislative agenda and what local businesses need to continue recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Economic prosperity is the cornerstone for any chamber or economic development organization and I have no plans to alter that vision and mission — to be the No. 1 region to do business"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""Colorado Springs is not unique in its challenges. If you are going to have problems these are good ones to have. Any thriving region will face housing affordability traffic congestion and labor shortage issues. I've worked in communities that would love the national attention Colorado Springs enjoys for its outdoor lifestyle and strong military presence.""

Candace McGraw CEO of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport describes Reeder Kleymeyer as a ""strong leader and consensus builder who brings others along with her but makes sure they make it to the destination. She is a natural collaborator and connector who is one of those people who understand the power of working together using their people skills to drive to a positive result.""

Reeder Kleymeyer grew up in rural northwestern Tennessee before getting her degree in communications from University of Memphis. She returned to her hometown Union City to work for the Obion County Chamber of Commerce hoping to make a difference in the 30000-person county before heading the downtown development organization in Jackson Tenn. about 85 miles northeast of Memphis and several times the size of Obion County.

After six years in those two areas Reeder Kleymeyer moved with her family to Cincinnati where finding a job in her 20s proved difficult because she had no network of business contacts or friends. She was eventually hired to head government affairs for Kentucky at the United Way of Greater Cincinnati.

""United Way gave me a chance and allowed me to cut my teeth in government affairs designing legislation on early childhood education and other issues. I fell in love with the work"" she said.

However love doesn't pay the bills so Reeder Kleymeyer took a second job selling makeup at Dillard's. After nearly three years she was ready to move into a higher-paying job in the corporate world handling community affairs charitable giving and government affairs for Citibank in Ohio and Kentucky.

Citibank was a major donor to United Way and had more than 3000 employees in the Cincinnati area and the job taught her the importance of corporate citizenship. She also learned that nonprofits needed to be operated ""like a business to show a return on investment for those who were investing"" in the organization — in her case the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber.

""Having sat on that side of the table helped me to understand the value we need to bring to our members"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. An early mentor also told her she had more to learn — she needed to understand the business side of the company if she was going to advance to the C suite so she headed off to graduate school for two years while still working full-time to get a master's degree in business administration.

She stayed at Citibank for nearly five years before moving to grocery giant Kroger to head its national communications operations for labor contracts. She stayed there about a year before taking a communications post with Duke Energy for Kentucky and Ohio where she wrote press releases speeches and presentations for the company's president. After 1½ years she was promoted to vice president of community relations government affairs and economic development for the same two states.

""I got a better understanding of customer relations such as having the utility bill correct and the lights on. It helped me to understand what the customer needs"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""If I hadn't had the previous experience (in government affairs) I never would have gotten that opportunity to make the company's case about reliability and cost. It also allowed me to go deeper into the technical side of economic development.""

While at Duke Energy she served on the board of the chamber at the same time some business leaders wanted to split the group's economic development arm into a separate organization. She played a pivotal role in that effort and was hired to be the first president and CEO of the newly formed nonprofit the Regional Economic Development Initiative (REDI) Cincinnati helping attract keep and foster expansion of businesses with a staff of 25 and a $6 million annual budget. The Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC has a $4.1 million annual budget.

""We had a lot of success — we were the No. 1 performing area in Ohio for four consecutive years and were chosen by Site Selection magazine as one of the top five regions to do business. We created more than 2500 jobs"" in the nearly five years she spent with the group Reeder Kleymeyer said. During that time she helped the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport land service from Southwest Airlines the North American hub for Amazon's Prime Air unit and more than 175 other projects that produced billions of dollars of investment.

""Everybody likes to cut a ribbon for a new company but our most important client is the one that is already here"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""Most of your (economic development) wins come from expansions by existing businesses rather than from attracting new companies. Helping existing companies generally makes up 80% of your project wins so helping existing companies with their work force infrastructure and location needs is the first priority.""

Reeder Kelyemeyer left REDI after five years having accomplished all her goals and seeking more flexibility in her schedule. During the past three years she served as interim dean of the business school at Northern Kentucky University was executive vice president of Cincinnati-based health care software company AssureCare and was a member of the board of directors of Delta Dental of Kentucky while also operating her consulting business.

""When I left my first job I wanted to move to a bigger place. I have worked for Fortune 500 companies nonprofits and economic development organizations. Every opportunity has given me the skills I needed for the next opportunity all culminating in this opportunity in Colorado Springs"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""The mountains are what intrigued me (about the job) but once I met the people and felt (their) hospitality I was sold.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2xvcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9iYmItc2NhbW1lcnMtcG9zaW5nLWFzLXBvd2VyYmFsbC13aW5uZXItY2xhaW0tdG8tb2ZmZXItbW9uZXktdmlhLXRleHRz0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93bG9zLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9iYmItc2NhbW1lcnMtcG9zaW5nLWFzLXBvd2VyYmFsbC13aW5uZXItY2xhaW0tdG8tb2ZmZXItbW9uZXktdmlhLXRleHRz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BBB: Scammers posing as Powerball winner claim to offer money via texts,"A fraudulent text message has been making its rounds claiming to be a Powerball lottery winner offering people some money.

In early December Antoine Dupont is favoured to pick up the World Rugby Player of the Year award. While they’re at it the Toulouse No.9 should be given the 2020 award that was never taken off the shelf.

World Rugby officials decided last year to forgo the end-of-season awards in light of a severely disrupted stretch caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Antoine Dupont and Robert Lewandowski were both on track to win ‘best player’ accolades in rugby and football but it was not to be.

This year after a rip-roaring run that includes narrowly missing out on Six Nations glory helping Toulouse to a European Cup and France to a big win over the All Blacks Dupont is set to make up for lost time [and awards].

On the latest House of Rugby episode [LISTEN from 11:40 below] hosts Seán O’Brien and Alex Goode reflected on the Autumn Nations Series and selected their best players from the past month of action.

Huge praise for Antoine Dupont Caelan Doris and Taine Basham

Looking back on the 2021 Autumn Nations Series Seán O’Brien marvelled about France scrumhalf Antoine Dupont who is favourite to win World Rugby Player of the Year.

“Dupont what a player” he declared.

“He’s outrageous at the minute… his level is untouchable. There’s no-one getting near him. He’s top of the pile for me.”

In discussing the players that impressed them most Alex Goode went first and had a certain Ireland forward in mind. The Saracens and England star commented “For me the player of this autumn was Caelan Doris.

“I’d say that not many people would have named him as a household name beforehand. He’s new enough to the international scene and the way he’s played has been just brilliant. He’s come into the Leinster and Ireland set-up and just gone up and up and up. He had someone [Seán O’Brien] in his way that was taking his time to retire and getting in his way! And look how well he’s doing now.”

Antoine Dupont among six ‘Best Player’ nominees

The panel that have selected the Autumn Nations Series’ best player nominations clearly agree with O’Brien and Goode. The six-man nominees are: Caelan Doris French duo Antoine Dupont and Roman Ntamack Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth and England pair Freddie Steward and Marcus Smith.

O’Brien who left Leinster for London Irish in 2019 agrees that Doris has been “phenomenal”. He named a few other players aside from Dupont that impressed him during the Test window. “I thought Garry Ringrose was unbelievable” he said. “Romain Ntamack as well.”

“If I was to go for a guy that has most impressed me though I’d probably pick [Wales flanker] Taine Basham. I knew what Caelan was about and it was just a matter of time once he came on to the scene like he has at this international level over the last few weeks against the bigger teams.”

“Basham for me” he added “because he’s almost come out of nowhere and now he’s an international players at a very high level. He’s someone that’s going to be very important for Wales.”

The award is for the company’s AgriTraxx AirCore – a high-performance gauge wheel tire intended for no-till agricultural applications.”

The R&D 100 Awards are given by the industry entity R&D World. The awards were first established in 1963 and according to R&D World is the “only science and technology awards competition that recognizes new commercial products technologies and materials for their technological significance that are available for sale or license.

“The R&D 100 Awards have long been a benchmark of excellence for industry sectors as diverse as telecommunications high-energy physics software manufacturing and biotechnology.”

“Congratulations to the Superior Tire engineering and production teams that went above and beyond; all of us at Superior Tire are extremely proud of the ingenuity and creativity you contribute everyday into producing not only a better product but a better way to make it” Joseph Peterson Superior’s vice president of engineering and quality explained.

“This award exemplifies Superior Tire’s culture of outcome-drive(n) research and willingness to translate cutting-edge thinking into customer impact.”

Peterson explained that seeder tires used for planting fields are normally made out of rubber.

“More and more farmers are going to no till farming” he said. That means cutting the previous year’s crop down to stubble and leaving it in the field. “They’ll just plant right over the top of it” Peterson said.

He detailed that this approach is good for the soil yields and fuel consumption but the “stalks are super sharp” and will tear up a rubber tire.

So engineers at Superior switched from rubber to developing a tire out of urethane. It’s about half the weight hollow and won’t tear like rubber.

Kyle Knotowicz was the lead engineer on the project.

“We knew a simple solution but how to do it was the fun part because we had to think far outside the box” he explained. “It was very challenging but the process of going from an eccentric concept to an extraordinary solution was extremely rewarding….”

So how do you develop a product that’s never been invented?

“Using other things that are made and produced trying to figure out (how we) can incorporate that production method” he said that can “be done into something we’ve never done before.”

“Kyle basically had to invent a manufacturing method to do it” Peterson said.

That started with what Knotowicz called a “wooden contraption.” The parts were sourced from Lowes. Production has evolved to a computer controlled mold.

The contraption though was enough for the team to feel “comfortable going to the next step” he said which was developing a prototype machine and molds. And tests after tests.

That was followed by three years of field trials. “After that (it) became ‘How can we get it into production and get high volume?'”

“We had a customer that had a Goldilocks problem” Tony Hasselman Ag business unit manager explained. “The ideal product could help validate no till farming as the all-around better way to produce crops by increasing yields reducing soil erosion and reducing expensive costs that were jeopardizing the less-common farming method.

“The hollow design AgriTraxx AirCore improves mud shedding and reduces tire weight for cost and freight benefits.”

He said there are about 5000 of these tires in the field currently.

The award is validation of all the work that has gone into the project.

“(We are) really excited to be in that group especially as a small local company in Warren” Peterson said noting that entities also recognized include DuPont and MIT. “We’re pretty pumped to be on that list with some of the big companies. We’re pretty excited.

“(It is) also nice to see something on the list that is practical” he said. “We’re helping a guy farm.”

Knotowicz called it a “good group team effort” highlighting involvement by sales engineering operations and mold making saying everyone had a hand in the process.

“Our innovations have led us to expanding into new opportunities in molding technology which the company will be investing in with a completely new product line in second quarter of 22022” Hank LeMeur CEO of Superior said. “We’re always looking for creative minds to join our team – our doors are always open to those who want to make a difference.”",,,,,,

Global beauty company Amorepacific and Eastman global specialty materials provider announce their collaboration to introduce sustainable packaging solutions using Eastman’s molecular recycling technologies. LANEIGE will be the first Amorepacific brand to utilize packaging made from Eastman’s Cristal™ Renew copolyester with certified recycled content* as early as December 2021.

“Cristal Renew and Eastman’s innovative molecular recycling technologies will play a crucial role in helping us achieve the commitments laid out in our ‘2030 A MORE Beautiful Promise’ without sacrificing the premier beauty experience customers expect from Amorepacific” said Jung Changwook senior vice president of Amorepacific development and purchasing division.

LANEIGE’s Water Sleeping Mask featuring Cristal Renew will be available at cosmetics retailer Sephora in the U.S. and Canada and at us.laneige.com. Beloved by customers since 2002 the new Water Sleeping Mask features technological advances in skin care and in its packaging — with a probiotics-derived complex to fortify skin’s moisture barrier that improves clarity and texture packaged in beautiful jars made from molecular recycling technology.

Eastman’s molecular recycling technologies break down hard-to-recycle plastic waste into building blocks used to create new materials that are comparable to traditional materials in clarity luster and mechanical properties. Using molecular recycling to make these materials diverts plastic waste from landfills incinerators and the environment. The process also reduces use of fossil resources and results in 20%–50% lower greenhouse gas emissions than traditional manufacturing.

For Amorepacific Cristal Renew is key to creating recycled-content packaging that lives up to their signature beauty aesthetic adored the world over. Cristal Renew available with 30% and 50% certified recycled content* gives the skin care leader brilliant crystal clear packaging that enhances their products and customer experience.

“It’s an honor to be selected as a partner in Amorepacific’s sustainability journey” said Glenn Goldman commercial director for Plastics at Eastman. “We look forward to working further with them to bring new innovations to market beginning with the LANEIGE launch before the end of the year.”

PUEBLO – It’s always tough to defend a state title and the reigning Class 2A champion Eaton football team got all it could handle from upset-inclined Brush on Saturday night.



But just like last year Eaton rose to the occasion in the critical moments of a tight game.



In the championship game at the CSU-Pueblo Thunderbowl top-seeded Eaton took control in the second half to win 26-14 over the seventh-seeded Beetdiggers. It was the second title in a row for the team the program’s third overall and an affirming moment for this year’s senior group to go out as unbeaten champions.



“This one is definitely huge for us seniors because we came back and did it again” Eaton senior Ethan Florez said. “We did it again you know. It’s just an amazing feeling. A lot of winning last year was the seniors last year because that’s a big part of a football team in high school. For them to leave and for us to be able to come back here that’s what’s so special to us.”



Florez who was named Most Outstanding Player after the game led the way.



Following an interception by Brogan Barr midway through the first quarter Florez opened the scoring with a two-yard run that gave the Reds a 7-0 lead with 5 minutes 11 seconds left in the first quarter. Early in the second Brush’s Cesar Hinojos tied the game with a diving score and the teams went into halftime tied.



With just under four minutes left in the third quarter Brush’s Alejandro Maltos-Garcia threw a touchdown pass to Kale Stegner that gave the Beetdiggers their first lead of the night. Eaton’s Ryan Dirksen answered with a 43-yard score but the kick was missed and Eaton still trailed by one point to open the final frame.



In the fourth Florez found the end zone for a second time and after a missed two-point try the defending champions had a 19-14 lead. With 1:36 remaining Ryder True punched in a short-yardage touchdown to give Eaton a comfortable 26-14 lead that held up until the clock ran out.



“We knew it was going to be a fight we absolutely did” Eaton head coach Zac Lemon said. “We’re just happy with the way our team overcame it in the second half. It was really about consistency. Once we were able to string together some first downs and get some momentum we were much more confident and we played much better.



“The COVID championship was just a relief to be at that point. Now we’re just happy to have as normal a season as possible and to have all of our fans here. It’s a totally different feeling. For two state championships they feel completely different and it’s just amazing to be in this situation again.”



As different as this season felt to Eaton the fall of 2021 couldn’t have felt more different to a Beetdiggers team that had its 2020 campaign cancelled after four games because of COVID-19. Just finishing the regular season would have seemed like a blessing after last fall but the Beetdiggers instead shoved their way into the postseason. As the No. 7 seed they proceeded to eliminate Nos. 10 2 and 6 on the way to the championship game.



They may have come up short but head coach Lance Schwindt said he and all the Beetdiggers will look back proudly on this season’s wild ride.



“Last year our season ended because of COVID and we only got four games in” Schwindt said. “This year we came into the season unranked. We were just hoping that if we could get a few breaks we could make the playoffs. Once we got into the playoffs we just figured it’s a brand-new season everybody’s zero-zero and why not us? The kids played hard they did great and we just fell a little short tonight.”



Saturday’s game was the Brush’s 13th state championship game appearance in their program’s history. The Beetdiggers last won a football state championship in 2014.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy45bmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvaHMtZm9vdGJhbGwvZWF0b24tZGVmZW5kcy1jbGFzcy0yYS1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1mb290YmFsbC1zdGF0ZS10aXRsZS83My0zZDljYjU1NS1kOTI4LTRlYmQtYTBlMS05MTgzZDQ3NmE4ZjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eaton defends Class 2A high school football state title | 9news.com,"The Reds capped off their undefeated season with a win over Brush in the Class 2A state championship game.

PUEBLO Colo. — The 2A football state crown is staying put.

Eaton defended its title on Saturday night defeating Brush 26-14 in the Class 2A championship game at CSU-Pueblo. It is the third football title in its program history after snapping a 20-year drought last season.

""Being here a second time means the world"" said senior Ethan Florez who was named the game MVP. ""Just excitement being with my team again.""

A big difference between last year's championship and this season with the dominant run the Reds put together in 2021.

Eaton didn't drop a single game capping off an undefeated season (13-0 overall) and outscoring opponents 465-104 in the process.

""It's crazy. It's insane. We made history"" Ryder True said. ""There's a lot of pride.""

Brush which entered the playoffs as the No. 7 seed finishes as state runner-up with a 10-3 overall record. The Beetdiggers upset two higher seeds (Resurrection Christian and Severance) in route to their matchup with No. 1 Eaton.

The Jam - The Eton Rifles

The Jam’s classic 1979 song continues to fascinate with its political lyrics - but what inspired Paul Weller to write it? “It wasn't intended as a jolly drinking song” he explains.

“Sup up your beer and collect your fags - There's a row going on down near Slough.”

Released on 26 October 1979 The Eton Rifles trailed The Jam’s acclaimed fourth album Setting Sons and became the first single by the trio to break the UK Top 10.

Like a lot of songs by the young Paul Weller the song is full of meaning - and concerns political and class struggle in late 1970s Britain.

“Hello-Hurray - an extremist scrape with the Eton Rifles.”

The Jam had reached new heights in 1978 with the release of their excellent All Mod Cons LP which spawned the hits ‘A’ Bomb In Wardour Street and Down In The Tube Station At Midnight.

The Jam - Down In The Tube Station At Midnight

Weller recalled that he wrote the song when he was on holiday with his girlfriend to a caravan in Selsey Bill in West Sussex but the weather was terrible so Weller ended up writing five new songs on acoustic guitar.

He later told Uncut magazine: “I was watching the news on TV and I saw this footage of a Right To Work march going past Eton where all the kids from the school came outside and started jeering at the marchers. I just thought what a great fucking image it was. I didn’t think of it as particularly political.”

Not a million miles away from Weller’s hometown in Woking Eton was the private school that bred British Prime Ministers Princes Kings and Mayors. Jam drummer Rick Buckler told Uncut magazine: “Growing up in Woking you were aware that the school was nearby and these kids were being taught how to fire guns. It seemed crazy – a very militaristic view of education.”

The clash of cultures between the punk and working class campaigners and the privileged boys of Eton was noted by The Socialist Worker who described the protestors “Pogoing as a giant silver spoon is presented to the Eton Head Boy. 'I hope your jolly campaign gets you somewhere' he said.”

Following the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in May 1979 the gap between the ruling classes and the workers was getting wider and wider with unemployment about to skyrocket interest rates about to be raised and there being cuts to public spending in the first months of Conservative rule.

""Hello-Hurray - what a nice day for the Eton Rifles Eton Rifles""

Producer Vic Coppersmith-Heaven remembered that the recording of The Eton Rifles was not without some difficulty and claims that The Jam originally tried committing the song to tape on the previous album All Mod Cons: ""In all we recorded Eton Rifles three times"" he told Sound On Sound magazine. ""The first time it just didn't have the power it just didn't have the excitement. The second version of Eton Rifles was pretty much the same story.”

By the time The Jam had recorded a number of songs for Setting Sons the producer thought they were ready to have another crack at The Eton Rifles: “The drums improved the bass sound would get better and when that happened we'd often drop a new bass part for instance into a track that we'd been working on days before.”

The secret weapon for the track was a group of Jam fans who were milling around outside the Townhouse studios in Goldhawk Road West London - Weller invited them into the studio to help out on the choruses. ""I'd be mixing at the desk and I'd feel this unusual presence behind me” said Coppersmith-Heaven “When I'd look round I'd see about 30 kids sitting on the settees.”

The Eton Rifles released on Friday 26 October two weeks after the band finished recording the LP and three weeks before Setting Sons hit the streets. The single went into the UK Top 40 that weekend at Number 29 and jumped up to Number 7 the following week. On 18 November 1979 thanks to an appearance on Top Of The Pops that week the single reached its highest position at #3: the first Jam single to break the Top 10.

The Eton Rifles cemented The Jam as one of Britain's best post-punk bands and their legacy continued well beyond the life of the group - they split in 1982 leaving Weller to form The Style Council before going solo in 1991. The Eton Rifles made its way back into Weller's solo set in 2008 much to the delight of Jam fans.

“All that rugby puts hairs on your chest / What chance have you got against a tie and a crest?”

But The Eton Rifles came back to haunt Weller in a way he didn’t expect. In a Radio 4 programme in 2008 David Cameron leader of the Conservative Party and Old Etonian claimed that The Eton Rifles was his favourite song: “I was one in the corps. It meant a lot some of those early Jam albums we used to listen to. I don't see why the left should be the only ones allowed to listen to protest songs.""

This understandably drew anger from Paul Weller. He told The New Statesman: “Which part of it didn't he get? It wasn't intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps.”

When Cameron became Prime Minister he defended his Jam fandom telling The Guardian: “Of course I understood what it was about. It was taking the mick out of people running around the cadet force. And he was poking a stick at us. But it was a great song with brilliant lyrics. I've always thought that if you can only like music if you agree with the political views of the person who wrote it well it'd be rather limiting.""

But for The Modfather The Eton Rifles was as relevant as ever. “People say Why don’t you write any more political songs?” he told Mojo in 2015. “But I would just write exactly the same fucking things I wrote thirty-odd years ago. Nothing’s really changed has it?”"

A rare example of a Jaguar supercar - which was once the fastest road car on the planet - is up for sale and the price has been cut.

The Jaguar XJ220 is being sold on eBay with an asking price of £399950.

Although that might seem like a lot - and to most people it is - it is £25000 less than when the car was advertised for sale less than a year ago. In January this year the asking price was £425000.

The 1990s supercar had a chequered history before making it into production but models are highly sought after now by collectors.

The 1995 XJ220 on the market is part of a UK collection and is being sold by a specialist dealer based in Penn Buckinghamshire.

As well as having deep pockets any would-be buyers need to book an appointment for a viewing and test drive.

The vehicle has just 11000 miles on the clock.

The eBay sales particulars say: “Finished in black with grey full leather this stunning example is currently in a private collection and is viewing by appointment only. The car has a great history file and has been maintained irrelevant of cost.”

The sales particulars go on to offer an interesting insight into the history of the XJ220.

They say: “It was at the 1988 British Motor Show in Birmingham appropriately that the sensational Jaguar XJ220 concept prototype was first revealed to the public and as expected orders and the required £50000 deposits flooded in from all corners of the world.

“The original concept was for a V12-engined car with a six-speed gearbox and four-wheel drive priced at just under £300000.

“However some four years later when production commenced the XJ220 had become a two-wheel drive twin-turbo V6 with a five-speed box on offer at £470000.

“Predictably many of the 1200 option holders tried to cancel their purchase blaming the massive change in the specification but the collapse in values of collectable supercars at the time was probably more of a factor. Eventually the car found 275 buyers and the others don’t know what they missed.”

Highlighting the blistering power of the car the eBay description adds: “Producing an impressive 549bhp at 7000rpm and 473lb.ft at 4500rpm and now slightly shorter by some ten inches courtesy of the smaller dimensions of the V6 engine against the bulky V12 but still with a not inconsiderable girth of six feet and six inches the XJ220 proved more than capable of reaching its target maximum speed.

“In 1992 at the Italian Nardo test track Formula One and sportscar ace Martin Brundle recorded 212.3mph around the banking in standard trim and 217.1mph with the catalytic converters disconnected the latter speed equivalent to 223mph on a straight road.

“With 0-60mph acceleration in a brutal 3.5 seconds the XJ220 was indisputably the fastest road car on the planet at that time and thanks to motorsport-developed inboard wishbone suspension and huge ventilated disc brakes with four-piston callipers it held the road beautifully and stopped equally as well.”

The XJ220 went on to enjoy success in the world of motorsport.

The eBay sales particulars conclude: “Production of the car began the following year in a purpose-built factory at Bloxham in Oxfordshire with the first cars delivered in July.

“On the circuits the Jaguar also proved highly effective.

“In the full-race version the XJ220C another sports car ace Win Percy took victory on the car’s race debut in the BRDC National Sports GT Challenge and in the 1993 Le Mans 24 Hours John Nielsen David Brabham and David Coulthard finished first in the GT class.”

With all the commercialism and mince pies flying about it’s easy to forget the true meaning of Christmas.

Thankfully one intrepid Ebay seller is here to remind us.

Along with angel wings baubles and personalised gift tags a brand called Laser Craft Shapes – self-described as ‘the leading supplier’ of everything from Christmas Eve boxes to craft shapes – is selling advent calendar options that every traditional type will want by their tree.

We’re talking of course about ye olde penis-shaped advent calendars that you can fill with Ferrero Rocher chocolates.

That was a thing back in the days of Mary and Joseph right?

The ‘Willy Christmas Advent Calendar’ is exactly what it sounds like: a laser cut block of wood designed to look like an erect penis and a set of testicles with numbered holes for your chocolates.

Be warned the chocolates aren’t included (Picture: Laser Cut Shapes)

Why would someone want an advent calendar shaped like a penis? That’s not for us to answer. But according to Ebay 15 were sold in the last 24 hours.

The Willy Christmas Advent Calendar is available in a range of options with adapted slots such as one for Ferrero Rocher another for Celebrations and one for After Eights.

Strangely some of these designs have a space for one large chocolate orange in the base for Christmas Day. We say ‘strangely’ because surely it would have made sense to go for two large chocolate balls positioned right in the well balls.

Perhaps an After Eights option is more your speed? (Picture: Laser Cut Shapes)

All these designs have the option of a jaunty laser-cut ‘Merry Christmas’ at the base lest you forget why you have a chocolate-loaded penis in your home.

They each cost £11.99 on Ebay – or £7.99 on the Laser Cut Shapes website – but be warned: that price doesn’t include the chocolates so you’ll need to buy those yourself.

The good news with that however is that this is an advent calendar that can be brought out and enjoyed every year – just refill with chocs.

There’s only one chocolate option for the vagina. Read into that what you like. (Picture: Laser Cut Shapes)

And don’t worry this site offers equal opportunity advent. Along with all the penis designs there’s a ‘Ferrero Vagina’ also confusingly with space for a chocolate orange somewhere in the top-middle section.

Good tidings all round.

Rare 50p coin sells for £255 on eBay because of huge error - check your piggybank

A rare Benjamin Bunny 50p coin has sold for £255 on eBay because of a huge error in its design.

The coin features the cute Beatrix Potter character on one side and was first released in 2017.

But what makes this particular version unusual is a mistake on the side that shows the Queen’s head.

According to the seller the Queen's head is in a different direction on the obverse to the design of Benjamin bunny on the reverse.

When you flip over a coin the Queen’s head should be facing the same way as the design on the other side.

Do you have a rare coin in your collection? Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk





In the listing description the seller said: ""In the picture you will see the rotation error where the Queen's head is - that's how far the rotation is on the coin.

""When you flip it round it should be facing up the same way as Benjamin bunny.""

The seller adds that the 50p is in ""lovely condition"".

The trouble with error coins is that they are extremely rare to find and could be one of only a handful or even one of a kind.

The Royal Mint is able to verify coins to check they are genuine.

It is worth noting this particular Benjamin Bunny 50p only ended up attracting two bids on it after a five-day auction.

This means some coin hunters may have been wary about bidding on it as it didn’t gather a lot of attention.

Around 25 million of the Benjamin Bunny coins were struck for circulation in 2017 - so it isn't impossible that a mistake could have happened.

The design was minted as part of four coins to celebrate Beatrix Potter with other characters in the collection including Peter Rabbit Tom Kitten and Jeremy Fisher.

A regular version of the Benjamin Bunny 50p coin would only fetch between £1 and £1.54 on eBay according to Coin Hunter.

You should always be wary and do your research first before buying any coin on eBay as there are fakes floating around.

Websites and Facebook groups from change experts like Coin Hunter can help you work out if a coin is the real deal or not.

The Battlefront series started back in 2004 on the PC PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox. A sequel followed a year later and is considered by me and many others as one of the best Star Wars games ever made.

In 2006 Free Radical Design the studio behind the TimeSplitters series was hired by LucasArts to make a third game in the Battlefront series for the Xbox 360 and PS3.

However the game was canceled in 2008. Free Radical developers said the game was practically done and that LucasArts could not commit to spending a lot of money on the game's marketing.

An unnamed LucasArts employee told GameSpot that Free Radical was constantly missing deadlines on the project.

Other than some hand-held games for the PlayStation Portable the Battlefront series sat dormant until Disney purchased Lucasfilm in 2012 and Electronic Arts signed a 10-year deal the following year to exclusively develop Star Wars games for PC and home consoles.

EA released a reboot of ""Star Wars Battlefront"" In 2015 developed by its studio DICE which became the best selling Star Wars game of all time. ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" came out in 2017 and is the third best selling game in the franchise.

With sales like that you would assume a third game in the rebooted series would be a given but last week it was revealed by EA insider Tom Henderson that the company had rejected a pitch from the developers at DICE to make a third Battlefront. The reason Henderson was given was that because of licensing fees with Disney the game would have to sell 20% more copies to make the same amount of money as a non-Star Wars title.

That wasn't the only Battlefront news we got last week.

Dennis Brannvall the game director of ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" went to the Battlefront sub-Reddit page to discuss some of the ideas the team at DICE were working on for the two games that never made it out.

DICE's original Battlefront game had four major post-launch content releases that saw new characters and maps added to the game but the characters and maps we almost got were very different. The bounty hunter IG-88 Grand Moff Tarkin from the original ""Star Wars"" film and an old Obi-Wan Kenobi and a map based on Mos Eisley from the original film were all planned for the game.

Tarkin and IG-88 never came to either of DICE's Battlefront games but the Mos Eisley map was moved to the sequel and that game also eventually received a young version of the Obi-Wan character.

Brannvall also revealed that his team was working on bringing the fan-favorite characters of Ahsoka Tano and Asajj Ventress as well as the lava-filled planet of Mustafar to ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" last year when EA canceled future content for the gameand moved its developers over to the recently released ""Battlefield 2042.""

With EA losing the exclusive license for Star Wars games I'm really hoping another developer will step up and give us the ""Star Wars Battlefront 3"" we fans have always wanted and never received.

This article is more than 2 years old

Electronic Arts and DICE revealed their post-launch plans of Battlefield 2042 which stretch throughout the rest of the year pushing the release of new in-game content to 2022. As per the company’s statements three waves of ongoing fixes will be released between now and the end of December 2021 addressing the current sorry state of one of this year’s most-anticipated games. So has the never-ending Beta become the norm within the gaming industry?

EA Games launched the first big patch for Battlefield 2042 addressing issues like overpowered hovercrafts bugs that prevent you from reviving your allies wildly inconsistent bullet spread that makes the in-game crosshairs as useful as a bar of soap in the Sahara Desert. This patch was predated by a smaller one which addressed critical post-launch issues on Xbox consoles like crashing the consoles stuttering and server performance issues. However according to Kotaku the third patch scheduled for December will be the biggest thus far addressing everything from performance issues UI bugs and vehicle animations. Players should expect this patch in between Thanksgiving and December holidays though no specific information was provided regarding its release date.

For those unfamiliar with the situation the game that allows you to fight tornadoes began its Early Access on November 12 and soon started crashing the Xbox consoles. EA Games addressed the issue with the aforementioned patch but the number of reported problems only continued to rise once Early Access went live on other platforms on November 19. Soon Battlefield 2042 went on to become one of the worst-reviewed games on Steam in the history of Valve’s PC storefront with players complaining about the new operator system lack of voice chat (inconceivable for modern online FPSs) and scoreboards and exceptionally poor performance on high setting suggesting the poor optimization of the game’s engine.

Admittedly EA had its fair share of problems during the development of Battlefield 2042 which could be a contributing factor to the game’s current condition. Electronic Arts suffered a data leak on June 10 when hackers broke into the company’s systems and stole 780 gigabytes of data from EA’s servers including the Frostbite source code that powers the Battlefield gaming series. The cybercriminal group behind the hack tried to sell their unfairly acquired data on the dark web. However after they had failed to sell the data online hackers attempted to extort the company for an undisclosed sum to avoid having its data leaked online. EA not only refused to pay the ransom but completely ignored the hacker’s demands which led to 751GB of compressed EA Games’ data being dumped on public torrent sites making it available to the public.

With that said EA Games and DICE could have easily delayed the game once again and addressed these issues internally. Battlefield 2042 was initially scheduled for an October release but DICE delayed it a month. All things considered it should have been pushed even further. Whatever happened to first impressions? Have companies such as Rockstar Games CD Project RED Electronic Arts and their respective subsidiaries given up on quality? Are they just pumping out one superbly-marketed low-quality title after another allowing marketing to drive up the sales instead of the quality of their releases? Are semi-completed unoptimized games now a thing? Is the perpetual Beta now an industry norm? We might never get these questions answered. But do you know what we did get? A full shelf of poorly-made video gaming titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2JhdHRsZWZpZWxkL2JhdHRsZWZpZWxkLTIwNDItd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtbGV2ZWwtY2FwLWhvdy10by1sZXZlbC11cC1mYXN0ZXItMTcwNDMzNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battlefield 2042: What is the level cap & how to level up faster,"Battlefield 2042 launched on November 19 and some players are already rising through the ranks with immense pace. However it can be a grind to get to the top. Here’s everything you need to know about leveling up faster and reaching the level cap.

Players around the world are duking it out in the landscapes of Hourglass and Manifest as Battlefield 2042 welcomes in a new era for EA DICE.

There are a plethora of challenges to blast through but as the XP starts to roll in you may be wondering just how far you can take your specialist.

With no campaign included this time around Battlefield 2042 is a purely multiplayer experience with up to 128 players fighting for victory. Unlike other FPS games like Call of Duty the path to leveling up is far more merciless.

It will take some time but the current level cap for players sits at level 99. Conversely the highest S-Level goes all the way up to S999.

However when it comes to S-Levels this doesn’t currently unlock anything new or worthwhile in the game. So think of this as an extra flex on your rivals and squadmates alike.

EA DICE Ribbons will be earned as you put more time in Battlefield 2042.

How to level up faster in Battlefield 2042

When it comes to leveling up faster in Battlefield 2042 patience is the key. XP doesn’t come in excessive amounts but there are things you can do to get an extra push on your way to the level cap.

Gaining XP can be done in any of the modes featured within Battlefield 2042. Typically most XP is acquired by completing challenges but there are a few standard methods you can use to gain an additional boost:

Killing enemy players

Getting assists on squadmates kills

Healing fellow players

Using EMP’s

Destroying enemy vehicles

Using the Recon Drone gadget to spot enemies and vehicles

Ranger Kills

Resupplying your allies with ammo

If you continue to repeat these actions especially assists and healing you’ll start to earn Ribbons which can supplement the total amount of XP earned.

How to level up faster in Battlefield 2042 Portal Mode

Another way to gain XP is by taking advantage of Battlefield 2042’s Portal mode which has a growing amount of XP Farm servers. These servers work by trapping bots or enemy players into chokehold situations – with little HP so that they are virtually a one-shot kill.

It should be stated that DICE has caught wind of these Portal Mode “XP server farms” and have begun patching it up. However there are still many of them you can get into. There’s no telling how long these will last so jump in while you still can!

Alternative ways to level up faster in Battlefield 2042

Hazard Zone can also grant more XP than a traditional Conquest match if you happen to land a decent amount of kills. Each kill is 200 XP each which is further aided by the sizable amount gained by completing a match (especially if you successfully extract from the map).

Lastly similarly to EA DICE’s Star Wars: Battlefront 2 players can hop into Solo/Co-Op playlists on Conquest and Breakthrough that pit you against A.I. soldiers. You’ll be able to gain a great amount of XP from drilling down A.I. foes in quick succession.

We unpack *a lot* with the comedian and author who is currently on her Missus tour and recently released book The Audacity from her campaign with Internet Matters and Electronic Arts to get people installing parental controls of gaming consoles ahead of Christmas to criticism about a recent post she shared of her daughter in Halloween make-up.

And of course we had to unpack what is going on with Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson…

Side note: if you’ve missed The Big Questions with the likes of James Arthur Matt Edmondson and The Wanted catch up while you’re here.

Your latest campaign is encouraging the use of parental controls for gaming – when did it dawn on you that you had a 12-year-old and these needed to become a thing?

I think I’ve always prioritised safety and age-appropriate boundaries for Violet. When she was born and when I was expecting I never put any photos of scans I was really protective. I think that was because I myself was figuring out social media and online culture.

Now she’s older I do put a few photos because she likes to be on there. But I’m acutely aware of some sides of online relationships and even gaming. You can get messages from some unsavoury people and she’s playing games where you do interact. I did forget to put parental controls on some apps and had huge charges on my credit card.

With gaming you can do it in a safe way and parental controls are key. It’s not news to me I’ve been aware step by step and vigilant all my life.

I tell Violet you don’t have a phone I have a phone no phone company would give you a contract. You are 12. You don’t have a gaming console I have a gaming console.

It is down to parents to protect the safety of their children but also that investment it’s not just about the time you set but the quality of gameplay.

You recently received messages from people concerned Violet was sporting black eyes in your Halloween family snap accusing you of covering them up. Did that frankly bonkers response put you off sharing your life on social media?

No it doesn’t discourage me from posting her because I don’t really mind. I understand that once you put something out in public domain then it is up for criticism and up for debate. That’s a huge reason people should be careful about what they post in the first place. It surprised me a little bit that on Halloween she would have ‘black eyes’ and not just Halloween makeup.

It was just a sweet thing actually she didn’t want to be the Incredibles she had a spooky costume with her friends and that’s why she had all this black makeup on but she’s such a lovely girl and put on the costume to be part of the family photo and took it off. And she said to me [amid the criticism] “oh just explain it to them mummy”.

It was great and a real opportunity for a teaching moment because I said “no one is owed an explanation. We don’t have to explain why you had this Halloween makeup on.” It was an opportunity for me to teach Violet just be comfortable in people’s wilful misunderstanding of your online content because it’s going to happen again. You don’t always have to correct people. In the end I didn’t regret it at all it was good.

Have you always been cool calm and collected when it comes to this or was there a time you stressed at setting the record straight?

I don’t mind about setting the record straight I think I’ve always been that way at least [as an adult]… I feel like the correction will reveal itself eventually. I’m very comfortable in silence. I love it actually.

I don’t have the impulse to have the last word I don’t mind. And if people are entertained by a falsehood then that’s fine with me too. I just want people to be entertained full stop. If I’m the punchline or they get something wrong about me…

Plastic surgery is a good example of that people think I’ve had loads and loads of plastic surgery and I don’t often bother to correct them because I don’t care. If they get a kick out of it and they want to gossip or criticise my face I actually don’t care so I just let them do it. I like being in on the joke. There is too much earnest serious behavior in society today.

Adele recently spoke about her son having no idea she’s famous. Does Violet know you have a profile?

How old is Adele’s son?

I think he’s nine?

Oh well…what?! How can you not know who Adele is?

I mean there was a lovely story: Jo Brand told me one of her children came home from school and turned to her and said ‘mum are you Jo Brand?!’ I think she uses her married name possibly at home.

Violet is both aware and largely unimpressed by my profile. She’s raised very much around comedians she’s come on tour with me since her infancy and she likes it she gets a little bit of a kick about it when she gets to do special things. She got to go backstage and see Billie Eilish at Leeds Festival so she gets some perks. But I’m not TikTok famous so she’s not interested.

The star is currently on tour and just released book The Audacity (Picture: Andy Barnes / BACKGRID)

In your book you wrote about panel shows still hiring the headline male comedians and dotting them with some ‘beautiful entertainment women’. Why is there still comedy inequality on these shows?

I mean it’s such a tricky very nuanced conversation. When I wrote about it in my book I had the space to explain my position on it fully. Long answer short I think that TV companies and commissioners are in a difficult position because even if they want to make a change they are beholden to viewership and audience. I do think that a large part of the audience still believes men are funnier than women and they want to see funny men and celebrity women laughing at these funny men.

I’m very peaceful and positive it’s changing possibly not quickly enough. People vote with their remote. I think it’s the responsibility can’t just lay with commissioners I think it lays with the audience if you want to see more grassroots standup comedians from different ethnicities genders socio-economic backgrounds you can support them in your local comedy clubs and watch shows that feature them.

People think just men are funny I don’t just mean men there are loads of women who will openly say to me ‘I don’t think women are funny I only think men are funny’. It’s about changing that attitude.

Out of your comedian pals who do you WhatsApp the most?

Ooh Romesh [Ranganathan].

Romesh and I are both on tour at the minute and we WhatsApp all the time just about this or that or comedy gossip or what he’s doing. His last WhatsApp to me was he was being shown to a table for dinner and he fell over and was really embarrassed. He was being shown to his table by someone who recognised him ‘oh right this way sir’ and he fell over. Probably because he had a new pair of cool trainers.

You say you love gossip – what are your thought on Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson?

I mean I’m disgusted…

I’m confused and perplexed

Pete and Kim are the talk of the town (Picture: Getty/Backgrid)

I love Pete Davidson I think he’s very talented. I’m gonna do a podcast on this it’s worth a whole podcast of discussion.

I’m not clear and I usually am on whether or not I’m being hustled I’m being tricked I’m not clear on that and I think Pete Davidson is a wonderfully talented man but I don’t know what is it about the Kardashian sisters at the minute they’ve all got to bring home a neck tattoo.

Well we have Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker Kravis don’t we?

I think Kim Kardashian is trying to emulate a Kravis moment and I don’t know where it’s going. I just feel very gaslit and agitated by the whole thing right now.

I’m going to feel like a fool when they get me…

That’s it. It’s difficult that I don’t have the show to turn to I feel really out of touch with what’s real and what’s not. I’m going to investigate I know someone who is friends with Pete and I’m gonna get on the phone because I can’t take it anymore.

The love bite’s come out. It would make sense that Kim Kardashian is giving love bites because that’s something you do when you’re a teenager and sexually inexperienced and perhaps it points to a very business partnership in her marriage with Kanye. She’s out of practice she’s giving love bites I don’t know I’m gonna get to the bottom of it."

ETR,Entergy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bG8uY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjgvZW50ZXJneS1hcmthbnNhcy0xc3QtZmVtYWxlLWxpbmUtd29ya2VyLWxvdmVzLXRoZS1hZHZlbnR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Entergy Arkansas' 1st female lineworker 'loves the adventure',"Sara Russell Lingo (photo courtesy of Entergy)

Sara Russell-Lingo didn’t set out to make history. But after a few post-high-school years of dead-end warehouse jobs and a stint in retail “I was looking for a career.”

She found one as the first female Entergy Arkansas lineworker.

Saw it on TV

Russell-Lingo 25 grew up in South Bend a community near Jacksonville. It may be that electricity is in her blood; her grandfather is a retired electrician. He saw a story on KATV news about H-VOLT Academy an Entergy-supported lineworker school at UA Pulaski Tech and told her about it. She was intrigued by the prospects of working outdoors earning good pay having a promising career path and helping people all day every day. Before long she was enrolled at H-VOLT Academy while continuing a job at Lowe’s.

Entergy Arkansas leadership saw her scores liked her attitude and made her a part of the team beginning May 12 reporting to Line Supervisor Bert Wilson out of the West Markham Service Center. Step one in her training was two months of “linemen’s boot camp” in Jackson Miss. where new apprentices learn to climb poles are taught to appreciate the importance of safety on and off the job and begin to acquire other basic skills needed for line work. She’s now in the next phase of her professional development a four-year apprenticeship after which she will be a journeyman lineworker.

Life as a Lady Lineworker

“I love the adventure” Russell-Lingo said. “I love going to communities; their lights are off and they’re all grumpy and upset and we leave and they’re just all smiling and happy.”

What’s it like being a woman in a job in Arkansas that up to now has been done entirely by men? “I don’t look at it as a man’s job. It’s a career and it’s awesome. And the guys I work with have been great. They don’t treat me any different and I don’t see myself as any different. You know I just fit in. They’re teaching me what I need to know and watching out for me.”

So lineman? Line worker? “I’m perfectly fine with being called a lineman” Russell-Lingo said.

Customers notice that she’s not a line man. “I pulled up to this house one time and got out of the truck and put my hard hat on and everything. This girl looks at her mom and says ‘Mom it’s Superwoman!'”

Now that Russell-Lingo has opened the door for women to be Entergy Arkansas line workers who’s next? “I’ve been asking around encouraging women I know to look into it. And I can’t find any. It’s unbelievable. I don’t know what it is. But you got to want to do it.” Still the opportunity is there and Entergy Arkansas would welcome additional female applicants.

Overcoming Challenges

Russell-Lingo is realistic about the road ahead. “You know when a girl comes into the program and doesn’t even know how to change a tire there’s a lot to learn. It helps to be mechanically inclined and I wasn’t. But I’m learning every day.”

Russell-Lingo had her doubts about line work because of the physical strength required. But after she got some hands-on experience she found that with the tools and techniques available to her she is physically strong enough. It was the mental challenge that took some getting over. “If you tell yourself you can’t do something you’re not going to do it. It’s all in the mindset. So I told myself ‘you can do this.'”

And she can. At boot camp she recalls in a class of 20 she’d sometimes finish second in a series of pole-climbing drills. “You don’t just hop on a pole and go up. It’s rhythm. You got to find your rhythm.”

Another common challenge for new line workers is a fear of heights. Fortunately Russell-Lingo said heights “don’t bother me a bit.”

All About Safety

Russell-Lingo has learned that everything about line work for Entergy starts and ends with safety. “Safety is number one priority always. You always want to be watching. Electricity is no joke.” In addition to formal training in the classroom and in the field Russell-Lingo has the benefit lately of working alongside Journeyman Serviceman Aaron Ramos. “He’s wants every task done perfectly and perfectly safely. He reminds me that with some mistakes you don’t get any do-overs. You have to stay focused all the time.”

Russell-Lingo and her husband Dale Fairchild live in Jacksonville. They have no children just yet.

As for the future Russell-Lingo is focusing mostly on being the best lineworker she can be. But for the first time she’s excited about working for a company from which she can see herself retiring someday after a long fulfilling and safe career.

Then three years ago at just 31 years old the North Dakota native was promoted to chief accounting officer (CAO) of the company she helped create from the ground up.

“After Momentum spun off from Apollo Management I got this opportunity to showcase what I had learned and accomplished in my previous experiences” Schank said. “I welcome opportunities where I may be uncomfortable and embrace change but I also know when to ask others for help. Collaboration with others is so important in solving problems and it really helped me ascend to this position before I thought I could.”

Schank now lives in Houston with her husband Garrett and her daughter Juliette.

Foot in the door

""After I graduated from the University of North Dakota in 2010 we were in the middle of a huge oil boom in the Bakken so it felt like the perfect time to enter the oil and gas industry. My first job was at an oilfield service company called Wyoming Casing Service in Dickinson ND where I had the opportunity to expand my skills and lead the development of the company’s internal processes. This early positive experience in oil and gas made me want to continue to pursue growth within the industry.

One of the achievements I am most proud of is being a member of the Apollo Management team that spun off and created Momentum Minerals. I was part of developing the company the culture and the team and now it is so rewarding to be reminded of our hard work every day in the office.

There were many challenges along the way that we had to overcome as a team. One of those challenges can be to get the entire team on board with the goals and overall vision of a project. When successful the outcome is well worth the struggle. When you get a cohesive team the benefits greatly improve efficiency outcomes long term employee retention and overall success of the organization.

Something so important for a leader in the oil and gas industry is the ability to adapt. This industry is constantly evolving and especially now during a consolidation period leaders must be able to adjust to the changes and react with solutions. Leaders also need to be able to listen to others and understand the entirety of a problem before throwing themselves into it. Without full information mistakes can be made that would have been avoided with deeper understanding.

As you grow in your professional experience you learn an incredible amount about business and people. One of the most important things I have learned in my experience as a manager and leader is that a manager needs to be able to tailor their leadership to what works best with each individual employee while also maintaining overall organizational equity. Knowing how to create an environment in which an employee does their best work and adapting to those needs differentiates a good leader from a great leader.

There are so many people who have been so supportive and influential in my life. These include my parents my husband my friends and my colleagues together always encouraging me to excel and pursue my goals. I have received so much advice and direction throughout my career but one that I always remember is to accept any challenge that comes my way.""

Working together

""I believe that the overall success of an organization depends on a shared vision and a cohesive culture. In order to achieve these things we have to as leaders and managers foster an environment of collaboration. This industry brings together so many different perspectives—from landmen to accountants petroleum engineers to PR specialists—that come together to transform businesses and ideas.

The oil and gas industry needs to take charge of the narrative regarding the benefits of oil and gas. These products drive the world and everything around us in our daily lives yet the image around them has become so negative and even considered detrimental to society’s wellbeing. We need to do better conveying the benefits of the products we produce to society and the economy.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Prestigious VC firms like Accel Sequoia and Atomico all have them — and more keep launching. Earlier this year secretive VC firm Hedosophia kicked off a new scout programme and enlisted dozens of well-known startup founders and operators to help it source early-stage startups. EQT Ventures is also setting up a scout scheme it has confirmed to Sifted and is actively approaching founders and operators at the moment.

They’re billed as a way for later stage funds to get in with the most promising founders early on — and as a way to diversify their pipeline. For scouts without personal wealth to invest they can be a way to build up an investment track record. They can also help put more underrepresented founders on VC firms’ radars.

And yet murmurs that these programmes don’t actually work that well — or at least not that well for the scouts or founders — are getting louder.

Critics say that they’re a cheap way for VCs to source deal flow and get ""dibs"" on the best companies while posing a problem for founders who can run into signalling problems if those investors then don’t back them at a later round. On the other hand Roxanne Varza director of Station F and a Sequoia scout told Sifted that she'd “never had a startup tell me it’s an issue”.

As competition at the seed stage hots up some founders are starting to turn down scout cheques preferring more experienced (and perhaps committed) seed-stage funds or angels who are investig their personal money. Some investors Sifted spoke to said they refused to coinvest with scouts instead asking them to invest with their personal capital if their conviction is high enough.

As for the scouts what counts as fair compensation has always been up for debate: is this a great crash course into VC or exploitation?

Here we list all the known scout programmes in Europe and share what deal the scouts get.

The Atomico Angel Programme

Sarah Drinkwater has been an Atomico scout

When Atomico a London-based VC investing at Series A onwards launched its first angel programme in 2018 it was something of a trendsetter. Now everyone’s at it — and Atomico’s scheme is on its third cohort.

What does it invest in? Atomico angels invest at seed or pre-seed — and often write a startup’s first cheque. Angels can invest in all sectors besides “unethical” areas like drugs tobacco and firearms.

How does it work? Each angel is given $100k to invest over a year. Scouts invest between $10k-50k per deal.

How many scouts? Atomico selects a cohort of 12-18 “angels” annually.

Who are some of the scouts? Josefin Landgård cofounder of digital healthcare startup Kry; Sarah Drinkwater ex-head of Google Campus and a startup adviser; Andy Ayim founder of Angel Investing School and head of product at fintech unicorn Zilch.

Compensation? Angels receive 25% carry in each deal they make. They also have a share in an “Angel Pool” where some carry from all investments is allocated so if one company wins all the angels win.

Other benefits? Access to the fund's team and their knowledge a network of peers and shared learnings from the fund and angels.

Example investments? Andy Davis founder of VC firm 10x10 and an angel in Atomico’s second cohort invested in eight startups with an average ticket size of $10k. Of those investments 50% were into female founders and five were black founders. Companies included The Stack audio startup Audiomob and logistics platform Hutch.

Accel’s Starter Programme

Hanno Renner

Accel the giant global VC firm has been running its Starters programme in the US since 2017 and launched a European version last summer.

What does it invest in? “Starters” can invest in any European startup as long as it isn’t working in an illegal or unethical sector.

How does it work? Each starter is given $200k to invest. They can decide on the speed and frequency of investments. Average cheque sizes are $20k.

How many scouts? 21 successful senior operators and founders were selected for the first programme. Scouts are expected to give knowledge and expertise alongside money to the startups they invest in.

Who are some of the scouts? Hanno Renner cofounder of HR unicorn Personio; Georgie Smallwood CPO at scooter operator Tier; Tristan Thomas former VP of marketing at digital bank Monzo.

Compensation? Scouts receive carry in the investments they make as well as in the fund the scout money comes from. So if one scout does well there’s upside for all. If Accel goes on to lead a round in a startup that a scout initially invested in there’s an extra (undisclosed) benefit.

Benefits? Training and resources on how to angel invest.

Example investments? Cardiac analysis startup Idoven investment app heyfina fertility startup Oviavo and broadband challenger startup Cuckoo.

Ada Ventures Scout Programme

Ada Ventures which backs underrepresented founders at pre-seed and seed in the UK launched a scout programme in 2018.

How does it work? Anyone can apply to be a scout.

How many scouts? Around 100 scouts.

Who are the scouts? Ada looks for leaders of diverse communities founders and activists for their programme. Scouts include Daniel Evans from Birmingham Enterprise Community; Emilie Bellet founder of investment platform Vestpod; and Mara Livermore founder of agency House of Sweet Waters.

Compensation? If the fund invests in a startup recommended by a scout they receive £5k or can invest that capital alongside the fund. They also receive 10% of carried interest on the company they sourced as long as that investment returns over 5x and the fund is paying carry.

Other benefits? A network of other scouts monthly masterclass sessions on topics from organisational design to coping with burnout. Access to pro-bono mental health support and coaching from Spill.

Example investments? Biodegradable sanitary pads Planera childcare platform Bubble and over-55 community Mirthy.

Ada Ventures — Ada’s Angels

Arfah Farooq

Ada Ventures also set up an angel programme in 2020 to give five people with experience in underrepresented communities money to make investments into startups — rather than just recommending companies to the fund as scouts do.

How does it work? Angels apply through an open process. They are given £50k to invest over an 18-month period. The final investment decision lies with the fund and angel.

How many angels? Five.

Who are the angels? Arfah Farooq founder of community Muslamic Makers; Ash Phillips founder of business building community Dffrnt; Nicole Crentsil founder of Black women community Black Girl Fest.

Compensation? Angels receive 100% carry on their investments once the fund has been paid back (which could be several years after the original investment).

Other benefits? Coaching mentoring and a free place at Angel Investing School — an online course that teaches people how to start investing in startups.

Example investments? Farooq has made four investments to date including workplace behaviour tracker InChorus pricing plan tool Kana and online business school Framework.

Backed VC

Seed-stage London-based VC firm Backed has perhaps the best-known — or at least most fun-looking — scout programme in Europe.

How does it work? Scouts are approached to join by the firm. Usually they are community leaders that have access to diverse dealflow.

How many scouts? Around 40.

Who are some of the scouts? Anne-Laure Le Cunff founder of mindful productivity school Ness Labs; Abi Mohammed programme lead at Tech Nation; James Frewin founder of US/UX design agency October.

Compensation? The programme works on a commission model — when the fund invests in a scout’s recommendation the scout is paid up to £25k. This number is constantly under review based on the market and has changed over time.

Other benefits? A well looked after network thanks to head of network Daisy Onubogu. Backed has previously covered conference tickets and accommodation for scouts provided executive coaching and invited scouts to offsites — this year’s being four days in Tuscany. Frewin who has been a scout since 2019 said: “I wanted to learn more about VC and the investment process so getting access to investment committee meetings and deal reviews has been super helpful”.

Example investments? Afro haircare brand Afrocenchix biotech for vegan fat Hoxton Farms and loyalty platform Fygo.

Hedosophia

Glovo cofounder Oscar Pierre

Secretive London-based growth-stage VC Hedosophia launched a scout programme earlier this year to invest in pre-seed and seed-stage fintechs.

How does it work? Scouts tend to write £20k-30k cheques although they have a lot of freedom in how much capital they can deploy and the manner in which they do so.

How many scouts? Around 20 well-known European founders and operators many from the Hedosophia portfolio.

Who are some of the scouts? Oscar Pierre CEO of Barcelona-based delivery giant Glovo; Chad West former communications chief at Revolut; Noor van Boven former chief people officer at fintech N26.

Compensation? Scouts get 30-40% carry on deals they make according to Sifted sources. There is also a shared pot for all scouts which they each get 10% carry from.

Example investments Equity liquidity startup Semper.

Flashpoint’s Scouts

Flashpoint VC primarily invests in revenue-generating B2B SaaS products in CEE the Baltics Finland and Israel. It launched its scout programme in the summer of 2021.

How does it work? Initially the firm had an open scout programme which anyone could apply to. However after being disappointed that people dropped off after a while Flashpoint decided to create a closed programme in which it pre-selects scouts and gives them a three-month trial. There are monthly meetups to discuss progress and deals.

How many scouts? It aims to have one to two scouts per investment region.

Who are the scouts? Tallinn-based Dmitri Sarle a Startup Europe advisory board member and founder of community Weeklyaction.club; Warsaw-based Piotr Grabowski founder of Foodtech.ac.

Compensation? A finder’s fee is provided which is dependent on the size of the deal. This is paid even if work with the scout ends after the trial period.

What other benefits do scouts receive? A right to invest into all Flashpoint deals introduced by a scout — Flashpoint covers all due diligence and any other transaction costs; access to the Flashpoint platform which includes resources for finance legal PR marketing and its tech stack; access to Flashpoint’s network; regular team meetings to discuss investment opportunities and share learnings; a network of investors and peers.

Peak an early-stage investment fund focused on European SaaS products marketplaces and platforms launched a scout programme in September this year.

How does it work? Each venture scout has €100k to invest.

Who are the scouts? Emma Tracey former CEO and founder of Honeypot based in Germany; Dennis Goedegebuure former VP for growth at Airbnb based in the Netherlands; Alok Alström CEO and founder of Appjobs and former GM of Uber Sweden based in Sweden.

Example investments? No investments made yet.

Sequoia Capital

Roxanne Varza

Sequoia’s scout programme is the OG: it’s been running a scheme in the US for over a decade. And when the world-famous VC firm opened a European office last year it also set up a scout programme over here.

How does it work? Sequoia dedicates a portion of its $195m seed fund to the scout programme. Scouts are selected and added to cohorts that run for two years. They are given $100k to deploy over that time and can invest in pre-seed and seed-stage startups in almost any sector (bar “red lines” like narcotics).

How many scouts? Around 24 in Europe.

Who are the scouts? Roxanne Varza head of Station F; Cristina Berta customer team lead at Picnic; Marc McCabe a former director of operations at Airbnb.

Compensation? Details are hazy but if startups do well scouts also benefit.

What other benefits do scouts receive? Investment memo feedback from cohort peers an investment track record and angel investing education.

Example investments? The US scheme backed some real winners like Stripe and Uber.

shl.vc

Sahil Lavingia founder of creator marketplace Gumroad started rolling fund shl.vc to invest over $10m a year into early-stage tech companies writing $100k-$250k cheques. Lavingia is now raising a dedicated fund for the fully remote scout programme which launched in July 2021.

How does it work? People apply and are accepted on a quarterly basis.

How many scouts? 100

Who are the scouts? Maya Caddle product at Nestcoin; José Ocampo team lead at Synthesis School.

Compensation? If the fund invests in a scout’s recommendation they receive 25% of the fund’s carry for that deal. Lavingia says: “If I invest $100k into a company that you help me source then you'll get 25% of my carry (about 20%) or 5% — as if you had invested $5K into the company yourself.”

What other benefits do scouts receive? Access to a community monthly calls and one scout says “Sahil’s brain”.

Example investments? Technical interviews platform Litebulb and video editor Sequence.Film.

Lakestar

Zurich-based VC firm Lakestar quietly set up an angel programme in January this year a partner confirmed to Sifted. Halo as it’s known is part of a strategy to invest more at the seed-stage and “get our foot in the door early with a company [in order] to participate in later deals” according to an investor update seen by Sifted.

How does it work? 12 founders and CEOs were selected by the firm. They have flexibility over how much they can invest.

Who are some of the scouts? Renaud Visage cofounder and former CTO of Eventbrite is a Lakestar scout. The cohort is based all around Europe.

Compensation? Undisclosed.

Tiny Scouts

Tiny Capital is a remote fund that buys companies to keep them operational. Founders can stay or go depending on what they want from the deal.

How does it work? Anyone can sign up — they need to review and sign the terms of agreement to be a scout. Scouts email recommended companies and then if of interest to Tiny will introduce the startup's senior leadership to Tiny’s team.

Compensation? If a scout refers a business that is bought a finder’s fee of $25k to $200k+ is paid out.

What markets does it invest in? Growing and profitable businesses that aren’t unicorn material.

Example investments? No-code platform Makerpad and women entrepreneurial network Girlboss.

Speedinvest

Deepali Nangia angel investor

Vienna-based early-stage VC firm Speedinvest doesn’t have scouts — instead it has venture partners.

How does it work? Venture partners — some of whom are publicly announced but not all — source and evaluate deals for the firm. Some focus on specific geographies or founder segments (such as underrepresented founders). Some venture partners also offer support to Speedinvest’s portfolio; for example functional expertise.

Who are the venture partners? The most prominent is Deepali Nangia a well-known angel investor. She joined Speedinvest a year ago to focus on sourcing female and underrepresented founders.

Compensation? Venture partners all have slightly different agreements. Some are paid monthly retainers some get carry in the fund others get cash rewards.

Mountside Ventures

This one is a little different. Mountside’s scouts aren’t hunting for startups; they’re looking for LPs.

How does it work? The idea explains managing partner Jonathan Hollis is that Mountside’s scouts will “identify individuals connected to 'emerging LPs' who are interested in investing into funds and those connected to the more secretive world of family offices”. In return the scouts will get to attend a conference for LPs and VCs which Mountside is running in February.

How many scouts? Five to eight. (Mountside is recruiting scouts at the moment.)

Blossom Capital

Last year just as cities started locking down London-based VC firm Blossom launched a huge $5m angel programme. The idea was to “help transition operators into angel investing” founding partner Ophelia Brown told Sifted. Blossom has since stopped the programme because Brown says “we successfully achieved this aim and more”.

How did it work? It was a bit complicated. Blossom enlisted a troop of angels to source early-stage startups to invest in. The plan was to invest $250k in 20 companies and for the angels to also provide mentorship. Angels were also invited to coinvest with Blossom.

How many angels? There are 13 listed on the programme’s website all founders or executives from European unicorns.

Who were some of the angels? Des Traynor cofounder of Intercom; Guillaume Pousaz founder and CEO of Checkout.com; Nilan Peiris VP of growth at Wise; Jonas Templestein cofounder of Monzo; and (very briefly) Shakil Khan an early investor in Spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Positive Capital has teamed up with investors to provide $200 million for community housing. Photo / Supplied

Positive Capital says it has been joined by investment firm Alvarium and KiwiSaver provider Pathfinder to build $200 million of new public housing through a shared equity programme.

The company said it had developed an equity programme for registered community housing providers involving Positive Property investing 50 per cent of the purchase price as equity its associated Community Finance lending 40 per cent as debt.

By contributing 90 per cent of the upfront cost of each home the community housing providers can meet this growing need at a significantly increased scale.

The $200m could go towards building up to 400 new public houses Positive Capital said.

The programme enabled new homes to be built now while focusing on growing the balance sheets of leading charities in the long term it said.

It involves the community housing provider owning a half share of each property and Positive Property owning the other 50 per cent from day one.

During the term of the programme the community housing provider pays down its 40 per cent debt and then has a first right to purchase the remaining half share from Positive Property.

Community housing providers are funded by long-term agreements with Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga –the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development.

Positive Capital was established earlier this year by James Palmer after founding Community Finance 2019.

Sistema founder Brendan Lindsay sons of philanthropist and entrepreneur the late Sir Eion Edgar as well as economist and housing expert Shamubeel Eaqub are also involved.

In addition to committing to invest in Positive Property Pathfinder is one of the key investors in Community Finance's Aotearoa Pledge which has raised $71m investment commitments this year to tackle New Zealand's housing shortage.

Palmer said the combination of equity from Positive Property debt through Community Finance and social services from the community housing providers all underpinned by long-term Government funding would drive new public housing supply.

""We set up Positive Property to work alongside and support the Government's significant investment in public housing with the shared goal of providing more affordable homes to those most in need while delivering both market and social returns to investors at scale"" he said in a statement.

Positive Capital provides investments for wholesale investors which focus on partnering with community housing providers leading developers and builders and investors.

Investors co-own community housing through Positive Property in partnership with leading housing charities.

Investors receive quarterly payments from the net rental income share in capital gains and the rent received is inflation adjusted annually for the length of the services agreement.

Community Finance was launched in 2019 and currently has advanced loans of more than $90m.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the years parents wandering the aisles of retail stores and scanning the pages of e-commerce sites have come across toys that would spark various degrees of horror and confusion from the poor tykes expecting something a tad more conventional.

For your viewing pleasure and as a warning on what to avoid for the holidays here is Benzinga’s naughty but nice list of the 10 weirdest toys of all time.

Golden Girls Action Figures. No one will thank the designer of this collection for being a friend – Bea Arthur’s Dorothy looks like Harvey Fierstein in a kimono Estelle Getty’s Sophia looks like she was just hit by a bus Rue McClanahan’s Blanche is lacking a middle torso and one has to assume the fourth doll is Betty White’s Rose though the facial inspiration is clearly not from the legendary sitcom star. Someone pass the cheesecake please.

Handi Squirrel Finger Hand Puppet. This product from Aqkilo consists of five finger puppets – one head and four paws – that is supposed to resemble a squirrel. Except that it looks like the poor squirrel was dismembered and its head and limbs are floating about each other.

Lil Shitz. There is a surprisingly large volume of toys that involve excrement but this poop doll is arguably one of the least appealing in this smelly segment. The Etsy ETSY based creator of the product claims each item in this line is individually hand-sculpted – not unlike snowflakes no two turds are alike.

Mega Plumber Action Figure. Sure Superman can repel alien attacks and Batman can foil nutcase criminals but can either unclog a backed-up drain. American Standard the company that manufactures toilets offered kids a very different superhero: Mega Plumber! This action figure came with its own wrench and toilet thus guaranteeing kids hours of fun imagining how to save the day in the bathroom. (Obviously Lil Shitz will be displeased to match wits with this toy!)

Mutant Bunny. You won’t say “What’s up Doc?” with this product though you could say ""WTF?"" with this bunny that has three ears and four arms. Clearly Mutant Bunny has the market for deformed rabbits to itself.

My First Bacon. This 19-inch-tall plush doll says “I’m bacon!” when it is squeezed. Just why a child would want to squeeze a 19-inch-tall talking bacon has yet to be explained.

Pet Rock. One of the most notorious fads of the 1970s was this offering created by advertising executive Gary Dahl who harvested stones from Mexico’s Rosarito Beach. Dahl sold these items in custom cardboard boxes (complete with breathing holes) that included straw beds for the unlikeliest of pets. Retailing at $4 per box Dahl made more than $1 million before the fad lost its appeal and the pet rocks were tossed out the window.

Sense of Right Alliance. This notorious Chinese knockoff features a sextet of pop culture heroes joined together into a hitherto unknown league of do-gooders. The heroes (or their unreasonable facsimiles) include Batman Superman Spider-Man one of the Power Rangers Shrek and Lightning McQueen from “Cars.” Obviously this is the perfect gift for kids with a minimal grasp of IP infringement.

Stretch Armstrong. Originally introduced in 1976 the point of this latex doll was to have its arms and legs stretched as far as kids could pull. While adequate as a test of juvenile strength it also proved to test the patience of parents whose kids left Stretch Armstrong in a hot car – as the doll was known to melt into a sticky goo that was difficult to clean up. (A 2019 re-release of the toy is designed to avoid that melting mess.)

War Criminals of the 20th Century: Adolf Hitler. G.I. Joe’s greatest foe has his own action figure – a 12-inch-tall Fuehrer who gazes out humorlessly at the poor kids who somehow wind up with him. The manufacturer also produced Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Goring dolls to accompany the Hitler doll in its doomed quest for world conquest.

Jodorowsky’s Dune (Documentary) Blu-Ray

David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation of Dune was the first time Frank Herbert’s iconic novel received the big screen treatment but it wasn’t the first attempt. The 2013 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune takes a deep dive into Chilean-French avant-garde filmmaker Alejandro Jodoroswky’s attempt to bring the book to life in the 1970s which became one of the most influential projects despite never coming to fruition after years involving H.R. Giger Dan O’Bannon Salvador Dali Orson Welles Pink Floyd Mick Jagger and other notable artists writers actors and musicians.

Dune (1984)

And then there is the Dune (1984) special edition Blu-ray set that is a must for diehard fans of property. Although not as ambitious or well-received (initially anyway) as the 2021 version David Lynch’s retelling of Frank Herbert’s novel has become a cult classic in the 37 years since its premiere and continues to be one of the most iconic sci-fi films of all time.

This should be more than enough to set you on your personal journey of bringing joy to the Dune fan in your life this holiday season especially if they’re upset about the movie leaving HBO Max following a month of streaming.

The result is a resurgence of maximalist home décor that embraces pattern color and ornamentation. Cabinetry that may once have been wood grain is now jewel-toned; streamlined furniture has given way to all things squishy and wiggly; trends like “cottagecore” and “grandmillennial” aim to elevate items that are handmade chintzy and secondhand.

Is it any wonder that fake food is back too?

Charcuterie and cheese candles resin-cast croissants and Jell-O salad lamps are hot items. Retro-style fake cakes are big on Instagram. The high-end jewelry brand Mociun sells faux glasses of spilled wine and melting ice cream cones alongside $10000 engagement rings. And Yukiko Morita’s Pampshade lamps which are made from real baked goods that have been preserved can sell for around $80 apiece.

For John Derian the founder of an eponymous home décor and decoupage line the resurgence of fake food is very welcome. Mr. Derian has had a fake cake sitting on his kitchen counter at home for 14 years he said and he estimates that he has been selling food-themed items in his store for about 20 years starting with a stuffed doll made by Nathalie Lete that had sausages for arms and a steak for a head.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdWdoaW5ncGxhY2UuY29tL3cvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMS8xMS8yNy9kaXNuZXktaWRlYXMtc21hbGwtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc2F0dXJkYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Holiday Shopping: Small Business Saturday - Disney Edition,"You’ve survived the Black Friday madness and you’re gearing up for Cyber Monday but don’t forget about Small Business Saturday!

Thanksgiving week is full of special promotions on Black Friday and Cyber Monday and sandwiched right in the middle is Small Business Saturday. Below are four ideas on how you can support a small business with your purchases while also meeting all of your Disney needs.

Disney Vacation

It might not seem obvious but many travel agents are actually small business owners! These passionate fans do the monotonous job of scheduling and planning a trip based on what you hope to experience so that you get the best vacation possible. Along with advertising they often partner with fan sites to help spread the word of what they have to offer much like Laughing Place and our pals at Mouse Fan Travel. Travel agencies make commissions from the destinations that you visit meaning when they set up your trip there’s no extra cost to you. So if a Disney vacation (Parks Cruise Line Aulani Adventures by Disney) is on your gift list for 2021 consider booking your magical stay with a travel agency.

Minted

Minted is an online community where aspiring artists and crafty creators sell their unique works. Just this month Minted launched a new Disney and Pixar Collection featuring characters from Moana Aladdin Monsters Inc. Frozen and more. Among the offerings are wall murals framed prints and decorative pillows and many of these can be personalized so that you can present your loved ones with a truly unique gift.

Etsy

If you can’t find the Disney item you’re looking for at a big box retailer (or even Disney!) chances are someone on Etsy has designed and produced exactly what you’ve imagined! Books face masks t-shirts glassware homemade toys candles Minnie Ears…you name it it’s here. Whether you’re looking for stocking stuffers or a special present not available anywhere else your purchase on Etsy will be a big hit with your loved ones and help support a small business in the process.

Gift Cards

If you’ve not planning a Disney vacation but know someone who’s going you can help cover some of their expenses or souvenirs with a gift card to local restaurants and shops. Disney Springs (and Downtown Disney) are home to some small-ish businesses such as The Art of Shaving Erin McKenna’s Bakery NYC Wondermade and Salt & Straw (DTD).

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management this week approved construction and operation of the South Fork Wind Farm a 132-megawatt project proposed in a stretch of Rhode Island Sound between Block Island and Martha’s Vineyard.

The project being planned by Danish company Ørsted and utility Eversource is only the second commercial-scale offshore wind farm in the nation to secure approval from the federal government.

The first Vineyard Wind received a record of decision in May and marked its groundbreaking a week ago in Massachusetts. The 800-megawatt project is being built in an area south of Nantucket further off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts than the South Fork proposal.

Both projects are significantly larger than the nation’s first offshore wind farm a 30-megawatt demonstration project that went into operation in Rhode Island waters near Block Island five years ago.

The Block Island Wind Farm which includes five turbines owned by Ørsted was built to prove the feasibility of offshore wind in the United States and spur the development of a new clean-energy industry.

With the recent approvals of the larger projects nearby the Block Island turbines appear to have done their job.

“Just one year ago there were no large-scale offshore wind projects approved in the federal waters of the United States” Interior Secretary Deborah Haaland said in a statement. “Today there are two with several more on the horizon.”

The decision comes amid a push by the Biden administration to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management expects to review at least 16 construction and operations plans for offshore wind projects by 2025 totaling about 19 gigawatts.

Previously in RI wind energy:Three more wind turbines OK'd in Providence

Many of the proposals are planned off the New England and mid-Atlantic coasts but auctions are being prepared for leases off the Carolinas and California. Meanwhile work is underway to explore potential sales in the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Maine.

The South Fork Wind Farm will be about 19 miles southeast of Block Island. Its power enough to supply about 70000 homes will be sent by an underwater cable to Long Island.

While federal approval was never really in doubt the proposal faced a rockier path when it came before Rhode Island coastal regulators. The state Coastal Resources Management Council awarded what’s known as a federal consistency certification in June but the decision came over the objections of fishermen who complained that the wind farm would interfere with their livelihoods.

Certification that the wind farm is consistent with state coastal policies also came despite concerns raised by Save The Bay and others about the council’s permitting process for the wind farm which would be built in an area called Cox Ledge in Rhode Island Sound that is home to a rich diversity of fish including species of tuna and Atlantic cod.

Ørsted is targeting the end of 2023 to begin operations and offshore work on the project is set to get underway early next year.

“With the achievement of this critical federal permitting milestone construction of this historic wind farm is expected to begin in the weeks and months ahead” said David Hardy CEO of Ørsted Offshore North America.

Fabrication of the wind farm’s offshore substation has already started in Texas. Ørsted and Eversource could begin site preparation for the transmission cable as early as this coming January.

The federal decision allows the developers to install up to 12 turbines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcGVjb2QuY29tL2NhcGUtd2lkZS1uZXdzL3NtYWxsLWZpcmUtaW4tYmFzZW1lbnQtb2YtYnJld3N0ZXItcmVzaWRlbmNlLWV4dGluZ3Vpc2hlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Updated: Small fire in basement of Brewster residence extinguished,"BREWSTER – Firefighters responded to a residence in the 200 block of Tubman Road shortly after 5 PM Saturday for reports of smoke in the house. Crews discovered a small fire in the basement of the home and quickly extinguished it. Smoke was ventilated and firefighters checked to make sure the fire hadn’t spread any further. No injuries were reported.

Brewster Fire reports that At 5:19 p.m. on Saturday November 27 Brewster Fire was dispatched to a residence on Tubman Road for a reported past dryer fire. Upon investigation firefighters found a heavy smoke condition in the basement with flames impinging on the wooden first floor structural supports above a drop ceiling. Personnel immediately stretched a 1 ¾ hose line from Squad 241 to the basement for fire extinguishment while at the same time using a water extinguisher to hold back the growing fire. Fortunately the rapid and aggressive work of the firefighters resulted in keeping the fire contained to a small area in the basement ceiling. After extinguishing the fire smoke was ventilated from the structure. Eversource was called to the scene to secure the electric after which the residence was turned over to the owner. Brewster Fire/Rescue thanks the Harwich and Dennis Fire Departments and their Chief officers for their response and assistance. Great job by all!

This incident highlights the need to ensure your home is protected by working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors on each floor of your residence. The daily fire and life safety of your family should be of the highest priority!

A New Bousquet Ready for Winter Opening

PITTSFIELD Mass. — After receiving an extensive makeover Ski Bousquet will open this winter with many new — and some old — features.

The most obvious renovation is the modern 15000-square-foot lodge that greets visitors from Dan Fox Drive.



A far cry from the original more than 50-year-old facility it features a gathering space expanded dining options a full bar and plenty of outdoor seating. The building was designed by Allegrone Construction.



Skiers and snowboarders can still frequent their favorite trails such as Drifter Russell Parker Main Street and the intimidating Icicles if they dare.



The chairlifts will also maintain their original titles as the Blue Chair and Yellow Chair which now seats three at a time.



The property was purchased by Mill Town Capital in May 2020. It is part of an outdoor recreation trifecta that also includes the former Berkshire West as Bousquet Sport and the former Lakeside Christian Camp as The Camp at Bousquet.



Earlier this year the Finance Committee recommended a tax increment finance agreement for the $11.3 million ski area and the project also received $960000 in Pittsfield Economic Development Funds to connect water and sewer lines to Bousquet.



Bousquet's general manager Kevin McMillan recently spoke to the tradition of starting on the easier Blue Chair and feeling accomplished after advancing to the Yellow Chair.



""When kids graduate from the Blue Chair to the Yellow Chair it's a really big deal for a lot of these folks"" he said. ""They're skiing more challenging terrain it's a bigger chair it's higher up.""



The advanced chair will be made of galvanized metal with Chair No. 1 painted yellow. McMillan said that kids will likely want to ride in the yellow seat on their first triumphant ride up the chair.



On the mountain Bousquet will see an electric converted fully automatic snowmaking system that is a quicker and more efficient process.



In this system are 80 new snow-making guns with 19 designed for full automation. Along with the guns there are 14000 feet of new snowmaking pipes and an upgraded pump house.



""The problem with snowmaking in this region is that the windows of opportunity to make snow are pretty small so you can sometimes have like a six-hour or eight-hour window of time and you have to decide as an operator if you want to make snow in that six to eight hours it takes about an hour to ramp up and it takes about an hour to ramp down in the six-hour window of time you only really have four hours to make snow"" McMillan explained.



""But with a fully automatic system in the center of the mountain we hit a button on a computer and the guns start firing up within 15 20 minutes which is wonderful and they self regulate and they can oscillate so that means that the middle of a mountain is kind of trouble-free from snowmaking standpoint which means then we can deploy our crews to make snow in other areas.""



All of these changes required a new slate of professionals to ensure that operations run smoothly.



McMillan was tapped from Zoar Outdoor where he worked and was a part-owner for more than 30 years before it was sold and there will also be a grooming and terrain park manager to oversee the park features.



Elements used for tricks were added to the park with the help of a Vans sponsorship and local artists will assist in decorating them.



35-year veteran Bousquet ski instructor Cindy Bartlett will return as the snow sports director to manage the ski and snowboard lessons offered for people of all ages and race programs will be led by program manager Jeremy Lawless.



To accommodate beginners additional easy terrain has been added to the mountain.



Throughout the facility there are technology upgrades improved lighting and added features to enhance the experience of visiting the mountain.



With all of these upgrades Bousquet is also prioritizing affordability.



""We are very aware of our local community and we've priced our season passes to make them as affordable as possible"" McMillan explained.



""So we check our regional competitors and we try and stay a little below most of our competitors and make ourselves as attractive to the local skiers as possible.""



He understands that working on the mountain is a tradition for many Berkshire County folks whether it is a seasonal job that is picked up for college students or to make skiing affordable.



""I think that that sort of cycle and the synergy between the folks that live here and the folks that work here are really important to us and so we want to continue to foster a place where people want to come ski in a place where people want to come work"" He said adding that the ski area is ensuring that employees are paid a living wage.



Bousquet plans to open by December but there is no set opening date because it is dependent on snowfall.",,,,,,

Iceland has been a focal point of my wanderlust for the better part of two years. The country is a dreamscape of natural beauty: the black sands of Reynisfjara towering icebergs of the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon and the steep jagged peaks of Vestrahorn. I was forced to shelve a meticulously planned trip there in 2020 like so many other globetrotters who set aside excursions during the Covid pandemic. Since then I've wondered: When will an adventure overseas be feasible again? Perhaps soon. The 2022 outlook for travel abroad is rosier than ever especially for Americans booking trips in the summer or later according to travel experts. But they should expect to do more advance planning and remain flexible. ""Since March 2020 there hasn't been a time as promising as it is now"" Sebastian Modak editor-at-large of Lonely Planet and the New York Times 52 Places Traveler in 2019 said of travel overseas. ""It really comes down to the traveler's own threshold for risk and comfort for things maybe going a little bit awry"" he added.

The year to 'go big'

A large share —about 37% — of U.S. travelers are planning both international and domestic trips next year according to an upcoming Expedia report on 2022 travel trends. After almost two years of pent-up wanderlust more than two-thirds of American travelers plan to ""go big"" on their next getaway — whether that be taking a once-in-a-lifetime trip abroad or upgrading to a luxury hotel according to the report. Though domestic-only travel plans remain most popular appealing to 59% of U.S. travelers interest in overseas destinations is climbing. G Adventures which offers guided group trips around the world has seen overseas bookings jump nearly 35% so far in November versus the same period in 2019. The company is seeing ""big demand"" for trips to Peru Costa Rica and Morocco according to Benjamin Perlo the company's U.S. managing director.

Flight searches to major European cities have also grown significantly in a short time span — by 65% from Los Angeles to London and 110% from New York to Paris for example between September and October according to Expedia data. Warm-weather hotspots close to the U.S. like the Riviera Maya Cancun Isla Mujeres and Punta Cana have been most popular overall for American tourists traveling in early 2022 according to Expedia. ""I think 2022 will be the year of going big and having some of those bucket-list moments"" Christie Hudson a travel expert at Expedia said.

There are many reasons for consumer optimism. For one Covid vaccination rates are climbing meaning Americans can travel with a relative degree of safety. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which recommends vaccination before traveling internationally authorized shots for children ages 5 to 11 in early November making family trips more feasible. Further travel restrictions are easing. Many countries have re-opened their borders to Americans and dropped policies like mandatory quarantine periods. New Zealand which has had one of the longest Covid-era bans on tourism said Wednesday it would open its borders to vaccinated non-citizens starting April 30. (Testing requirements are still widespread even for vaccinated tourists. Travelers can find country-specific requirements at the U.S. State Department website.)

Some countries have remain closed to American tourists or have yet to drop strict health policies. That's especially true for Asian countries travel experts said. China for example requires Americans to quarantine for at least 14 days at a government-selected facility. Japan isn't allowing any tourism travel. Some travel companies are still erring on the side of U.S. travel. Fodor's Travel for example limited its annual Go List to domestic locations in 2022 due to uncertainties around travel abroad though it added a measure of optimism. ""Like many of you we're still jonesing for international travel"" Fodor's wrote. ""And traveling abroad may still be in the cards for the intrepid. ""If you can travel there safely and responsibly do it — go anywhere in the world"" it added.

Safeguards and flexibility

Travelers should take certain precautions largely in the interest of safeguarding against financial losses. Experts recommend travel insurance which refunds trip costs in the event of a trip cancellation or other unforeseen circumstance. There are different types of policies however. A ""cancel for any reason"" policy is generally the only one that lets travelers recoup funds if they cancel a trip for a Covid-related reason experts said. (Most basic policies don't cover that eventuality.) Even ""cancel for any reason"" options may not offer a full refund though and insurers may require travelers to cancel a day or two ahead of one's trip. It's important to understand a policy's specific conditions before buying. Travelers should also weigh airfare and hotel options that allow for refunds travel credits or changes even if those options cost a little more experts said. ""I think you can feel comfortable booking that October trip to Egypt if you have the insurance in place and maybe booked a flexible flight with airlines"" Modak said. ""Make sure you have the contingency where if things get tough in Egypt you can book the flight for May 2023 without suffering any financial cost."" Many companies have retained extra flexibility relative to their pre-pandemic policies.

Special to USA TODAY

The forecast for your next phone tablet laptop or desktop includes not just a chance of clouds but a choice of them. As in which cloud storage service will you use to back up your files?

The wrong answer is “none.” Any device that will leave your house needs a backup system that doesn’t depend on you remembering to plug it into a drive or another computer once at home. Plus cloud storage vastly eases access to your most important files across all your devices.

But unless you exist entirely in Apple’s orbit you’ll have to choose between cloud services that fit better on some devices than on others.

Here are your options from Apple Google and Microsoft with costs on an annual basis:

Apple’s iCloud+ gives 5 gigabytes of free storage after which you can buy 50GB for $11.88/year 200GB for $35.88/year or 2 terabytes for $119.88/year.

Google One starts with 15GB free then offers 100GB for $19.99/year 200GB for $29.99/year and 2TB for $99.99/year.

Microsoft’s OneDrive provides 5GB free followed by a 100GB tier at $23.88 a year and a 1TB offering at $69.99 a year plus a family plan with 1TB per person for up to six people for $99.99/year.

On Macs iPhones and iPads iCloud+ allows for the simplest backup and now offers such additional privacy features as iCloud Private Relay to cloak your browsing and Hide My Email to create random addresses that forward to your actual email.

In Windows OneDrive provides an equally simple backup of your core data folders as well as the useful extra of Microsoft Office’s apps.

Google’s backup service does not come with add-ons to match Apple and Microsoft’s – but it’s also your only recourse for a Gmail inbox that’s grown beyond your ability to keep it under the 15 GB line.

►How to get it together:5 tips to help you organize your iPhone Android apps and control the chaos

►Unfriending Facebook:How to deactivate or permanently delete your Facebook account

Beyond those three you can also buy cloud storage from the likes of Dropbox where 2TB runs $119.88/year while Amazon Prime subscribers get unlimited Amazon Photos storage; those third-party services however lack their integration with major computing platforms.

My advice: Let the computer that most needs online backup – meaning the device that spends the most time out of the house and holds the most content in need of safekeeping – drive your cloud choice. In my case that device is an HP laptop running Windows 10 so I pay for OneDrive to sync its documents photos and music.

My other advice: Try not to pay list price for cloud storage if you can help it. Credit card cash-back offers such as a targeted American Express 20%-off deal for Google One may trim your costs but you can also often purchase Apple and Google gift cards good for their cloud services at a discount.

For example Target rewards buying a $100 Apple gift card with a $15 gift card Amazon earlier offered a $5 credit for buying a $50 Apple gift card and AARP members can buy $15 Google Play gift cards for $13 through that organization’s AARP Rewards page.

Subscription fatigue is real but chipping away at these expenses is one way to feel less wary about this cost of doing digital business.

Special to the Herald-Tribune

A beachfront mansion on Longboat Key designed in the lavish style of a northern Italian lake home with detailed European influences both outside and inside has come onto the market for the first time. It is being offered by five siblings for the asking price of $10880000 through Judy Kepecz-Hays of Coldwell Banker.

The traditional three-level Italian villa is similar to ones that fringe Lake Como. It has a red tile roof and stucco exterior five bedrooms five full baths and a garage space that can accommodate six cars. Set far back from the road and partially concealed by a low stucco wall and ornamental iron gates the property sits on nearly an acre of land and includes 100 feet of private white sandy beach.

The home was built in 1993 by a retired Vice President of European Sales Operations for Ford of Europe. Queen Elizabeth II conferred on him membership in the Order of the British Empire the OBE in 1969 for services to British exports. His wife was a prize-winning gardener and designer.

They had five children and lived all over the world before deciding to move to Longboat Key and build a year-round large family home that eventually welcomed five children their spouses and 19 grandchildren. The wife passed in 2005 and the husband last summer at age 94. He was an active member of the Audubon Society of Sarasota the Sarasota British Club and he was a well known personality on the island. Since the five children now live in Hawaii and California they have decided it is impractical to keep the Florida estate although they have many wonderful memories of the place they all considered their second home.

“My sister and I both got married at the property” remembered Johanna the eldest daughter. “We had our ceremonies on the beach and the reception around the pool. It was absolutely magical. We all gathered frequently from different parts of the county at the Longboat house for holidays family vacations and family celebrations. I particularly remember us gathering around the fireplace in the living room for photos. I have three decades of photos of us at the fireplace.”

She remembers when the home was built. “There was an architect of record but my parents collaborated with the builder Bill Roberson on the overall design of the house and construction materials” said Johanna. “Our family came to Longboat Key in 1989 when dad and mom bought the lot and cleared it. We rented a house nearby and came to see the 69 pilings that went into the ground for the foundation. Dad insisted on the best quality and safest beachside home that it was possible to build. He was meticulous about the construction and always had such pride of place concerning that property. Everything had to be perfectly maintained. When we made a list of things we had to do before putting the house on the market there was virtually nothing except painting a few rooms to make the color palette consistent throughout the house. Everything else was perfect.”

While her father concentrated on construction materials inside and out her mother was all about the design. “My mother was a talented gardener and a natural designer. In England she finished first in a national competition to design a family home and was honored at the Ideal Home Show at Earls Court Exhibition Centre. It was quite something. When she collaborated to design the Longboat Key house she was inspired by the large homes we used to see in Italy situated on the beautiful lakes. It was my mother’s idea to add the tower to the Longboat house and she designed the front entrance stairs and wanted the paver drive to ground the house visually. And my parents made the most of the water views. Dad was a sailor and we always had a boat. He loved living on the water and being on his boat.”

The master bedroom is on the main living level with access to a private terrace the swimming pool and alfresco dining areas. An elevator and a circular staircase lead to the guest wing on the third floor and offer a split plan with two of the bedrooms/baths and a gallery sitting area that looks down into the living room. The upper level bedrooms have oak floors big windows balconies and French doors.

The kitchen family room and informal eating area are arranged in an open-concept floorpan with expansive views to the outside. The floors are Spanish tile and mahogany framed arched French doors and windows open to the deck swimming pool and the beach. Wrought iron balconies and stairways reference the classic Mediterranean feel of the house. There is a separate library formal living room and formal dining space. The overall character of the interior space is a balance of European elegance and the casualness of a Florida beach house.

The kitchen is white contemporary in styling with dark granite counters and sand-colored glazed tile. Double wall ovens two islands (one for dining one for food preparation) extra storage space double stainless steel sinks and a large double-door refrigerator make cooking for a crowd convenient. The owners liked to entertain family but also European friends and retired Ford Motor executives some of whom had settled in Naples.

“After they retired to Longboat Key my parents took trips but mostly they were absolutely content to live in this house on the beach year round” said their daughter Johanna. “In the evenings my dad loved nothing better that to sit on the deck with a beer in his hand and watch the sunset and the birds. He said he had traveled the world and had now truly had found his paradise and he knew it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yOC9uYXRlLWRhbGVzaW8tY29yay1oYXZlbi1ob3VzZS11cHN0YXRlLW5ldy15b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nate Dalesio completes upstate house covered in corkboard panels,"Architect Nate Dalesio has completed a cork-covered home for himself and his young family in New York reusing the existing foundations but replacing almost the entire building.

Dalesio who also runs the architectural firm Multitude Studio from his home overhauled the house originally built in 1937 in South Salem Westchester County New York State. The abandoned property needed to be almost entirely razed in order to make it habitable.

""The timber framing and the floors were consumed by rot and mold” Dalesio said. “The entire house had to be leveled down to the top of foundation and built anew.”

""The existing footprint was entirely retained while targeted expansions have been used to enlarge the living spaces and bedrooms.""

The single-storey residence is laid out in a T-shaped plan with one arm containing the public areas and kitchen while the other accommodates three bedrooms and two bathrooms.

The completed house encompasses 2500 square feet (232 square metres).

Because of the site's slope the home's entry porch is reached via a flight of stairs. Inside a small vestibule with large built-in storage cabinets and a powder room is separated from the kitchen by a countertop – creating sightlines between the two areas.

The interiors features wide-plank white oak floorboards and white-painted walls. Pitched ceilings that follow the roof profiles give the rooms a spacious feeling and plenty of skylights help brighten the living spaces.

""Vaulted ceilings throughout the home create surprisingly spacious volumes that belie the modest footprint and white oak panelling and floors bring warmth to contrast the crisp and sculptural white walls"" said the architect.

At the back of the home sliding glass doors open out onto a patio.

Dalesio designed the building's exterior to relate to the area's agricultural structures and barns but using a more contemporary and minimal aesthetic.

The previous house on the site had a tin roof and wooden plank siding which were swapped for black corrugated metal and corkboard – a lightweight material made from compressed cork.

The cork offers an additional layer of insulation according to the architect helping to lower the home's heating energy consumption.

""A modest budget of $150 per square foot was stretched to invest in highly insulated walls roofs floors and windows to minimize utility bills and the exterior cladding doubles as a continuous layer of corkboard insulation"" Dalesio said.

Cork is a useful building material as it naturally resists humidity and mildew. It's also light and offers the potential to be recycled after use.

Other projects that incorporcate the material include a home in the Italian countryside by LCA Architetti and an English countryside residence that Matthew Barnett Howland built using of monolithic cork blocks and was shortlisted for the 2021 Stirling Prize.

FRT,Federal Realty,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzI3LzMtZ3JlYXQtcmVpdHMtZm9yLWxvdy1yaXNrLWludmVzdG9ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Great REITs for Low-Risk Investors,"If you are willing to give up yield for safety these REITs are a good way to boost your income while still sleeping at night.

There's a trade-off on Wall Street with which every dividend investor needs to come to terms: risk versus reward. When you see a giant yield it most likely means there's also giant risk involved in the investment. But that doesn't mean you can't find attractive though not giant yields from real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have increased their dividend for decades. Here are three of the best REITs for low-risk investors and each has a yield that's more than twice that of the S&P 500 Index.

1. The king

The undisputed Dividend King of REITs is Federal Realty (FRT) with a huge 54 consecutive annual dividend hikes under its belt. It is the longest streak of any REIT. The current dividend yield is roughly 3.3%. Compared to the S&P 500 Index's 1.3% yield that's pretty generous noting that despite the headwinds this retail landlord saw in pandemic-hit 2020 it still managed to increase its dividend.

The key is that Federal Realty focuses on quality over quantity when it buys strip malls. Indeed with only around 106 properties it's pretty small but the locations are so strong that even during the pandemic downturn it was fielding calls from retailers looking to upgrade from nearby locations. The REIT also puts a lot of effort into redeveloping its assets to maximize the rent they generate and grow its top and bottom lines.

This brings up the most exciting thing here: Federal Realty bought a handful of new properties during the downturn giving it additional growth levers in the years ahead. That includes adding a new region (Phoenix) to its opportunity set.

Federal Realty will never be a really exciting REIT and the yield will rarely be huge but if a slow and steady dividend payer is your speed you'll want to keep an eye on this one.

2. Bigger and better

Realty Income (O 0.70%) is the next REIT up here. The company owns single-tenant net lease properties which means the tenants are responsible for most of the costs of the properties they occupy. Spread over a large portfolio it's a pretty low-risk way to invest in real estate.

This helps explain why Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for more than 25 consecutive years making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The dividend yield is 3.98%. And the dividend is paid monthly which makes it easier to deal with budgeting for those looking to live off of their dividends.

However the most exciting thing right now is that Realty Income has just stepped up its game using its acquisition of VEREIT to increase its portfolio from around 6600 properties to over 10000. In the net lease sector scale provides a number of benefits.

For example the investment-grade rates REIT has access to cheap capital the heft to take on deals that its peers couldn't manage the ability to spread its costs over more properties and enough diversification in its portfolio that no tenant or sector niche should be too problematic even in a downturn.

On that note the REIT increased its dividend four times in 2020. If you want to own the biggest and the best Realty Income has to be on your list.

3. The all-in-one

W.P. Carey (WPC 0.93%) is the last name on this list with a generous yield of 5.4%. While it isn't a Dividend King or a Dividend Aristocrat it has increased its dividend every year since its initial public offering in 1998. And like Realty Income it hiked the payout every quarter in 2020.

The key here is that W.P. Carey which is also a net lease REIT has long been an opportunistic investor putting money to work where it sees the best opportunities. That investment approach has led to a uniquely diversified portfolio spread across the industrial warehouse office retail and self-storage sectors and across geographies with roughly 37% of rents coming from outside the United States (mostly Europe).

It is probably one of the most diversified REITs you can buy which makes it somewhat of a one-stop shop for investors looking to own a single REIT. It doesn't have the scale that Realty Income offers but that hasn't stopped it from achieving a pretty incredible dividend record. And given its generous yield compared to Realty Income and the broader market it looks relatively attractive today.

The ones to own

Federal Realty and Realty Income both tend to be afforded premium prices by investors most of the time. That includes today which means that value-conscious investors will probably find them less than appealing. However if your goal is reliable income from a relatively low-risk investment both are worth a deep dive.

Meanwhile W.P. Carey has been cheaper in the past but still looks pretty attractive given its above-peer dividend yield and strong dividend history. Most income investors will probably find it appealing right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The thin all-transparent solar panels can work as invisible generators for a number of electronic devices.

Solar photovoltaics are the fastest-growing electricity source in the world producing 2% of the world’s energy up from a mere afterthought just a few years ago. Nowadays most commercial solar panels have an efficiency between 15 and 20% although outliers do exist on both sides of this range.

But in most cases you can’t really use solar panels for electronics because of a very simple reason: they’re not transparent.

At first glance transparent solar panels sounds like a contradiction but that’s not necessarily the case. Partially transparent solar panels or other similar devices have been produced in recent years although incorporating them into electronics has remained challenging. This is where the study led by Professor Joondong Kim comes in.

The team claims to have devised the first fully transparent solar cell (as opposed to previous efforts which were not entirely transparent) and can therefore be implemented in electronics with relative ease. The cell’s combination of transparency and conversion of sunlight into energy is achieved through the use of nickel oxide semiconductors and titanium dioxide.

TItanium dioxide (TiO2) is already used in solar panel technology as a semiconductor. It’s not only abundant in the Earth’s crust (unlike other materials used in solar cells) but also non-toxic. Nickel oxide (NiO) on the other hand is also a semiconductor but it has high optical transparency features. Both of these materials are manufactured at low temperatures in existing industrial settings. Together they make for a transparent and eco-friendly solar panel.

However this transparency comes at the cost of efficiency. The power conversion efficiency of the transparent solar panel is 2.1% — much lower than conventional black panels but still significant enough to be used in some applications.

The applications are countless. This technology could be integrated into buildings windows buses even smartphones. This would make solar power more accessible especially in a crowded urban environment where space is scarce. It may be a while before we charge our phones from their very screens but it’s an idea that’s definitely looming on the horizon.

The study has been published in the Journal of Power Sources.

Daryl Wilson Executive Director Hydrogen Council

Sceptics of hydrogen as a source of energy point out the challenges of technology and cost that have bedevilled it in the past. These challenges are real. Green hydrogen is expensive to produce. There is not yet enough renewable energy capacity in the world to generate it at scale. And large electrolysers are relatively untested.

But sceptics miss the point for three reasons. First if we are to survive humanity needs to not just lower carbon emissions but move towards a world of net zero emissions. Second this means a complete transition to renewable energy.

Ford updated the Rangerto the nickel-metal-hydride chemistry for the 1999 model year and through 2002 approximately 1500 trucks were produced. The NiMH battery was rated at 26 translating to 82 miles (132 kilometers) of driving range. The Dacia Spring  which is the most affordable electric vehicle in Europe right now levels up to 27.4 kWh and as many as 230 kilometers (143 miles) on thecombined test cycle.Following the Ranger EV and the appalling Focus Electric produced from 2011 to 2018 the Blue Oval started taking electric vehicles a little more seriously with the Mustang Mach-E. The crossover will be joined by a half-ton pickup next year the F-150 Lightning that comes with dual-motorfrom the get-go for the extremely reasonable price of $40k sans incentives.With Chevrolet GMC Ram and Tesla gunning for the same customers with their upcoming pickups it’s obvious that everyone in the truck-making industry will start electrifying mid-size models in the near future.Enter the all-new Ranger  which is due to enter production in 2022 as a 2023 model. Based on the T6.2 platform that also underpins the Bronco it’s only a matter of time until the Ford Motor Company will present customers with a hybrid option or a plug-in hybrid (or both). Pixel artist SRK Designs took these outcomes to the next level by grafting F-150 Lightning cues to the Ranger including a charging port on the right front fender. The LEDs on the front grille’s accent bar and the closed-off front grille surely bring the point home along with the aero-focused wheels of the full-size workhorse.As to when the Ranger Lightning will become reality it’s pretty hard to guesstimate with the information available right now. But still we do know that FoMoCo is working on two new platforms - the unibody GE2 and body-on-frame TE1 - for next-generation electric vehicles . A Ranger-like silhouette was shown earlier this year at the Delivering Ford+ presentation which is our best clue yet that an electric Ranger is on the horizon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsb2Ryb21lLmNvbS90aGUtc21pdGgtc3lzdGVtLW9mLW5vLWFjY2lkZW50LWRyaXZpbmctZmlsbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1956 Driving Skills Film: The Smith System Of No-Accident Driving,"The Smith System Of No-Accident Driving is a driving skills improvement film funded by the Ford Motor Company and originally released in 1956. All of the lessons in the film are still valid today and taught in defensive driving schools.

Unfortunately many people seem to believe that their driving education comes to an end when they get their license whereas the truth of the matter is that good drivers are on a constant learning curve.

The Smith System Of No-Accident Driving

Aim high in steering.

Get the big picture.

Keep your eyes moving.

Make sure they see you.

Leave yourself an out.

The film has a runtime of just 8 minutes and change so it’s clear it was designed to stay close to the average person’s seven minute attention span – possibly because it was intended to be shown to student drivers in a school setting.

Each of the five elements of The Smith System Of No-Accident Driving are covered individually with clear descriptions and on-screen graphics to help you fully grasp each of them.

The instructor in the film does make more liberal use of his horn than would be advisable in a modern context horns are now seen as highly aggressive so for example you wouldn’t honk at someone before overtaking them as the driver does here.

A feature of the car that is uncommon in EVs is its SolarSky roof which harvests sunlight to create energy for the vehicle. The energy obtained by the roof is used to support the performance of the battery-powered motor and its Extreme version is capable of producing 1500 clean energy miles when fully exposed to sunlight.

Other technologies that the vehicle uses include parking assistance which scans the surrounding area to find a perfectly sized space and then proceeds to park the vehicle with no input from the driver.

Johnson shared on social media video of the moment he stunned Oscar Rodriguez of Los Angeles during a special Thanksgiving theater screening of ""Red Notice.""

In front of a surprised theater crowd Johnson praised Rodriguez for his acts of kindness at church at his job as a personal trainer in his preparation of meals for women who are survivors of domestic violence and in caring for his mother.

""Just an honor for me to give a little bit of joy to a dude who deserves probably a lot more than just my truck"" Johnson said in the video.

Rodriguez was shocked when Johnson gave him the pickup that he called ""his baby"" in the theater parking lot.

""I thought this was your truck bro"" Rodriguez said.

""It is my truck"" Johnson said. ""Now it's your truck.""

The emotional video has millions of views across Instagram and Twitter including at least one from Ford CEO Jim Farley who retweeted Johnson with a personal message.

""Kindness matters. Nice work DJ @TheRock. And thank you for your service @ORodri240 That's a great truck! #F150Raptor"" Farley tweeted.

On Aug. 15 the Taliban left a threatening letter on Ahmad Fanoos’ instrument case warning him and his family to stop playing music or else.

""All your family members are busy with these dirty activities"" the letter read. ""We are warning you for the last time to leave…""

Under Taliban rule music was illegal in Afghanistan in the late '90s. Since then Fanoos rose to fame playing the harmonium and singing Ghazal or Afghan epic poetry. As a talent judge on the TV show ""Afghan Star"" Fanoos became a household name and a target of the Taliban as it retook control of Afghanistan this summer.

OPINION: FROM MY DAD'S DEATH IN AFGHANISTAN 20 YEARS AGO TO TALIBAN RETAKING THE COUNTRY – HOW DID WE GET HERE?

""It was very shocking for him"" Elham Fanous Ahmad’s 24-year-old son said of the Taliban letter. ""He actually couldn’t really focus on the music anymore.""

A renowned Afghan classical pianist in his own right Elham moved to the United States to study in 2015 after his music school was bombed.

Desperate to save his father and remaining family members Elham asked his sponsor Lesley Rosenthal COO of the Juilliard School for help.

""I just racked my brains trying to think how we could help him"" Rosenthal said.

Rosenthal discovered that Fox had a substantial shareholding in Moby Media Group – the television station that aired ""Afghan Star.""

She alerted Fox of the situation and in less than a week Fanoos and five of his family members were evacuated on a plane alongside Fox personnel.

""We asked Fox if they could find some more seats on the plane for the whole family"" Rosenthal said ""and sure enough they brought the whole family of six out into safety into freedom.""

Fanoos filmed the heart-racing escape from Afghanistan and turned it into a music video that pays tribute to religious freedom tolerance and personal responsibility.

""It was very difficult for us … it was very dangerous"" Fanoos told Fox News. ""There was a lot of Taliban at the gate of the airport.""

Fanoos his daughter son-in-law and three grandchildren were hosted in Qatar for the past two months. They arrived in the U.S. on Oct. 29 and just days before Thanksgiving Ahmad and Elham were together again in New York for the first time since 2016.

""We just really hope to represent Afghanistan and Afghan music"" Elham said. ""Afghan music is running in my veins and it’s because of my dad.""

Before leaving Afghanistan Elham studied at the Afghanistan National Institute of Music founded in 2010.

Elham says that without the U.S. military music in Afghanistan would have perished.

""Don’t lose hope. You did a lot"" Elham said of American soldiers who served in Afghanistan some of whom were disheartened by the Taliban takeover. ""Without them I don’t think we would have been here in the United States. I don’t think we would have been musicians.""

Father and son are now on a mission to save Afghan classical music and help the sound evolve with Western influences.

""We’re trying to show that Afghan people can make a positive impact in American society"" Elham said.

""With robotics what we've been able to do is basically run the food back and forth so our wait staff has been able to spend a little bit more time with our guests getting to four to five tables"" Gazitua told FOX Business’ David Asman .

The Florida restaurant added the $1000-a-month robot to improve its efficiency rate and it has been a success.

""The guests love it because they see their server more"" Gazitua added. ""They're able to have a better hospitality experience manicure that table and that's a big win for the server who's actually making more and working less.""

BlackRock has prioritized investments in environmentally and socially conscious companies in the U.S. but has continued to pour money into Chinese companies that don't meet those standards Consumers' Research executive director Will Hild told Fox News.

WATCH:

""It's going woke here in the United States … while it's funneling U.S. investment dollars over to China"" Hild said.

Since China is considered a developing economy and the United States is a developed economy Chinese corporations are subject to less strict guidelines on green and equity initiatives putting American companies at a disadvantage according to Hild.

LARRY FINK'S BLACKROCK TO BENEFIT FROM GOVERNMENT ESG PUSH

Consumers’ Research a nonprofit consumers watchdog group recently kicked off a multimillion-dollar campaign that ""highlights the ties between BlackRock and the Chinese government"" according to its website. The campaign will feature television and billboard ads as well as a digital component.

""BlackRock has nearly 10 trillion in management that's made up of pension funds 401(k)s institutional investments like college endowments"" Hild told Fox News.

Out of all the $103 trillion of assets managed in the world BlackRock manages close to 10%. That's more than Apple Alphabet Amazon Saudi Aramco and Microsoft combined.

""BlackRock treats U.S. corporations completely differently than it treats their Chinese companies and the investments that they make over there"" Hild said.

Democratic mega-donor George Soros recently wrote a similar message in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.

""Pouring billions of dollars into China now is a tragic mistake"" Soros wrote. ""It is likely to lose money for BlackRock’s clients and more important will damage the national security interests of the U.S. and other democracies.""

BlackRock Investment Institute's chief investment strategist Wei Li told the Financial Times in August: ""China is under-represented in global investors’ portfolios.""

""It should be represented more in portfolios"" she said. The institute also recommended increasing allocation to Chinese assets.

""The Chinese market represents a significant opportunity to help meet the long-term goals of investors in China and internationally"" BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter.

The BlackRock China Fund which BlackRock uses to invest in Chinese holdings is valued at around $1.6 billion.

As recently as the past two years BlackRock has invested in Chinese companies that the Commerce Department blacklisted over human rights concerns.

BlackRock holds a $15 million stake in Hikvision and a smaller investment in iFlytek FOX Business previously reported. Both are implicated in China’s persecution of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region. Hikvision is one of the largest surveillance technology manufacturers in the world and iFlytek produces vocal recognition software.

Some of that inspiration came from the iconic pin-up model Betty Grable whose image was stamped across planes barrack walls and even bomber jackets.

Grable became immensely wealthy for her modeling work but the primary currency she enjoyed was the joy she could give America’s troops serving overseas in World War II according to her daughter Victoria Colucci.

Betty Grable expressed what an honor her success was

Colucci shares that Grable considered herself simply “a dancer who could act.” In a career that spanned four decades Colucci says Grable felt that “one of her greatest accomplishments in life was bringing a little happiness to our soldiers” explaining “She would get letters from soldiers and she’d reply. She was proud to help light up the world when it was so dark.”

The dazzling whtie of her bathing suit was part of that light the outfit she donned for one of her most famous photos and the one that ended up traveling with so many soldiers overseas. It was taken by 20th Century Fox studio photographer Frank Powolny. It was he who suggested they take a picture of Grable’s back “just to be different” and she agreed to the change of routine. She tried different poses and “clowned around” in Powolny’s words and just two photos later they had the shot.

A wealth of talent – and money

Betty Grable was born on December 18 1916 and under pressure from her mother worked towards becoming a performer first winning several beauty contests while secretly battling a fear of crowds. None of this showed up on the camera during photoshoots by 1943 when she posed for a promotional picture for the film Sweet Rosie O’Grady.

Instead her image attracted the attention of immense crowds to the point that she surpassed Rita Hayworth as the number one pin-up girl during World War II. As a publicity stunt her studio insured Grable’s legs for $1 million while she herself became both the highest-paid actor in Hollywood and the highest-paid woman in any industry in America earning over $3 million over the course of her career.

The same year that photo was taken Grable married Harry James a trumpeter and bandleader. Together they first had Victoria Elizabeth “Vicki” Bivens in 1944 then Jessica Yahner in 1947. Jessica passed away in 2016. Meanwhile Grable and James’ marriage eroded by 1965 after bouts of infidelity and alcoholism. Grable then dated dancer Bob Remick and the two remained together until her death in 1973. Both Jessica and Victoria observed their mother’s work evidenced by pictures of the two watching her rehearse in the ‘50s.

The current labor shortage dubbed the Great Resignation reached a record high of 4.4 million resignations in September according to the Labor Department’s Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey.

""Welp people quit their jobs and don't want to work anymore.. soooo here ya go.."" commented one person.

""Looks like a lawsuit waiting to happen"" added another.

JOBLESS CLAIMS TUMBLE TO 199000 LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1969

The hospitality robot is provided by Bear Robotics. Founded in May 2017 the company considers itself the brainchild of restaurant experts and tech entrepreneurs. According to a video on the company's Instagram account it joined the Denny's team earlier this month.

""Whether you’re running a diner or curating elite culinary experiences there’s so much hustle behind the scenes. This is not only costly but also puts barriers between your guests servers and the moments that matter"" Bear Robotics' website states. ""By automating the extra work it’s our promise that you’ll see lower turnover less errors better reviews and return customers.""

Although they are few and far between Denny's is not the first restaurant to use a robo-server.

Sergio Restaurant CEO Carlos Gazitua is a huge advocate of the California-based company's product. In an appearance on ""Cavuto: Coast to Coast"" last month Gazitua said it has resulted in bigger tips for better quality service.

""With robotics what we've been able to do is basically run the food back and forth so our wait staff has been able to spend a little bit more time with our guests getting to four to five tables"" Gazitua told FOX Business’ David Asman .

The Florida restaurant added the $1000-a-month robot to improve its efficiency rate and it has been a success.

""The guests love it because they see their server more"" Gazitua added. ""They're able to have a better hospitality experience manicure that table and that's a big win for the server who's actually making more and working less.""

Gazitua said human servers are seeing higher tips and are able to provide better service to their tables thanks to the robots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2I3YWQwYjcwLWE1ZDctNDczZC04ZWY2LTI4Y2Q4Zjk1ZWRkOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to thrive as a mid-life woman in the creative industries,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

BlackRock has prioritized investments in environmentally and socially conscious companies in the U.S. but has continued to pour money into Chinese companies that don't meet those standards Consumers' Research executive director Will Hild told Fox News.

WATCH:

""It's going woke here in the United States … while it's funneling U.S. investment dollars over to China"" Hild said.

Since China is considered a developing economy and the United States is a developed economy Chinese corporations are subject to less strict guidelines on green and equity initiatives putting American companies at a disadvantage according to Hild.

LARRY FINK'S BLACKROCK TO BENEFIT FROM GOVERNMENT ESG PUSH

Consumers’ Research a nonprofit consumers watchdog group recently kicked off a multimillion-dollar campaign that ""highlights the ties between BlackRock and the Chinese government"" according to its website. The campaign will feature television and billboard ads as well as a digital component.

""BlackRock has nearly 10 trillion in management that's made up of pension funds 401(k)s institutional investments like college endowments"" Hild told Fox News.

Out of all the $103 trillion of assets managed in the world BlackRock manages close to 10%. That's more than Apple Alphabet Amazon Saudi Aramco and Microsoft combined.

""BlackRock treats U.S. corporations completely differently than it treats their Chinese companies and the investments that they make over there"" Hild said.

Democratic mega-donor George Soros recently wrote a similar message in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.

""Pouring billions of dollars into China now is a tragic mistake"" Soros wrote. ""It is likely to lose money for BlackRock’s clients and more important will damage the national security interests of the U.S. and other democracies.""

BlackRock Investment Institute's chief investment strategist Wei Li told the Financial Times in August: ""China is under-represented in global investors’ portfolios.""

""It should be represented more in portfolios"" she said. The institute also recommended increasing allocation to Chinese assets.

""The Chinese market represents a significant opportunity to help meet the long-term goals of investors in China and internationally"" BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter.

The BlackRock China Fund which BlackRock uses to invest in Chinese holdings is valued at around $1.6 billion.

As recently as the past two years BlackRock has invested in Chinese companies that the Commerce Department blacklisted over human rights concerns.

BlackRock holds a $15 million stake in Hikvision and a smaller investment in iFlytek FOX Business previously reported. Both are implicated in China’s persecution of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region. Hikvision is one of the largest surveillance technology manufacturers in the world and iFlytek produces vocal recognition software.

""These are companies that were put on a blacklist by the United States government in 2019 … and yet BlackRock sees them as a good investment"" Hild told Fox News.

BlackRock did not respond to a request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZG95b3VyZW1lbWJlci5jb20vMTU2Mjc4L3Bpbi11cC1tb2RlbC1iZXR0eS1ncmFibGUtcHJvdWQtaGVscC1zb2xkaWVyc9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vZG95b3VyZW1lbWJlci5jb20vMTU2Mjc4L3Bpbi11cC1tb2RlbC1iZXR0eS1ncmFibGUtcHJvdWQtaGVscC1zb2xkaWVycy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pin-Up Bombshell Betty Grable Was Proud To Bring Joy To Soldiers Daughter Says,"As soldiers trekked across the globe into the brutality of war they carried tokens to keep up morale. Some of that inspiration came from the iconic pin-up model Betty Grable whose image was stamped across planes barrack walls and even bomber jackets.

Grable became immensely wealthy for her modeling work but the primary currency she enjoyed was the joy she could give America’s troops serving overseas in World War II according to her daughter Victoria Colucci.

Betty Grable expressed what an honor her success was

Colucci shares that Grable considered herself simply “a dancer who could act.” In a career that spanned four decades Colucci says Grable felt that “one of her greatest accomplishments in life was bringing a little happiness to our soldiers” explaining “She would get letters from soldiers and she’d reply. She was proud to help light up the world when it was so dark.”

The dazzling whtie of her bathing suit was part of that light the outfit she donned for one of her most famous photos and the one that ended up traveling with so many soldiers overseas. It was taken by 20th Century Fox studio photographer Frank Powolny. It was he who suggested they take a picture of Grable’s back “just to be different” and she agreed to the change of routine. She tried different poses and “clowned around” in Powolny’s words and just two photos later they had the shot.

A wealth of talent – and money

Betty Grable was born on December 18 1916 and under pressure from her mother worked towards becoming a performer first winning several beauty contests while secretly battling a fear of crowds. None of this showed up on the camera during photoshoots by 1943 when she posed for a promotional picture for the film Sweet Rosie O’Grady.

Instead her image attracted the attention of immense crowds to the point that she surpassed Rita Hayworth as the number one pin-up girl during World War II. As a publicity stunt her studio insured Grable’s legs for $1 million while she herself became both the highest-paid actor in Hollywood and the highest-paid woman in any industry in America earning over $3 million over the course of her career.

The same year that photo was taken Grable married Harry James a trumpeter and bandleader. Together they first had Victoria Elizabeth “Vicki” Bivens in 1944 then Jessica Yahner in 1947. Jessica passed away in 2016. Meanwhile Grable and James’ marriage eroded by 1965 after bouts of infidelity and alcoholism. Grable then dated dancer Bob Remick and the two remained together until her death in 1973. Both Jessica and Victoria observed their mother’s work evidenced by pictures of the two watching her rehearse in the ‘50s.

Younger women on the other hand use fewer services but spend more hours streaming"" Skogen added.The companies should now assess streaming TV campaign objectives which may include maximising reach extending mainstream TV ad buys or scaling performance-oriented digital advertising objectives.""Marketing leaders must learn to navigate this fluid high growth medium in order to deliver TV ads efficiently and effectively"" said Schmitt.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL25ld3MvY3Jhc2gtY2xvc2VzLXUtcy05NS1pbi1ueWUtY291bnR5LW5lYXItYW1hcmdvc2EtdmFsbGV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Authorities: Man 2 kids killed in DUI-related crash in Nye County near Amargosa Valley,"NYE COUNTY (KTNV) — Authorities are investigating a deadly multi-vehicle crash where three people died Sunday afternoon in Nye County.

1. Itapemirim is highlighted in the media with several events in a row in a few days

In a busy week for the company Itapemirim Transportes Aéreos entered the media spotlight with good and bad news.

In the first days of the week the Labor Court granted an injunction in a collective action filed by the SNA against Itapemirim Transportes Aéreos to determine the immediate reestablishment of the payment of food allowances and food vouchers to the crew.

The SNA also filed a collective action to demand the regularization of salary payments and FGTS deposits – there is still no decision by the Court.

Soon after we published an excellent court decision for the airline which authorized the auction located in Cachoeiro do Itapemirim (ES) the complex was the first garage of the company that was founded in 1953.

The land of 689.252m² is valued at R$ 132 million and could mean a good injection of cash into the company's cash despite currently being one of the main operational bases of Viação Itapemirim. See more about this topic Clicking here.

The company also activated another new aircraft for the fleet. The Airbus A320 registration PS-MGF arrived in Brazil in mid-October but has been undergoing maintenance at Digex in São José dos Campos since then. The aircraft entered the network already performing international flights to Uruguay and replacing the PS-AAF which has been undergoing maintenance since November 15th.

Tiago Senna announced last Wednesday (24/11) his departure from Itapemirim. In recent months the executive was acting as vice-president of new business for the Itapemirim Group but had an important role in the founding of ITA Air Transport.

The company's 5th plane an Airbus A320 has the license plate in honor of Tiago Senna containing the initials of the executive's name: PS-TCS. Tiago will now concentrate his efforts on his new company Senna Investimentos e Participações.

Since the 25th of November Itapemirim Transportes Aéreos has started to work with its network adapted to carry out its first international operations. These are made up of 34 chartered flights in both directions excluding the operations of returning aircraft and sending them to Montevideo Uruguay.

The chartered flights transported supporters who watched the Libertadores final in Uruguay.

The planes take off from the São Paulo-Guarulhos and Rio de Janeiro-Galeão airports to Montevideo Uruguay to take and pick up Brazilian fans who will follow the Copa Libertadores final between Flamengo and Palmeiras. The flights were contracted by a tourism agency.

However these flights caused a disturbance in the airline's regular network which in the last two days (Friday and Saturday) now has only one aircraft to fulfill frequencies to 13 destinations. Logically many complaints have arisen from passengers who have had their flights canceled since Thursday or who took off too late.

This Saturday morning (27/11) four of the company's A320 aircraft were spotted on the patio at Carrasco International Airport (MVD) the PS-ITA PS-MGF PS-SFC and PS-TCS all A320 arrived in the Uruguayan capital (MVD) from Galeão (GIG).

Considering that the PS-AAF is still undergoing maintenance and the PS-SIL (7th aircraft in the fleet) is still undergoing adaptations. We can consider that the company once again destined 80% of its aircraft fleet for flights to Uruguay.

During last Friday (26/11) the Airports of Belo Horizonte (CNF) Curitiba Florianópolis Fortaleza Salvador did not receive any flights from the airline throughout the day. The airports of Brasília Rio de Janeiro Congonhas(SP) Guarulhos(SP) Porto Seguro and Recife received one or two operations from the company throughout the day.

2. FAB officially receives FOUR Gripen E fighters in Sweden

Last Wednesday (24) Saab unveiled the first six series Gripen E fighters. The Swedish manufacturer has entered the phase of delivering four fighter jets to the Brazilian Air Force and two to the Swedish Air Force.

At last Wednesday's ceremony the Saab presented the first six production Gripen four Brazilians and two Swedes. In addition to the Commander of the FAB the President and CEO of Saab Micael Johansson the senior vice president and head of the business area of ​​Saab Aeronautics Jonas Hjelm and Major General Edström were also present.

The four F-39s delivered are the FAB's first operational units and will enter service with the 1st Air Defense Group the Jaguar Squadron at Anápolis Air Base.

The FAB acquired 36 Gripens 28 of which were one-seat F-39Es and eight two-seat F-39Fs. Sweden on the other hand bought 60 fighters all single-seat JAS-39Es. The Gripen E also competes with other aircraft in the Canada Finland e Philippines.

3. Pilots and stewards threaten to go on strike but this was canceled

Pilots and flight attendants voted in recent weeks to establish a strike on November 29 (Monday) due to the lack of agreement with the airlines on the renewal of the Collective Bargaining Agreement for regular aviation.

Without a guarantee of provisional maintenance of the current CCT by the airlines several crucial rules would cease to apply on December 1st including some that directly reflect on the physical psychological and technical conditions of the crew.

The category only claimed a salary adjustment that includes the replacement of inflationary losses in the last two years — INPC from December 1 2019 to November 30 2021.

However this Saturday an emergency meeting was held with the TST (Superior Labor Court) ending with the discussion about the crew strike.

The TST's proposal provides for an immediate readjustment of 75% of the INPC for the last 12 months in the fixed and variable part of the salary; 100% of the INPC for the last 12 months in national food allowances and food allowance/ceiling. In addition it provides for the full renewal of the other social clauses without changes.

With the approval of the proposal the crew strike from November 29th is cancelled.

4. LATAM manages to present its Judicial Recovery Plan which provides for an injection of BRL 46 billion and zero debt in Brazil

After a hectic week LATAM presented this Friday (26) its Judicial Reorganization Plan to the US court which is governing the airline's Chapter 11 (Judicial Reorganization) process.

The company which in Brazil leads the domestic aviation market with a good advantage predicts that it will leave the RJ regime in 2022 if the creditors and justice approve the company's plan.

The hearing to approve the adequacy of the Chapter 11 Disclosure Statement and voting procedures is scheduled to be held in January 2022 with a specific timing that will depend on the Court.

The Plan proposes the injection of US$ 819 billion ao group through a combination of new equity convertible bonds and debt which will allow the group to exit Chapter 11 with adequate capitalization to execute its business plan.

Upon exit LATAM is expected to have total debt of approximately US$726 billion and liquidity of approximately US$267 billion.

5. Another new Cessna Grand Caravan from Azul Conecta lands in Brazil

This week Azul Linhas Aéreas received another Cessna Grand Caravan for the fleet of its subregional airline Azul Conecta. The aircraft registered PS-CNB left the USA last Saturday the 20th making nine stopovers before landing in Brazil on the 25th of November.

The new aircraft model is more modern more efficient in terms of fuel consumption in addition to being quieter when compared to previous versions.

Known for its performance in any difficult situation the C208B can carry 9 passengers on board and can be quickly converted to transport cargo with a capacity to carry approximately 1600 kg.

The company also recently received another two new Grand Caravans in October to expand its subregional fleet of aircraft. With these three new planes the company will have 20 aircraft in its fleet.

9. LATAM changes rules for transporting animals in the cabin and hold of aircraft

A LATAM Airlines modified its rules for the transport of animals on its flights the sale of tickets for the transport of pets is currently suspended. The airline is restructuring all conditions and rules for this service.

At first LATAM will continue to suspend the transport of animals until December 15th. After the suspension the new rules for transport will come into effect.

The minimum age for animals to be transported will increase from the current 8 weeks to 16 weeks from two to four months respectively. The change will also be applied to the transport box both for transport in the passenger cabin and in the hold of aircraft.

The new rule for boarding in the passenger cabin will allow the boarding of pets only in a flexible bag or in a box with rigid plastic.

For boarding in the hold of the aircraft via LATAM Cargo the pet must be boarded in a transport box made of fiberglass rigid plastic or wood. In the case of large animals it will be necessary to test the transport box of the model 82.

10. GOL starts to fire employees for lack of vaccinations

On November 19 GOL Linhas Aéreas fired at least two of the company's employees who had not been vaccinated with immunizations against covid-19.

Employees were removed from the company for just cause that is without their guaranteed labor rights.

The company's attitude was carried out after the Minister of the Federal Supreme Court (STF) Luís Roberto Barroso suspended the ordinance of the Ministry of Labor which prohibited the dismissal of workers for lack of vaccination against Covid-19.

During the months of September and October the GOL further intensified its internal campaign to raise awareness and encourage vaccination reinforcing the importance of immunization among all employees. More than 99% of employees are currently vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine against Covid-19.

The subject dominated the aviation market and the SNA took a position to file a lawsuit against the dismissals.

You can also check whether this move by GOL is legal according to the law in an article we published in Ivan Dilly's column on the Aeroflap Portal. Click Here to read about this topic.

Using federated learning (FL) participating institutions hope to bring on-board more collaborators and expedite the execution of large-scale research without the encumberment caused by the current need to share data.

The investigators will utilize multi-modal data—including CT scans cinematic renderings and laboratory test results—to create AI models that accelerate diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). When diagnosed earlier the likelihood of survival is substantially higher. The researchers hope to enable earlier diagnosis and tailoring of more precise treatment. Participating institutions include Johns Hopkins Medicine MD Anderson Cancer Center Dana-Farber Cancer Institute University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and City of Hope National Medical Center.

“One of the biggest challenges in pancreatic research is accessing the large datasets required to come to scientific conclusions” said Elliot Fishman M.D. professor of radiology surgery oncology and urology at Johns Hopkins Hospital. “No one institution can do it alone. Cross-institutional collaboration is essential to changing the trajectory for pancreatic cancer patients and federated learning makes it possible for multiple researchers to utilize relevant data while always protecting privacy and without creating additional administrative or ‘IT burden’.”

With federated learning artificial intelligence models are trained using data from disparate sources - without sharing or aggregating data. This protects privacy facilitates access to more diverse datasets and makes it easier for medical researchers and AI developers around the world to collaborate. Rhino Health has partnered with NVIDIA and is leveraging its technology in the Rhino Health Platform - an end-to-end federated learning solution that makes it possible for researchers to quickly get a project up and running and easily add collaborators.

“Rhino Health is putting the power of federated learning in the hands of leading medical researchers building on the industry-leading capabilities made possible by NVIDIA technology” said Mona Flores M.D. head of medical AI at NVIDIA. “This platform approach is very aligned with our vision for the future of federated learning which we believe will fundamentally change how healthcare AI is developed and deployed.”

“To realize the transformative promise of healthcare AI in the early detection of pancreatic cancer - and more broadly across the practice of radiology - we need to collectively adopt common standards and principles in managing and utilizing data” said Eugene Koay M.D. Ph.D. associate professor Department of GI Radiation Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center. “Together medical researchers and industry are doing this and federated learning helps to ensure we’re keeping observations in context maintaining high-quality data and collaborating in a very transparent manner that ultimately serves patients.”

EDRN backed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is a consortium of more than 300 investigators at academic institutions and in the private sector working to discover develop and validate biomarkers and imaging methods to detect early-stage cancers and to assess risk for developing cancer and to translate these biomarkers and imaging methods into clinical tests.

“Translating research findings into clinical practice requires assurance that an AI model will work consistently across today’s increasingly diverse real-world patient populations” said Michael Rosenthal M.D. Ph.D. assistant professor of radiology Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “This means we need to be utilizing diverse datasets from the early stages of research and federated learning is critical to providing globally relevant generalizable methods of finding pancreatic cancer earlier.”

Several of the Principal Investigators in this pilot project will present their work and the intended collaboration with Rhino Health during a virtual industry presentation at the upcoming annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). The session will take place online on Tuesday Nov. 30 from 12:15–1:15 p.m. CT titled “Accelerating AI: How Federated Learning Can Protect Privacy Facilitate Collaboration and Improve Outcomes.”

“We are humbled by the ingenuity and dedication of these leading physicians and scientists who are revolutionizing clinical medicine using artificial intelligence” said Ittai Dayan M.D. cofounder and CEO of Rhino Health. “For that they need to be able to collaborate effectively and efficiently using a common platform and without the risk of patient privacy breach. We hope that Rhino Health’s ‘Federated Learning as a Platform’ solution will be a useful tool at their disposal and help accelerate the impact of healthcare AI.”

To complement its new OS Aidoc added FDA-cleared solutions from five third-party AI companies to its existing selection of seven FDA-cleared solutions. These solutions expand its coverage across imaging subspecialties wherein the AI OS provides each sub-specialty with a seamless user experience in their native workflow.

“When people think about the concept of a platform some think of an 'app store’ for healthcare institutions to discover and plug in AI solutions” said Paul Chang M.D. vice-chair of Radiology Informatics at the University of Chicago. “This sounds attractive but merely centralizing and providing an online shopping experience isn’t enough of a value proposition. A true platform must be based on a unified architecture that enables effective use of the various AI products in the challenging real-life IT settings of health systems. In other words what's so compelling about the app store isn't the app store itself but actually the infrastructure it's built upon—the iOS. That is exactly what Aidoc's AI OS solves for.”

According to a 2021 survey of U.S. hospitals 90% of hospitals have an AI strategy in place—up from 53% in 2019—yet implementation lags behind with only 34% deploying an AI solution. As these strategies are introduced at the dawn of AI in healthcare many existing AI “marketplaces” lack the true unifying quality required to integrate and orchestrate multiple AI solutions—at scale and seamlessly—due to the technical limitations imposed by vendor incompatibilities. Aidoc’s AI OS helps solve these technical barriers of using AI at scale by orchestrating a diverse set of AI solutions under one unified vendor-agnostic operating system. The OS applies unique AI-based image analysis to match the most compatible algorithm with the relevant scan and ensure improved quality of care.

Aidoc’s comprehensive suite of AI includes solutions for triage and detection of acute patients and AI-driven cross-specialty workflows facilitating care coordination. Along with seven FDA-cleared solutions for intracranial hemorrhage acute C-spine fractures intra-abdominal free gas rib fractures large vessel occlusions and pulmonary embolism on both dedicated and non-dedicated (incidental) exams the Aidoc OS platform integrates AI solutions from Imbio Riverain Icometrix Subtle Medical and ScreenPoint Medical together covering a variety of radiology subspecialties and imaging enhancements.

“We’ve come to understand the challenge of implementing AI while deploying AI modules into hundreds of hospitals for which we faced a diversity of IT systems and workflows” said Michael Braginsky CTO of Aidoc. “While overcoming the internal challenges with our own algorithms we were forced to develop an AI operating system that can run effectively in any clinical setting and we did so with one question in mind ‘How do we bring value to the providers?’ I’m thrilled to say that more and more companies who’ve developed amazing solutions are operating on our OS and we are proud to enable them to greatly impact patient care.”

The smoke fed by the seasonal burning of crops in northern India was causing levels of the toxic particle PM 2.5 to spike a trend residents could track in real time on the Global Environment Monitoring System for Air (GEMS Air) website.

By early November GEMS Air showed that concentrations of PM 2.5 outside New Delhi’s iconic India Gate were ‘hazardous’ to human health. In an industrial area north of the Indian capital the air was 50 times more polluted.

GEMS Air is one of several new digital tools used by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to track the state of the environment in real time at the global national and local levels. In the years to come a digital ecosystem of data platforms will be crucial to helping the world understand and combat a host of environmental hazards from air pollution to methane emissions say experts.

“Various private and public sector actors are harnessing data and digital technologies to accelerate global environmental action and fundamentally disrupt business as usual” says David Jensen the coordinator of UNEP’s digital transformation task force.

“These partnerships warrant the attention of the international community as they can contribute to systemic change at an unprecedented speed and scale.”

The world is facing what United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has called a triple planetary crisis of climate change pollution and biodiversity loss. Experts say averting those catastrophes and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require fundamentally transforming the global economy within a decade. It’s a task that would normally take generations. But a range of data and digital technologies are sweeping the planet with the potential to promote major structural transformations that will enhance environmental sustainability climate action nature protection and pollution prevention.

A new age

UNEP is contributing to that charge through a new programme on Digital Transformation and by co-championing the Coalition for Digital Environmental Sustainability as part of the Secretary-General’s Digital Cooperation Roadmap.

UNEP studies show that for 68 per cent of the environment-related Sustainable Development Goal indicators there is not enough data to assess progress. The digital initiatives leverage technology to halt the decline of the planet and accelerate sustainable finance products services and lifestyles.

GEMS air was among the first of those programmes. Run by UNEP and Swiss technology company IQAir it is the largest air pollution network in the world covering some 5000 cities. In 2020 over 50 million users accessed the platform and its data is being streamed into digital billboards to alert people about air quality risks in real time. In the future the program aims to extend this capability directly into mobile phone health applications.

Building on lessons learned from GEMS Air UNEP has developed three other lighthouse digital platforms to showcase the power of data and digital technologies including cloud computing earth observation and artificial intelligence.

Managing freshwater

One is the Freshwater Ecosystem Explorer which provides a detailed look at the state of lakes and rivers in every country on Earth.

The fruit of a partnership between UNEP the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and Google Earth Engine it provides free and open data on permanent and seasonal surface waters reservoirs wetlands and mangroves.

“It is presented in a policy-friendly way so that citizens and governments can easily assess what is actually happening to the world’s freshwater resources” says Stuart Crane a UNEP freshwater expert. “That helps countries track their progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal Target 6.6.”

Data can be visualized using geospatial maps with accompanying informational graphics and downloaded at national sub-national and river basin scales. Data are updated annually and depict long-term trends as well as annual and monthly records on freshwater coverage.

Combating climate change

UNEP is also using data-driven decision making to drive deep reductions in methane emissions through the International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO). Methane is a potent greenhouse gas responsible for at least a quarter of today’s global warming.

The observatory is designed to shine a light on the origins of methane emissions by collecting data from various sources including satellites ground-based sensors corporate reporting and scientific studies.

The Global Methane Assessment published by UNEP and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) found that cutting human-caused methane by 45 per cent this decade would avoid nearly 0.3°C of global warming by the 2040s and help prevent 255000 premature deaths 775000 asthma-related hospital visits and 26 million tonnes of crop losses globally.

“The International Methane Emissions Observatory supports partners and institutions working on methane emissions reduction to scale-up action to the levels needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change” says Manfredi Caltagirone a UNEP methane emissions expert.

Through the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 the methane observatory works with petroleum companies to improve the accuracy and transparency of methane emissions reporting. Current member companies report assets covering over 30 per cent of oil and gas production globally. It also works with the scientific community to fund studies that provide robust publicly available data.

Preserving nature

UNEP is also backing the United Nations Biodiversity Lab 2.0 a free open-source platform that features data and more than 400 maps highlighting the extent of nature the effects of climate change and the scale of human development. Such spatial data help decision-makers put nature at the heart of sustainable development by allowing them to visualize the natural systems that hold back natural disasters store planet-warming gasses like carbon dioxide and provide food and water to billions.

More than 61 countries have accessed data on the UN Biodiversity Lab as part of their national reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity an international accord designed to safeguard wildlife and nature. Version 2.0 of the lab was launched in October 2021 as a partnership between UNDP UNEP’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre the Convention on Biodiversity Secretariat and Impact Observatory.

All of UNEP’s digital platforms are being federated into UNEP’s World Environment Situation Room a digital ecosystem of data and analytics allowing users to monitor progress against key environmental Sustainable Development Goals and multi-lateral agreements at the global regional and national levels.

“The technical ability to measure global environmental change—almost in real time—is essential for effective decision making” says Jensen.

“It will have game-changing implications if this data can be streamed into the algorithms and platforms of the digital economy where it can prompt users to make the personal changes so necessary to preserving the natural world and achieving net zero.”

Not only that it also doubled the frame-rate on select Xbox 360 titles that had already received enhanced 4K support for Xbox One X. Spurred on by the addition of FPS Boost to one of my favourite Sonic games I decided to take a look at some of these improved experiences gaining further appreciation for some classic titles.

In doing so it reminded me of something I hadn't thought deeply about for some time - the fact that the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era actually delivered what must surely be the biggest gen-on-gen downgrade in overall game performance... if you ignore Nintendo 64 that is. In looking at these newly enhanced FPS Boost releases I also decided to go back and revisit their showings on Xbox 360 too - because Series consoles aren't just delivering a doubling of performance but often much much more. Standard back-compat on Xbox Series consoles effectively solves their original performance issues - they hit their (mostly) 30fps frame-rate caps. However FPS Boost goes one step further reminding us that 60fps used to be the norm not the exception.

I wanted to start by looking at both Sonic Generations (which now possesses both resolution and frame-rate upgrades) and Sonic Unleashed (60fps only). I love Generations: while it may not reach the heights of the 2D originals I feel this represents the best example of three-dimensional Sonic gameplay to date. The boost style of gameplay retains the upper middle and lower tier design Sonic specialises in really testing your reaction time. It's this combination of high-speed movement multiple paths that feel satisfying to nail and the perfect blend of beautiful visuals and excellent music. It's an explosion of colour and style that manages to hold up brilliantly to this day.

The problem is in its original console form Sonic Generations was limited to just 30 frames per second and even that was not a guaranteed target. In fact during certain sections the frame-rate plummets to near unplayable levels. It feels terrible when this occurs. A PC version exists but I've found it has become increasingly finicky when you desire a quick play session.

Sonic Generations previously received a resolution boost update bringing it up to near 4K basically around 3520x2160 versus the 880x720-ish of the original but it was still limited to 30 frames per second. This is where FPS Boost enters the picture - when played on Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S the frame-rate cap is eliminated allowing the game to reach 60 frames per second. Xbox Series X retains the near 4K resolution enjoyed by One X while Xbox Series S renders around 1760x1440. Areas where Xbox 360 could collapse in performance sees Series X power through with barely any impact to frame-rate - just a couple of dropped frames in some scenarios flawless in others. Series S does the same just with a lower resolution.

Honestly playing through the game again it's a miracle that this was even possible on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in the first place. Sonic moves extremely quickly in this game - you cover a lot of ground in a matter of seconds. The Hedgehog Engine powering the game was architected to handle high-speed traversal while retaining a high level of detail and it genuinely works - it looks great even now. More impressively it features pre-calculated global illumination combined with the exceptional depth of field and per-pixel motion blur used to accentuate movement.

Of course the same can be said of Sonic Unleashed as well which - with support for FPS Boost - is perhaps even more important as this is a game which had never received a PC conversion. Unfortunately there is no resolution enhancement here so we're still running at 880x720 but in light of the improved frame-rate we can let that slide. Again there can be drastic drops to performance - one of the last levels Adabat is notorious for this - but Series X just blasts through with just small fleeting drops in the entire segment. Series S? I would have loved to tried it but there was no way to move my late-game save to the machine short of re-buying a game I already owned in disc form - a shortcoming of the machine we have to live with unfortunately.

I also tried Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed - one of the best kart racers of all-time. It plays like a dream serves as excellent Sega fan service and offers multiple modes of play keeping the tracks especially fresh. But a karting game at 30fps? That's a problem but not with FPS Boost. Resolution hasn't been improved - we're still at the original's low 1152x544 but the performance side of things is now resolved running without a hitch. If you like racing games I highly recommend this one - it's really good.

As a big fan of Sonic games that was my primary focus for this testing - it's a series that gains so much by running at 60 frames per second with 30fps never seemingly like a good fit. However elsewhere other titles also benefit immensely. Fallout 3 ran at 720p with 4x MSAA on Xbox 360 but suffered due to CPU GPU and storage bottlenecks. Certain choke-points within the game could see frame-rates dip into the teens. However with Xbox Series consoles you retain the clean MSAA anti-aliasing but we're rendering at 4K on Series X and 1440p on Series S with 60fps performance to boot. Storage stutter is gone with only mild hits to performance that line-up with Xbox 360 at its absolute worst. Again it's a transformative experience.

I'd also recommend trying out Mirror's Edge an original first-person platform game built around the idea of free running. While it has some combat sequences the game is primarily focused on fluid movement. Mirror's Edge isn't afraid to challenge the player with complex controls either - it's a very technical game which is precisely why it remains so playable. As you become more skilled you'll find yourself effortlessly moving through the world on the way to your objective. On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 however the game was marred by poor performance. It was capped at 30 frames per second but both consoles failed to lock to this frame-rate often dipping below while exhibiting screen tearing. As a result many of the game's more impressive sequences were ultimately spoiled by reduced performance. A PC version which included more advanced physics simulation solved this problem but on consoles we were left with no options.

Mirror's Edge received Xbox One X support years ago at this point increasing the resolution to 4K and solving the performance dips but it remained capped at 30fps on Series consoles - but not any more thanks to FPS Boost. Critically like Fallout 3 and Sonic Mirror's Edge retains the same high-resolution output - which is native 4K on Xbox Series X and 1440p on Series S - but increases the frame-rate to 60. The results aren't flawless however with dips into the mid-50s. This seems to occur in nearly every mission at some point or another but thankfully the drop is minor enough that it has only a minor impact on overall fluidity. If you have access to a VRR capable display the issue is cleaned up as well so keep that in mind. The result is fascinating however and does help demonstrate why some games lose Xbox One X enhancements when FPS Boost is enabled. But honestly they've made the right choice here as aside from these small pockets of disturbed frames the rest of the experience is fluid - and there's vastly improved loading times too.

I was also intrigued by Gears of War 3 Epic's last title in the franchise and a brilliant Xbox 360 experience. Performance was always variable in this series and while Gears 3 improved over its predecessor it still had issues maintaining 30fps - especially in cutscenes. Xbox One X got a 4K upgrade but curiously FPS Boost comes at a cost to Series X owners this time around. Curiously both Series S and X both render the game at 1440p instead - unexpected to say the least. I'd expect Series S to have a less solid lock on 60fps and that is indeed the case but these moments are limited to cutscenes only. Gameplay seems to be absolutely fine. It is more stable overall than Mirror's Edge and I found it difficult to locate areas where the performance did not maintain its target. Series X simply delivers a locked 1440p60 experience as you would expect... which makes me wonder why they needed to reduce the resolution to 1440p in the first place especially given the performance on Xbox Series S. Did the team run into some unexpected bug? Did the performance degrade significantly? I'm genuinely unsure but that's how it is. Overall though FPS Boost is a winner and in actual fact all of the Gears titles now run at 60fps - it's just that Gears 3 is the only series entry to receive the resolution boost too.

Dark Souls 3 FPS Boost: Xbox Series X vs Series S/ Series S vs Xbox One S It wasn't the most transformative improvement we've seen owing to a locked 900p resolution but Dark Souls 3 demonstrated that Microsoft would try out different techniques to make FPS Boost possible.Watch on YouTube

I also wanted to check out the original Assassin's Creed. It's a game with issues for sure but at the time the concepts presented by this game were truly revolutionary - an open world assassination game focused on the minutiae of this brutal career path. Assassin's Creed could have become what Hitman is today on a much grander scale had the chips fallen just right but alas the series never quite managed to build on what was started in this first game pivoting in a very different direction from Origins onwards. The technology however was special for its day with a highly dynamic animation blending system that enabled a level of fluidity in traversal that was simply unheard of during this era. Not to mention a size and scope unlike anything else - it was a supremely impressive experience.

On Xbox 360 the game runs at a native 720p with 2x MSAA delivering clean results. It uses an adaptive v-sync setup meaning torn frames can occur when under load. It's not too bad on the Xbox 360 though the PlayStation 3 version is nigh unplayable in comparison in many scenarios. With the launch of Xbox One X Assassin's received 4K enhancements allowing a boost to 4K native - this also introduced other improvements such as improved texture filtering and enhanced shadow rendering. It looked much more in line with the PC version as a result. Thanks to FPS Boost however the frame-rate cap has been pushed up to 60 frames per second instead and the results are impressive. Only the most minor dips to performance and this combined with the image boosts makes for a great way to revisit the game.

It's been fun revisiting these titles and despite comments from Microsoft suggesting that the FPS Boost program has reached its conclusion I can't help but think there's more juice left in the classic Xbox 360 catalogue. This is important stuff: the Xbox compatibility team is effectively rescuing games from their performance prisons - breathing new life into titles which could sometimes be rendered borderline unplayable at points. Adding the resolution increases on top can also be transformative.

And if it’s one thing that they don’t have in their lineup which comprises electric vehicles too that’s a two-door luxury coupe.

Such a model would inevitably take up the space left by the demised Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe  and while it may not exist in the real world it does in the digital realm. Abimelec Design is behind these renderings that imagine what a hypothetical two-door variant of the Genesis G90 would look like.The front end design complete with the big grille and split headlamps is identical to that of the sedan  up to the doors that stretch further back. The rear quarter panels had to be readjusted as well and a Genesis badge adorns the C pillars. Look at the rear end and you will see that it has remained untouched. The same goes for the wheels and pretty much everything else too.In order to improve ingress and egress at the back the digital illustrations portray the car registered in sunny California with no visible B pillars. Nonetheless as the artist chose not to open the doors at all you will have to use your imagination for that. And while the blacked-out windows with chrome surrounds don’t exactly help at least you can partially see the interior in one of the pics.Now while certain people spent time rearranging the pixels of the current G90 Genesis has been working on the new generation. Camouflaged prototypes of the company’s BMW 7 Series Audi A8 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class fighter have been spied in different environments looking more evolutionary than revolutionary.

Photo Credit: Lauren Allen

Actor Nicholas Alexander Chavez of “General Hospital” chatted with Digital Journal’s Markos Papadatos about working with Maurice Benard and winning “Favorite Newcomer” at the 2021 Soap Hub Awards.

As Digital Journal reported Chavez won the “Favorite Newcomer” Award at the fan-voted Soap Hub Awards for his portrayal of Spencer Cassadine on the ABC daytime drama “General Hospital.” “That was amazing” he exclaimed.

“That was so cool” he admitted. “I loved getting to go on the talk show ‘The Talk.’ It is incredible to receive a fan award like that because it means that the fans are responding to what is happening on-screen. In many ways a fan award can be more meaningful than a merit-based award that you would get from critics. This means the world to me since it tells me that the fans are really enjoying the program.”

“I am just so thankful that the fans are responding to the work that I am doing on-screen and I look forward to giving them many more performances to enjoy” Chavez added.

Working with Maurice Benard

Chavez opened up about doing the moving “Tough Love” scene with Maurice Benard who plays Sonny Corinthos and is affectionately known as “the godfather of Port Charles.” “Maurice is a great actor” he said. “It is easy to see why the fans love Maurice so much and it’s easy to see why he won the ‘Best Actor’ Daytime Emmy Award this year. Maurice is incredible and he has been doing this for a long time.”

“I take notes each time that I am working with Maurice since I’m getting a masterclass with him every time that I have a scene with him” Chavez added.

Working with Marcus Coloma

Most recently Chavez had an intense scene with Marcus Coloma who plays his on-screen father Nikolas Cassadine which earned rave reviews from fans and critics alike. “The scene that I did with Marcus on the pier was really good. I liked that one and it was fun” Chavez said.

“I think Spencer is slowly but surely figuring things out for himself” he said. “It is great that Spencer is establishing his independence lately.”

Working with Avery Kristen Pohl

Chavez continued to compliment co-star Avery Kristen Pohl for playing his onscreen girlfriend Esme Prince. “Avery is an amazing actress and I think it’s hard for Spencer to not be suspicious of her” he said.

“Spencer has his own plan for all of this and he’s very perceptive because he needs to stay a step ahead of everyone in order to thrive in Port Charles so he needs to pay attention to details” he added.

GH Fantasy Zoom event

Chavez shared that he enjoyed being a part of the GH Fantasy virtual fan event that he did in October with his co-star Sydney Mikayla (who plays Trina Robinson) which was produced by Coastal Entertainment. “I had such a good time and the fans that were there asked some really great questions” he said. “I would love to do more of those events.”

Recently he enjoyed rock climbing with his “General Hospital” co-stars Johnny Wactor and Marcus Coloma. “That was so fun I loved it” he said. “I had the time of my life. Johnny invited us and we had a helluva time.”

With Thanksgiving just passing Chavez shared what he was most thankful for this year. “I am always very thankful for my family and the people that are closest to me who support me in everything that I do” he said. “This year I’ve had a new addition to my family which is all of the cast crew and fans of ‘General Hospital’. They all became a part of my family so I am very thankful for them as well.”

Groton — A 400-foot barge built to help deliver Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines arrived Monday at Electric Boat the prime contractor for the submarines.

The new Ocean Transport Barge Holland constructed by Bollinger Shipyards of Lockport La. was named after John Holland the Irish-born immigrant who designed the first submarine purchased by the Navy. The original Holland was built at EB and delivered in 1900.

“We are happy to welcome Holland to her new home in the Groton shipyard” EB President Kevin Graney said. “Our fellow shipbuilders at Bollinger have delivered a terrific asset on time and on budget. Holland will play an important role in the construction of the Columbia class of submarines which will carry nearly 70% of the nation’s nuclear arsenal.”

The Columbia class is being built at EB’s Quonset Point R.I. manufacturing facility. Skilled tradespeople will construct and outfit Columbia modules at Quonset Point and the modules will then be transported by the Holland barge to the company’s final test and assembly facility in Groton. The first Columbia module is expected to arrive in Groton in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZW5ld3NoZXJlLmNvbS90ZXdrc2J1cnlfdG93bl9jcmllci9zcG9ydHMvYXJ0aWNsZV9mODdiZDdmNC00ZDQ3LTExZWMtYTE1Mi1lYjAxZmFiZGNlZWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A town and a son say thank you to Jimmy Brooks,"Woburn MA (01801)

The first documented successful flight was in 1903 and since then they have evolved into the great aircraft we see today. Aircraft are used worldwide for various reasons such as transportation recreational activities and military purposes. In addition they have made traveling across America easier.

Here is an article about the top 10 most used airplanes in America!

1. The Boeing 737

The Boeing Company is considered to be the world’s largest aerospace company. The first commercial jet that they released was in 1965. At that time there were two versions of the aircraft: the 737-100 and 737 -200. This became their most sold product with over 1500. It is still considered to be one of the most used aircraft in America.

The Boeing 737 is a twin-engine passenger aircraft. It holds up to 212 passengers and the measure of its wingspans is 139ft. The wings are made out of aluminum and the airfoils are in a delta shape. The fuselage is made out of aluminum and it spans 129ft in length. The engines produce 8000lbs of thrust each engine making it able to fly for 5 hours.

2. The Cessna 172

The Cessna Aircraft Company is a division of the U.S. conglomerate Textron Aviation Inc. In 2013 they had built around 3000 planes for more than fifty years making them one of America’s most successful airplane companies. The first production model was released in 1955 and is called the “172 Skyhawk”. It has been one of their best products to date with an estimated 43000 aircrafts being used worldwide since then.

The wings’ primary material is aluminum while its fuselage is constructed from steel tubing and it has fabric-covered flight surfaces. Its single door on each side provides access to passenger seats and the pilot’s seat while an additional exterior door provides access to the cargo area. The wingspan is 36ft 5in and the fuselage length is 34ft 8in. This aircraft can reach up to 175mph which provides a cruising speed of about 120mph.

3. The Cessna 414

The Cessna Aircraft Company “is an American general aviation company founded in July 1927 by Clyde Cessna. The company produced thousands of planes for civilian use as well as supplying military forces with fighter and reconnaissance planes.” Their most successful model was used between 1966 – 1985 where they made almost 1800 models called the “Cessna 414” or affectionately known as the “Husky.”

It has been considered one of their best products since it can hold up to 8 people and has a cruising speed of 170mph faster than the Cessna 172.

4. The Piper PA-23 Apache

Piper Aircraft Company was founded by Walter Briggs Jr. and Bill Turner in 1927 to develop a line of aircraft that would be easy to fly. They produced their first airplane in 1937 called the “Mongoose” and became highly successful with over 12000 being sold worldwide. In 1959 they released their best-selling single-engine light aircraft called the “Apache.”

It has been considered one of their most popular modern designs being used as a touring vehicle for up to four people a trainer for various military branches and civilian pilots training to fly Cessna Caravans. In total about 8500 have been produced since then.

5. The Beechcraft Bonanza

Textron Inc. acquired the Beech Aircraft Corporation in 1980 after they merged with the American company Hawker. The first production of their most common aircraft the “Beechcraft Model 35 Bonanza” was in 1947 and has been used worldwide ever since it was released.

It is currently still being used as a light aircraft that can carry up to 6 people on board while cruising at about 200mph. It holds more than 14 gallons of fuel which allows it to fly for 8 hours straight before refueling again.

6. The Grumman G-164 Ag-Cat

Grumman Aerospace Corporation is American aeronautics that had its origins when Leroy Grumman incorporated his first company in 1929 called the “L. Grumman & Co.” which produced a variety of general aviation aircraft like the Grumman G-21. The company was acquired by Northrop Corporation in 1994 and became known as Northrop Grumman. They also sold off some of their smaller divisions which is how they ended up selling their Agricultural Aircraft Division to Nebraska’s Keystone Agricultural Products Group (KAPG).

The most successful product for this division of Grumman was the G-164 Ag-Cat which is considered one of the most popular agricultural airplanes ever made. It has four propellers on it with two mounted on each wing and can hold up to five 50-gallon drums of chemicals or fertilizers and have room for a pilot and one passenger. In addition it is capable of flying at speeds up to 100mph while carrying those heavy loads.

7. The Cessna 120/140 series

Cessna Aircraft Company was founded by Clyde Cessna in 1928 and has steadily grown into the world’s largest producer of general aviation aircraft. They have claimed 11 different “Jet Airliner” speed records with their Citation jets including the fastest flight from Honolulu Hawaii to Sydney Australia. They also produced thousands upon thousands of other light planes such as the 120 and 140 series aimed towards private pilots. In addition it provided exceptional safety features such as more significant for their time high mounted wings to help prevent accidents with tall trees.

During its release between 1947-1949 it was their most famous aircraft that they have ever made being used as both a trainer for new pilots and having the ability to fly at speeds of up to 130mph while carrying four people on board.

8. The Convair 580 Series

Convair Division of General Dynamics Corporation first produced their commercial airliner in 1947 which they named “Convair 240”. It was designed by Robert Hagedorn and William Schwendler who worked on other projects including the B-36 Peacemaker Bomber for Convair. Although it started with only 48 being sold it helped them produce aircraft for the military including B-36 Peacemaker’s F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors and others.

Their most famous airliner was Convair 580 which went into production in 1966 at their San Diego Plant. It had an aluminum structure with a pressurized fuselage that carried up to 69 passengers depending on its configuration. Features that were added into this model included slotted flaps which increased the aircraft’s speed by 20% compared to other planes during takeoffs and accommodated more passengers because they reduced fuel consumption.

9. The Mitsubishi MU-2

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is a Japanese multinational company best known for producing vehicles such as aircraft been helicopters and ships. They were initially started in 1917 to have military equipment before shifting their focus towards creating cars planes and other goods for civilian use.

The MU-2 is considered one of the best long-range business jets that they have ever produced with seating up to 6 passengers while its high performance allows it to fly at speeds of up 410 knots which is about 497mph. This model was first introduced in 1973 until 1981 when production was temporarily halted due to issues with the fuel control system. When it came back into production again in 1985 they completely redesigned its interior layout and installed a new electronic flight instrumentation system that uses LCDs.

10. The Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander

Britten-Norman Aircraft Company is an aircraft manufacturer that serves the general aviation market in the United Kingdom. They are known for producing various designs including their Trislander which is three different planes welded together to form one.

However more well known was their Britten-Norman Islander which John Britten and Desmond Norman designed. It first flew on January 27th 1969 with its primary role being used for light transport and short-range reconnaissance. Its unique design came from its Short Takeoff and Landing capabilities allowing it to land at airfields without long runways.

Conclusion

It’s interesting to see how this industry has expanded over the years with them constantly coming up with new designs for their jets. It shows that these companies are never afraid of taking risks especially considering the amount of money they invest in designing aircraft for civilians."

A controversial doctor thinks he has the answer","In the war on wheat William Davis is the commander of a battalion on the front lines.

The Milwaukee-based cardiologist’s 2011 book Wheat Belly along with 2013’s Grain Brain by David Perlmutter both New York Times best-sellers were twin bombshells that some argued took up the war against the world’s most abundant crop after the Atkins diet fell out of fashion in the ‘90s.

Inspired by Davis’ own experience of losing 30 pounds and improving his energy after eliminating wheat from his diet Wheat Belly argues the grain “provokes inflammatory phenomena distorts insulin responses and issues abnormal metabolic signals to the rest of the body.” Davis chalks up conditions ranging from diabetes to arthritis to schizophrenia to a 20000-year-old mistake: harvesting wheat.

The Mower by Georges-Pierre Seurat (1881-82). Heritage Images/Hulton Archive/Getty Images

Critics say Davis’ ideas “are based on shaky science” that they “cannot be substantiated based on published scientific studies” and they “ignore the bulk of the science [and] exaggerate the truth.”

Davis shot back with a 2017 manifesto titled Undoctored — and he is launching a new offensive with Super Gut a book that offers a guide to ‘maximizing’ health by cultivating the gut microbiome of a (pre-wheat) ancient human.

“​​It's eating real food not things from Nabisco General Mills and Duncan Hines” Davis tells Inverse. “It's eating things like meat. Eat the fat. Save the carcass slow cook it or put it into soups or stews.”

As part of a weeklong celebration of your wondrous gut Inverse spoke to Davis about the importance of the microbiome why he feels confident in the face of criticism and whether you should trust your doctor [Editor’s note: you should trust your doctor].

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Inverse: For people who are new to the concept what is the human microbiome?

William Davis: People think of human bodies as being nothing more than human. But the truth is we are crawling every nook and cranny with trillions of microbes.

This discovery is quite new. Scientists are still in the early stages of understanding microbiomes’ role in health. Given how new all this is how do you base a whole diet on it?

There is actually a lot more known than you get from those kinds of conventional sources. You can buy microbes now as probiotics as a mixture of microbes. You can buy single microbes. You can even actually get microbes from fermented foods — there are a variety of ways for you and me to gain access to certain microbes.

There is one microbe I like to play with it's a prototype for what we're doing. It's called Lactobacillus reuteri. Best evidence is 96% of us have lost this very important microbe. When you restore it wonderful things happen. One of the things it does is boost the release of oxytocin from the brain. That in turn has all sorts of interesting effects. It can smooth skin wrinkles increase dermal collagen it restores youthful muscle because we lose about a third of our muscle as we age. It deepens sleep.

“We ferment for 36 hours which allows the microbe to double 12 times.”

It preserves bone density. In an age of record social isolation divorce and suicide we restore oxytocin and people tell me “I like my family better. I like my coworkers better. I introduced myself to strangers in line for coffee at Starbucks.” So there's a restoration of empathy and concern for other people.

One of the things we do is make yogurt. Not conventional yogurt. Conventional yogurt is a four-hour commercial process. These are my methods. We ferment for 36 hours which allows the microbe to double 12 times. If you allow them to double once you'll get so much allow them to double 12 times or for 36 hours in this case and you get — we did flow cytometry on these yogurts and we got 260 billion counts per half-cup serving. And that's what gives these exaggerated almost extravagant effects. You can do that with numerous microbes you can cultivate microbes. It doesn't have to be yogurt yogurt just happens to be a very friendly way to do this. But you could cultivate Lactobacillus gasseri and it shrinks your waist; no change in diet no exercise no push. It shrinks your waist by about an inch over three months.

“One of the things we do is make yogurt.” Shutterstock

I mean has this been under peer review? Research? Its effect on athletes? Its effect on sleep? Its effect on libido? Is there peer-reviewed evidence?

I tell people it's 1982 and you and I have a Commodore 64 computer and we're playing Pong. We haven't yet foreseen the incredible things coming out of technology. That's where we are with the microbiome.

There's lots more to learn as many new things to do. Oxytocin came from MIT from a cancer group trying to understand whether reuteri had some anti-cancer effects. But they noticed that the mice grew thick luxurious fur as they called it and they explored further. They documented a whole range of effects including acceleration of healing increased hair growth thicker dermal increasing dermal collagen restoration of youthful muscle. So all of those effects I told you about were first seen in mice not all of it but much of it corroborated in humans we have our own clinical trials to corroborate. So there's actually a lot more known about the microbiome you don't hear about in mainstream media.

So where do you hear about it? Where would I look?

Well you'd have to search for it of course like in PubMed but if you entered in your search for the terms like reuteri oxytocin and maybe bone density you'd see that there's a clinical trial performed that showed that ladies who got reuteri had half as much bone loss as ladies getting a placebo. So it's not as if we're in the vacuum of research there is a wealth of research for those cells. The study with preservation of muscle with bacilli is published in humans. The gasseri effect that reduces waist circumference is two human clinical trials.

“We've lost keystone microbes; foundational important microbes.”

There's also another aspect of the thing I'm trying to advocate here: the restoration of microbes we've lost. You and I are exposed to antibiotics herbicides pesticides in our food. Glyphosate is everywhere. It's an herbicide but it's also a very potent antibiotic. We all have glyphosate in us. So we're all exposed to this potent antibiotic. So for a variety of reasons modern humans have disrupted their microbiome including the loss of numerous species such as reuteri and many others.

It's harder to show what you've lost than what you have right? But little by little it's becoming clear. We've lost “keystone microbes”; foundational important microbes.

Can you give me a preview of Super Gut? What’s the diet you're recommending here?

​​It's eating real food not things from Nabisco General Mills and Duncan Hines. It's eating things like meat. Eat the fat. Save the carcass slow cook it or put it into soups or stews. Vegetables of course. Healthy oils: extra virgin olive oil coconut oil. There's no calorie restriction. Calorie restriction is a very destructive process.

“Calorie restriction is a very destructive process.”

What's surprising is how much of the science is already performed but it's not widely talked about. There are several studies now looking at a very simple question: What happens to the gallbladder when you cut calories and/or cut fat? Which is commonly done right? Cut your calories push the plate away all that business. What happens to the gallbladder when you do that? Well this has been done. Ultrasound of the gallbladder days zero day 30 day 60 day 90 very simple. And then you put somebody on a low-calorie diet low-fat diet or both. A shocking number of people develop gallstones. Depending on the mix of participants as many as 55 to 62 percent of the ladies develop gallstones within a three months period.

Relatively little is known about the composition of the pre-industrial gut. Why are you so confident that this missing microbiota is so critical?

So as you point out you could use coprolites that is fossilized fecal matter which is flawed. It's fecal matter it's mixed in with other things other microbes other animals have touched it. So there's only a limited amount of that stuff. The best data comes from an examination of the existing current indigenous populations like the Yanomami in the Brazilian rainforest or the Matsigenka in the highlands of Peru or the Hadza in Tanzania or the Maasai in Keny. So when these populations' microbiomes have been looked at they're completely different from ours.

Also read: The “disappearing” human microbiome — and the fraught push to preserve it

Even more interestingly despite being separated by 1000s of miles different continents they all look very similar to one another. So the presumption is that this represents so-called Stone Age microbiome. In other words why would the microbiome of somebody in the Brazilian rainforest be almost identical to the microbiome of somebody living in Tanzania in Africa? So the logical conclusion would be this must be the current version of the microbiome as preserved from Stone Age times. And that their microbes are completely different. They have species we don't have we have species they don't have. They have virtually no constipation hemorrhoids ulcerative colitis Crohn's Disease colon cancer type 2 diabetes obesity schizophrenia psoriasis etc. They have other problems. They have Dengue fever malaria worm infestations infections and injury. But anthropologists call the diseases we have ""diseases of civilization"" and they have virtually none of the diseases of civilization. Isn't it shocking that we don't make more of that? What are they doing right that we're not doing?

Why do you think there's been so much pushback to your work?

Well because so many people have their entire careers based on wheat. It's like. The tobacco executive with two kids in college and a mortgage to pay is not going to stand up and say You know what we actually do have the evidence showing that cigarette smoking causes heart disease and lung cancer. We've had it for 25 years.” You're not gonna have a tobacco executive admit that same thing here. And the grain industry is a huge trillion-dollar industry that permeates all aspects of society.

Some of your advice has gone beyond wheat and grains. You've made some blanket statements about the necessity of prescription drugs. I saw one blog post that you wrote that the notion that prescription drugs are necessary for health is a patent absurdity. You also have a book that encourages people to ""become smarter than your doctor."" I mean without knowing who you're talking to is it dangerous to encourage people who may need medical care to reject the expertise of their own physicians?

You're right there are people who don't have the intelligence to manage their own health. People would come to me and say ""Hey I told my doctor I was gonna do the Wheat Belly lifestyle"" and my doctor said ""If you do that plan on your heart attack so I'm going to give you Lipitor."" And so the person — this happened thousands of times — said ""I'm gonna do it anyway. I'm not taking Lipitor. I'm just going to give it a try.""

“The grain industry is a huge trillion-dollar industry.”

And they experienced dramatic transformations in health. Truly type 2 diabetics become none-diabetic. Pre-diabetic to no longer pre-diabetic. People with three blood pressure medicines off all blood pressure meds. People with many forms of autoimmune diseases saw their diseases regress skin rashes regressed or disappeared.

And so what I saw was just given a handful of common-sense strategies such as reverting back to the diet that humans were evolved to follow not the modern version of diet replacing nutrients lost because of modern habits like the magnesium loss and drinking water doing that and it's an astounding return of health for the vast majority of people. But it was accomplished without your doctor. In fact it was accomplished in spite of the doctor.

You’ve said doctors are motivated by greed but isn’t that just a blanket statement? We've got about 900000 active physicians in the U.S. and you can't trust any of them?

No of course not. There are great naturopaths. There are great integrative health and functional medicine practitioners. There are occasional mainstream MD who understands the system is corrupt and that he's doesn't have that much power to change it. So I'm generalizing.

You're right. I'm generalizing. But as a whole the healthcare system is broken. It is horribly broken. And my real regret is that I don't have a solution except to say to people “Here's a set of strategies that can restore magnificent health in fairly short order. And you can do this without your doctor.” In fact the only time you need your doctor is to help you get off the medication you're on.

It appears that the idea of General Motors CEO Mary Barra being a leading force in the automotive sector’s transition into electric vehicles is well embraced by the executive herself. During a conversation with CNBC’s Andrew Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook Online Summit Barra declared that GM is the leader in the United States’ electric vehicle sector even as she practically acknowledged that Tesla holds over 60% of the country’s EV market today.

The CNBC anchor’s questions to the GM CEO were surprisingly tough. Over the course of their conversation Sorkin asked Barra about GM’s market cap as compared to Tesla self-driving cars US President Biden’s Tesla snub during the White House EV summit the upcoming revisions to the country’s EV incentives and the idea of Tesla workers potentially earning more in a non-union workplace. More importantly the CNBC host asked the CEO if GM could catch up to Tesla since the veteran automaker currently holds just about 9-10% of the EV market while the Silicon Valley-based carmaker holds 63%.

“Right now GM in terms of the electric vehicle market you have about 9-10% of the market. Tesla has about 63% of the market. Five years from now if you succeed — but everybody else has their own success in this space — what does that pie chart look like?” Sorkin asked.

Quite surprisingly Barra responded by stating that GM is the leader in the United States’ electric vehicle sector today. The CEO also noted that GM is currently number two in China’s EV market. Overall Barra stated that she remains optimistic about GM’s future in the electric vehicle sector and she has no intention of conceding General Motors’ leadership position to anyone.

“Well we have said just like we’re the leader today if you set aside you know with the distortion that’s happening with the semi shortage we have been the leader in the United States. We’ve been number two in China for many years. I think when you get to wanting to get 50% all EVs you have to win customers that only drive one vehicle. They only own one vehicle. They depend on that vehicle every day.

“General Motors has brands that they trust. We have the highest loyalty rating. We have manufacturing plants that are ready to go and so when I look at our ability to scale to serve customers I think we’re incredibly well-positioned. And we’re not going to cede our leadership position to anyone” Barra said.

While the GM CEO’s statements may raise some eyebrows considering its apparent disregard for the fact that 63% is larger than 9-10% the narrative of GM being a leader in the electrification of the auto sector has been echoed by the Biden administration itself. During his visit to General Motors’ Factory Zero in Detroit US President Joe Biden patted the executive on the back stating that the CEO “changed the story” and that she “electrified the entire automotive industry.”

“In the auto industry Detroit is leading the world in electric vehicles. You know how critical it is? Mary I remember talking to you way back in January about the need for America to lead in electric vehicles. I can remember your dramatic announcement that by 2035 GM would be 100% electric. You changed the whole story Mary. You did Mary. You electrified the entire automotive industry. I’m serious. You led and it matters” Biden said.

In order to be able to lease them structurally reinforced concrete needed to be installed. Each pit is 19200 square feet (153600 square feet in all) with more than 7 million pounds of storage capacity. Also he said each pit is serviced by a 30 ton overhead gantry crane.

“Local engineering teams ensured the finished product was to standard compliant with local code and suitable to service the industrial users that the property attracts” Crock said. “Plymouth’s goal was to balance the benefits of modernizing the property while sustaining the core of the historic facility. Our objective was to retain rather than demolish portions of the property that make Fisher Park unique.”

Other improvements include 160000 square feet of LED lighting upgrades and updated restroom facilities.

“Plymouth is focused on sustainable green construction practices” Crock said. “Plymouth removed and recycled over 450 tons of steel as well as 160 antiquated inefficient sodium halide lighting fixtures.”

Everything but the restroom upgrades should be completed by the end of the year and the restrooms should be finished by the end of the first quarter next year.

The city of Fairfield is “excited” to see the investment said Fairfield Economic Development Manager Nathaniel Kaelin. For the first time since the heyday of the old Fisher Body Plant “the full capacity of the building can be maximized” he said.

“Fisher Body was a mainstay in the community for many years. While many former automotive plants end up being demolished or abandoned investments by Plymouth and the previous owner have made the property economically viable again” Kaelin said.

Tenants such as Gardens Alive Metalworking Group Deufol and others thriving in the space Kaelin said and the city sees the building “provides flexible overflow space for some of our other industrial companies in Fairfield.”

Plymouth Industrial REIT took ownership of the former General Motors Fisher Body plant in October 2018 the fourth owner since 2005.

Plymouth CEO Jeff Witherell said they were initially approached by the previous owners about the property’s availability.

“We had known them for several years. After evaluating the transaction we thought that as long-term owners we could invest the necessary capital to take the property to the next level” he said.

Witherell said they were already a property owner in Cincinnati and wanted to expand the company’s footprint and Plymouth continues to invest in the market.

“Fairfield checked on all the boxes ― easy access to interstates strong blue-collar workforce and affordable leasing rates” Witherell said.

Crock said half of the redeveloped area approximately 76800 square feet has been leased for six months or longer. All newly executed leases he said are with existing Fisher Park tenants.

“There are several ongoing conversations with both new and existing tenants to potentially lease the remaining areas” he said.

There have been rumors and reports citing unnamed insider sources and now there’s this recent survey sent out by Chevrolet to C8 Corvette owners in order to gauge their views regarding what the manufacturer described as an ‘electric sport vehicle.’

Chevy didn’t overtly say that it was referring to the next-gen Corvette that may go fully-electric but according to this post from MidEngineCorvetteForum it may in fact be the C9 that they are talking about. Owners described receiving an email from Chevrolet polling them about several topics like over-the-air updates whether or not they were looking to buy a new car in the next two years or the aforementioned electric sports car.

Reactions among those who responded were the opposite of unanimous. Some seemed happy and willing to consider an electric Vette while others shared more reserved positions not only about an EV sports car but electric cars in general. The data gathered by GM via this survey probably contains a similar mix of answers.

What do we actually know about the electric Corvette? Well not a whole lot right now. The scene was abuzz when Chevrolet ’ name back in 2015 prompting reactions pretty similar to the ones above; the trademark was renewed last year but this still doesn’t mean it will surely be used.

Some have also stated that this E-Ray could in fact be some kind of all-wheel drive hybrid (if so most likely a PHEV) with a mid-mounted internal-combustion engine (still a V8 possibly twin-turbocharged from the upcoming ZR1 model) driving the rear wheels and the front wheels powered by a pair of electric motors.

This could be the 1000-horsepower Corvette Zora (named after the ‘father of the Corvette’ Zora Arkus-Duntov) that is also said to be in the works. However it could also be the less extreme electrified Corvette Grand Sport model whose output is rumored to be around 600-horsepower mark (it reportedly pairs the standard C8’s 6.2-liter V8 with the same pair of electric motors up front).

But perhaps GM was gauging Corvette buyers’ opinions not for any of the electrified models mentioned above but for an actual EV planned for even further in the future. How much further in the future? Well given the fact that the rumors about the hybrid Vettes place their launch sometime in 2023 it’s going to have to be after that.

The vertical implementation of center stack infotainment screens of the Ram 1500 and F-150 Lightning give us an opportunity to address the very design direction that started with Tesla cars.

When the current-gen Ram 1500 – a chief competitor to GM’s Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra – launched for the 2019 model year it offered a large vertical 12-inch infotainment screen dominating the center stack and lighting up the automotive world.

At that time various folks reviewed the truck and opined on the screen with some liking it while also taking issue with its vertical orientation. MacRumors writer Eric Slivka perhaps said it most eloquently: “I do also still have some concerns about the shift toward increasingly large touchscreens in vehicles which can make it harder to make changes by feel and end up taking your eyes off the road for longer. A portrait display magnifies these issues by bringing significant portions of the display lower on the center stack and away from the driver’s line of sight. I would have appreciated it if the display could have been moved all the way to the top of the stack to minimize this issue as much as possible.”

Our thoughts exactly. By comparison General Motors has elected to use a horizontal orientation of its screens enabling drivers to quickly gather information via an “eye sweep” across the dash reducing distractions by minimizing time away from watching the road. This horizontally-oriented approach makes even more sense when we consider that Apple CarPlay and Android Auto both display information in a horizontal rectangle format and Tesla – known for its large vertically-oriented screens doesn’t support either of the two technologies.

Interestingly Ram has announced that its Uconnect 5 infotainment system will allow Apple CarPlay to “occupy the entire space” of the pickup truck’s 12-inch vertical screen for the 2022 model year. That’s seems puzzling as it brings a driver’s eyes down and away from the road especially the recently-used app icons which are small and near the bottom of the screen making them difficult to find and tap. This new one-off iteration seems like more of a concession for Ram to fill its (not ideally-oriented) vertical screen that it’s so proud of rather than honoring Apple’s stringent design ethos and declaration that “CarPlay is a smarter safer way to use your iPhone while you drive.” But wait there’s more.

The all-electric 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning – a rival to GM’s GMC Hummer EV Pickup and upcoming Silverado E – has followed Ram’s suit with a large vertical center stack screen. Meanwhile Tesla – the company that pioneered vertical screens with the debut of the Model S back in 2012 – has shifted to horizontal screens for all of its models. GM seems to agree with that direction as it has continued to go horizontal and in a big way – literally.

For example the all-new 2021 Cadillac Escalade features an impressive industry-first 38-inch curved screen that includes infotainment a driver control panel and the instrument cluster all in a horizontally-oriented configuration.

The upcoming GMC Hummer EV Pickup and SUV will feature a 13.4-inch infotainment display and 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster as standard. The horizontally-oriented infotainment screen is identical in both vehicles.

Similarly the upcoming all-electric 2023 Cadillac Lyriq features an enormous 33-inch display which – similar to the unit in the aforementioned 2021 Escalade – provides readouts for the instrumentation and infotainment as well as various onboard controls all in a – you guessed it – horizontally-oriented fashion.

The refreshed 2022 Silverado continues the horizontal trend offering the same screens sizes of the GMC Hummer EV modes on mid- to high-end trim levels. That gives the refreshed 2022 Silverado 1500 one of the biggest infotainment touchscreens in its class at 13.4 inches. the center infotainment screen is complemented by a 12.3-inch all-digital instrument cluster.

It even appears that the upcoming all-electric Silverado E will have a huge curved horizontal screen similar to the units used in the Lyriq and Escalade. The new electric truck will be unveiled during the opening ceremony of the 2022 CES show via a keynote delivered by General Motors CEO Mary Barra on Wednesday January 5th 2022.

And last but not least there’s the refreshed 2022 GMC Sierra 1500. Like the 2022 Silverado 1500 it also gets a new 13.4-inch center infotainment screen that is very much horizontally-oriented. Chalk one up for the wide screen camp.

GM’s approach also speaks to its desire to go way beyond screen size as a critical measure and instead focus on how well the complete package of screen design works to fulfill the goal of quickly providing critical and important information and controls to drivers. The solution involves a large fully configurable digital information cluster (digital gauge cluster) plus a large infotainment screen with a logical orientation along with an intuitive user interface.

As GM puts it regarding the refreshed 2022 Silverado “Silverado’s new infotainment screen is the centerpiece of the more intuitive technology and is paired with a new digital configurable instrument cluster. Together they provide customers with a bold panoramic and at-a-glance view of the important vehicle feature readouts and infotainment settings.

“The configurable cluster and infotainment display are designed to engage customers with new levels of personalization and intuitive interaction. It starts the moment the driver slides behind the wheel and the driver information center comes to life. The available Rear Camera Mirror and Head-Up Display take the total to four technologically advanced screens each helping provide an engaging and comprehensive driving experience.”

So while the Ram and F-150 Lightning both offer large vertical screens Chevy’s refreshed 2022 Silverado 1500 and 2022 Sierra 1500 deliver large screens that are elegantly integrated into the cockpit delivering effortless scanning and control to the ever-increasing amounts of data and information available in a modern motorized vehicle."

Mention the names Colonial Pipeline or Kaseya and almost everyone will know that they were each hit by a crippling cyberattack that involved intruders breaching the corporate network to encrypt data and systems and then demanding a ransom payment generally in cryptocurrency for decryption.

In the face of the increased media attention public reports of multi-million-dollar ransom demands and the involvement of national governments law enforcement and more it may seem as if ransomware is becoming more prevalent. However the reality is more nuanced.

According to the Global State of Ransomware 2021 the proportion of organisations hit with a ransomware attack declined from 51% in 2019 to 37% in 2020. While this may look like good news it’s not.

One of the main reasons for the decline is that some of the major ransomware operators have altered their approach moving from larger scale generic automated attacks to more targeted attacks that include human hands-on-keyboard hacking. Even though the overall number of attacks is lower as a result the potential for damage from these more advanced and complex targeted attacks is much higher. Such attacks are also harder to recover from and this is reflected in the far higher recovery costs experienced by ransomware victims the world over during 2020.

In fact the global survey found that the cost of recovering from a ransomware attack including the need to rebuild systems the cost of business downtime lost orders operational costs and more grew from an average of $761106 in 2019 to $1.85 million in 2020. In short the average global recovery cost following a ransomware attack in 2020 is double what it was in 2019.

With the average global ransom demand during 2020 coming in at around $17000 this means that the cost of recovering from a ransomware attack is now 10 times the size of the ransom payment on average.

Why are these recovery costs increasing? According to Sophos security researchers one reason is the greater disruption made possible by more effective attacker tactics and the precision-targeting of business-critical assets.

More effective techniques

The techniques used by attackers are becoming more sophisticated. In a traditional ransomware attack malicious code rapidly encrypts files with public-key RSA encryption and then deletes those files if ransom demands are not met. However following the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware campaigns in 2017 companies have begun to place a greater emphasis on making regular backups and keeping a copy offline and other restoration processes. This means that even if files are encrypted in an attack the victim has copies and can restore their lost data. As a result they can refuse to pay a ransom.

The global survey found that in 2020 ransomware victims in financial services and in manufacturing and production were the most likely to be able to recover from backups and were correspondingly the least likely to pay a ransom.

However cybercriminals have adapted their techniques to these new circumstances. A growing number of ransomware families now incorporate “double extortion” into their approach. As opposed to just encrypting files the attackers also steal data and then threaten to publish it online or sell it on for profit if their ransom demands are not met. In such cases backups and data recovery plans become relatively worthless.

A small but growing number of ransomware attacks now even skip the encryption stage altogether and just demand a ransom to delete the stolen data. Not surprisingly ransomware victims in financial services and in manufacturing and production are among the top targets for this approach.

Targeting business-critical assets

Cybercriminals understand the value of targeting business-critical assets and activities; those which an organisation can’t operate without. The more disruption caused by the attack the more likely the victim is to pay the ransom demand – or so the attackers hope anyway.

There is a parallel and probably not totally unconnected shift in the main targets for attack. Sophos’ global ransomware research has found that larger organisations – those with a thousand employees or more - are now more likely to be attacked by ransomware than smaller ones.

The reasons for this are likely to include the potential for higher rewards in terms of ransom payments. However recent attacks investigated by the Sophos Rapid Response team show that no matter the size or cyber maturity of the organisation no company is immune from becoming a target for attack.

Conclusion

The pace at which connected global IT infrastructure has evolved over recent decades has created an environment in which cybercrimes of all types can flourish.

Ransomware attackers benefit from low costs and wide digital connectivity especially following the impact of the pandemic and the fact that it is now possible for even less-skilled cybercriminals to hire every component of an attack as-a-service from targets to tools and infrastructure and more.

Defeating ransomware requires a global response. International governments need to work in collaboration with local governments supply chain vendors law enforcement the commercial sector and others to establish universal anti-ransomware standards and protection. The cybersecurity industry has a vital role to play in enabling this for instance by sharing the latest research intelligence on attacker tools and techniques security advisories and information such as indicators of compromise and more that defenders everywhere can apply to their own organisations. We all share the cost of recovering from ransomware.

Nomod a platform which makes payments easy for worldwide merchants to accept card payments on their phone without extra hardware has raised US$3.4 million in a seed funding round with the enterprise now being valued at $50 million. The round was led by Global Founders Capital. Other investors include Kingsway Capital Goodwater Capital as well as angel investors like ""one of the founders of Careem an early employee of Dropbox and a partner at DST Global.""

Launched in March 2021 Nomod is the brainchild of serial startup entrepreneur Omar Kassim. Kassim's previous startup UAE-based e-commerce marketplace platform JadoPado was acquired by Noon in 2017. His current venture Nomod replaces card terminals by seamlessly accepting card payments on your phone. The startup processes in-person payments and payment links using keyboards cameras or contactless options like NFC and QR codes. Nomod also accepts every card network and it is able to charge in over 135 currencies.

Kassim believes that Nomod's offering stands out among the crowd. ""We're deeply focused on both mobile as well as micro and small merchants who are a globally underserved segment"" he says. After testing in over 40 markets globally Kassim points out that he and his team have learned one crucial factor: ""Small merchants don't care for complicated features such as APIs or SDKs. They simply want to be able to press a button know that they'll be paid on time and get on with their lives. Staying laser-focused on building out our product offering to continue to solve programs for our segment of customers is what I think will put us in a good position to succeed over time.""

Headquartered in London the Nomod team is globally remote and it currently operates in six countries across the world. Working across multiple markets including the UAE US and UK the company has managed to acquire over 4700 merchants so far with total processed volume having grown 11x since launch. According to Kassim the team is actively acquiring customers particularly in the UAE with the country accounting for 30% of its merchants and 50% of total processed volume since launched. It was also a part of the summer 2021 batch of Y Combinator a renowned US-based startup accelerator.

With this infusion of capital the Nomod team aims to accelerate the enterprise's growth by ramping up customer acquisition continuing to build its features and growing the global remote team.

But what is the end goal for Nomod? ""If we zoom out and cast an eye towards the future our ambition is to build a financial operating system for forward thinking businesses"" Kassim replies. ""Whether it be holding money spending money accepting or making payments or getting access to capital to grow our mission is to empower millions of entrepreneurs and startups around the world to start and grow their businesses with access to better payment tools and financial services.""

""Developers can now accept payments for in-app purchases from mobile and tablet users in South Korea with an alternative in-app billing system in addition to Google Play's billing system"" said a latest post on the Google Play Policies website.

The changed policy which takes effect from December 18 will give choice to local app developers between a third-party payment system and its own in-app billing system at its Google Play Store.

The move came as the new law went into effect in the country in September restricting app store operators such as Google and Apple from forcing their in-app payment systems on developers.

South Korea was the first country to introduce such curbs on global tech giants' in-app billing policies which have been increasingly under scrutiny around the world reports Yonhap news agency.

Google and Apple have required developers on their app stores to use their proprietary payment systems that charge fees of up to 30 per cent when users purchase digital goods within apps.

Developers around the world have questioned app market operators' exclusive in-app payment systems opposing their relatively high commissions and demanding that they should be able to freely use other systems.

At just 28 the Flipkart alum has figured it out.

I turned 28 few weeks back. I want @sliceit_ to become a Unicorn before I get to 30 We could be valued at $100-150mn today What is the one thing we need to do today to get there? — Rajan Bajaj (@rajanbajaj_) January 7 2021

Slice which was valued at under $200 million in a financing round in June this year has raised $220 million that values it at over $1 billion the startup said on Monday.

Tiger Global and Insight Partners co-led the Bangalore-based startup’s Series B round. Private equity firm Advent International’s Sunley House Capital Moore Strategic Ventures Anfa and existing investors Gunosy Blume Ventures and 8i also participated in it.

TechCrunch reported early last month that Tiger Global and Insight Partners were in talks to back Slice. The round could further grow to $250 million a source familiar with the matter said.

Slice has established itself as one of the market leading card-issuing firms in India. The startup offers a number of cards that are aimed at tech-savvy young professionals in the country. “These users have been on Instagram and Snapchat for years” said Bajaj of Slice customers in an interview with TechCrunch.

“The bar for consumer design is very high for them. We don’t have to educate them on how to navigate the app. It’s intuitive for them. They want simplicity and transparency” he said.

The median age of Slice customers is 27 which is also about the age of the team members at Slice who are building the app he said.

The market of credit cards is massive in India and it remains largely untapped.

Despite nearly a billion Indians having a bank account only a tiny fraction of this population is covered by the South Asian nation’s young credit rating system.

As we have outlined in the past Indian banks heavily rely on archaic methodologies to determine an individual’s creditworthiness and whether they deserve a credit card. Their conclusion: it’s too risky to give a credit card or even a loan to most Indians.

Slice is tackling this by using its own underwriting system. Such is the confidence it has in its underwriting system that in September this year it launched a card with $27 limit — an offering that was inspired by a request from a potential customer — to tap into the nation’s 200 million population. Bajaj (pictured above) said the new card is gaining fast traction but declined to share any figures. Slice has a registered user base of over 5 million users.

The startup offers Slice customers a range of features such as the ability to pay the bill in multiple instalments spread across three months at no charge as well as access to discounts on purchase with scores of brands.

Slice says it is issuing over 200000 cards each month which according to a person familiar with industry figures makes the startup the third largest card issuer in India after two banks. Slice has a waitlist of over a million users it said on Twitter.

“Slice has built a product that customers love which we expect will result in continued growth and market share gains” said Alex Cook a partner at Tiger Global in a statement. “We are excited to partner with Rajan and the team as they expand access to credit and deliver best-in-class customer experience.”

Slice is moving with an annual revenue runrate of over $60 million according to the source quoted above. The source requested anonymity as the details are private. Bajaj declined to comment on financial figures.

Slice will deploy the fresh funds to expand its product offerings. In the coming months it plans to launch support for UPI a payments railroad developed by a coalition of retail banks and which is the most popular way Indians transact online he said.

The startup may also launch some new cards one of which may be focused at teens the aforementioned source said. Slice is also working on a decentralized product called ‘&ID’ Bajaj said in a LinkedIn post earlier this year.

“It has become second nature for us to jump between identities whether we are online or offline. What if we stop and think about one ID that can be used everywhere and is fully controlled by you? Picture an ID that can be used to accept payments do KYC make investments apply for a visa rent a car or even create a unique link to all of your brand’s social presence online — without any censorship” he said in the post.

Slice’s UPI offering will be the first product to adopt &ID. The startup is also looking to hire more people he said. Slice last month announced that it is offering new hires a three-day week with steady pay and benefits to attract talent that wishes to work on other opportunities — or do whatever else they like — at the same time.

“Slice targets an underpenetrated market in India and seamlessly allows users to make online payments pay bills and more” said Deven Parekh Managing Director at Insight Partners in a statement “There is a large opportunity in the credit and payment space in India and slice is well-positioned to become the leader in the industry. We look forward to this partnership with slice as they continue to scale up and grow.”"

Triad Combat is a revolutionary new combat team sport which incorporates boxing and MMA rules in an aggressive fast-paced manner with the fighters competing in a specially designed triangular ring over two-minute rounds featuring professional boxers competing against professional mixed martial arts fighters. The specific motto of leveling the playing field between the two sports utilizing crossover gloves and with holding allowed is meant to offer boxing and MMA fighters an even battleground where neither opponent has a greater advantage.

Regarding METALLICA's involvement with the event bassist Robert Trujillo told MMA Junki: ""It's pretty exciting because I almost feel like the type of music that we do that METALLICA does kind of warrants itself into the combat sports world. I'm a big fan of MMA and actually boxing because I grew up watching a lot of the classic matches through the '70s and the '80s and I actually watched early MMA. I could always relate the two universes between edgy music and just edgy sporting events. I think it's a perfect fit.

""This is the first time something like this specifically has landed on our plate"" Trujillo added. ""One of the things about METALLICA is that we like a challenge we like something new. This is something that hasn't really been done at least in our universe. We're pretty excited. It's a unique experience. Everything about it is pretty unique. The way the set is set up — in terms of the setlist and how it's sort of sprawled out over the course of the evening — is pretty special and unique. I think all and all between the fights and the performance it's going to balance out into a pretty exciting experience.""

The ""Triad Combat"" PPV event was carried in North America across all PPV platforms including cable satellite telco and streaming.

Among the fighters featured in separate fights on the debut of ""Triad Combat"" were two-time UFC heavyweight world champion Frank Mir two-time boxing heavyweight world title challenger Kubrat ""The Cobra"" Pulev and former UFC superstar ""Platinum"" Mike Perry.

""Triad Combat"" was produced by the award-winning Nigel Lythgoe the Triller Fight Club visionary in addition to the producer and creative force behind ""American Idol"" and ""So You Think You Can Dance"".

In a fight that went the distance Flores was rewarded for his work in the latter rounds to take a unanimous decision over UFC veteran Mitrione by scores of 68-64 67-65 and 68-64.

The heavyweight fight took place at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas.

The pair came out throwing absolute bombs in the first round coming close so inflicting some major damage. That moment didn’t happen until Round 2 though when Mitrione connected with a huge right hand that floored Flores and had him hurt. He barely made it up before the 10-count then the fight wore on.

Matt Mitrione sends Flores down in the second #TriadCombat pic.twitter.com/w1zkugCwiC — FITE (@FiteTV) November 28 2021

Some controversy came in Round 3 when Flores locked up a Dagestani handcuff from a clinch position which is illegal. Mitrione was irate and complained to referee Dan Miragliotta but he gathered his wits. Mitrione landed a spinning back fist which was the first of the event.

The pace slowed down on the back half of the fight. There was a lot more clinching and fighting from in close and both men had difficulty landing that big shot to change the trajectory of the fight.

Flores was arguably more effective in that situation and a moment in Round 7 where he knocked Mitrione’s mouthpiece. That seemingly made the difference as he got the nod from the judges.

This time they upgraded their starting rotation.

Multiple sources confirm that the Rangers and right-handed pitcher Jon Gray have agreed to a four-year $56 million contract. ESPN's Jeff Passan was the first to report the terms of the contract.

Gray 30 is a solid middle-of-the-rotation arm though he slots in at the top of the Rangers rotation. Through seven seasons with the Colorado Rockies the Oklahoma native has posted a 53-49 record with a 4.59 ERA and 1.34 WHIP. The ERA mark may not excite fans but Gray's career 3.91 FIP and 107 ERA+ could translate to better numbers with him set to pitch in a better environment like Globe Life Field which is far more pitcher friendly than Coors Field.

Earlier on Sunday the Rangers and shortstop/second baseman Marcus Semien agreed to a seven-year $175 million contract and also agreed to a one-year $5.2 million deal with outfielder Kole Calhoun. Adding to the two signings to the existing contracts retained salaries and money set aside for their pre-arbitration and arbitration-eligible players the Rangers roughly have a $95 million payroll for next season. In October president of baseball operations Jon Daniels said the club's 2022 budget would be ""consistent with the market and fan base of this size"". Dallas-Fort Worth is a top-five sports market.

Every indication right now is the Rangers are not done adding to their roster. Multiple sources confirm that the Rangers are still very involved in the sweepstakes for free agent shortstop Trevor Story who the Rangers have already hosted in Arlington this offseason.

Professional boxer Kubrat Pulev defeated mixed martial artist Frank Mir by first-round TKO to cap Triller’s Triad Combat card from Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas on Saturday.

Pulev was a massive favorite entering this bout and that came to fruition.

By the end of the fight Pulev was throwing hard rights and lefts without any defense from Mir who was somehow able to keep standing.

Eventually the referee stepped in between the two fighters to stop the match right before the end of Round 1.

Triad Combat is basically a mesh between boxing and MMA with Matthew Wells of MMA Junkie providing more information:

""This new take on boxing will take place in a triangular ring with the fighters wearing 8-ounce hybrid gloves. Aside from the usual punching techniques fighters will be able to utilize spinning backfists and superman punches.""

Ariel Helwani of BT Sport relayed a Triller press release explaining the concept in more detail:

The idea as the press release stated is to ""even the playing field"" between boxers and MMA fighters.

""The specific motto of leveling the playing field between the two sports utilizing crossover gloves and withholding allowed is meant to offer boxing and MMA fighters an even battleground where neither opponent has a greater advantage"" the release read.

Both Mir and Pulev came into this matchup with excellent resumes.

Mir 42 has a 19-13 professional MMA record with 14 wins by way of knockout or submission.

He won the UFC's interim heavyweight championship at UFC 92 in Dec. 2008 before falling to Brock Lesnar in a title bout in July 2009 following a second-round TKO.

Mir had two more title chances after that result falling to Shane Carwin for the interim title in March 2010 before losing to Junior dos Santos in May 2012 for the heavyweight crown.

The Las Vegas native's last MMA fight was a unanimous-decision win over Roy Nelson at Bellator 231 in Oct. 2019.

This marked Mir's second professional boxing match. He fell by unanimous decision to Steve Cunningham in a six-round fight last April.

Meanwhile Pulev entered Saturday 28-2 all-time in the professional boxing ring. He won the vacant IBF International heavyweight title with a unanimous-decision win over Travis Walker in Oct. 2011 and successfully defended the belt five times.

The Bulgarian's losses came against two of the best heavyweight fighters in the sport's history. Wladimir Klitschko took him down with a fifth-round knockout for the IBF and The Ring heavyweight titles in Nov. 2014 which marked the first loss of his 21-match career."

I'm Matt Turner the editor in chief of business at Insider.

Goldman Sachs polled its interns earlier this year on everything from posting to TikTok to the climate crisis. One takeaway: 21% said they'd invested in cryptocurrencies.

Given that Wall Street and its workforce are typically heavily regulated and tracked I found this striking. In the past financial institutions have waged war on their staffers communicating on encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Now they're facing a generation that's bypassing brokerage accounts to make investments from their crypto wallets.

At the same time these firms are looking to get in on the crypto craze themselves with Citigroup this week appointing an executive to lead a new crypto team. That could create new conflicts of interest and lead to a clampdown.

Until then as Reed Alexander and Alex Morrell reported this week young Wall Streeters are making bank on crypto. Read on for a Q&A on their reporting.

Reed Alexander and Alex Morrell take us inside their reporting on how young Wall Streeters are making crypto trades — and what banks' compliance departments are saying about it.

What prompted you to look into young Wall Street trading crypto?

Reed: Alex and I had seen headlines about senior folks on Wall Street making bank on personal crypto trades. We were curious what junior bankers and financial advisors were up to — and how their firms might be thinking about oversight. Wall Street typically has a lot of rules around what workers can invest in but we discovered that few have any guidelines in place right now that pertain to digital assets.







How are these Wall Streeters able to get around red tape and invest in crypto?

Reed: Cryptocurrency is still very much an emerging asset class and many on Wall Street are scratching their heads over how to police it. Using digital wallets instead of their brokerage accounts is one avenue they're taking to buy crypto without having to turn over any information about their investments to their employers. But it's unclear how long this flexible environment may last.

How are banks responding to these crypto trades their employees are making?

Alex: It's something of a mixed bag but primarily it's watch and wait right now. Since most banks don't have significant business operations involving crypto they're not taking great pains to clamp down on employee trading. That could change if banks get the go-ahead from regulators to embrace digital currencies. We're already seeing some signs of this at places like Goldman Sachs which has been more eager to pursue crypto than some of its competitors.

In a moment when many are reevaluating their priorities and putting a greater emphasis on their mental health the story reflects a broader debate about startup culture. At Spring Health moving fast sometimes contradicted the self care it was selling.

Clubhouse was the breakout app of the pandemic a place for creators to talk over a trendy and social audio platform. But now the app is struggling to stay relevant and keep its users happy.

""No one really talks about it anymore"" one venture capitalist said. And it isn't for a lack of funding. Its user base is dwindling and so-called drama rooms are hobbling the app.

Here's what happened to the VC-darling app of the pandemic.

During the Reddit meme-stock boom earlier this year retail traders slated short-sellers as sworn enemies.

For example hydrogen is often used in the reaction between the chemical decomposition and the reuse of useful substances. More directly it can be combined with the collected CO2 to produce a variety of chemicals including methane” explains Mr Deguchi. “The chemical processes and bioprocesses that enable such carbon recycling are an extension of the technologies that chemical companies like Toray have accumulated over the years—and we view them as a great opportunity.”

Toray’s pursuit of the ultimate limits of technology and materials is making the production transportation storage and use of green hydrogen rapidly cost-competitive. The company’s breakthroughs are also making a genuinely circular economy possible.

Toray believes the next decade will become green hydrogen’s moment: as it becomes cost-competitive with rival energy sources in terms of production and distribution and more efficient and environmentally friendly thanks to sector coupling and carbon recycling. All of which underscores the company’s positive contribution to carbon neutrality solving global environmental problems and ensuring a safe and hygienic living environment for all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI4L2NoaW5lc2UtdGl0YW4tbGF2aXNoZWQtaHVudGVyLWJpZGVuLXdpdGgtMy1jYXJhdC1nZW0tb2ZmZXItb2YtMzAtbWlsbGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'More money than God': Chinese titan lavished Hunter Biden with 3-carat gem offer of $30 million,"The Biden family offered their services to a huge Chinese government-linked energy consortium to expand its business around the world. How do we know? Because of hundreds of emails documenting the deal found on Hunter Biden’s laptop left in a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. In her new book “Laptop from Hell” New York Post columnist Miranda Devine tells the tale:

James Gilliar a wiry 56-year-old British ex-SAS officer got to know Ye Jianming the 40-year-old chairman of CEFC when they were both working in the Czech Republic.

CEFC was a Chinese conglomerate one of the largest energy companies in the world.

Ye’s task was to spend $1.5 billion as quickly as possible to ensure the Czech Republic would become China’s “Gateway to the European Union” a priority of President Xi Jinping.

To that end Ye bought everything from a football team and a brewery to an airline before being named “special economic adviser” to Czech President Milos Zeman.

Now he was looking for an influential partner to help with acquisitions in other locations around the world that had strategic significance for the Chinese state.

Gilliar had an idea who could help: the Biden family.

Gilliar connected with Hunter Biden through trusted Biden family friend Rob Walker a former Clinton administration official whose wife Betsy Massey Walker had been Jill Biden’s assistant when she was second lady.

8 Miranda Devine’s book “Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden Big Tech and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide.”

Gilliar emailed Walker in February 2015 to praise Hunter’s appearance in Beijing at a board meeting of the fledgling investment fund Hunter had founded BHR.

“Hunter was great” Gilliar wrote to Walker. “True sheikh of Washington.”

He emailed Hunter a few weeks later: “It has been made clear to me that CEFC wish to engage in further business relations with our group.”

Gilliar knew CEFC was the capitalist arm of President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative to spread China’s influence — and debt traps — across the world. No Chinese company executed its goals more ardently than CEFC and its young chairman who was dubbed the “Belt and Road billionaire” in the press.

Chairman Ye had built his provincial energy company into a Fortune 500 colossus virtually overnight an achievement described by Chinese news agency Caixin as “another great enigma in the miraculous world of Chinese business.” He enjoyed the support of President Xi and was former deputy secretary general of the government’s propaganda arm the China Association for International Friendly Contacts.

In a rare interview with Caixin at CEFC’s palatial marble headquarters in Shanghai’s upscale French Concession District Ye was portrayed as a “hermit king” sitting on a golden chair in “a room that resembles a miniature Great Hall of the People.”

Uniformed staff members wearing earpieces glided by. “Most of them were young women wearing smart clothes and bright faces.”

Ye’s face was “as expressionless as a stone statue. Amidst the gilded surroundings his canvas shoes had an eye-catching plainness. …

“In his public activities as a private entrepreneur Ye Jianming is always walking alongside important foreign political figures. He has been photographed with world leaders such as Israeli President Peres Turkish President Erdogan Chadian President Déby and European Commission President Juncker. He has met with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Prime Minister of Bulgaria held a feast to welcome him.”

In the winter of 2015 Chairman Ye and CEFC Executive Director Jianjun Zang a.k.a. “Director Zang” flew to Washington DC. A meeting with Ye was scheduled in Hunter’s diary for December 7 2015 in a week that was a swirl of back-to-back Christmas parties hosted by Joe and Jill at the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory.

One of his former associates who spoke on condition of anonymity believes that Hunter brought Chairman Ye to meet Joe at one of those parties. There is no indication of any such meeting on the laptop but Hunter had a pattern of introducing business associates to Joe when they came to DC.

After a frustrating experience in another Chinese deal as a minority partner in private equity firm BHR in which the payday would not come until the end of the fund’s life Hunter and his uncle Jim Biden wanted more control of the CEFC partnership and a regular income stream.

Enter Tony Bobulinski. The naval officer-turned-wealthy institutional investor came highly recommended by Gilliar to build what they planned would be a world-class investment firm called SinoHawk named after Hunter’s late brother Beau’s favorite animal the hawk.

In December 2015 Gilliar told Bobulinski he needed help structuring a Chinese joint venture for “one of the most prominent families in the United States.”

The plan was to “build an investment firm like Goldman Sachs” he wrote in a WhatsApp message transcripts of which were obtained separately from the laptop.

“The family is the Biden family” Gilliar would soon disclose. Joe who had announced that he would not run for president in 2016 would be actively involved once he left office and the Bidens expected billions of dollars of projects to flow through the company Gilliar said.

He let Bobulinski in on the last piece of the puzzle in March 2016: The Bidens’ Chinese partner is CEFC which has “more money than God” he wrote. “This is the capital arm of one belt one road.”

At about this time Bobulinski was introduced to Rob Walker who told him he was “a proxy for Hunter Biden Jim Biden and the Bidens around the world.”

Finally in February 2017 Gilliar sent Bobulinski a WhatsApp message saying he wanted to introduce him to his “partner.”

“Who is your partner?” asked Bobulinski.

“Hunter Biden” replied Gilliar.

Bobulinski was leery. “I understand you want me to … help drive things in the US but Hunter is [already] here.”

Gilliar: “Money there intent there … skill sets missing … We need to create the best deal platform in history and they haven’t got a clue.” Bobulinski didn’t like the fact Hunter “was kicked out of US Navy for cocaine use.”

“But he’s super smart” said Gilliar. “Just a lot of under achievers around them using their name. Has a few demons but u are used to those right?”

Bobulinski asked: “Is he the decision maker or the Chinese?”

Gilliar: “New platform. Best discuss face to face but I’m the driver.”

Later Bobulinski asked: “Ok who is putting up the $10MM [million]?”

Gilliar: “Joint vehicle — half us and then equally split — money is already in. Discuss more face to face.”

8 Ye Jianming chairman of Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC gave Hunter Biden a 3.16-carat diamond estimated to be worth $80000.

Three weeks after his father left office in 2017 Hunter flew to Miami with Gilliar and Walker to meet Chairman Ye who was there for the Miami International Boat Show.

They booked into the $700-a-night beachfront Nobu Hotel on Monday Feb. 13 2017 and scheduled lunch with the Chinese for Thursday in a private room set for 10 at the Bourbon Steak restaurant in the ritzy JW Marriott Turnberry Resort & Spa where Ye was staying with his entourage.

But Hunter flew home the day before the lunch. He already had met with Ye over a private dinner on Tuesday night at which the CEFC chairman made him an offer too good to refuse: $10 million a year for a minimum of three years for “introductions alone” as Hunter would later assert in an imperious email to CEFC executives.

Ye sealed the new alliance with a rich gift — a 3.16-carat diamond worth $80000. Photographs of the stunning stone appear on Hunter’s laptop along with a grading report that lists it as a “round brilliant” of Grade F with prime “VS2” clarity and “excellent” cut.

8 Photos of the 3.16-carat diamond were found on Hunter Biden’s laptop.

The gift could not have come at a better time. Hunter was in the middle of an ugly divorce from Kathleen and his office manager Joan Peugh had just sent him the latest in a series of overdue bills a tax collection notice from the District of Columbia for $47226.78.

Hunter would tell the New Yorker’s Adam Entous that he had flown to Miami to meet Chairman Ye purely for charitable purposes hoping to secure a donation to World Food Program USA the nonprofit on whose board he served and which he had used before as a cover for his foreign business activities.

Hunter said it was just chance that the altruistic encounter “turned to business opportunities” and claimed to be surprised when Ye gave him the diamond. He didn’t mention the happy coincidence that his business partners Gilliar and Walker were with him in Miami to clinch a business deal with CEFC.

But the diamond was just an appetizer.

Nine days after Hunter’s meeting in Miami with Ye $3 million was wired into an account for Rob Walker’s company Robinson Walker LLC from State Energy HK Limited a Shanghai-based company linked to CEFC according to an inquiry by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).

On March 1 another $3 million was wired to Robinson Walker by the same company. Both transactions were flagged by the Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement network in a “suspicious activity report” filed with the Senate committees as “Confidential Document 16.”

Using the document as a source the Grassley-Johnson report of Nov. 18 2020 says: “At the time of the transfers State Energy HK Limited was affiliated with CEFC China Energy which was under the leadership of Ye Jianming. In the past State Energy HK Limited transferred funds to at least one company associated with Hunter Biden’s business associate Gongwen Dong …

“These transactions are a direct link between Walker and the communist Chinese government and because of his close association with Hunter Biden yet another tie between Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements and the communist Chinese government.”

The Senate report concluded it was “unclear what the true purpose is behind these transactions [$6 million from CEFC] and who the ultimate beneficiary is.”

We know from the laptop that Hunter received regular payments from Robinson Walker. One document lists $56603.74 from Robinson Walker as income for Rosemont Seneca Advisors between June and December 2017.

Rob Walker paid at least $511000 to Hunter’s firm Owasco in 2017 according to an email from Hunter’s tax accountant Bill Morgan.

Walker told Bobulinski his role in CEFC was “being a surrogate for H [Hunter] or Jim when gauging opportunities i.e. digging around in Texas on high speed rail with some of my republican friends … or hitting new countries and contacts abroad where things are lukewarm but not hot enough for H to close or too odd for H to be present …”

8 An Aug. 3 2018 photo of Hunter Biden in bed at Palms Casino Resort Vegas was found on his laptop.

On March 5 2017 Page Six broke the news that Hunter and his brother’s widow Hallie were an item.

When Hunter didn’t show up for a scheduled meeting three days later in New York Gilliar told Bobulinski it didn’t matter: “In brand he’s imperative but right now he’s not essential for adding input to business.”

It was at this point that Gilliar explained to Bobulinski that the Chinese involved in CEFC were “intelligence so they understand the value added” of the Biden name.

Bobulinski remained troubled by Hunter’s scandals and Gilliar who was in Australia with Director Zang looking for acquisitions was worried he might pull out. So he arranged for him to meet Hunter the following month at the Chateau Marmont in Bobulinski’s hometown of LA.

They met by the hotel pool in April and spoke for two hours while Hunter chain-smoked. Bobulinski found him respectful and polite. Hunter boasted that he had his father’s ear and could bypass his advisers.

Hunter told Bobulinski how the joint venture vehicle should be structured and expressed caution about US laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) which prohibits businesses paying bribes to foreign officials. He appeared to conflate that law with the Foreign Agents Registration Act a 1938 anti-spying law that requires anyone acting as a lobbyist for a foreign power to register with the US government as a foreign agent.

“No matter what it will need to be a US company at some level in order for us to make bids on federal and state funded projects” Hunter wrote later.

“Also we don’t want to have to register as foreign agents under the FCPA which is much more expansive than people who should know choose not to know.

“Regardless we should have a … company called CEFC America and ownership should be 50 me 50 them. We then cut up our 50 [percent] in a separate entity between the 4 of us.”

Hunter seemed focused but Bobulinski was puzzled about Uncle Jim’s frequent meddling in CEFC business.

For instance in April 2017 Jim pulled strings at New York’s elite Horace Mann School to get Director Zang’s daughter Rouqi fast-tracked for entry although she ended up enrolling in another school.

Jim also wrote a letter on behalf of CEFC to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo requesting a meeting. “We intend to discuss potential projects and investments in New York.” He listed the other attendees as Hunter Chairman Ye Director Zang and an unnamed “Member of the Royal Family of Luxembourg.”

“What is the deal w Jim Biden as he wasn’t part of the discussion but now seems a focal point?” Bobulinski asked Gilliar. “What role does Jim see himself playing?”

“Consultant is what he’s offered as [far as] I know” Gilliar replied. “He [Hunter] brought in Jim simply to leverage getting more equity for himself and family in the final hour that is evident.”

In another WhatsApp message Gilliar told Bobulinski: “With H [Hunter’s] demons could be good to have a backup he [Jim] strengthens our USP [unique selling point] to Chinese as it looks like a truly family business and I like the dude.”

With the deal progressing Hunter told Bobulinski it’s time for the next step.

“I want Dad to meet you” he said.

Rasham Marketplace a grocery-takeout place opened this month at 770 Farmington Ave.

The shop owned by Talet and Javaria Peracha and managed by their son Talal Peracha sells foods from Pakistan India the Middle East and Europe and halal beef lamb chicken goat and sucuk sausage. Fish popular in the Indian subcontinent are available such as rahu pomfret katla hilsa and kingfish.

At the deli counter in back Peracha sells samosas chats shish nihari tikka masala tandoori chana masala soups and rice. The takeout food made by Peracha’s parents at the South Windsor eatery is cold and can be reheated at home.

At the deli counter in front sweets are sold including jalebi milk cake ladoo baklava and mango lassi.

Rasham is the word for silk and it also is the name of Talal Peracha’s grandmother. He is a native of Rawalpindi Pakistan and now lives in Tolland.

Rasham Market is where the popular Cosmos International Indian market used to be. In acquiring the property the Perachas returned to a place that was important to them in their early days in the country.

“The family that owned Cosmos helped South Asian people fill out their immigration and naturalization forms because the forms are difficult to understand and if you make a mistake it stalls the process for a long time” Talal Peracha said. “My parents came to them for help with our naturalization forms.”

In its first few weeks he has benefited from Cosmos’ loyal customer base in the area. “We’re trying to keep up with Cosmos” Peracha said. “We’re happy people can come here and buy the things they were able to buy there and a few other things too.”

The shelves and freezers are full of specialty groceries from all over the world that would be difficult to find in mainstream stores: several varieties of ghee tamarind chutney mustard oil rose petal preserves pomegranate molasses date syrup cheeses from Syria and Bulgaria paratha naan kulcha.

The market is in its early days.

The spirit of innovation is again taking wing in Parkville with a new push by city leaders and the private sector to foster a 21st-century hotbed of startups particularly in advance manufacturing and cost-saving technology for the insurance industry. This they say is a good fit with arts and culture that have thrived in Parkville for years.

The plans envision a neighborhood of not only early-stage companies but new apartments more restaurants a parking garage and entertainment venues — all existing together in a campus-like atmosphere a short walk from Pope Park and West Hartford’s Park Road.

Carlos Mouta stands on the balcony of the building next to Parkville Market where a second phase of the market is planned. Mouta would be a key developer in the neighborhood’s innovation initiative but other developers will be needed.

“We could be a Brooklyn a small Brooklyn” said Carlos Mouta a longtime developer in the neighborhood and the force behind the thriving Parkville Market. “So when I tell people I want to Brooklyn-ize Parkville I’m not ashamed. I don’t mind copying what other successful people have done.”

Mouta’s $70 million conversion of the sprawling former Whitney Manufacturing Co. on the corner of Bartholomew Avenue and Hamilton Street could be one of the first projects in the new innovation district perhaps early next year.

The 290000-square-foot 3-story factory — about as much space as a Walmart Supercenter — would include 80000 square feet for startups; short-term co-living space for start-up visitors; 189 mixed-income apartments; restaurants and a beer garden.

A tattered flag flutters in the wind around the building at 237 Hamilton Street where it intersects with Bartholomew Avenue. A redevelopment of the former Whitney Manufacturing Co. is expected to include 80000 square feet of startup space and 189 apartments.

A significant boost could come to the district if the city is successful in vying for up to $50 million in grants over five years from the state’s “Innovation Corridor” program launched in October. The program is part of Gov. Ned Lamont’s broader “economic action” program to spur the state’s economy add jobs and revitalize cities.

The Innovation Corridor program stipulates that its funding contribute no more than 20% to a project ensuring that there is strong financial commitment from other sources. The requirement seeks to make sure projects are economically viable.

Martin Guay vice president of development at New Britain-based Stanley Black & Decker said it is logical for Hartford to focus on manufacturing because of its roots in the industry.

But it also makes sense Guay said because New Haven has carved out life sciences and Stamford is focusing on digital.

Stanley Black & Decker the tool and equipment storage giant has partnered with the city of Hartford on the creation of the Parkville innovation district and is also a prominent corporate leader statewide in encouraging the growth of businesses that could result in more jobs.

“What the city gets — and the neighborhood — are projects that are invested in the city” Guay said. “Because ultimately the people of the city need to win for the strategy to be viable. And the way they win are permanent good-paying jobs and benefits that are created over time.”

Stanley would likely benefit from working with the start-ups in the new district. The company has shown a willingness to collaborate with other companies. Its decision to hire HCL Technologies to handle its IT led to HCL establishing a presence in downtown Hartford with the promise of 200 jobs for the city.

Natural light pours in from glass ceilings inside an area of the former Whitney Manufacturing Co. owned by developer Carlos Mouta. Space for startup companies is planned for this area of the former now vacant factory.

Stanley Black & Decker had already taken a strong interest in Hartford. The manufacturer has established an advance manufacturing accelerator downtown and recently took the first steps in helping finance downtown apartment development.

Parkville is especially suited to an innovation district proponents say because it has the buildings though some are vacant others blighted. It also is close to amenities such as the Parkville Market which is expanding and a CTfastrak bus station. The area also is located in an Opportunity Zone.

Obtaining financing through tax credits the Capital Region Development Authority private lenders and other sources still will certainly present a hefty hurdle to clear. CRDA funding for instance through the State Bond Commission has slowed as Lamont has pulled back on borrowing through the sale of bonds.

The effort also will require more developers getting involved to diversify the sources of investment.

The Trinity College chapel is framed by a fourth-floor window destined to illuminate apartments planned for the former Whitney Manufacturing Co. building in Hartford’s Parkville neighborhood.

But Guay said he is optimistic that the first signs of redevelopment could come next year with the district unfolding over the next five to seven years.

While an overall strategy for redevelopment is crucial it will be equally important to just get a few projects off the ground to create a buzz.

“We need to hit singles and doubles before we hit the grand slam” said Peter Denious chief executive of AdvanceCT a private nonprofit that seeks to foster business development in the state. “Let’s agree on step one use that as the ‘Hey look this is happening. This is real’ and build that and get it done. Then this begins to take on a life of its own.”

Building momentum

For years Parkville has been a rising star for arts and culture in Hartford.

Real Art Ways the contemporary arts center on Arbor Street has been in the neighborhood since 1989 and two weeks ago announced a $15 million expansion.

Two weeks ago Real Art Ways announced it would acquire the building at 56 Arbor St. in Hartford’s Parkville neighborhood as part of a $15 million expansion. The building is a former typewriter factory.

While the Parkville Market has grabbed a lot of attention in the past year and is now planning an expansion the Hog River Brewery and the Know Good Market a monthly food festival have been staples.

The neighborhood certainly has been on the radar. Last year the “Parkville Arts and Innovation District” was listed as one of 10 projects that could transform the city by the time Hartford reaches its 400th anniversary in 2035.

The start of a new wave of innovation gained early momentum as reSET a business incubator and accelerator took space in 2015 in the redeveloped Hartford Rubber Works building at the corner of Bartholomew Avenue and Park Street.

Sarah Bodley reSET’s executive director said she expects the concentration of innovation and start-ups broadly in Parkville will accelerate the momentum.

“One thing that is really unique about co-working and the accelerator model you get to build that energy when you are in a group of entrepreneurs who are all tackling big hairy problems together” Bodley said.

Parkville Market offers a model for start-ups experimenting with new ideas or expansion to a second location said Michael W. Freimuth CRDA’s executive director.

There isn’t the barrier of a big investment up front or signing of a long-term lease Freimuth said.

“If someone fails it’s part of the system” Freimuth said. “So you want to nurture that concept for the neighborhood. So that’s what’s going on here. Stanley may be doing it in manufacturing and the Parkville Market in the food industry.”

“Others will try in other technologies. Maybe some service businesses will come out of it. That’s what rebuilds the economy. That’s getting back down to the nuts and bolts of it and that’s what exciting about Parkville.”

Space to grow

On a recent morning Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin walked along Bartholomew Avenue talking about how the street could form the “spine” of the innovation initiative.

While walking Bartholomew Avenue Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin at right talks with heavy equipment operator Patrick Conneely. A streetscape project is underway with new sidewalks in front of the former Whitney Manufacturing Co. targeted for a $70 million redevelopment.

Parkville Market sits at one end of Bartholomew and at the other end the 34-acre former scrap metal junkyard just taken over by the city. On the quarter-mile in between are buildings — including Mouta’s factory building — that could be part of the new district.

As he walks Bronin points to a parking lot just past the corner of Bartholomew and Park with an old factory boiler building to the rear bearing the name of the long-gone Spaghetti Warehouse restaurant.

The parking lot also owned by Mouta would be ideal for a 350-space parking garage “wrapped” with apartments and storefront space Bronin said. The boiler building could become part of the project with more residential rentals he said.

“There is a need for parking in this neighborhood” Bronin said. “You know that if you come to Parkville Market at lunch or dinner time. But like we’re trying to elsewhere in the city we’re hopeful that structured parking could open up other development opportunities.”

An abandoned conveyer belt is shown in a file photo from this summer of one of several structures on a 34-acre industrial site in the Parkville neighborhood. The property was foreclosed on by the city in August.

All together the three components could cost more than $50 million according to preliminary estimates.

Bronin said the area also offers the rare opportunity for start-up space to be next to the 34-acre tract that would be appropriate for larger scale development while at the same time creating places for people to live.

“There is the space to do those side-by-side here in a way there isn’t anywhere else in the city” Bronin said.

Bronin said he doesn’t see gentrification as an overriding concern in Parkville because so many buildings are vacant so residents won’t be displaced.

“It helps lift up the neighborhood and if we are successful it creates not just a vibrant neighborhood where people can live and play but also a neighborhood where they can work” Bronin said.

Other opportunities also exist: a closer integration with the adjoining West Hartford neighborhood little more than a block away; and an extension of Bartholomew all the way to Flatbush Avenue and a quick entrance to I-91 long sought by the neighborhood.

Peeling paint and bare floors are exposed inside an area of the former Whitney Manufacturing Co building at the corner of Hamilton Street and Bartholomew Avenue in Parkville. Apartments are planned for the space.

Buildings now occupied by other companies also could well figure into the district in the future.

For example Champlin Packrite a packaging company at 81 Bartholomew had discussed a sale of its 80000-square-foot building to Real Art Ways several years ago. But RAW decided to buy the building it had leased on Arbor Street as part of its recently-announced expansion.

But Rory Poole Champlin’s chief executive said the company still is looking to consolidate and expand its plant in Manchester. The building which once housed steel-tube manufacturing for Columbia bicycles has been occupied by Champlin since 1931.

Of a potential sale Poole said “I think it will be coming somewhat soon.”

Leasing start-ups

At the former Whitney factory Mouta hopes to lease start-ups with space between 2000 to 3000 square feet with his thought being that as companies grow they will stay in the city perhaps moving to new larger space on the nearby 34 acres.

Mouta said he expects to start conversion of the factory building early next year with redevelopment spread out over two or three years. The creation of the startup space is the first priority Mouta said.

He is still lining up financing but Mouta said he believes he is close to winning up to $30 million in tax credits. Mouta expects bank financing will be $28 million to $30 million.

A rendering shows the facade of the former Whitney Manufacturing Co. building at the corner of Bartholomew Street and Hamilton Street after a $70 million redevelopment.

Along with startups and new neighborhood residents he sees cultural diversity among shop owners and restaurateurs as key to revitalization.

Mouta immigrated with his family to Hartford from Mozambique in 1975 and grew up in Parkville. Mouta says he’s come up against plenty of naysayers on his projects in Parkville where he has concentrated building efforts since the late 1980s. But he said he’s proven them wrong and the push for the innovation district is the latest evidence.

“I’m happy that Parkville finally — finally — is getting what it deserves” Mouta said “meaning that I’ve only been doing this in this neighborhood since 1989.”

Joe movies.

Fast forward a couple of years and with Hasbro adding Entertainment One to its portfolio the company opted to pull the plug on the Paramount project but retain Entwistle to oversee a new shared Power Rangers universe of TV series and movies which Deadline is reporting has now found a home at Netflix.

“Since we set up Power Rangers with Jonathan we pitched really a whole-world approach” states EOne’s President of Global Television Michael Lombardo who previously served as President of Programming at HBO. “It’s not just one show it is shows followed by films some kids’ programming. We have found a great writing partner for him they are off. Knock on wood Netflix is excited we’re excited we hope to have some news soon.”

A press release from Mission Health announced the installation of a Pneumatic Tube System at the hospital located in Highlands.

The release noted that HCA Healthcare CEO Sam Hazen visited Highlands-Cashiers Hospital last December asking employees what would help them take better care of their patients.

Staff responded almost unanimously saying they could greatly benefit from a tube station.

The release adds that before the installation of the tube system ER nurses would have to routinely leave the ER to walk a specimen to the lab.

""With the newly installed tube system team members – and patients - are now benefiting from the elimination of this step in the patient care process"" the news release says.

MUSC filed the lawsuit in state court on Monday against six of its departing doctors and HCA Healthcare which owns North Charleston-based Trident Medical Center.

Charleston-based MUSC wants a judge to halt what it termed the ""wholesale departure of physicians nurses technicians staff and fellows"" from the hospital's head and neck oncology division to Trident's new facility in an effort to impede MUSC's ability to compete news outlets reported.

The doctors sought information including case logs patient lists and other data that belongs to MUSC in the months leading up to and after they announced their resignations the medical research university alleged in a complaint.

It would take Trident eight to 10 years to independently develop the ""misappropriated confidential and proprietary information"" that MUSC has the latter claimed in court documents.

Trident has denied MUSC's claims.

""Physicians frequently move their practice locations and affiliations"" the health system said in a written statement to ""We are well-positioned to care for head and neck patients and are excited these physicians have chosen to be part of the Trident team. This last-minute lawsuit appears to be an effort to keep patients away from their doctors.""

MUSC says it is in the public interest for a judge to stop the plan because the hospital is a public university hospital and research institution whereas Trident is private and for-profit.

MUSC is seeking a hearing on the preliminary injunction before Dec. 1 the day the six defendant physicians will stop working at the hospital.",,,,,,,,,

Do you have dreams of your family going down waterslides while you relax by a fancy heated pool with a cocktail but you can't justify a whole vacation spent paying for an expensive resort just to sit by the pool for a day or two? There's an app for that. Or rather there are websites that sell day passes to popular resorts so you can stay wherever you want but play at the poshest pools around.

My family uses these sites to book resort days on cruises when we are in ports we have already explored extensively in the past. However this day pass system is far from reserved for cruisers. It is alive and well in places like Miami and Hawaii too where most folks arrive by plane. Using a resort pass you could stay at an Airbnb or more budget hotel and then spend a day of your vacation living it up at the pool and beach of a pricier resort. Or you could book a day pass as part of a ""staycation"" closer to home since even some hotels in metro areas such as New York City have pool day passes available.

My colleague Betsy Eccles was in need of a reset recently and tested out a day pass at Walt Disney's Swan Hotel in Orlando. Here's her report:

The pool at Disney's Swan Hotel. (Photo courtesy of the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort)

""While working alone in Charlotte has its perks I recently decided to venture out and come work remotely in Orlando for a month. Being a big Disney fan (annual passholder and all) Orlando just seemed like the right place. I was able to find a rental close to the theme parks and with mild February temperatures thought it was the perfect time to come. Unexpectedly Orlando is unseasonably warm. Seeing that it was going to reach almost 90 degrees last weekend I knew a day at the parks would be way too hot to be enjoyable. Ironically enough I saw an Instagram ad pop up for ResortPass so I checked it out. It had the [Disney] Swan and Dolphin resort listed as a potential place to get pool access.

""For $25 I was guaranteed a reserved chair at the pool of my choosing (they have a few) access to the fitness center pool bar and grill. When I arrived I followed the instructions (ResortPass' pre-communication was excellent) and checked in. I was escorted to my chair and given the rundown of everything. I stored my backpack in one of the lockers in the fitness center right beside the pool so it wasn't in the sun all day. They've made it easy with the ability to walk up to the pool bar to order drinks or use mobile ordering from your chair for food and beverages. After a few hours of sun and cocktails I showered in the locker room (which was very clean and updated) changed into other clothes and headed to the theme park.

""It was a wonderful experience and I cannot recommend it enough. I even tried to book again for Sunday but they were already sold out I did rebook for a day in two weeks with my friend who is coming to visit. It's a great option for those that don't have annual passes and are being a bit more money conscious [but] still want a Disney-esqe experience.

""As for masks you do not have to wear one in the pool or while laying out in your chair (all chairs are spaced apart) but do [need to] wear one walking to the bar or bathrooms. Everyone did a great job of following the guidelines and I felt safe.""

How does a resort day pass work?

With a resort day pass you typically pay a flat rate — either per person or per cabana — that includes access to the hotel's recreational amenities. Some passes kick it up a notch in the value department to include a food and beverage credit for on-site dining venues and/or transportation to and from the port if cruisers are the target demographic.

Some resort day passes even include a private hotel room for your family's use during the day. In more urban areas the pass may only include use of the pool and/or fitness center. (Spa passes are also available for adults.)

It's best to reserve your day passes in advance since they are capacity-controlled. If you just show up at the resort you might be turned away if its allotment of passes has already sold out for that day. Most often the resort's recreation department handles day pass clients so you'll usually check in at the recreation desk near the pool or in the spa/fitness area.

Apps and Sites That Sell Resort Day Passes

There are a handful of sites that sell resort day passes. Start with a search of these sites:

ResortPass: Perhaps the gold standard among resort day pass purveyors for U.S.-based hotels ResortPass works with the major hoteliers including Hilton Hyatt (including Miraval) IHG Marriott (and many of its brands from The Ritz-Carlton to Moxy) Omni Fairmont Four Seasons and more. Day passes start at $25 per person.

This site works with many resorts right here in the U.S. including in California Florida Hawaii Arizona Texas and New York. If you sign up for its newsletter you'll be notified when new hotels are added.

Its list of overseas options was meager — just six Mexico resorts and eight in the Caribbean. So if you're looking for day passes beyond the U.S. one of the other options below will be a better fit for you.

Daycation: While Daycation's footprint is smaller than ResortPass it's got some nice options in the U.S. and beyond. Resort brands include Kimpton Fairmont COMO Marriott Hilton Park Hyatt and others. With Daycation you can purchase day passes as well as rent cabanas.

In the U.S. most of Daycation's resort day pass options are in Florida with more than a dozen options in the Miami Beach area. Some of the standout options in that area are the Tidal Cove Waterpark at the JW Marriott Miami Turnberry Resort & Spa ($65/day) and SLS South Beach (day passes starting at $40 per person or cabanas for up to six people starting at $375).

If you're outside the U.S. here are some of the standout offerings:

Bahamas: Breezes Bahamas Resort & Spa British Colonial Hilton Nassau and Warwick Paradise Island Bahamas.

Breezes Bahamas Resort & Spa British Colonial Hilton Nassau and Warwick Paradise Island Bahamas. Caribbean: Scrub Island Resort Spa & Marina Autograph Collection (British Virgin Islands) The Westin Punta Cana Resort & Club (Dominican Republic) Bay Gardens Beach Resort (St. Lucia) Eagle Aruba Resort & Casino and others.

Costa Rica: Selina Manuel Antonio Selina Puerto Viejo Selina Santa Teresa and Selina La Fortuna.

Selina Manuel Antonio Selina Puerto Viejo Selina Santa Teresa and Selina La Fortuna. Mexico: Selina Cancun Lagoon Hz Selina Playa del Carmen Allegro Cozumel Melia Cozumel Golf and Occidental Cozumel.

DayPass: If you're looking to spend a day at an all-inclusive or luxury property DayPass may have what you're looking for though its inventory isn't very extensive.

It includes destinations such as Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the Middle East; Indonesia's Bali Thailand's Koh Samui and Singapore in Southeast Asia; Punta Cana and San Juan in the Caribbean; and Miami Beach and Port St. Lucie in Florida.

The day passes on offer are interesting though. Properties of note include the InterContinental Abu Dhabi (from AED 99 per day) the Hard Rock Hotel Tenerife (from 40 euros per day) and the Park Hyatt Siem Reap (from $30 per day).

Closer to home check out the all-inclusive day pass to the Club Med Sandpiper Bay in Port Saint Lucie Florida. It's $120 per person and includes lunch dinner and all the resort's amenities including four pools.

Resort for a Day: You need to be a cruise traveler to book a resort day pass from this company.

Its portfolio includes resorts in Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic Antigua Aruba Bahamas Barbados Bermuda Cabo San Lucas and Cozumel in Mexico Curacao Grand Cayman Grenada Hawaii Jamaica La Romana in the Dominican Republic Puerto Vallarta in Mexico San Juan in Puerto Rico St. Kitts St. Lucia St. Martin – and even a few resorts in Florida cruise ports like Fort Lauderdale and Miami.

While Resort for a Day usually sells Atlantis Aquaventure Waterpark passes day passes can currently be purchased in advance directly from the resort.

Day Passes: The sister site to Resort for a Day Day Passes is for non-cruise travelers but offers access to many of the same resorts.

Essentially serving the same destinations as Resort for a Day listed above Day Passes has some standout resorts including all-inclusive and adults-only options that will make for the perfect day in the sun. In Jamaica for example two Hyatt all-inclusive resorts are available Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara both starting at $132 per adult. In Bermuda the Elbow Beach Resort is available at $74 per person.

A real-world example in Miami

When TPG studied the lists of resort day passes that can be purchased across the above-mentioned services we were impressed. There are some terrific options for families that will allow them to punch above their weight class and use a day pass to gain access to some pretty cool resorts.

I was interested to see Tidal Cove Waterpark was available as a day pass from several of the companies we've talked about. Marriott spent millions renovating The JW Marriott Turnberry Resort & Spa and it added this incredible waterpark in the process. The kids' pool is 4000 square feet and there are seven waterslides a FlowRider surf simulator a meandering lazy river and 25 luxury cabanas. This could be the perfect way to spend a pre-cruise day if you're departing on a Disney Cruise Line Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise out of PortMiami. (Read a comparison of those three family-friendly cruise lines.)

ResortPass Daycation and the DayPass all offer day admission to Tidal Cove Waterpark though we noticed different pricing across the companies. ResortPass had certain dates starting at $55 per person for a Resort Membership Day Pass but that rate fluctuated between $125 and $250 for various weekends throughout 2021. DayPass and Daycation rates seem to also be between $125 and $250 any day of the week. Across the board kids under 3 are allowed in free and taxes and fees may differ across the companies.

JW Marriott own entry rates to the waterpark start at $55 for guests when access to the waterpark isn't already included in the room package.

This resort just unveiled the waterpark and there are some decent packages available to stay on site. However later in the year the per night cost creeps up. At that point you may be better off staying somewhere like the Holiday Inn Port of Miami – Downtown less than 2 miles from PortMiami from around $150–$170/night and then buying a pass to spend your pre-cruise day at the waterpark.

Call the Resort Directly

If you're traveling and want to book a day pass at a resort but it's not listed at any of the booking sites don't give up. Call the hotel directly and inquire about the availability of day passes. That approach has worked for my family in the past and it's also a great opportunity to negotiate for the hotel to throw in a day room if you're visiting during low season. It never hurts to ask.

Right now some resorts have capacity restrictions due to COVID-19 so you may need to call more than one resort to find one with availability on your preferred date.

Bottom Line

Depending on where you're traveling or how your family prefers to spend its vacation days a resort day pass may be a terrific solution. Day passes can also be a terrific way to sample a resort to determine if your crew would like to vacation there at some point in the future – or to simply have a great afternoon at the pool.

The Shanghai Club

The building started out as the Shanghai Club a British gentlemen’s club (the first in the city in fact) back in 1861. It wasn’t even the second decade of the International Settlement and Shanghai had been besieged by the Taiping rebels. Foreign troops allied with the Qing army repelled the rebels the following year despite being outnumbered. None of that commotion seems to have hindered the British elite from establishing a club to sip tea play pool and celebrate fortunes made by getting roaring drunk.

The historic building that stands there now however was only built in 1910 after the club’s original headquarters were torn down. British architect Betram H. Tarrant designed the exterior in an English Renaissance Baroque Revival style with Corinthian columns and arched windows on a whitewashed façade. The interior design was the work of Japanese architect Shimoda Kikutaro.

The Long Bar

Apart from ballrooms smoking rooms and its large library the Club’s most famed area was the so-called Long Bar; at 110 feet (33.5 meters) long it was the pinnacle of luxury. If the Shanghai Club was the utmost expression of Shanghailander (as they called themselves) high society then the Long Bar was a microcosm within this palace of wealth. The Club’s membership was the most exclusive in Shanghai and with it came a social hierarchy.

How did you know where you stood? This became apparent at the bar. As the Waldorf’s June Seah puts it “The crème de la crème of Shanghai enjoyed the privilege of sitting on the east end of the bar which accorded a view of the Huangpu. Moving from one end of the Long Bar to the other signified an elevation of status.”

Throughout the decadent but golden age of the Pearl of the Orient in the 1920s and 30s the Club embodied the lavish urbanism of the age as well as the oppressive power and elitism of the Shanghailanders.

From Glamour and Glitz to... Fried Chicken

It would all end sooner than many expected. When the International Settlement was occupied by the Japanese in December 1941 the Shanghai Club came to house the invaders. Upon the Communist takeover it was remodeled as the International Seamen Club catering to foreign sailors.

In 1971 became the Shanghai Dongfeng Hotel. And then on November 28 1990 the building earned a dubious claim to fame by opening the first KFC in the city. China’s first KFC had opened next to Tiananmen Square three years earlier. Both restaurants were a hit from day one.

Hungry customers enjoy KFC at the Shanghai Dongfeng Hotel — what is now the Waldorf Astoria

By the time Hilton Worldwide bought the building in the late 2000s and as the city was undergoing a dramatic makeover for the 2010 World Expo it was a shadow of its former self. The inside was abandoned and dusty.

Waldorf-Astoria Shanghai on the Bund

Like a phoenix rising 101 years after its inauguration the building opened once again as the Waldorf-Astoria Shanghai on the Bund entirely renovated and including a reconstructed Long Bar. The Royal Asiatic Society even reopened its library although it isn’t accessible to the public. No longer under the shroud of exclusivity but as opulent as ever No. 2 on the Bund has been restored to its former glory."

Four men have been arrested in connection with theft at a Home Depot in California where as many as 10 people entered the store Friday night and left with a range of stolen tools according to law enforcement officials.

The incident took place at approximately 8 p.m. local time in Lakewood Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department Deputy Miguel Meza told CNN. Lakewood is a city in Los Angeles County.

The thieves made off with hammers sledgehammers crowbars and other tools. After grabbing the items they ran out of the store and got into a getaway car parked outside Meza said.

The theft comes as similar tools have been used in a number of smash-and-grab robberies at high-end stores in several major US cities this month.

At least 18 people broke into a Nordstrom department store in Los Angeles Monday night and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise the city’s police chief said. Similar crimes have been reported in the San Francisco Bay Area Chicago and other cities.

Saturday Beverly Hills police officers spotted a red vehicle with front-end collision damage matching the description of a vehicle believed to be connected to the flash mob theft in Lakewood according to a news release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

While conducting a traffic stop to investigate the vehicle officers found new tools inside the car “possibly from Home Depot” according to the news release.

The four men in the vehicle whose ages range from 19 to 22 were detained and later taken into custody by Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office detectives and booked for conspiracy to commit burglary officials said.

“There are still several more suspects and suspect vehicles being sought in this flash mob burglary and many more like it” read the release.

Three of the men will have their initial court appearances on Tuesday Bellflower California.

Officers from the Beverly Hills Police Department received a call regarding several vehicles driving with no license plates near Beverly Drive and Dayton Way just after 9 p.m. Friday Sgt. Jeff Newman of the Beverly Hills Police Department said.

Officers made a traffic stop on one of them and soon took the suspects into custody.

""We're currently working with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to see if there is a link to the Lakewood Home Depot incident or any other crimes that have been committed"" Newman said.

Approximately eight males entered the store at 7:46 p.m. Friday walked directly to the tool isle and stole various sledgehammers crowbars and hammers said Deputy Miguel Meza of the Sheriff's Information Bureau.

Store employees said a group of up to 20 males from 15 to 20 years old pulled up to the store in up to 10 cars put on ski masks and began stealing sledgehammers and crowbars.

The group possibly entered a red Mercedes-Benz with severe damage to the front and fled Meza said.

Quite big words spoken by Mike Madsen Honeywell Aerospace CEO back in October but since they come from one of the best companies in this business we tend to kind of believe them. And that belief is reinforced even more by the initial details available on this little something called Anthem.Every (boy) child dreams at one point in his life about becoming a pilot. About having the ability to control winged metal beasts that move through the air faster than a little brain considers even possible the skill to perform aerobatics and the audacity of shooting down enemies.Then said child grows up and either finds out that for whatever reason he cannot be a pilot or becomes one and realizes being a pilot is a much more complicated and less romantic job than dreamt of.If you go and search on specialized websites for pilot job openings you’ll find under responsibilities a very long list of things to do other than actually flying. Pilots have to create a flight plan ensure the fuel levels carry out pre-flight checks and even “ensure noise regulations are followed during take-off and landing” as one post states. At the end of each flight the aircraft’s logbook must be filled and a report filed. And that's only the tip of the iceberg.All of that and much more needs to be done from inside or near the plane. So if for passengers a two-hour flight is a two-hour flight for a pilot it’s much longer and not nearly as relaxing.Most of this reality is the result of available technology which albeit very advanced at the moment still requires a hands-on approach. Luckily advancements made in recent years especially when it comes to connectivity might forever change piloting.Enter the Honeywell Anthem flight deck a piece of technology described as the “aviation industry's first cloud-connected cockpit system.” Emphasis of course on cloud-connected as that’s where the magic happens.Anthem is an always-on system that includes specialized software and hardware in the form of 2K resolution displays. Honeywell made it in such a way as to be scalable and suitable to a variety of aircraft types. Both the software and hardware can be customized to fit and suit anything from cargo planes to all those fancy new urban air mobility gizmos we keep hearing about including autonomous ones.The system is first and foremost meant to eliminate the need for the physical presence of pilots and even mechanics when performing some activities that can be done remotely such as the data transfer of maintenance status and flight plans.What’s more important is that the aircraft doesn’t even have to be powered on for pilots to gain remote access to info they need prior to a flight. From afar they can even load the flight plan or set up the flight deck.Another feature of the thing is that in brings into one place all individual support systems things like fuel maintenance or catering eliminating the need for multiple third-party apps or websites. The pilot can now simply notify all parties involved in due time (and you guessed it remotely) about the flight plan including about real-time changes caused by unforeseen events.Inside the cockpit Anthem presents itself as a “smartphone-like easy-to-use interface” whose layout can be customized and even reconfigured to display whatever info or metric the pilot deems necessary. It also uses what Honeywell calls the “cleanest most functional symbology available today.”Separately Anthem’s integrated web browser allows pilots to see inside the cockpit images from airports’ live weather cameras or live radar imagery. Hours before landing it can send data to maintenance crews about possible malfunctions so that the people on the ground are prepared with the required parts and tools as soon as the airplane arrives.The Anthem was just detailed by Honeywell earlier this year having been shown at the NBAA Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition in October so it’s not exactly widespread at the moment. The first companies to use it are Vertical Aerospace and Lilium for their VA-X4 and Lilium Jet  respectively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXJjZXNlY3VyaXR5LmNvbS9ob25leXdlbGwtc2VjdXJpdHktaGI0MXhkMi1jY3R2LWNhbWVyYS10ZWNobmljYWwtZGV0YWlscy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honeywell Security HB41XD2 CCTV camera Specifications | Honeywell Security CCTV cameras,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL25haXJhbWV0cmljcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yOC93aGF0LXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtaG9uZXl3ZWxsLWdyb3VwLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LXRyYW5zYWN0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLWFuZC10aGUtY29tcGFueXMtZnV0dXJlLXBsYW5zL9IBmAFodHRwczovL25haXJhbWV0cmljcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yOC93aGF0LXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtaG9uZXl3ZWxsLWdyb3VwLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LXRyYW5zYWN0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLWFuZC10aGUtY29tcGFueXMtZnV0dXJlLXBsYW5zLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What you need to know about Honeywell Group…the biggest transaction of the week,"Recently Honeywell Group Limited (HGL) announced a deal to combine Honeywell Flour Mills Plc one of its portfolio companies and FMN. The deal which is expected to go through before the end of 2021 is subject to regulatory approval. It will see Honeywell Group Limited transfer its 71.69% stake in Honeywell Flour Mills Plc to Flour Mills of Nigeria.

This transaction put Honeywell Group on the radar for many as many were conversant with Honeywell Flour Mills as opposed to the investment company and the parent company of the foods manufacturing company as well as many other companies.

Here are three important things you need to know about this deal and the company leading the transaction.

1. Honeywell Group – a leading investment company

Honeywell Group is a leading investment company that began as a food trading company servicing the West African region before pivoting to importing a variety of goods including dairy products stockfish glass and steel rods for the domestic Nigerian market.

It has evolved into an investment company participating in major sectors of the Nigerian economy including foods financial services telecommunications real estate leisure and hospitality energy infrastructure and security management in the past 49 years. Honeywell Group invests heavily in these industries through its portfolio companies such as Pivot Engineering Pivot Energy Services Group Pavilion Technology Ltd Uraga Real Estate (owners of Radisson Blu Anchorage Victoria Island) and strategic investments like Airtel Nigeria and Fan Milk which it has successfully exited.

And now the company has spearheaded an N80 billion agreement to ensure that Honeywell Flour Mills Plc (makers of the popular Honeywell Pasta Spaghetti Semolina etc.) will merge with the only company in the country that can create a food business that is better positioned to benefit the growing Nigerian population and leverage opportunities stemming from the African Continental Free Trade Area (“AfCFTA”).

2. The transaction brings together two of the largest food manufacturers in Nigeria

On its own Flour Mills of Nigeria is the largest flour milling company in Nigeria and has been operating for over 60 years. It began operations as a single flour mill in 1960 and has grown into a national conglomerate with an installed flour milling capacity of approximately 12000 metric tonnes per day. It serves Nigerians through a diversified food portfolio built upon five core food value chains: grains sweeteners oils and fats proteins and starches.

Honeywell has also proven to be a formidable force over time particularly in recent years. Its most recent financial results revealed that it grew its revenue by more than 36% from N80.45 billion in 2019 to N109.59 billion in 2020. It also increased profit by 73.1% from N650.49 million in 2019 to N1.13 billion in 2020. In 2020 alone its pasta production factory in Sagamu produced 138600 metric tonnes of pasta and generated more than N19 billion in revenue. Its plants in Apapa and Ikeja also generated a combined N90.51 billion in revenue.

3. It is a merger of two robust businesses that have contributed highly to employment in Nigeria

The Honeywell Group is a family-owned investment holding company of Nigerian heritage that has transcended generations. It is well-established across critical sectors of the economy including foods real estate infrastructure energy and financial services employing over 10000 people in the process.

Over twenty years HGL has invested in its portfolio company Honeywell Flour Mills Plc to build a robust wheat processing business alongside a manufacturing system that produces a range of staple foods including baking flour semolina noodles and pasta.

Flour Mills of Nigeria on the other hand has a vast product portfolio and a wide distribution network that spans across the country. Its portfolio includes the largest single-site flour mill and most significant greenfield sugar production investment in Nigeria. It also has the largest edible oil and margarine factory and largest sorghum milling in Sub-Saharan Africa. FMN reports revenue over N770 billion through its vast operations and has always been at the forefront of Nigeria’s industrial development employing around 15000 people across the country.

4. The merger potentially creates a national champion for food manufacturing in Nigeria

The proposed merger will lead to a more resilient national champion for food manufacturing in Nigeria. This will ensure long term job preservation and create additional opportunities across different levels of operations. The new singular entity will benefit from the more than 85 years of combined history and track record of FMN and HFMP.

Through consistent investment in its infrastructure HFMP has grown from a 200-metric-tonne per day business (70000 metric tonnes per annum) to producing a capacity of 835000 metric tonnes per annum. It now sits on an exclusive list of food and beverage businesses that have generated revenue of over N100 billion.

By merging with FMN the new combined entity will give customers access to a broader range of products and provide a platform for a more proficient line of innovation. Employees will have access to more opportunities within the combined entity and will continue to help the company play a vital role in Nigeria’s food production and security.

Nigeria needs more viable and sizable businesses that have the financial capacity to invest massively in backward integration. The country will benefit from the companies’ focus on developing the agricultural value chain and backward integration of the food industry ultimately improving food security.

The merger also creates a platform to strengthen the business enhance growth potentials and create many more jobs in the future. Beyond the jobs created the increased productivity will also lead to higher levels of knowledge acquisition and transfer within the workforce as there will no doubt be a deeper investment in technology. The merger also provides a chance for talents from both companies to combine their unique abilities and strengths.

Oluwaseun Olanrewaju an investment analyst writes from Lagos.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NkYXkubmcvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL2Ztbi1ob25leXdlbGwtbWVyZ2VyLXRoZS1tYWtpbmctb2YtYS1naWFudC1pbi1uaWdlcmlhbi1mb29kLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctaW5kdXN0cnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FMN Honeywell merger: The making of a giant in Nigerian food manufacturing industry,"Honeywell Group Limited recently announced the signing of an agreement with Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FMN) on the proposed combination of Honeywell Flour Mills Plc and Flour Mills of Nigeria another leading Nigerian food manufacturer to further enhance food security in the country and create a more resilient national champion in the Nigerian food industry. The agreement will have Honeywell Group Limited dispose of a 71.69 percent stake it has in HFMP to FMN.

According to a report by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Nigeria is ranked as the largest food market in Africa with significant investment in the local industry and a high level of imports. As of now the food and beverage sector is estimated to contribute 22.5 percent of the manufacturing industry value and 4.6 percent of Nigeria’s GDP.

In another report compiled by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) it was confirmed that the food sector brought in an average of 57 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and generated 64.5 percent of export earnings. Founded in 1972 Honeywell Group began as a food trading company servicing the West African region before pivoting to importing a variety of goods for the Nigerian market.

Now operating an investment holding company based in Nigeria Honeywell Group Limited has diversified its business into different sectors which are referred to as portfolio companies. The group has evolved to become an investment company participating in major sectors of the Nigerian economy including; foods real estate leisure and hospitality energy infrastructure and financial services.

Honeywell Flour Mills Plc (HFMP) one of the portfolio companies of Honeywell Group Limited and a market leader in milling processing and packaging of flour and other wheat-based products in Nigeria has continued to contribute immensely to the growth and performance of the Nigerian economy. With over 20 years of experience HFMP has gathered extensive knowledge and skill in the production of flour and a range of flour-based products.

The company has superior operational efficiency and remains a dominant player in the food industry in Nigeria. Operating on a total installed capacity of 2610 metric tonnes per day; HFMP manufactures a variety of products from wheat meals semolina noodles superfine flours to spaghetti macaroni and brown flour among others.

During the company’s recent Annual General Meeting (AGM) which was held on October 14 2021 the company recorded all-time high revenue of N109.5 billion an increase of 36 percent over N80.4 billion for the financial year ending March 2021. The company’s Operating Profit also grew faster than revenue at 39 percent from N5.4 billion in FY 2019 to N7.6 billion in FY 2020.

Building on the achievements and improved performances of HFMP and FMN year-on-year it can be seen that this is a combination of two giants in the food manufacturing industry in Nigeria. With more than the 85-year combined track record of both companies and their shared goal of making affordable food available to Nigeria’s population stakeholders will benefit from the combination in numerous ways.

Based on the scale of the transaction that will be carried out by the consolidated company this will provide employees with more career development opportunities in a larger organisation with the potential to create more jobs in the economy. Customers will also benefit from access to a wider product range and an even stronger stream of innovation that can only be delivered by a combined entity with stronger teams and financial muscle.

In addition Nigeria and its food security agenda will benefit from both companies’ focus on developing Nigeria’s industrial capability its agricultural value chain and specifically backward integration of the food industry. The proposed combination will bring together two trusted and entrenched brands creating a single entity of becoming a national champion in the food manufacturing space that is better positioned to benefit the growing Nigerian population and leverage opportunities stemming from the African Continent Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

As the deal comes to a close Honeywell Group a leading investment company is setting its sights on the journey of refining and growing its investment portfolio. This will see it consolidate in sectors where it currently operates such as real estate energy financial services and infrastructure. The company also intends to announce more strategic initiatives in the coming months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2FmdGVyLXVzLXR1cmtleS10by1wYWtpc3Rhbi10aGUtdDEyOS1hdGFrLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcGhpbGlwcGluZXMv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vYWZ0ZXItdXMtdHVya2V5LXRvLXBha2lzdGFuLXRoZS10MTI5LWF0YWstaGVsaWNvcHRlci1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leaving Pakistan In Limbo Turkey To Deliver The First T129 ATAK Helicopter To The Philippines Next Month,"As Pakistan’s deal to acquire the T129 ATAK helicopters from Turkey remains frozen Ankara is scheduled to ship the first ATAK helicopter to the Philippines next month in what is seen as yet another boost for the country’s aerospace industry.

Philippines Air force chief Lt. Gen. Allen Trio Paredes stated that the service has ordered six Turkish helicopters which would be delivered sequentially beginning from December.

The Philippines is the first foreign buyer of the Tactical Reconnaissance and Attack Helicopter (ATAK) having ordered six choppers for $280 million (TL 3.37 billion).

The T129 is a twin-engine multirole attack helicopter based on the A129 Mangusta and manufactured by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) under license from the Italian-British company AgustaWestland.

Following a name change AgustaWestland has now become now Leonardo Helicopters; the corporation is Italian but has a presence in the United Kingdom too.

The aircraft is fueled by two LHTEC T800-4A turboshaft engines each of which can generate 1014 kilowatts of output power. The helicopter is developed for advanced attack and reconnaissance missions in both day and night scenarios in hot and mountainous locations with rugged terrain.

Our #T129 #ATAK helicopters are in the skies for our country with its twin-engine five-blade main rotor system.#TurkishAerospace pic.twitter.com/R0TQTrPNYJ — Turkish Aerospace (@TUSAS_EN) January 4 2020

The T129s will be assigned to the 15th Strike Wing of the Philippine Air Force whose pilots and crew have been sent to TAI headquarters in Ankara for training. The 15th Strike Wing will fly the T129s alongside its MD530G light attack and Leonardo A109 armed transport helicopters.

Turkey Receives US Permission?

The engine installed in the helicopter is the LHTEC T800-4A which was developed by a joint effort between US company Honeywell and Rolls-Royce of the UK.

Foreign companies seeking commercial sales of military-grade equipment must acquire export authorization under US law. Major defense sales of more than $25 million must also be notified to Congress.

Frictions between the US and Turkey a NATO member state have been on the rise since the latter signed a $2.5 billion deal with Russia for S-400 missile defense systems in 2017.

Turkey was also kicked out of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter plane program which Turkey had previously contributed to. All this had fuelled apprehension that the US might create a hurdle in the Turkey-Philippines helicopter deal.

Putting all speculations to rest Washington however granted Ankara the export license to sell the helicopters to the Philippines in May this year.

Washington-Manila Ties

The Philippine government has previously deployed its armed helicopters in operations against a number of insurgencies most notably separatist and Islamic State-linked militants on its southernmost islands. However it appears that the military cooperation between the US and the Philippines is unaltered.

The Philippines received the first of two C-130 planes from the US in February. Last year the US also sanctioned two possible attack helicopter exports worth up to $2 billion. However due to budgetary constraints the Philippines will likely consider a lesser acquisition Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana has stated.

Washington has indicated that it will continue to approve weapons sales to the Philippines which it regards as an important ally in the Indo-Pacific region. The Biden administration is facing challenges from its own party which is demanding a review of security aid to Manila due to reports of human rights abuses by the police and military.

After the US revoked the visa of a political ally accused of human rights breaches Philippines President Duterte unilaterally canceled the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) in February 2020 but temporarily overturned his decision afterward.

Experts believe the United States is hesitant to cut off security assistance to an ally it sees as critical in tackling Chinese expansionism and Islamist terrorism.

Is Pakistan Buying Turkish ATAK Helicopters?

Pakistan has been looking to acquire a new attack helicopter to replace its aging American AH-1F Cobra gunships acquired in the 1980s. Islamabad ordered 15 new AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters from the US however Pakistan’s acquisition request was placed on hold due to political tensions.

Pakistan later attempted to acquire Turkish T129 ATAK helicopters in 2018. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) signed a $1.5 billion deal with Pakistan for 30 T129 helicopters but the company had to first obtain US export license before delivery could commence.

Pakistan agreed to prolong the deal for which Turkish Aerospace Industries was given a six-month extension by Pakistan. Since the US has been hesitant to give export licenses for the engine the Turkey-Pakistan deal has been in limbo ever since.

Chief General of Pakistan Armed Forces Nadeem Raza has visited our company and get informed about our platforms.#TurkishAerospace pic.twitter.com/wzpgo7HsFc — Turkish Aerospace (@TUSAS_EN) March 31 2021

The attack helicopters are causing alarm among US senators who believe the deal could further strengthen Pakistan’s ground-attack capability against India with whom the US has a strong defense and security partnership."

Advice was also provided on sustainability finance matters by Riyadh partner Edward Kempson with associate Peter Neuböck and on public company matters by Washington D.C. partners Joel Trotter and Julia Thompson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL3ZhbHVlLWludmVzdG9ycy1waWNrLWhvc3QtaG90ZWxzLTEzNDUwMTU2NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Value Investors Pick Host Hotels & Resorts (HST) Stock?,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?

One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. HST stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:

PE Ratio

A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.

On this front Host Hotels & Resorts has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.25 as you can see in the chart below:

This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 17.91. Also if we focus on the long-term PE trend Host Hotels & Resorts’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 11.06 over the past five years.

The stock’s PE also compares quite favorably with the Finance Market’s trailing twelve months PE ratio which stands at 14.18. This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now compared to its peers.

Moreover Host Hotels & Resorts has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 10.22 which is slightly lower than the current level. So it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Host Hotels & Resorts stock in the near term too.

P/S Ratio

Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.

Right now Host Hotels & Resorts has a P/S ratio of 2.48. This is quite lower than the S&P 500 average which comes in at 3.24x right now. Also as we can see in the chart below this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.

Broad Value Outlook

In aggregate Host Hotels & Resorts currently has a Value Score of B putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Host Hotels & Resorts a solid choice for value investors.

What About the Stock Overall?

Though Host Hotels & Resorts might be a good choice for value investors there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of . This gives HST a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)

Meanwhile the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen seven upward revisions versus one downward revision over the past sixty days while the current-year estimates have seen ten upward revisions and no downward revision in the past sixty days.

This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate as the current-quarter consensus estimate which remained stable over the past two months while the current-year estimate has surged 2.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:

Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. Price and Consensus

Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. Price and Consensus

Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. price-consensus-chart | Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. Quote

Such bullish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and it is the reason why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.

Bottom Line

Host Hotels & Resorts is an inspired choice for value investors as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. A strong industry rank (among Top 33% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2 instils investors’ optimism in the stock.

Also over the past two years the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large as you can see below:

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

HP is taking $200 (33%) off its recently updated HP Reverb G2 VR headset starting Cyber Weekend and hopefully lasting through Cyber Week.

Comparing the HP Reverb G2 to the Oculus Quest 2 isn't really apples to apples since the Quest 2 is usually much less expensive and has total wireless capability. However with one of these differences mostly removed it makes more sense to see what you get get with the HP Reverb G2 that you don't get with the Quest. The Reverb G2 has a higher resolution display that uses two screens (one per eye) instead of a single screen that the Quest 2 uses. It also has a far more comfortable padded headstrap and superior on-ear speakers that mimics those found on the much more expensive Valve Index. The recent update improves the tracking on the Reverb G2's controllers as well. Another benefit of the HP Reverb G2: you don't have to log in with your Facebook account.

With its IPS display 165 Hz refresh rate and 1440p resolution this 27-inch display is a great choice for gamers and content creators.

Though the best gaming monitors come in many shapes and sizes the flat 27-inch panel is one of the most popular.

HP’s Omen line of gaming displays offer premium performance accurate color and high-end build quality. The HP Omen 27i (usually selling for $460-$500) in question is an IPS panel with a fast 165 Hz refresh rate both FreeSync and G-Sync Compatibility and an expanded color gamut. Color purists may be disappointed but there's a myriad of features for gamers. The Omen 27i isn’t the cheapest 27-inch panel out there but offers a lot for the money. With performance to match it’s a compelling choice.

Features

HP doesn’t skimp on the panel used in the Omen 27i. It’s a brand-new part from LG called Nano IPS. This doesn’t mean the backlight is quantum dot but it does mean a very wide gamut with accurate color. Our tests showed DCI-P3 coverage that ranks it above most of the extended color monitors we’ve reviewed. The backlight is a white LED with a rated output of 350 nits. HDR is not supported but the Omen 27i has a native color depth of 10 bits. If you see banding on this screen it’s coming from the content not the 27i.

Adaptive-Sync comes in both flavors with a G-Sync Compatible certification from Nvidia as well as AMD FreeSync support. The 165 Hz refresh rate is achieved without overclocking. This is one quick panel as we discovered in our tests.

Though on-screen display (OSD) navigation is easy with a joystick HP offers a convenient Windows 10 app called Omen Command Center that controls every monitor function from your PC. It even includes a crosshair editor so you can tailor the aiming point to your personal preference and controls lighting for all connected Omen products like gaming PCs and gaming laptops.

Assembly and Accessories

Unpacking the Omen 27i reveals a base and upright already assembled. Further investigation uncovers a small Allen key. You’ll need it to attach the panel to the stand with two captive bolts. Once complete the package is super solid and though the base looks small its diamond shape ensures stability with a minimal desktop footprint. Accessories include DisplayPort and USB cables with a small external power supply.

We’ve never seen an HP Omen display that didn’t have premium build quality and the Omen 27i is no exception. The chassis has monolithic styling with satin-finished metal parts and a rock-solid stand. LED lighting is on the back and below the bezel with a variety of colors and effects to choose from.



The Omen 27i’s styling is all about the diamond shape; you won’t find a single curve. Edges are nicely softened but everything comes together with straight lines and right angles. The stand is wobble-free with nary a hint of play. It offers a 5-inch height adjustment and -5/20-degree tilt. There is no swivel function but upright’s top is ideally shaped for hanging a pair of headphones.

The screen features a flush-mounted anti-glare layer of 3H hardness. The bezel is 8mm around the top and sides with a 23mm strip trimming the bottom. The Omen logo is printed front and center and a small LED underneath brings RGB lighting to your desktop with any color of RGB and a variety of effects. You control RGB from the OSD and HP’s Omen Command Center PC app.

From the side the Omen 27i appears to be built from blocks. Internal components are housed in a diamond-shaped bulge rimmed by LEDs. This allows ports to be placed where they're visible and easily accessible. Video inputs include a DisplayPort 1.2 input and HDMI 2.0 (for a comparison between the two see our DisplayPort vs. HDMI article). A 3.5mm headphone jack shares one side with those ports and three USB 3.0 ports one up and two downstream are on the other. You can loop the cables through the stand to keep things tidy.

OSD Features

The OSD is all business with an Omen logo to remind one of the 27i’s gaming intent. It’s divided into eight sub-menus each with its own reset function.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

All the gaming features are grouped in the Gaming sub-menu. You can toggle Adaptive-Sync adjust the overdrive (four levels) and put elements on the screen like crosshairs frame counters and timers. You can also control the lighting effects here and use alignment marks for multi-screen setups.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Image menu has the Omen 27i’s luminance controls and the Color menu has the other necessary calibration options. Color is very accurate out of the box though some tweaks to grayscale tracking are necessary for maximum quality. There are eight picture modes all of which allow changes to the RGB values. The only thing missing are gamma presets. The 27i tracks 2.2 pretty well but some might prefer a darker or lighter luminance curve.

Other convenience functions include options for programming the OSD joystick to quickly access things like input selection and brightness. Power can be managed with auto-off or no-signal timers and you can shut off the power LED if you wish.

HP Omen 27i Calibration Settings

The Omen 27i comes set to Standard mode which covers the DCI-P3 color gamut accurately with good gamma tracking but a slightly green white point. You can easily fix the latter by adjusting the RGB sliders which we did to excellent effect.

Once tweaked this is a very accurate monitor. There is no sRGB mode so you’ll be seeing the expanded color gamut with all content. As stated earlier there is no HDR support.

Below are our recommended calibration settings for the Open 27i.

Gaming and Hands-on

The Omen 27i is a very versatile monitor. It was equally at home playing games with demanding graphics or pushing through workday tasks. 27 inches and 109ppi is an ideal balance of sharpness and performance. The large color gamut was apparent in everything we did from Windows desktop background photos to movies and games of all types.

Windows instantly recognized the Omen 27i’s 165 Hz refresh and G-Sync Compatibility. No changes were necessary in the Nvidia Control panel. FreeSync also worked right off the bat when we hooked the monitor up to our AMD-based gaming PC.

We calibrated (see our recommended settings above) before starting the hands-on tests. The Standard picture mode provided excellent color and spot-on grayscale tracking after a few tweaks to the RGB sliders.

Small text and icons were easy to discern on a variety of contrasting backgrounds with the Open 27i.Black text on white came across clearly. We tried the dynamic contrast function and found it helped deepen the image a little for tasks like word processing spreadsheet editing and photo work. It appears that feature has no downside when viewing real-world content.

Watching movies was also a pleasure on the Omen 27i. Some Blu-ray films might look a tad overblown since the color gamut is too large. Most streamed material is also meant for the smaller Rec.709 color space. But this was a minor issue.

Gaming is where the Omen 27i shines. Tomb Raider came across with rich and vibrant hues as we played in an outdoor beach environment. Moving into dark caves changed the feel to dark and foreboding as it should. With dynamic contrast engaged shadow detail still popped and highlights popped even more. With dynamic contrast turned off the 27i looked like a typical IPS monitor with blacks that aren’t quite black. HP has done an excellent job with its dynamic contrast feature which works better than what we’ve seen from any other non-HDR monitor.

Call of Duty WWII is our usual HDR test but it looks pretty good in SDR mode too when there is this much color available. Urban rubble showed its rough textures fine shades of gray and earth tones. Smoke and mist effects were smooth and clean without banding or artifacts. Small bits of color from uniforms shone nicely.

Of course given that we are dealing with Hennessey Performance Engineering just about everything is humongous. Save perhaps for the access strip that leads to the company’s Pennzoil Proving Grounds at Lonestar Motorsports Park.By all accounts – especially the “vicious” Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye video embedded below – that flesh of tarmac was copiously dwarfed dominated and owned by the Dodge rascal. Well this is what happens when your sedan is packing a widebody kit and 797 horsepower from a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine even in stock form.Then and only then it’s time for a little bit of Hennessey magic so one can hear the glorious whine abundantly clear and tear up the tarmac with what feels like mile-long burnouts. Come to think about it one might think that jumping from 797 hp to 1012 ponies as offered by the company’s HPE1000 upgrade package is not that hard after all.This is probably why Hennessey wanted everyone to see (and hear) the result. One that includes a lot of hidden (behind the murdered-out look) features . For example aside from the professional installation and a 24-month/24k-miles (38620 km) warranty there is also an upgraded supercharger system HPE calibration high-flow air induction system and many more.But does it matter? Not so much when the Charger can pull off zero to 60 mph (96 kph) sprints in 2.8 seconds and quarter-mile ETs of 9.9 seconds at 141 mph (227 kph). Now of course beauty is always in the eye of the beholder. But we really feel this all-black example managed to properly capture the atmosphere of running amuck on a closed track after just getting hooked on some tuning “ steroids !” Right?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmljdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9tYWNoaW5lcnkvdHJhY3RvcnMvYW4tZWxlY3RyaWMtdHJhY3Rvci1tYXktYmUtaW4teW91ci1mdXR1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An electric tractor may be in your future,"It's been nearly 30 years since Steve Heckeroth designed and built his first electric tractor. Since then he's converted diesel tractors to electric power custom-built electric tractors and assembled an experimental electric tractor for Ford New Holland as early as 1995. Today as founder of Solectrac Heckeroth is finally seeing electric tractors taken seriously by both customers and other manufacturers.

California-based Solectrac has sold about two dozen of its battery-powered tractors since 2018 and has accumulated about $1 million worth of back orders because of pandemic-related issues.

""The biggest problem with electric cars is the weight of the batteries"" says Heckeroth who has a background in solar power and electric vehicles. ""I realized very quickly that weight on a tractor is actually an asset that improves traction.""

More than 14 countries and over 20 cities have proposed or enacted bans on the sale of cars and in some cases light trucks powered by fossil fuels; the bans will go into effect from five to 20 years from now. Heckeroth expects a ban on small gasoline- and diesel-powered tractors to follow especially in large cities. The push to reduce air pollution is primarily driving the market but he lists a number of benefits an electric tractor offers over its diesel counterpart.

""In addition to being cleaner and quieter an electric tractor is much more efficient since all the energy goes into work; whereas in a diesel tractor much of it is wasted as heat"" he explains. ""In addition maximum torque is available immediately rather than at rated engine speed. Finally since the power source has just one moving part they require very little maintenance. Even the batteries are projected to last 10 years pending operating cycles and depth of discharge.""

Solectrac currently offers a 30-hp. compact and a 40-hp. utility model. The company just introduced a 70-hp. vineyard and orchard tractor which addresses the specific needs of that specialty market with its narrow width and greater horsepower.

Monarch Tractor

Equipped with an electric drivetrain capable of providing 40 hp. of continuous power and short-duration peak power up to 70 hp. the Monarch combines electrification automation machine learning and data analysis to bring a fully electric driver-optional smart tractor to the farm in a single platform.

""Monarch Tractor is moving farming toward a safer sustainable future by eliminating harmful emissions reducing the need for herbicides and keeping workers out of harm's way with its driver-optional capabilities"" says Carl Mondavi Monarch Tractor chief farming officer.

The California company recently received a minority investment from CNH Industrial that will share Monarch Tractor's electric and autonomous tractor technology across CNH's portfolio of ag brands.

""This partnership underscores our commitment to rapidly improving our alternative propulsion and precision-farming portfolio while extending our world-leading sustainability credentials"" says Scott Wine CEO CNH Industrial.

Kubota Prototypes

Kubota recently released two prototype machines powered by lithium-ion batteries that will be tested in France later this year. One is a compact tractor while the other is a mini excavator. The company says the maximum output of both machines will be equivalent to that of models with diesel engines.

Fendt e100 Vario

AGCO has looked to its Fendt division to take the lead in electric tractor production. The company has already developed a 75-kW (100 hp.) electric tractor. Known as the Fendt e100 Vario the all-electric compact tractor operates up to 10 hours under actual operating conditions and can be recharged to 80% in just 40 minutes.

""The technology developed by the auto industry has been a big driver in development of electric tractors"" says Tom Turner AGCO strategic marketing manager for high-horsepower tractors pointing to higher-capacity batteries with faster charging cycles. ""Now we're just trying to get ahead of the curve.

""The Fendt e100 is similar in size and power to the Fendt 200"" he adds. ""Thanks to its quiet and emissions-free operation we see real potential for an electric tractor that size particularly among small farms and livestock operations and for use in urban and residential areas. Compact tractors aren't typically used a long distance from home or the shop; they often spend a fair amount of time idle.""

Like Heckeroth Turner points out that an electric tractor eliminates the cost of fuel oil DEF etc. and the batteries can be charged via renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power for an even lower cost of operation. Thanks to the three-point hitch hydraulic remote valves and PTO an electric tractor can operate any existing implement as well as electric-powered implements being developed.

John Deere GridCON

Unfortunately Turner doesn't see electric tractors going much higher than 100 hp. or much longer than a few hours on a charge with current technology. John Deere has attempted to remedy those issues with its cable-powered prototype GridCON. Unlike its earlier battery-powered prototypes the fully electric autonomous tractor provides up to 400 hp. (300 kW) and is powered by an electric cable connection from the field border to the tractor via a drum that carries more than 1000 yards of cable.

""The biggest challenge for battery electric tractors is available energy capacity in batteries today compared with the energy required for typical farming operations"" says Dennis Muszalski director module and electrification system engineering John Deere. ""During the critical windows of planting and harvesting availability of equipment is paramount. Our customers can't afford any delays due to limitations of battery capacity resulting in frequent and lengthy recharging.""

Although prices aren't available yet for prototype models the Monarch has a base price of $50000. Solectrac tractors currently list for about 20% more than a comparable diesel model. However the lower maintenance costs should offset much of that."

You can tell by the Phillips/flatblade screw head in the photo. Hubbell/Bryant receptacles have hex socket head (Allen key) clamp screws.



This in my mind is the biggest problem with Leviton's 14-50s. Getting the correct torque for #6 or #8 wire with a Phillips screwdriver is very difficult. Doing it with an Allen key is easy. If the wire is not clamped sufficiently it can work for years all the while slowly moving toward failure. Without sufficient preload on a clamp screw any motion can make it back out. Motion for instance caused by thermal changes. In my business the thermal changes we have to watch out for are caused by going in and out of direct sunlight once every 97 minutes; for a charging outlet the thermal changes are caused by charging cycles. Regardless of how tight the joint is it will heat up enough to make the parts expand when current is flowing. Without the required preload on the screw that expansion and contraction can cause it to slowly back out. Which reduces the preload further until finally it's no longer making a good electrical connection. Then you get resistive heat or arcing either of which can ruin your day.



This is why the manufacturer provides a torque spec for tightening the clamp screw. For a 14-50 it's a substantial amount; enough to hurt your wrist if you're trying to do it manually with a Phillips screwdriver. Don't ask how I know. The use of Phillips screw clamps is reason enough to never use the cheap Leviton receptacles. (I have heard they also make a better line which may be better I dunno. The Bryant is only about $40 just spec that.)",,,,,,,,,,,,

Soon after much of the crowd of 49736 followed by storming the field celebrating the first Axe triumph in Minneapolis in 18 years.

And the game operations folks got in on the festivities too blaring ""Jump Around'' the signature song at Wisconsin's Camp Randall Stadium as a little dig to the archrivals from the east.

""Oh that was funny'' Gophers linebacker Jack Gibbens said with a sly smile afterward.

Gibbens and his teammates had many reasons to smile. Though their shot at winning the Big Ten's West Division evaporated Friday as Nebraska imploded in a come-from-ahead loss to Iowa the Gophers grabbed a couple of valuable prizes nonetheless: the Axe for the second time in four years and the knowledge that they kept their most bitter rival from playing for the Big Ten championship.

""That's a really good football team and that was a really hard game'' Gophers coach P.J. Fleck said. ""I'm so proud of our players their resolve their courage throughout the year.''

Minnesota's defense kept Wisconsin's offense out of the end zone while the Gophers offense took control in the second half overcoming a 10-6 deficit at the break and scoring 14 points in the third quarter. The Gophers' win gave Iowa (10-2 7-2) the West title outright and the Hawkeyes will play Michigan for the conference championship next Saturday in Indianapolis.

The Gophers (8-4 6-3) finished in a three-way tie for second in the West with Purdue and Wisconsin (8-4 6-3). Had Nebraska held on to win and all other results stayed the same Minnesota would be going to Indy.

""The whole mission of the week was to get the Axe'' Fleck said. ""If it came with something great. If it didn't great.''

Tanner Morgan passed for 199 yards and a touchdown to Chris Autman-Bell Ky Thomas rushed for a TD and the Gophers got three field goals from Matthew Trickett. The Gophers defense was outstanding holding the Badgers to only a field goal in the second half. Wisconsin's lone TD came on an interception return in the first half.

Minnesota held Badgers freshman running back Braelon Allen who averaged 144.7 yards in Wisconsin's seven-game win streak to 47 yards on 17 carries. Graham Mertz completed 21 of 38 passes for 171 yards and the Gophers held him to 4-for-10 passing for 29 yards on third downs.

""We were going to play in their face man cover and make [No.] 5 beat you'' Fleck said.

BOXSCORE: Gophers 23 Wisconsin 13

The teams traded long drives and short field goals in the game's first 17:23 before Wisconsin made what could have been a game-defining play.

Outside linebacker Noah Burks tipped Morgan's first-down pass and safety Scott Nelson intercepted it and returned it 25 yards for a touchdown and a 10-3 Badgers lead with 12:22 left in the second quarter.

""The way he responds after that'' Fleck said of Morgan. ""He makes those huge throws. That's why I'm so proud of him with all the criticism he takes.''

Huge throw No. 1 was a connection to Mar'Keise Irving out of the backfield for a 36-yard gain to the Wisconsin 29 a play on which only linebacker Leo Chenal's tackle prevented Irving from scoring. The Gophers got a field goal out of that one.

Justin Walley's interception on Wisconsin's third play of the second half — a grab in which Walley outdueled receiver Kendric Pryor for a 50-50 ball — set up huge throw No. 2. Morgan immediately followed with a 26-yard hookup with tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford. Thomas' 2-yard TD run gave the Gophers a 13-10 lead.

After Wisconsin tied it 13-13 on Collin Larsh's 28-yard field goal huge throw No. 3 was Morgan's 27-yard TD pass to Autman-Bell that gave the Gophers a 20-13 lead with 1:56 left in the third quarter.

""It's all about response which is something I pride myself on'' Morgan said. ""… I knew I had to stay focused stay calm and execute.''

Wisconsin would have one more parry into Gophers territory reaching the 30 but Lash's 48-yard field-goal attempt hit the crossbar and bounced back to the field harmlessly a sign that maybe something was going right for a team that had dropped 16 of the previous 17 Axe games.

Trickett's 36-yard field goal with 6:08 to play closed the scoring and the Gophers went into Victory formation after a Badgers turnover on downs with 48 seconds left.

""It was fun winning it in Camp Randall'' Fleck said of the 2018 triumph. ""It was even better winning it at home.''",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9leHRyYS1tdXN0YXJkLzIwMjEvMTEvMjgvbWlubmVzb3RhLWZhbnMtdHJvbGwtd2lzY29uc2luLXdpdGgtanVtcC1hcm91bmQtYWZ0ZXItd2lu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota fans troll Wisconsin with 'Jump Around' on field,"There's nothing like beating your rival. And if you ever beat the one person or team you've always despised it's safe to assume you won't be too humble about it. That was the case this Saturday at Huntington Bank Stadium.

Unranked Minnesota upset No. 18 Wisconsin on Saturday and after the win fans stormed the field. But that wasn't the worst hit to the Badgers' ego that night.

The Golden Gopher fans in epic troll fashion celebrated on their home field by dancing to the hip-hop classic Jump Around—the same song Badgers fans dance to while at home.

The scene was chaotic but beautiful after the 23–13 win and it surely won't be forgotten anytime soon by Wisconsin.

The Gophers whipped UW physically snapped a 14-game losing streak in the series and took home Paul Bunyan’s Axe home for the first time since the 2003 season.

The pain the UW players will feel in the wake of their 23-13 loss to the Gophers on Saturday at Huntington Bank Stadium will run deeper and last longer.

“This is the worst feeling you can have"" junior linebacker Leo Chenal said. ""It just pains you so much. I just looked at the axe seeing them grab it. It was tough to see.”

UW entered the game needing a victory to clinch a share of the West Division title secure a berth in the Big Ten title game against Michigan and take the axe back to Madison.

Paul Chryst and his players went 0 for 3 and saw their winning streak end at seven games.

The Badgers (8-4 6-3) will have to sit home next weekend while Iowa (10-2 7-2) and Michigan (11-1 8-1) battle for the title in Indianapolis.

To note that the Gophers (8-4 6-3) ruined the Badgers’ day and spoiled their regular season is an understatement.

Senior cornerback Caesar Williams gave a passionate and lengthy response when asked to summarize his emotions.

""The axe was the most important thing at stake today"" said Williams who disputed an interference call against him in the pivotal third quarter when the Gophers scored two touchdowns. ""The axe was the only thing that mattered. Keeping the axe in Madison because that is the tradition.

""We don’t lose to Minnesota. Big Ten championship (game) on the line or not we don’t lose to Minnesota.""

A reporter replied: Yet today you lost.

""This is honestly the worst feeling in the world"" Williams said. ""All the work past players have put into even up the (series) and put us in the lead it just feels like a disgrace to the program for us to lose the axe.""

UW faced a 20-13 deficit when it took over at its 32 with 13 minutes 27 seconds left after a punt.

The offense had been held to 175 total yards on 42 plays and just two field goals to that point. UW drove from its 32 to the Minnesota 30 but Graham Mertz threw three consecutive incompletions and Collin Larsh missed from 48 yards with 11:44 left with the ball clanging off the crossbar.

Minnesota responded with a field-goal drive that covered 52 yards and lasted nine plays and 5:36.

""Guys are hurting"" said outside linebacker Noah Burks who tipped a pass near the line of scrimmage that resulted in Scott Nelson's 25-yard interception return for a touchdown in the second quarter. ""We all feel pain. Obviously we weren’t able to accomplish what we wanted to do. Just disappointed all around.

""It’s our biggest game of the year. Biggest rivalry. Longest rivalry in college football. We’ve been so dominant in this game for so long nobody wants to be on the team that loses the axe.""

Minnesota entered the day with the No. 3 rushing defense in the Big Ten allowing an average of 103.6 yards per game. Opponents had rushed for just 10 touchdowns in 11 games.

The Gophers were as good as the numbers suggested.

Braelon Allen was limited to 29 yards on 10 carries in the opening half and finished with 47 yards on 17 carries. Twelve of his first 16 carries went for 3 yards or less.

UW finished with 62 rushing yards on 22 carries and just 233 total yards.

Mertz who had completed 71.9% of his passes (41 of 57) for an average of 200.3 yards in the previous three games finished 21 of 38 for 171 yards with one interception.

""We knew coming in it was a good defense"" a dejected Chryst said. ""We weren’t able to consistently run the ball. And we had some in the passing game but nothing consistent.

""We couldn’t finish. Two red-zone opportunities and got field goals instead of touchdowns. Against a good team that is going to make it harder.""

Losing safety Collin Wilder to a targeting call just six seconds into the game didn't make life any easier.

UW went with Nelson and John Torchio but it appeared both were beaten off the line of scrimmage for pass plays of 20-plus yards by tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford who finished with three catches for 62 yards.

Minnesota tailbacks Ky Thomas and Mar'Keise Irving combined to rush for 94 yards on 30 carries just enough to keep UW's defense honest. Thomas scored on a 2-yard run to help the Gophers take a 13-10 lead just 1:36 into the third quarter.

Quarterback Tanner Morgan who entered the day completing 59.1% of his passes with nine touchdowns and seven interceptions completed 11 of 16 passes for 199 yards with one touchdown and one interception.

He was efficient and made critical throws when the Gophers needed them. His 27-yard touchdown pass to Chris Autman-Bell on first and 20 gave the Gophers a 20-13 lead with 1:56 left in the third quarter.

""I definitely don’t think we played to our potential what we could have done"" Chenal said. ""I think we left a lot of meat on the bone as the term goes. Too many mistakes and not enough play-making. That is what it comes down to.""

UW got the ball to start the second half but gave it away on third and 7 from its 21.

Mertz tried to hit Kendric Pryor near the right sideline but the ball was thrown high and to the inside. Cornerback Justin Walley out-fought Pryor for the ball for the interception at the UW 28.

A 26-yard pass play from Morgan to tight end Spann-Ford and a 2-yard run by freshman tailback Thomas allowed the Gophers to take a 13-10 lead with 13:24 left in the third.

""Certainly a big sequence was the start of the second half"" Chryst said. ""The pick. We gave them a short field up 10-6 and they scored.""

Mertz added: ""It was a one-on-one with Kendric. I’m going to give my guy a shot. I could have (thrown it) a little bit more outside. But one-on-one I’m going to trust my guy.""

UW took the ensuing kickoff and drove from its 25 to the Minnesota 9 but Allen lost 2 yards on second on second and 5 and Jake Ferguson gained just 2 yards on a catch on third down.

Larsh hit a 28-yard field goal with 6:35 left in the quarter to forge a 13-13 tie.

""It all comes down to finishing drives"" Mertz said. ""You can’t win with field goals.""

The Gophers drove 74 yards in seven plays for the go-ahead score the 27-yard pass from Morgan to Autman-Bell.

UW failed to score on its final four possessions. The closest the Badgers came to scoring was the missed 48-yard field-goal attempt by Larsh.

The Badgers came to Huntington Bank Stadium with a chance to win a share of the division title secure a berth in the league title game and defeat Minnesota for the third consecutive season.

UW failed to achieve its goals and suffered one of the more painful defeats since Chryst took over as head coach before the 2015 season.

""We didn’t do enough to earn the victory"" Chryst said. ""We didn’t get it done.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYnJpbmdtZXRoZW5ld3MuY29tL21pbm5lc290YS1zcG9ydHMvd2F0Y2gtZ29waGVycy10cm9sbC1iYWRnZXJzLXdpdGgtanVtcC1hcm91bmQtYWZ0ZXItc2F0dXJkYXlzLXdpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: Gophers troll Badgers with 'Jump Around' after Saturday's win,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-sports/watch-gophers-troll-badgers-with-jump-around-after-saturdays-win on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYnJpbmdtZXRoZW5ld3MuY29tL21pbm5lc290YS1zcG9ydHMvd2F0Y2gtZ29waGVycy10cm9sbC1iYWRnZXJzLXdpdGgtanVtcC1hcm91bmQtYWZ0ZXItc2F0dXJkYXlzLXdpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjEvMTEvMjcvbWlubmVzb3RhLWNob3BzLWRvd24tbm8tMTgtd2lzY29uc2luLXRvLXRha2UtYmFjay1wYXVsLWJ1bnlhbnMtYXhl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota chops down No. 18 Wisconsin to take back Paul Bunyan's Axe,"Tanner Morgan overcame an interception that was returned for a first-half touchdown leading Minnesota on three scoring drives after halftime to surge past No. 18 Wisconsin 23-13 take back Paul Bunyan's Axe and give Iowa the Big Ten West Division title Saturday.

As the crowd streamed onto the turf the rap song “Jump Around” played over the speakers in a taunt of Wisconsin's home-game anthem.

Allen topped the 100-yard mark in each of the last seven games all wins for Wisconsin. The Badgers had 62 rushing yards after averaging 229 yards on the ground entering the week.

Collin Larsh made two field goals for Wisconsin but had a 48-yard try — four yards beyond his career long — bounce off the crossbar early in the fourth quarter. Minnesota went the other way for Matthew Trickett's third field goal of the game to put the stamp on it.

Scott Nelson returned a tipped-ball interception 25 yards for a touchdown for the Badgers early in the second quarter to give them a 10-3 lead.

The Gophers got their first big break early in the third quarter when Justin Walley who had two pass interference penalties on the afternoon while covering Kendric Pryor wrestled away a catch by Pryor for his first career interception at the Wisconsin 28.

Morgan hit tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford for 26 yards to the 2 on the next play. Then Ky Thomas ran it in for a 13-10 lead with eight offensive linemen blocking on the play.

Minnesota reached the end zone on its next possession too moving Morgan into second place on the program's all-time list with 56 career touchdown passes.

The Gophers honored their seniors in customary fashion with flowers presented to the parents and hugs and pictures with their sons but because of the free year of eligibility from the pandemic-abbreviated 2020 season there's no clarity yet on which players are actually leaving or staying.

Morgan who's in his fifth year with the program and is the career leader for a Gophers quarterback with 26 victories as a starter has not yet declared his status for 2022. He didn't participate in the pregame tribute though perhaps a sign he'd like to return.

Either way Morgan was going to have to make his share of significant completions to win this one facing as formidable of a Badgers defense as he and his teammates had seen in their careers.

Even by settling for a field goal Morgan and the Gophers served notice on their first possession that they weren't going to go quietly as has been the case so often in this series over the last three decades. Wisconsin also lost safety Collin Wilder who had two interceptions against Nebraska last week after the first snap because of an automatic-ejection targeting foul for leading with his helmet on Autman-Bell.

This was the second time in four years the Gophers have beaten the Badgers following 14 straight losses.

The Badgers will get their bowl game invitation Dec. 5. Four losses make them unlikely to play somewhere on New Year's Day. The Las Vegas or Music City bowls on Dec. 30 are strong possibilities.

The Gophers also a long shot for a Jan. 1 bowl are essentially in the mix for the same postseason games as the Badgers."

The T60 and T61 (introduced in 2006) are especially famous being the last generation sporting IBM logos and such classic features as 4:3 displays and infrared ports.

The thing is even the best hardware eventually becomes obsolete when it can no longer run modern software: with a 2.0 GHz Core Duo and 3 GB of RAM you can still browse the web and do word processing today but you can forget about 4K video or a 64-bit OS. Luckily there’s hope for those who are just not ready to part with their trusty Thinkpads: [Xue Yao] has designed a replacement motherboard that fits the T60/T61 range bringing them firmly into the present day. The T700 motherboard is currently in its prototype phase with series production expected to start in early 2022 funded through a crowdfunding campaign.

Designing a motherboard for a modern CPU is no mean feat and making it fit an existing laptop with all the odd shapes and less-than-standard connections is even more impressive. The T700 has an Intel Core i7 CPU with four cores running at 2.8 GHz while two RAM slots allow for up to 64 GB of DDR4-3200 memory. There are modern USB-A and USB-C ports as well as well as a 6 Gbps SATA interface and two m.2 slots for your SSDs.

As for the display the T700 motherboard will happily connect to the original screens built into the T60/T61 or to any of a range of aftermarket LED based replacements. A Thunderbolt connector is available but only operates in USB-C mode due to firmware issues; according to the project page full support for Thunderbolt 4 is expected once the open-source coreboot firmware has been ported to the T700 platform.

We love projects like this that extend the useful life of classic computers to keep them running way past their expected service life. But impressive though this is it’s not the first time someone has made a replacement motherboard for the Thinkpad line; we covered a project from the nb51 forum back in 2018 which formed the basis for today’s project. We’ve seen lots of other useful Thinkpad hacks over the years from replacing the display to revitalizing the batteries.

“What I find inspirational is that these people were willing to take such an incredible risk to sort of jump off into something new with not just no guarantee of success but like no guarantee of survival” Phaneuf says.

Now Phaneuf plans to follow them—in a sense.

For the past five years a non-profit Phaneuf heads ProMare has been building an unmanned autonomous ship powered by a hybrid diesel-electric motor and solar panels which it hopes will follow in the Pilgrims’ wake crossing the Atlantic from Plymouth England to Plymouth Massachusetts. If successful The Mayflower Autonomous Ship named in honor of its famous nautical forebearer and known as MAS for short will be the first such trans-Atlantic voyage by an autonomous vessel.

As he plans to recreate the pilgrims’ risky crossing Phaneuf finds today’s culture illogically risk-adverse. “As a society we really simply have completely lost the ability to think about risk” he says. This is particularly true he says when it comes to the regulation of new technology such as artificial intelligence. “There’s just this bias against automation and autonomy” he said.

Meanwhile says Phaneuf the biggest hazards on the water today are inexperienced pleasure boaters.

“But no one talks about banning them” he said.

The promise of autonomous ships

Phaneuf’s modern Mayflower was envisioned as a testbed for the technology needed to make autonomous ships viable. The market for such vessels for container transport research and military applications is expected to reach more than $160 billion by the end of the decade.

Phaneuf a Boston-area native who moved to Britain a decade ago for work has been in discussions with regulators in both the U.S. and the U.K. about what rules should govern ships piloted by artificial intelligence software. One company Phaneuf runs Marine AI makes such software. Two other companies he also heads M Subs Ltd. and The Submergence Group build manned and unmanned submersibles for use by the U.S. and British Navy. In his view uncrewed ships captained by A.I. pose far less risk than those helmed by human skippers—but most regulators don’t see it that way he says.

Dispensing with crews could help ease future supply chain disruptions not to mention saving the shipping industry millions in labor costs. So it’s not surprising that a number of maritime industry giants including Maersk and Happag-Lloyd have been teaming up with software and robotics startups to explore the creation of autonomous ships. Rolls-Royce a major producer of ships’ engines is making a big push to develop A.I.-captained vessels too. A Norwegian autonomous container ship MV Yara Birkeland this month began testing in the fjord outside Oslo. And Japan’s largest shipping company Nippon Yusen plans to send a captainless containership on a 236-mile coastal voyage from Tokyo Bay to the Japanese city of Ise in February.

But so far none of big league shipping companies has proposed a journey as lengthy and audacious as what Phaneuf has planned for MAS. The 49-foot long aluminum trimaran was supposed to have made its trans-Atlantic voyage to commemorate the 400th Anniversary of the Pilgrims’ journey in 2020 but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the vessel’s completion. In June this year MAS belatedly embarked from Plymouth bound for America. The journey was expected to take about three weeks. But after three days at sea an exhaust pipe broke preventing the hybrid electric generator from operating. MAS was forced to limp back under reserve power to the Isles of Scilly which lie just west of the English Channel and then the ProMare team towed her home to Plymouth.

“Boats always break so our boat broke—but not the A.I. part” Phaneuf shrugged.



Phaneuf isn’t one to give up easily. “One setback doesn’t define the whole project” he said. After all the original Mayflower also had to turn around—twice—for repairs before it eventually completed its 66-day Atlantic crossing. So Phaneuf redesigned the ship’s engine Promare upgraded much of the boat’s software for good measure and the group is planning another attempt to cross The Atlantic this spring. But first the boat—which has cost Promare about $1.2 million so far with a variety of corporate partners donating more in equipment and labor—is undergoing extensive testing in the waters near Plymouth with a longer shake-down cruise to Rotterdam and back planned for February.

It should be easy

In theory building an autonomous ship ought to be easier than creating a self-driving car. Even in busy shipping lanes the oceans are less congested than most city roads or highways. “Last time we travelled 500 miles offshore and we never came within 10 miles of another vessel” Phaneuf said of MAS’s maiden crossing attempt. Except when coming in and out of port ships generally have a lot of more freedom to navigate than cars do. Also in most cases ships travel much more slowly than cars meaning there is a lot more time for A.I.-systems to identify potential hazards and maneuver to avoid them.



But training an A.I. system to identify buoys channel markers boats and all sorts of other things that float in the sea from crab pots to logs—and to do so reliably in rain or fog while the ship is also pitching in heavy swells—that is a bit of a trick says Don Scott the tall bearded Canadian who is the chief technology officer at MarineAI and who oversaw the development of the software systems deployed on MAS. To do so Scott developed a labelled database of millions of images of marine objects in different light and weather conditions. He installed cameras and sensors at various points around Plymouth Harbor to record activity and create a set of training data for MAS’s A.I.

Sitting still alongside the pier in Plymouth MAS cuts an impressive figure: its main hull and outriggers have reverse bows designed to cut through the waves more efficiently giving the ship the profile of some exotic spacecraft. A central platform rises on four struts rises from the middle of the main hull sporting an impressive array of antennas radars sensors and cameras.



IBM took an early interest in the project and became ProMare’s principal technology partner its corporate logo prominently displayed on the ship’s hull. The company provided some of the software the ship uses to “see” objects around it as well as the software the ship uses to decide how to steer when other vessels obstruct its path. This decision-making system was adapted from software IBM first used to help banks and insurance companies. IBM has also provided MAS with computers that can run A.I. software without needing to send information back and forth to on-shore datacenters. Being able to handle these computing demands “on the edge” without consuming too much of MAS’s limited electric power was an essential requirement. MAS may need to be make quick navigational decisions while in the middle of the ocean beyond the reach of cellular communications and where satellite connectivity can be slow and bandwidth limited or sometimes nonexistent.

Other computers onboard the ship will be helping to gather scientific data. One of the big advantages of autonomous ships as Phaneuf sees it is their ability to advance human understanding of the oceans. An unmanned vessel can remain at sea longer at a tiny fraction of the cost of a human-crewed research ship. With its own propulsion and the ability to navigate independently it can also cover a wider geographic area than a sensor-laden buoy.



IBM researchers have designed three science projects that MAS will conduct while it is crossing the Atlantic. One is a hydrophone that will be used to listen continuously to sounds underwater feeding the data to software that has been trained to identify whale songs. Another sensor called Hypertaste is an “electronic tongue” that will sample the water around MAS at 15 minute intervals identifying its chemical composition. The data will be used to study ocean acidification a process linked to climate change in which as the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the oceans also absorbs larger and larger amounts of carbon dioxide becoming more acidic. Finally researchers will be using video from the ship’s cameras combined with data from inertial sensors onboard to train an A.I. system to predict the energy a wave carries based on its appearance. This might one day help scientists make better use of video to understand the potential for storms and erosion as well helping future autonomous ships steer the safest most efficient path through high seas.



Big Blue has contributed in other ways too. IBM owns The Weather Company which transmits meteorological data to MAS that it will use to help determine the best route across the Atlantic. (In return the ship is also relaying weather data from its own sensors back to shore-based researchers.) Weather company forecasters are also consulting with the ProMare team to help them find the best weather window for maximizing MAS’s chance of having a successful crossing.

Test drive

It’s a chilly but calm and sunny early afternoon as Scott and I step aboard a small cabin cruiser in Plymouth Harbor. We watch as Matt Shaw the 24-year old who serves as chief engineer on the MAS project opens a laptop inside the pilot house and pulls up a digital dashboard displaying readouts from MAS’s instruments. Using an Xbox controller and a Bluetooth network Shaw remotely pilots MAS as she motors placidly in front of us attached to the cabin cruiser by a slack day-glow orange line. As a precaution local officials have mandated that MAS be under human control and tethered to a manned boat while navigating in and out of the harbor.

Once we reach a designated testing area in Cawsand Bay just outside the harbor entrance the tether is released Shaw taps a key on the keyboard and MAS is off making her own way between preprogrammed waypoints at a speed of 6.8 knots (about eight miles per hour). “This is her optimal speed for fuel consumption efficiency” Shaw said. Meanwhile James Sutton a software engineer from IBM Research who has worked on the science experiments MAS carries sits with a laptop perched on his knees watching the readouts from the scientific instruments onboard.



The cruiser motors along next to MAS and then pulling slightly ahead crosses her path. “We’re testing to make sure the sensors can correctly see us and that the collision-avoidance software is working properly” Scott said. The authorities won’t actually let MAS operate fully autonomously this close to shore so MAS doesn’t deviate from its set course. But back on shore in a squat redbrick building right alongside the wharf other ProMare employees can monitor MAS’s camera feeds and radar data in real-time and also see what decision MAS’s A.I. captain would have taken to avoid a collision if it had been operating autonomously. They radio Shaw to tell him everything appears to be working. “This is the reality of being at sea nothing much happens” Scott said.



Phaneuf grates at what he sees at the needless caution of government maritime authorities. “It’s just this sort of hyperbolic sort of safety culture that is being used to justify irrational attempts to regulate things in a way that will retard the growth of the industry” he said. Of all the many hardships the Pilgrims had to bear at least excessive maritime regulation wasn’t one of them.",,,

Kathy was born on March 17 1960 in South Bend. She has lived in Massachusetts since 2016. Kathy worked in the optical field for 15 years and for Lakeville Veterinary Clinic for 12 years. She had a love for animals. She began employment at IDEXX Laboratories in 2016 with the Parasitology Team. Kathy worked at North Grafton MA before joining the Louisville Lab as part of the “start up” team and then returned to Massachusetts in 2020 where she shared her experience and extreme knowledge base with the team there.

To say Kathy was dedicated to her job would be a massive understatement. Her job was her passion. Kathy believed in the principle that each lab sample was a patient and that was reflected in the impeccable quality of work she produced. Kathy used this passion to train technicians to take the same care she did. She was a go-to person in the department for a reason as everyone knew how much she cared and how dedicated she was to getting the right answer to any question. There was more than one occasion where there would be a parasite unidentified or a question unanswered at the end of the night and the next day Kathy would go to work with textbooks and references to show she had found the answer.

Anyone that spent a day with Kathy would know that there was nothing that she didn’t have a story for or an opinion on and never held back sharing either. Kathy would strike up a conversation with anyone and make people smile no matter what was going on around them. To much of her co-workers Kathy was more than a colleague. She was a friend. Kathy was one of the best support systems at work. She would do anything for anyone whether it meant just grabbing coffee talking for hours on the phone or just giving them a laugh when they needed it the most. Kathy was charismatic kind giving and truly “one of a kind.”

Kathy is survived by her mother LaRuth K. Donathen of North Liberty; sister Karen (Jim) Duffy of Elsberry MO; brother David (Jodi) Donathen of Bremen; three nieces Abigail Chartrand Angelina Chartrand and Alexis Donathen; and her lifelong friend Mary Purvis. She was preceded in death by her father Danny N. Donathen and her niece Alexandria Chartrand.

Per Kathy’s wishes there will be no services. Palmer Funeral Home South Bend is assisting her family. In lieu of flowers contributions in memory of Kathy may be donated to Reins of Life 55200 Quince Road South Bend IN 46619. Online condolences may be offered to Kathy’s family at www.palmerfuneralhomes.com.

I colori i sapori e gli odori dei mercatini riempiono le vie del centro storico. E anche il trenino la pista di pattinaggio lo scivolo e il Villaggio di Babbo Natale hanno aperto le porte ai bambini e alle loro famiglie. È ufficialmente partito ""Pesaro nel cuore - il Natale dappertutto"". ""Una delle manifestazioni più attrattive magiche e sicure d'Italia"" commenta il sindaco Matteo Ricci.

""Quest'anno - spiega Ricci - abbiamo deciso di non fare la classica inaugurazione per evitare assembramenti. Dobbiamo tenere la guardia alta e vivere queste festività al meglio ma sempre con grande prudenza"". Anche per questo motivo la formula scelta quest'anno è quella del ""Natale diffuso"" con i mercatini sparsi per le vie del centro storico e le tre attrazioni dislocate in piazzale Matteotti piazza del Popolo e via Curiel: ""abbiamo attrezzato la città alla grande ma utilizzando gli spazi del centro per non fare aggregare le persone"".

Sicurezza in primo piano con l'obbligo della mascherina in centro storico tutti i giorni fino al 9 gennaio dalle 10 alle 22: ""È un'ulteriore protezione per cercare di non fermare le attività e non richiudere nella massima sicurezza. Avremo un Natale con regole rigorose - continua Ricci - l'appello che faccio è quello di vaccinarsi perché non c'è altra soluzione per difendersi dal Covid-19 e per uscire velocemente da questa Pandemia. A Pesaro solo il 785% dei cittadini è vaccinato manca all'appello il 215%. A loro il mio invito a farlo al più presto. È un dovere nei confronti delle persone che non ci sono più e dei medici infermieri operatori sanitari che da mesi stanno combattendo questa battaglia"".

Iniziato nel 2016 per dare un tocco natalizio alla via di anno in anno il giardino di Andrea si è trasformato in un immancabile appuntamento per molti abitanti del quartiere che già da novembre sbirciano curiosi il procedere dei lavori.

L’accensione ufficiale come di consueto avverrà il 1° dicembre e le lucine saranno attive tutte le sere dalle 18 alle 24 fino al 6 gennaio.

Quest’anno ci sarà una novità tutta dedicata ai più piccoli. Per loro sarà infatti disponibile il servizio di raccolta delle letterine per Babbo Natale. Sulla recinzione ci sarà una speciale cassetta postale dedicata alle letterine dei bambini e ufficialmente gestita dagli elfi che aiutano Babbo Natale.

La cassetta in realtà verrà svuotata ogni domenica da Andrea che conserverà le buste rigorosamente sigillate fino al 24 dicembre così he i genitori possano recuperarle qualora servisse un suggerimento per il regalo da mettere sotto l’albero.

Intel's pricing places the 12700K against mid-range Ryzen 5000 models but today we're putting the $408 Core i7-12700K up against the decidedly more expensive $549 Ryzen 9 5900X as well as the ~$390 Ryzen 7 5800X. That's because Intel's Alder Lake chips are surprisingly powerful already earning key upsets against higher-priced Ryzen chips on our list of Best CPUs for gaming and CPU Benchmark hierarchy.



As seen in our previous Intel Core i9-12900K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and 5950X and Intel Core i5-12600K vs AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and 5800X faceoffs Intel's hybrid x86 Alder Lake design represents the company's most disruptive architectural shift in a decade. As a result Intel upsets AMD's highest-end mainstream chips particularly in price-to-performance metrics.



However Alder Lake does have an Achilles heel: Intel launched the chips without the B- and H-series motherboards that tend to be the affordable favorites for mainstream gamers. That means you'll have to buy a pricey Z690 motherboard but at least you get cutting-edge connectivity as part of your purchase — Intel baked in leading-edge exclusive options like the DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 interfaces that outstrip AMD's venerable AM4 platform. You can also opt for DDR4 models which is good given that DDR5 is hardly available and selling for scalper pricing.



While Intel's new hybrid design is a game-changer it also has a few early performance teething pains in Windows 10. This means the AMD vs Intel rivalry is anything but the clear-cut victory it appears to be on the benchmark charts. Below we've put the Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X through a six-round faceoff to see which chip takes the crown in our gaming and application benchmarks along with other key criteria like power consumption and pricing. Let's see how the chips stack up.

Features and Specifications: Intel Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X

Swipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 U.S. Price Cores | Threads P-Core Base/Boost E-Core Base/Boost TDP / PBP / MTP DDR4-3200 L3 Cache Ryzen 9 5900X $549 12P | 24 threads 3.7 / 4.8 GHz - 105W DDR4-3200 32MB (1x32) Core i7-12700K / KF $409 (K) - $384 (KF) 8P + 4E | 12 Cores / 20 threads 3.6 / 5.0 GHz 2.7 / 3.8 GHz 125W / 190W DDR4-3200 / DDR5-4800 25MB Ryzen 7 5800X $449 (typ. $390) 8P | 16 threads 3.8 / 4.7 GHz - 105W DDR4-3200 32MB

Alder Lake combines big and fast Performance cores (P-cores) for latency-sensitive work with small and powerful Efficiency cores (E-cores) for background and multi-threaded workloads. As a result Intel's hybrid architecture brings what we would normally consider 'odd' thread arrangements. That's because the P-cores are hyper-threaded while the E-cores only have a single thread.



The Core i7-12700K lands with the same $409 pricing as the previous-gen Core i7-11700K but it comes with 33% more threads. The Core i7-12700K has eight P-cores and four E-cores for a total of 20 threads. The P-cores run at a 3.6 / 5.0 GHz base/boost while the E-cores weigh in at 2.7 / 3.8 GHz. The chip is fed by 25MB of L3 cache and 12MB of L2.



The 12700K comes with the integrated UHD Graphics 770 engine with 32 EUs that run at a 300 MHz base and boost to 1500 MHz an advantage over the graphics-less Ryzen 9 5900X and 5800X. That means Intel wins by default if you don't have a discrete graphics card. For a more direct comparison you can look at Intel's own Core i7-12700KF an identical chip that lacks the in-built GPU for $384. That $25 price reduction is tempting if you plan to use this chip for a gaming rig that doesn't need integrated graphics — you'll end up paying $65 less than the graphics-less Ryzen 7 5800X. None of these chips in the faceoff come with a bundled cooler and the 12700K comes with 125W PBP (base) and 190W MTP (peak) power ratings.



The 12700K goes toe-to-toe with the 6-core 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600X that has long been the favorite for enthusiasts because of its incredible blend of pricing and performance. These chips come with 65W and 105W TDP ratings respectively 32MB of L3 cache and have only high-performance cores. Both chips support DDR4-3200 memory and the PCIe 4.0 interface.



All Alder Lake chips support DDR4-3200 or up to DDR5-4800 memory (odd DDR5 population rules apply). Alder Lake chips also expose up to 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and an additional four lanes of PCIe 4.0 from the chip for M.2 storage. Intel also added 12 lanes of PCIe 4.0 to its chipset (in addition to its 16 lanes of PCIe 3.0) and now offers a total of 28 lanes. Intel has also widened the DMI connection between the chip and the chipset which now serves up twice the throughput. The increased DMI throughput is also beneficial for Z690's bolstered connectivity options like the new second USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 20 Gbps connection (other new features are listed here).



These new technologies add cost to the Z690 motherboards that house the chips and DDR5 memory is largely unavailable. However there are DDR4-powered Z690 options available. Intel hasn't launched the value-centric B- and H-series chipsets yet so platform pricing will be high for now. It is noteworthy that there is quite a pricing spread between the flagship and bottom-of-the-barrel Z690 options but as expected prices are generally high this close to the launch.



Winner: Intel

Intel's chip pricing is an advantage. The Z690 platform also has a clear connectivity advantage: With DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 on the menu AMD's AM4 platform finds itself looking a bit long in the tooth but Intel's new features do make for more expensive motherboards. The lack of B- and H-series boards at launch doesn't help matters either. Additionally DDR5 pricing is currently brutal and we can expect that to continue for some time. Fortunately the 12700K is just as fast with DDR4 in the majority of tasks.

Given its new hybrid architecture with two types of cores Intel's core counts aren't directly comparable to AMD's due to their different capabilities. Our performance results will dictate the value of the overall designs.

The Core i7-12700K comes with integrated graphics by default though you can sacrifice those for a lower price point. Meanwhile you'll have to look to AMD's Ryzen 7 5700G APU if you want integrated graphics but that chip isn't really directly comparable to the 12700K. That means Intel wins by default if you need an iGPU.

Gaming Benchmarks and Performance: Intel Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X

This article is an overview of our much more in-depth testing in our Intel Core i7-12700K review. We're focusing on our Windows 11 test results in this article but be aware that you could encounter odd performance in some cases with Windows 10. We have the full details in our review.

Below you can see the geometric mean of our gaming tests with the Core i7-12700K vs the Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X at 1080p and 1440p with each resolution split into its own chart. As per usual we're testing with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 to reduce GPU-imposed bottlenecks as much as possible and differences between test subjects will shrink with lesser cards or higher resolutions.

Paired with affordable DDR4 memory at the 1080p resolution the $409 Core i7-12700K is 12% faster than the ~$390 Ryzen 7 5800X in our cumulative gaming performance measurement. The 12700K is also 7.5% faster than the $549 Ryzen 9 5900X that holds the title as AMD's fastest gaming chip.

Pairing the Core i7-12700K with DDR5 causes performance to decline slightly reducing the leads to 10.4% over the 5800X and 5.5% over the 5900X at 1080p but we have to keep things in perspective — that's only a 3 fps difference between the DDR4 and DDR5 setups. It's clear that you don't need an expensive DDR5 kit or motherboard to extract the best of the 12700K's performance especially given the markup for a DDR5-capable motherboard and the scalper pricing on DDR5 kits.

The Core i7-12700K is plenty impressive against AMD's chips but it really stands out when we compare it to Intel's flagship $589 Core i9-12900K: The difference between the two chips is in the noise of expected run-to-run variance. That means the 12700K delivers a 12900K-class gaming experience but for $180 less. Notably the 12900K will have a bit more heft for background tasks like streaming due to its additional four E-cores and perhaps a bit more gas in the tank for future GPU upgrades due to its 200 MHz higher boost clock.



Naturally moving over to 1440p pushes the bottleneck to the GPU so the difference between the chips shrinks tremendously. Gamers with lower-resolution panels with high refresh rates will benefit more from Alder Lake's faster frame rates. Flipping through the 99th percentile charts shows larger deltas between the chips but Windows 11 is still a bit raw and seems to suffer from more framerate variability than Windows 10.



The AMD vs Intel gaming competition is closer now with some games favoring one architecture over the other. As such it's best to make an informed decision based on the types of games that you play frequently. Be sure to check out the individual tests in the above album. In either case Intel holds the lead.

Winner: Intel



The Core i7-12700K beat the Ryzen 7 5800X by substantial amounts in our Windows 11 testing and though the lead narrowed against the Ryzen 9 5900X it still led by ~7% but for $150 less. Overall you get the 12900K gaming experience but for significantly less cash which is hard to beat. You can head to our CPU Benchmark hierarchy to see comparisons in Windows 10 but the deltas are similar giving the 12700K the win in this category.



Of note: The Denuvo DRM falsely identified Intel's E-cores as a separate system and thus ~20 Denuvo-enabled game titles currently don't work with Alder Lake chips. You can read about the simple fix and find the impacted games here. Denuvo says that all affected games will be patched soon.

Application Performance: Intel Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X

We're focusing on Windows 11 application test results for this article but be aware that we encountered subpar performance in Windows 10 with some of the programs that worked perfectly in Windows 11. These problems arise due to a lack of software optimizations for hybrid architectures.

There are methods to correct those issues in Windows 10 but it could require some manual adjustment until more patches arrive from software vendors. Aside from the odd performance in the Handbrake x264 y-cruncher Corona and POV-Ray tests our comparative Windows 10 performance results largely mirrored what we see in Windows 11. Head to our review for more detailed information.

We can boil down productivity application performance into two broad categories: single- and multi-threaded. The first slide above shows the geometric mean of performance in several of our most important tests in each category but be sure to look at the expanded results below.

The Core i7-12700K is ~17% faster than the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X in the single-threaded tasks listed in the chart title. Naturally those impressive performance deltas won't carry over to every type of workload but the 12700K beats the Ryzen lineup in every benchmark. In single-threaded work the 12700K is 19% faster than the previous-gen 11700K and 14% faster than the previous-gen flagship 11900K. The 12900K is the only chip on the market that can beat the 12700K in lightly-threaded work though only by a comparatively slim 3% margin.

These high levels of performance in lightly-threaded apps will equate to a snappier faster experience in all manner of light day-to-day tasks. The 12700K's snappy performance will be most perceivable in web browsers and application start-up tasks.

Image 1 of 21 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

In our cumulative measurement the 12-core 24-thread Core i7-12700K is 2.5% faster than the 12-core 24-thread Ryzen 9 5900X in threaded work. It's also 40% faster than the Ryzen 7 5800X. The generational uplift is impressive too. Against the previous-gen flagship 11900K the 12700K is 35% faster in heavily-threaded tasks and 34% faster than the 11700K.

The current-gen 12900K is ~17% faster in threaded work than the 12700K justifying the premium for users that are focused on productivity work. However it's quite impressive to see the 12700K remain this competitive with the 12900K especially because the difference between the two largely boils down to higher boost clocks and four fewer E-cores for the 12700K. Despite that disparity the 12700K puts up strong results in applications with branchy code like LLVM compilation and the massively parallel molecular dynamics simulation code in NAMD. These heavily-parallelized high-throughput applications respond very well to the E-cores giving the 12900K a leg up.

Given its more forgiving price tag the 12700K also shines in more standard fare like threaded encoding tasks like Handbrake x264 and x265 SVT-HEVC and SVT-AV1.

Winner: Intel

The $409 Core i7-12700K beats the Ryzen competition in every single-threaded benchmark so it delivers exceedingly snappy performance in many of the lighter applications like web browsers and office applications. At its price point the 12700K is untouchable in lightly-threaded work — the $589 Core i9-12900K is the only chip on the market that can beat the 12700K in this type of work.

The 12700K beat the Ryzen 7 5800X in every multi-threaded workload — it really wasn't much of a contest. The Ryzen 9 5900X is much more competitive here with the 12700K only being 2.5% faster in our cumulative measurement. However the 5900X carves out quite a few wins in specific applications like Blender.



The Core i7-12700K wins this round due to its compelling blend of both single-and multi-threaded performance and its more forgiving price tag.

Notably like the other Alder Lake chips the Core i7-12700K can suffer in some multi-threaded workloads in Windows 10 due to difficulties with code with certain prioritization settings. You can correct those issues either via command-line utilities or third-party software like Process Lasso and receive the full expected performance. We expect the industry to correct many of those issues over time. Still it is important to know that Windows 10 could require additional manual tuning to extract the utmost performance.

Overclocking: Intel Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X

Overclocking has become much more complex with the addition of a myriad of new knobs to turn and much of that has to do with the shrinking frequency headroom. Due to fierce competition both Intel and AMD have rolled more of their frequency headroom right into the stock settings over the last few years. Luckily for mid-range system builders you tend to find the most headroom in the lower- to mid-range parts. Enthusiasts have also turned to wringing out extra performance from memory and fabrics as the companies expose more tuning knobs.



Both Intel and AMD expose a wealth of tunable parameters along with sophisticated software overclocking utilities like XTU and Ryzen Master. Both companies also support per-core frequency and hyper-threading control (enable/disable) to help eke out more overclocking headroom.



Intel's Dynamic Memory Boost adds a new wrinkle. This new tech works with both DDR4 and DDR5 and allows the system to dynamically switch between standard memory frequencies and timings and an XMP profile meaning that it will auto-overclock the memory as needed based on the current usage pattern. And yes this occurs while the operating system is running and doesn't require a reboot — it's a real-time dynamic adjustment. Intel also continues to support its existing mechanism for live memory timing adjustments from within the operating system giving users a plethora of on-the-fly memory overclocking options.

Intel has long locked overclocking to its pricey K-series models while AMD freely allows overclocking with all SKUs on almost any platform. However we see signs of some improvement here from Intel as it has now enabled memory overclocking on its B- and H-series chipsets with the 500-series chipsets and it appears that the same policy will hold true with the 600 series.



AMD's Ryzen 5000 chips come with innovative boost technology that largely consumes most of the available frequency headroom so as we see with Intel's flagship there is precious little room for bleeding-edge clock rates. In fact all-core overclocking with AMD's chips is lackluster; you're often better off using its auto-overclocking Precision Boost Overdrive 2 (PBO2) feature that boosts multi-threaded performance. AMD also has plenty of Curve Optimization features that leverage undervolting to increase boost activity.



Intel generally has higher attainable peak frequencies while AMD's more adaptive auto-overclocking tends to have less headroom. However it's always important to remember that chip quality can vary for both vendors so the silicon lottery always comes into play.

Winner: Tie

Both platforms have a wealth of overclocking options for enthusiasts their respective overclocking advantages and a suite of both auto-overclocking and software utilities. However there's still room for a sizeable performance boost from overclocking the core fabric and memory so this contest will often boil down to personal preference.

Power Consumption Efficiency and Cooling: Intel Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X

Image 1 of 15 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Intel's Alder Lake marks an overdue and drastic improvement to the company's power consumption and efficiency metrics. Those improvements come not only from the new architecture that shuffles heavily-threaded work to smaller more efficient cores but also the new Intel 7 process that reduces power consumption and improves efficiency.

The Ryzen processors are still the most power-efficient chips we've ever tested and Alder Lake still sucks more power. However Intel's improvement here is noteworthy: We measured a peak of 195W with the 12700K while the previous-gen 11700K peaked at 239W.

Peak power consumption isn't the most important metric though. The Core i7-12700K is also faster than its predecssor. As you can see in our renders-per-day measurements the Core i7-12700K is nearly twice as efficient as the previous-gen 11700K. Overall Intel has reduced its power consumption to an acceptable level. The Core i5-12700K ran just fine with a 280mm liquid cooler but you could get away with a 240mm or equivalent air cooler.



The last four slides in the above album give us a different view of power efficiency. Here we calculate the cumulative amount of energy required to perform a given task. We plot this 'task energy' value in Kilojoules on the left side of the chart. These workloads are comprised of a fixed amount of work so we can plot the task energy against the time required to finish the job (bottom axis) to give us a better look at efficiency.

Bear in mind that faster completion times and lower task energy are ideal. That means processors that are closest to the bottom left corner are best. It's easy to see that Intel has made a massive generational improvement here; the Core i7-12700K is far more efficient than the 11700K.



However AMD still holds the advantage in all of the key power criteria with the Ryzen 5000 models retaining the crown of the most efficient desktop CPUs that we've ever tested.



Winner: AMD



Intel has made plenty of progress but AMD still holds the crown of the most power-efficient chips. The Ryzen 5000 chips consume less peak power and also accomplish more work per unit of power consumed. That results in a clean sweep in power consumption efficiency and thermal output so you'll end up with a cooler and quieter system.

Pricing: Intel Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X

The Core i7-12700K has a $409 suggested price point but you can also snag the $384 graphics-less Core i7-12700KF for $25 less. Black Friday sales aside you'll typically find the Ryzen 7 5800X for around $390 and the 5900X for $549.

However while the CPU is one of the most important components in the build it is but one factor in the equation — you also need a motherboard and memory. Naturally DDR5 memory is the elephant in the room but that is pretty simple: You should expect to pay a massive early adopter premium for DDR5 memory and more for the higher-end DDR5 motherboards. If you plan on going the DDR5 route be ready to open your wallet wide — DDR5 memory is mostly out of stock or up to 50% more expensive than DDR4. If you're looking for bang-for-the-buck DDR5 is off the table for now. Luckily DDR4 offers nearly the same performance in most applications and faster gaming performance in Windows 10 (at least in our test environment).

For now you have no choice but to use a Z6900 motherboard for Core i7-12700K systems as Intel hasn't released the B- or H-series chipsets yet. In addition all high-end Z690 motherboards support DDR5 but most (if not all) of the DDR4-compatible Z690 boards land in the lower- to mid-ranges of the Z690 stack.

In terms of pricing building a Ryzen 7 5800X system is roughly a wash compared to a DDR4-equipped 12700K system but you gain significantly more performance in exchange. Meanwhile the Ryzen 9 5900X costs significantly more for the chip (at least at suggested pricing) than the Core i7-12700K giving the Intel chip some leeway to absorb higher motherboard pricing and still maintain the performance-per-dollar edge.

We can make a few comparisons with X570 and Z690 boards though. It's still a bit early to get the complete picture on motherboard pricing; we're seeing the normal spotty availability in the wake of a big launch. Here are a few like-for-like comparisons but this could vary (pricing is valid only at the time of publication):

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Price MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 $219 MSI X570-A PRO $159 ASRock Z690 Phantom Gaming 4 $179 ASRock X570 PHANTOM GAMING 4 $154 ASUS Prime Z690-P D4 $220 ASUS PRIME X570-P $157

As you can see we're looking at price deltas that range from $25 to $63 between the X570 and Z690 DDR4 motherboards with the latter being more expensive. So of course you'll have to add in those costs if you plan to build an Alder Lake system.

However there are a lot of factors involved. For instance the Z690 platform offers more robust connectivity options like PCIe 5.0 but you do have to pay extra for those capabilities.

Winner: Intel

Alder Lake systems equipped with DDR5 memory will carry a big premium that isn't worth the slim performance gains over DDR4 in most applications especially with Alder Lake chips with lower core counts. Given the early state of DDR5 availability it's hard to nail down firm estimates. However the high pricing of DDR5 isn't worth it for most users which removes one of the key reasons to go with an Alder Lake system.

Platform pricing for a Ryzen 7 5800X system will be close enough to a wash with the 12700K to push the focus to the 12700K's 12% faster gaming performance 17% gain in lightly-threaded applications and 40% advantage in threaded work. In other words the 12700K has a clear performance-per-dollar win against the 5800X.



The Ryzen 9 5900X also carries much higher suggested chip pricing which means the 12700K offers a lower platform cost while leading the 5900X by 7.5% in gaming 17% in lightly-threaded work and ~2% in threaded work though the latter is closer to a tie when we zoom out to the overall broader picture.

Bottom Line: Intel Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X

Swipe to scroll horizontally Intel Core i5-12600K vs Ryzen 5 5600X and Ryzen 7 5800X Row 0 - Cell 0 Intel Core i7-12700K AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and 5800X Features and Specifications X Row 1 - Cell 2 Gaming X Row 2 - Cell 2 Application Performance X Row 3 - Cell 2 Overclocking X X Power Consumption Efficiency and Cooling Row 5 - Cell 1 X Pricing X Row 6 - Cell 2 Total 5 2

The Core i7-12700K offers the lion's share of the Core i9-12900K's performance but at a much more forgiving price point. That goes a long way to boosting the value proposition giving the chip a five-to-two lead in this Core i7-12700K vs Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X battle.

In performance testing the $409 Core i7-12700K beat the ~$390 Ryzen 7 5800X convincingly in just about every category with 12% faster gaming 17% faster performance in single-threaded work and 40% more performance in multi-threaded applications. Given the Core i7-12700K's performance lead it more than makes up for the roughly equivalent platform pricing with the 5800X.

Additionally even though the ~$549 Ryzen 9 5900X costs $140 more the 12700K was 7.5% faster in gaming 17% faster in single-threaded work and ~2% faster in our overall measurement of multi-threaded productivity applications. The Ryzen 9 5900X does take the lead in some heavily-threaded applications however so you'll have to carefully weigh your priorities and decide if the markup is worth the extra performance in some areas or the sacrifices in others. Overall the 12700K holds the value crown here.

The 12700K is the fastest gaming chip in its price range with both DDR4 and DDR5 memory and Windows 10 and 11. Given its aggressive pricing and 12900K-like performance it reigns supreme as the high-end chip for gaming — the 12900K isn't worth the premium for gaming-only rigs. However AMD will fire back with its 3D V-Cache processors that will come with up to 192MB of L3 cache per chip which the company says infuses up to 15% more gaming performance. Those chips arrive next year but we aren't sure if the performance gains will apply to games.



The Core i7-12700K's advantages also include platform additives but the DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 interfaces add to platform costs. Intel's decision to hold back the B- and H-series motherboards hurts here as pricey Z690 boards are your only option at least for now. Support for DDR4 can help reduce the premium associated with DDR5 but that comes with a compromise: We haven't seen any flagship DDR4 motherboards yet; the highest-end models appear to be confined to DDR5. If you're going with a DDR5 build prepare yourself for eye-watering pricing at least until supply improves. Luckily you won't need expensive DDR5 memory to unlock the best gaming performance — unless you have a very specific need for DDR5 it's probably best to skip it.

AMD still holds the power and efficiency crown but the 'Intel 7' process reduces peak power consumption drastically improves power efficiency. Overall if we take performance into account Intel has reduced its power consumption from meme-worthy to an acceptable level.

Be aware that software updates should help resolve many of the early issues in Windows 10 but you might need to engage in some manual tweaking with some specific programs.

Despite those early challenges Alder Lake marks a massive generational leap forward forging a compelling blend of pricing and single- and multi-threaded performance all while delivering roughly the same gaming performance as the world's fastest gaming chip the Core i9-12900K but for $180 less.



Combined with leading-edge connectivity options and improved power consumption and efficiency the Core i7-12700K wins the faceoff with the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X in convincing fashion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLTR0aC1nZW4tYXJjLWRydWlkLWdwdXMtY291bGQtcG90ZW50aWFsbHktZ2V0LWEtMjAyNS1sYXVuY2gv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vaW50ZWwtNHRoLWdlbi1hcmMtZHJ1aWQtZ3B1cy1jb3VsZC1wb3RlbnRpYWxseS1nZXQtYS0yMDI1LWxhdW5jaC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel’s 4th Gen ARC Druid GPUs Could Potentially Get a 2025 Launch,"Intel is by far the only company that has revealed a long-term roadmap for its ARC Gaming GPU lineup based on its future Xe GPU cores. With a strong motivation to design and develop the best gaming GPUs in the market Intel's Gaming division is definitely cooking up some great products.

Intel's 4th Gen ARC Druid GPU Lineup With Xe Next Architecture Could Potentially Launch In 2025

While AMD and NVIDIA have yet to release their latest gaming GPU roadmap Intel already teased its next-generation lineup starting with ARC Alchemist based on the Xe-HPG architecture. The GPU lineup is planned for launch in Q1 2022 and if everything goes as expected Intel expects to have a yearly cadence where they will launch a new generation of GPUs to replace the older ones.

If all goes well that could be when Intel ARC 'Druid' cards come out... game on 🎮😉 — Bryce_GfxDriverGuru (@theBryceIsRt) November 23 2021

According to Intel's ARC community advocate driver guru and product manager (via Videocardz) Bryce if all goes well Intel could have its fourth generation ARC GPU lineup codenamed Druid out by 2025. The 4th Gen lineup will most likely compete with AMD's RDNA 5 and NVIDIA's Ampere Next Next GPUs by the time that they launch. This means that the two GPU generations prior to Druid are going to see a tentative launch in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

Intel's next-generation ARC Battlemage GPUs will feature the Xe2 HPG architecture ARC Celestial will feature the Xe3 HP architecture and ARC Druid will feature a brand new Xe Next architecture. Intel has barely revealed details regarding its ARC Alchemist graphics lineup and most of what we know is through leaks and rumors. So information for the rest of the lineup isn't expected till we get closer to launch.

As for ARC Druid GPUs Intel will be competing against the top and bottom lineup of graphics cards from its rivals and will try to offer competitive pricing and performance. But we shouldn't place our bets on a 2025 release as the current ARC DG2 lineup was stated to launch by the end of 2021 by Intel themselves however it has since been pushed to a 2022 launch and for Druid we are talking at least 4-5 years in advance so a lot can change.

The final versions of the upcoming ‘locked’ non-K CPUs have been pictured (almost) in their entirety.

Over at Zhihu DDAA117 has the first photos of the non-K Alder Lake-S CPUs. This is actually the same leaker that revealed retail models of Core i9-12900K and i5-12600K SKUs ahead of launch.

Intel Alder Lake non-K Series Source: DDAA117

This time around DDAA117 possibly delivers the world’s first photos of the non-K lineup including Core i9-12900 (SRL4E) Core i5-12600 (SRL4F) Core i5-12500 (SRL4G) and Core i5-12400 (SLR4P). What this lineup is missing are Core i7-12700 and Core i3-12300/12100 CPUs not to mention their F-variants which lack integrated GPU support.

Along with the photos some new details on the series clock speeds have been confirmed. Some details were provided by leaker @momomo_us and some were confirmed by DDAA117 himself who provided CPU-Z screenshots of the samples pictured above.

The Core i9-12900 is a 16-core and 24-thread (8P+8E) CPU with a base clock speed of 2.4 GHz and a boost up to 5.1 GHz. This CPU will have a 30MB L3 Cache. A cut-down part known as Core i7-12700 will have half of the Efficient cores enabled (8P+4E) which means a total of 12-cores and 20 threads. This CPU is to be clocked 200 to 300 MHz lower than the 12900: 2.1 GHz base clock and 4.9 GHz boost clock. Do note that those frequencies only apply to Performance cores.

Intel’s Core i5 lineup will include as many as three parts: i5-12600 (base clock 3.3 GHz boost 4.8 GHz) i5-12500 (base clock 3.0 GHz boost 4.6 GHz) and i5-12400 (base clock 2.5 GHz boost 4.4 GHz). According to the leaks each of those CPUs will have Efficient cores disabled entirely in fact this type of core is not even present on the silicon. As revealed by MSI Intel developed two types of Alder Lake desktop silicon either with 8+8 cores or 6+0. The Core i5 non-K lineup will exclusively be using the latter variant. What is interesting here however is that a higher-spec’ed variant called Core i5-12600K is not actually using the same silicon (which is normally the case) but a 6P+4E configuration instead. In other words Core i5-12600K and Core i5-12600 will not only have different TDPs and clocks but also a different number of cores.

Finally the Core i3 series has only partially been confirmed. Mainly the Core i3-12300 remains a mystery for now. The configuration of cores has not yet been confirmed but it is expected to be a quad-core CPU without any hybrid functionality. The same applies to Core i3-12100 the slowest Alder lake-S part carrying the ‘Core’ branding. What is confirmed at this moment is that 12300 might boost up to 4.4 GHz and 12100 up to 4.3 GHz.

Some of the mentioned non-K Alder Lake CPUs have already been listed by retailers. We have already seen a leak from Canadian retailer but now we have a listing from a Bangladeshi store called Nexus that claims to have those CPUs in stock. This would be the first confirmation that the non-K series have already shipped to retailers.

Intel is now expected to launch its non-K series along with B660 and H610 motherboards in mid-January. We should hear more about this lineup around CES 2022 where Intel will be making a number of announcements including the next-gen Alder Lake-P mobile series and hopefully its Arc Alchemist GPU series.

AMD has been slowly but surely eating away at Intel's market share in the laptop world and its latest Zen 3 microarchitecture shows no signs of slowing down. The performance advantages in particular are hard to ignore especially after benchmarking the Ryzen 5 5600U CPU as even this AMD midrange offering can outperform Intel's best on numerous occasions.

Based on our time with the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 14 running on a Ryzen 5 5600U the 6-core AMD processor can offer anywhere between 70 to 100 percent faster multi-thread performance than the Core i7-1165G7 i7-1185G7 or even the i7-1195G7 according to CineBench benchmarks. Other applications dependent on multi-thread performance would subsequently favor the Ryzen 5 5600U by wide margins including HWBOT x265 7-Zip and Blender.

The performance delta can be mostly attributed to the differences in cores and threads between AMD and Intel U-series CPUs. Whereas the Ryzen 5 5600U integrates 6 cores and 12 threads (or even 8 cores and 16 threads on the Ryzen 7 5800U) the entire Intel 11th gen Core i7 U-series lineup is limited to 4 cores and 8 threads only. Benchmarks that don't depend on multi-thread CPU performance such as single-thread operations or raw graphics tend to favor Intel as a result. 3DMark and CineBench single-thread benchmarks for Intel are about 30 to 45 percent and 5 to 10 percent higher respectively when compared to the Ryzen 5 5600U.

If you're looking to maximize U-series processor performance then an AMD model would be your best bet especially since they tend to retail for cheaper prices than Intel. On the other hand users looking to maximize integrated graphics performance may want to consider an 11th gen Core i7 model instead. Intel no longer has the best of both worlds in this regard."

As reported by Radio Free Asia China's Cyberspace Administration has ordered Didi Global Inc to devise a plan to delist as the company could ""leak sensitive data.""

This came months after China's internet watchdog has started an investigation into Didi Chuxing company for issues related to national 'data security'.

The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in July 2021 Radio Free Asia reported.

Meanwhile experts said that the review is another example of Beijing crackdown on influential IT giants.

Earlier in April the Chinese government had also imposed a huge fine on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.

Claiming a crackdown on anti-competitive practices among Chinese internet giants Beijing has ramped up a broader effort to clean up the operations of the country's fast-growing and freewheeling tech sector.

Meanwhile Beijing has been infamous for using antimonopoly rules to curb the market influence of foreign firms. In April regulators imposed a whopping USD 2.8 billion fine upon Alibaba stating that it had abused its dominant market position by engaging in a controversial practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fredonia represented 16 countries across five different committees.

Each delegation wrote a position paper and this year we submitted 16 position papers. The delegation representing Yemen (Greta Frerichs Joella Bauza and Angelina May) position paper came in second place. The Syrian delegation (Emerson Bramer Gigi Gullo and Haley Zadzilka) position paper came in third place.

Only three awards are given in this category.

This is a major achievement. This year we faced very challenging paper assignments; both groups wrote about their countries’ approaches to ocean acidification. Since the first week of school the Model UN team has stayed after school every Friday to work on their position papers. Their dedication has been exceptional and their hard work has certainly paid off.

Several Fredonia students were recognized for their outstanding effort in representing their countries at the conference. In addition to being recognized for their position paper Greta Frerichs Joella Bauza and Angelina May were recognized as best delegate runners-up representing Yemen. Fred Gullo and Lauren Sercu were awarded honorable mention and an excellent ranking representing St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Ava Hartung Andrew Cowan and Luca Gullo won BEST delegate awards for their work representing China. This was a major accomplishment as it was the first time Ava Andrew and Luca attended a Model UN conference.

Gannon added a new committee this year the Press Corp Students developed a pen name attended a committee meeting posted updates on social media and wrote articles. Raena Beckley won one of the three inaugural awards for this committee. She was recognized for her excellent journalism skills. A big thank you to Lisa Reinhardt who attended the conference this year. Her expertise in journalism was a welcomed addition to the advising team.

Finally FHS won third place for Overall Best Delegation. This award recognized the work of all the students who attend the weekly meetings here at school and performed at their best at the Conference.

On behalf of Tom Donovan and myself another thank you to Reinhardt and everyone who supports this organization. We observed some great things this season. Several students took on mentorship roles and worked with new members while others improved and became more confident in their speaking and writing abilities.

Overall it was a great year!

The report warned the world must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. To achieve this not only must the emissions released by countries and companies be dramatically curtailed but billions of tons of carbon dioxide must be sucked out of the atmosphere.

These findings directly informed Microsoft’s climate policy said Willmott. In January 2020 the company announced that it would be carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 it would have removed from the atmosphere all the carbon it has emitted since it was founded in 1975. By making this pledge the company joined a small group of businesses including Ikea and the software company Intuit committed to going further than net-zero.

Microsoft is often ranked as a leading business on climate action. Its policies – from making it easier for people to repair their devices to launching software to help companies measure and manage carbon emissions – have been praised for going beyond the company’s own operations to the footprint of its suppliers and customers.

“Being a large well-known brand and putting a stake in the ground talking publicly for years about the importance of climate change is really critical” said Simon Fischweicher head of corporations and supply chains for the environmental non-profit CDP North America.

However Microsoft has also been criticized for actions that appear to contradict its bold rhetoric on climate including membership of trade associations that lobby against climate legislation contracts with oil and gas firms and donations to politicians who obstruct climate policy.

These connections make it “complicit” in efforts to push against climate action said Bill Weihl a former sustainability executive at Google and Facebook and the founder of the advocacy group ClimateVoice.

Scaling up goals

Microsoft has been operating as a carbon-neutral company for nearly a decade a feat it has achieved through buying carbon offsets as well as securing renewable power directly from clean energy companies and installing onsite renewable energy such as solar panels at its offices.

Since 2012 Microsoft has also implemented an internal carbon fee currently set at $15 a metric ton making business units pay for emissions related to their operations and electricity as well as from business air travel.

“The money gets collected and spent” said Willmott whose carbon management team uses the money to fund initiatives such as buying clean energy and carbon offsets. “I have to pinch myself regularly because that was something we dreamed about and didn’t think was actually going to happen.”

It’s a “powerful mechanism” says Fischweicher to push a company to think more deeply about the impact of its activities: “To pay a fee you start to think about: ‘What can I do to reduce that so I have more money in my budget?’”

But the company has recognized that much more is required to tackle the climate crisis and the plan to go carbon negative was a big step up in ambitions.

Microsoft has laid out milestones for reaching the target. By 2025 it aims to reduce the emissions from its direct operations to “near zero” through gains in energy efficiency and using 100% renewable energy. By 2030 it has committed to reducing by at least 50% its direct emissions and those from its supply chain.

The company’s supply chain – more than 58000 suppliers provide everything from office furniture to the metals and plastics used in its products – makes up the bulk of its emissions. Last year the company implemented a carbon reporting requirement for suppliers and it extended the internal carbon fee to cover supply chain emissions.

But in order to remove more emissions than it produces the company will rely heavily on carbon removal projects. These include nature-based initiatives such as funding reforestation projects but the company is also pinning its hopes on technology. Microsoft is investing $1bn to support emerging technology that can reduce capture and remove carbon from the air.

As part of this the company has invested in and purchased carbon removal from Climeworks which operates the world’s largest direct air capture plant in Iceland removing CO2 from the air and trapping it in rock underground.

In 2020 Microsoft removed 1.3m metric tons of carbon through a range of initiatives from nature based programs to carbon capture technology.

However these projects face obstacles. Relying on forests and soil to trap endless amounts of carbon is increasingly difficult in the face of worsening wildfires pests and changes in land use. And carbon removal technology is not anywhere near the scale needed. There are 19 direct air capture (DAC) plants in operation globally capturing just over 100000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. The International Energy Agency has estimated that reaching net zero by 2050 would require the world to scale up DAC to capture more than 85m tons each year by 2030 and around 980m tons a year by 2050.

It’s a challenge that Microsoft is grappling with. The number and type of projects currently available is “far short of what we need” said Willmott. By 2030 the company estimates it will need to remove 5m to 6m tons of carbon. This means the technology will need to be considerably scaled up to meet Microsoft’s demands alone she said “and that’s to say nothing of the fact that there’s a real spike in corporate demand”.

It’s not just the amount of viable carbon capture projects that’s lacking Willmot said; there’s also a quality issue. The industry doesn’t fully distinguish between avoided emissions and those that are actually removed from the atmosphere she said. More robust quality standards would go a long way to making sure “it’s not quite a wild wild west that it is today” Willmot said.

“[Microsoft is] opening up new conversations about historical emissions without having all the answers” said Aoife Brophy departmental research lecturer in innovation and enterprise at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School. “Leaders on climate need to acknowledge the complexity of the problem and be transparent about the fact that there are not always clear solutions.”

Microsoft’s focus on historical emissions could also help spur a deeper conversation she said about “responsibility for the past and may lead to much better ways to think about issues like climate justice that have not yet been adequately addressed by companies”.

A wider influence

The modern corporate sustainability movement requires companies to also consider their impacts on customers peers and society more broadly. This shift in perspective said Fischweicher “is a really critical turning-point moment … because what you’re also talking about is shifting your business model overall”.

To Microsoft’s critics this means the company should reconsider its work with oil companies. The same week that Microsoft made its carbon-negative announcement it sponsored an oil conference in Saudi Arabia. A 2020 Greenpeace report digging into tech companies’ work with the oil and gas industry – such as providing software to support fossil fuel extraction – found that its contract with ExxonMobil “could lead to emissions greater than 20% of Microsoft’s annual carbon footprint”.

The company also spent about $200000 during the 2020 US election cycle supporting politicians with a history of climate denial. And this October Microsoft – along with other corporations – was criticized by the watchdog group Accountable.US for its membership of trade organizations with a history of fighting climate crisis legislation including the Business Roundtable and the US Chamber of Commerce. Most recently these groups have lobbied against climate legislation included under Joe Biden’s reconciliation bill.

“I feel really strongly that we need to be able to work with everyone to make this transition to a low-carbon economy in the future” said Willmott responding to these criticisms. “I really think it’s important not to villainize any particular sector or villainize any particular entities but rather really work hard from within to shape the journey.”

Weihl whose organization ClimateVoice is calling on Microsoft and others to devote one-fifth of their lobbying dollars to climate policy in 2021 remains skeptical. “Companies are putting their narrow self-interest ahead of actually addressing the climate crisis at scale” he said. “Silence and unwillingness to publicly distance themselves [from these groups] is not neutrality it’s complicity.”

Whether it’s Microsoft’s customers and affiliations or the type of work it does experts agree the company’s size and political heft as well as its position within trade groups give it immense power – and it’s all about how the company chooses to use it.

“Tech companies shape how we engage with the world and the information we see on a daily basis” said Brophy. “We need to think of impact beyond measuring emissions and consider ways in which technology can be used to create change across different systems.”

Microsoft’s climate commitments are laudable she said but ultimately success will require collective action. “The biggest challenge is that Microsoft’s goals cannot be achieved by Microsoft alone” said Brophy. “But that’s exactly what we need to see companies across industries doing more of: coming out and being bold recognizing that they need to be systems leaders.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

IRM,Iron Mountain,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzExLzI4L2hvdy1zYWZlLWFyZS1pcm9uLW1vdW50YWluLWFuZC1pdHMtZGl2aWRlbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Safe Are Iron Mountain and Its Dividend?,"The REIT's payout ratio looks pretty good but that's not the only thing investors need to consider when it comes to gauging dividend safety.

Iron Mountain (IRM 0.23%) is a unique real estate investment trust (REIT) that basically has no direct peers. That can make it hard to analyze the company but there are some financial truths that can't be ignored and those metrics show the REIT and its dividend may be riskier than some investors realize.

Storage then now and in the future

Iron Mountain's core business is storing physical records. Mostly that involves bankers boxes full of papers that it puts into safe locations so its customers can clear out space in their own buildings. It's a very sticky business since most companies don't want to touch the boxes they store again until they are so old that the contents can be legally destroyed. For example the average box that the real estate investment trust gets sits in storage for 15 years and the company has a 98% customer retention rate.

The problem is that the world is increasingly going digital so paper just isn't as important as it was before. And that means that its core business despite being sticky is slowly dying.

Iron Mountain's management isn't sticking its head in the sand though. It's doing something about the problem -- building data centers. That's basically the future of storage which Iron Mountain hopes it can tap into with its massive Rolodex of big-name customers. Around 95% of the Fortune 1000 use its services today.

On the surface it sounds like Iron Mountain is heading down a great path using its ""cash cow"" core operations to fund its expansion into a new area. Only there's one big problem: A REIT has to pay out huge amounts of cash to investors (at least 90% of its taxable income) in the form of dividends. There's really not all that much left after that to pay for a costly transition. That increases the company's risk across the board. And even though it could trim the dividend to the bare minimum required for a REIT management is loath to cut the payment because doing so would turn off investors.

The dividend and more

So the company is in the middle of an important overhaul that will ultimately determine its long-term future. Because it's a REIT and wants to avoid a dividend cut it has to look to capital markets to help fund that shift. The means debt and stock sales are key issues for investors to monitor. With a dividend yield of 5.3% stock sales are a little expensive; the average REIT using Vanguard Real Estate Index ETF as a proxy has a yield of just 2.2%. And secondary offerings aren't exactly the ideal way for it to raise cash given that it has to pay dividends on each new share it sells.

Iron Mountain's debt meanwhile is fairly high. Though management says that its balance sheet is well-positioned its debt-to-equity ratio of nearly 9.4 is woefully out of sync with the largest data center REITs which have ratios closer to 1. Building data centers is a costly endeavor but adding more leverage to the balance sheet isn't exactly an exciting prospect.

And yet Iron Mountain's payout ratio in the third quarter was a fairly reasonable 70% or so of adjusted funds from operations (FFO). The adjusted FFO metric factors out some one-time items. Leave those in and FFO shrinks enough to boost the payout ratio to around 85% -- still not terrible but getting closer to worrisome territory.

Still on its own the payout ratio isn't all that troublesome. It's when you add in Iron Mountain's leverage and its expensive (though necessary) business overhaul that the risk starts to become more apparent. Simply put if something should go wrong during the REIT's transition into a more digital company cutting its dividend would be a very convenient way to shore up its finances. That doesn't mean there will be a cut but there is likely more risk here than meets the eye.

So far so good

Given the REIT's recent past this analysis might sound like Chicken Little's warning that the sky is falling. But leverage materially limits a company's flexibility and Iron Mountain has a lot of leverage -- notably more than the REITs it is increasingly trying to emulate. If everything goes well the company and its dividend will probably be just fine. If something goes wrong however the impact could be swift and painful. That's not something that risk-averse income investors should ignore even though Iron Mountain's yield is fairly generous today.

If you do decide to buy make sure you continue to pay close attention to the digital makeover the dividend and the balance sheet. All three are potential trouble spots.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ:JKHY) Just Reported Third-Quarter Earnings: Have Analysts Changed Their Mind On The Stock?,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. ( ) shareholders because the company has just released its latest third-quarter results and the shares gained 3.1% to US$169. Jack Henry & Associates reported in line with analyst predictions delivering revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models following these results.

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a notable 8.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 11% to US$5.75. In the lead-up to this report the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$181 suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. There's another way to think about price targets though and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Jack Henry & Associates with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$200 and the most bearish at US$170 per share. Still with such a tight range of estimates it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.

These estimates are interesting but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare both to the Jack Henry & Associates' past performance and to peers in the same . We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Jack Henry & Associates'historical trends as the 6.6% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 is roughly in line with the 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 3.7% annually. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.

With that in mind we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Jack Henry & Associates. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Jack Henry & Associates analysts - going out to 2026 and you can

It All Boils Down To One Brilliant Career Risk Back ...,"Why Is Oprah A Multi-Billionaire Instead Of A Mere Multi-Millionaire? It All Boils Down To One Brilliant Career Risk Back In 1984…

Back in the early 1980s Oprah was locked in a head-to-head ratings battle with local Chicago TV rival Phil Donahue. Other popular TV hosts of the era included Sally Jessy Raphael Geraldo and Jerry Springer. Fast forward 30 years and Phil Donahue's net worth is $150 million. Sally Jessy is worth $40 million. Springer is worth $60 million. Oprah's net worth? $3.5 billion. That's around 60 times larger than her closest former rival. How did this happen? By all indicators Oprah should have had a respectable TV career that maybe went national for a decade or two. A respectable career that would have left her rich today…a fortune in the tens of millions of dollars. We can't possibly know the actual amount but it's safe to bet it would have been a mere fraction of billionaire status. So what's the difference between Oprah and basically everyone else? It all boils down to one brilliant business risk that she took in 1984.

Oprah got her TV start at a CBS station in Nashville when she was just 19 years old. In 1976 she moved to an ABC station over in Baltimore as an evening news host. In 1978 she jumped to a new morning talk show on the same station. It was in the morning talk show format that Oprah found her niche with viewers. She listened she emphasized she could chat about everything from a serious crime to a new recipe for muffins.

By 1980 she was beating the nationally-syndicated Phil Donahue in the local Baltimore market. By the end of her Baltimore run she was earning $220000 per year which is the same as around $560000 today after adjusting for inflation.

Recognizing her potential in 1984 ABC gave Oprah her very own 30-minute morning talk show in Chicago to be produced by a company called King World Productions. King World was also the production studio behind Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. The job came with a 4-year contract and a $30k per year pay raise to $250k which is the same as around $600k today. There was also a plan to take the show national.

Oprah was ecstatic. how could she not be? She had come from wretched poverty and pulled herself up by the bootstraps to earn an enormous salary and become a star. The American dream come true!

Oprah's Net Worth 1984: $500000

Pretty soon after signing the new deal something seemed fishy to Oprah. ABC executives wouldn't shut up about how good the deal was for her and how easy her agent was to work with. No executive had ever told her she had a good deal before. They always bemoaned how much she was making.

Oprah mentioned her fishy feeling to fellow Chicago TC personality film critic Roger Ebert. Roger confirmed the deal was bad especially considering his assumption that profits from the show would increase 40X if it ever went national. Exponentially more than the $30k bump they were paying.

Oprah then pinged Bill Cosby about the situation. Cosby was struck by her description of the agent and network getting along so well. Cosby explained:

""When they see my agent coming down hallways at TV studios networks anywhere people get scared…My agent is a piranha. You need a piranha. I know a guy. He'll explain to you why I'm wealthy. They're just offering to make you RICH.""

Oprah immediately fired her longtime agent and following Cosby's advice hired a lawyer named Jeffrey Jacobs.

Jacobs looked at her contract and explained:

Jeffrey Jacobs: ""You can sign this contract. You can sign it if you're willing to be nothing more than a slave.

Oprah: ""Excuse me?""

Jacobs: ""This is a slave contract. Slaves work for a fixed dollar. They're willing to bank on a national show. This contract is for 4 years totaling $1 million dollars an effort to make you a highly paid slave. Now there's a thing called syndication that they're going to market this through.""

Oprah: ""Roger Ebert told me how he and Gene Siskel held out for a piece of their show's syndication revenue but had to take on production costs… I think that's the kind of deals Bill Cosby brokers for Fat Albert and The Cosby Show… but I don't have that kind of clout.""

Or did she???

With her blessing Jacobs went into King World/ABC and told them the contract was a pile of crap. They demanded to renegotiate right away.

This was a huge risk. Think about it. Oprah was a black female regional TV host in the 1980s. She wasn't Bill Cosby-famous. What would have stopped ABC from simply firing her on the spot? Even if they had to pay out her contract it would have been a rounding error.

Jacobs and Oprah proceeded to drop a bomb on ABC/King World. A bomb that would ultimately turn her into a billionaire.

Oprah didn't merely want an enormous salary boost she wanted OWNERSHIP of her show.

Amazingly ABC/King World agreed. To be fair Oprah was starting to attract record viewer numbers in Chicago so national syndication was looking more and more like a slam dunk.

In 1986 Oprah's show was relaunched as The Oprah Winfrey Show and expanded to an hour. Under the new deal terms Oprah would be taking on all production costs for her own show. And remember at the time her net worth was in the $500000 range. She had nowhere near the tens of millions that would be needed to produce a nationally syndicated professional TV show.

The solution? Fake it till you make it.

Oprah and Jeffrey hatched a plan where they would pledge the future profits of the first three years of the show estimated to be $30 million per year as collateral to:

a) Fund the current production costs and

b) Simultaneously begin construction on her own company and physical studio space. The name for the new company and production space? Harpo Productions and Harpo Studios. Oprah would own 90% Jeffrey Jacobs would silently own 10%. They pitched the concept like a startup seeking venture capital. Under the structure Oprah could earn as much as 25% her show's gross profits. Jeffrey estimated the proceeds in year one to be $30 million and these proceeds are what they put up as collateral to build their plan.

Oprah: ""This is amazing Jeffrey. Is this what Bill [Cosby] is doing?""

Jacobs: ""Yes which is why he'll soon be one of America's invisible billionaires. Every project he works on he operates not as a paid performer but as a business a partner so he gets a piece of the pie not crumbs as payment.""

Harpo Productions and Harpo Studios launched in 1990.

Oprah Net Worth 1990: $100 million

Oprah wasn't done yet.

King World was still Harpo's distribution partner. They were essentially a paid employee taking the show national for a fee every year. Oprah knew how valuable she had become to King World as the #1 daytime talk show host in the country.

Jeffrey and Oprah soon negotiated a new deal with ABC that included books deals movie productions a magazine…and most importantly…other TV shows. Oprah didn't want just any crappy random show to air before or after The Oprah Winfrey Show so she struck a deal to produce the shows that surrounded her. All production will take place at her 3.5 acre Harpo campus.

She still wasn't done.

Jeffrey and Oprah negotiated a deal where Harpo was given an equity stake in King World Productions. They made it so Oprah earned money off everything King World produced including Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.

Oprah Net Worth 1995: $300-500 million

In 1999 CBS bought King World for $2.5 billion in stock. With the deal Oprah ended up owning one-half of 1% of all of CBS. Media mogul Sumner Redstone would eventually splice together CBS and Viacom.

Oprah owned a stake in Disney through an equity deal she was given at ABC in the 90s. That stake eventually became Disney stock.

Oprah Net Worth 2000: $1 billion.

By the turn of the millennium Oprah had become American's first female black billionaire and by far the richest person on TV. At this point between her own show and the shows she produced (most notably Dr. Phil Rachael Ray) Oprah is earning $300 million per year.

Oprah Net Worth: 2007: $2 billion

Outside of television Oprah grew her assets very wisely. In 2015 she became a board member and endorser for Weight Watchers. She was initially awarded $43.5 million worth of company stock. At times that stake has been worth as much as $400 million.

She's also quite the real estate investor. In Chicago she owns the real estate that houses Harpo studios. She formerly owned a large home in the Chicago suburbs.

Arguably her most impressive real estate asset is a 23000 square foot mansion in Montecito California (near Santa Barbara) which she purchased in 2001 for $50 million. Today this home is worth at least $90 million. In 2016 she purchased a 23-acre farm estate also in Montecito for $29 million. She owns 63 acres in Montecito.

Oprah owns a 41-acre estate on Orcas Island in Washington State that she purchased for $8.275 million in 2018. In 2014 she spent $14 million for a home in Telluride Colorado. Oprah bought her first property in Maui in 2002. Over the year she has spent as much as $60 million to piece together 163 acres. She spent $32 million in one transaction alone to buy the property next door.

In total Oprah owns at least $200 million worth of real estate in the United States.

Oprah Net Worth 2019: $3.5 billion

Today when you add it all up Oprah is worth at least $3.5 billion perhaps as much as $4 billion. The only entertainment people who have more money are Steven Spielberg with $3.7 billion and George Lucas with $5.4 billion. What's the common thread with all three? At some point all three made the transition from paid employee to OWNER of what they were producing.

Be it Star Wars Amblin Entertainment or the appropriately titled OWN Network if you want to be wealthy as opposed to merely rich you must be an owner.

As he approached his first anniversary in office the freshman mayor whose political career began at the firebrand Chicago Teachers Union looked right at home before the adoring crowd of self-proclaimed troublemakers at the annual Labor Notes conference in April near O’Hare International Airport. During his speech to the group Johnson commended the City Council’s controversial razor-thin January endorsement of a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.

“I’m also proud that the city of Chicago led the way the beginning this year of passing a resolution calling for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza” he said. “And I’m so grateful that I got a chance to vote to break the tie.”

Outside meanwhile protesters were clashing with Rosemont cops. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators banged on a police car to demand the release of one of them who had been detained.

Johnson celebrating his newfound role as the boss of the nation’s third-largest city with a roomful of union bigwigs at the annual strategy session was not the target of the rally-turned-skirmish by rank-and-file labor groups outside the event the Labor for Palestine National Network said.

But the chorus of protesters singing the labor anthem “Which side are you on?” while fighting with baton-wielding officers illustrated a difficult reality for him one year into his term: How does a mayor who proved his bona fides through audacious organizing against the establishment set the tone for peaceful protests amid a swelling antiwar movement ahead of the Democratic National Convention’s arrival in Chicago this August?

As with other issues during Johnson’s first year the question touches on the conundrum of his jump from underdog mayoral candidate to chief executive. His campaign caught fire because he vowed to fight the status quo. But to some his administration now represents the status quo.

Like his fifth floor predecessors Johnson has been thrown a series of curveballs over the past 12 months making it tougher for him to find his footing at the outset as he’s up against a sharp learning curve in occupying the most powerful seat in Chicago government.

The very costly and divisive migrant crisis waiting on Johnson’s desk from day one crowded out many of his early legislative victories centered on worker’s rights and saddled him with high-profile setbacks as he stumbled through how the city could house tens of thousands of asylum-seekers.

Though momentum is returning in the wake of him clinching the passage of an ambitious $1.25 billion bond plan to fund affordable housing and development pockets of Johnson’s progressive base are restless. They object to decisions l such as keeping embattled Chicago Transit Authority chief Dorval Carter as well as a campaign about-face on a publicly financed Chicago Bears stadium.

Jason McGrath a Chicago-based strategist who was a pollster for the last three mayors said Johnson should be concerned about these “calls coming from inside the house.”

“It’s a very very hard job and I think he’s finding now that it’s a lot easier to throw bombs from the sideline than it is to be in the ring and actually defuse them” McGrath said. “Right now there are too many people who are openly criticizing him who should be with them. And if that’s not a flashing red light yet it certainly will be soon.”

Aldermen have said they felt bigfooted over decisions from placing migrant shelters in their wards to the city’s impending cancellation of the ShotSpotter contract and his political capital in Springfield is on much shakier footing than a year ago.

If the mayor was concerned about the drumbeat of negativity however he did not betray that in an interview with the Tribune.

Instead Johnson accentuated his wins touting the recent bond plan eight times during the 30-minute sit-down. He also pointed to other progressive gains such as the city allocating $250 million for affordable housing and homelessness services and $100 million for violence prevention abolishing the tipped subminimum wage expanding mandatory paid time off and increasing the city’s youth jobs program by $76 million.

It’s all a part of righting historic wrongs Johnson said a process that will take time. While he didn’t specifically ask for patience after 12 months the mayor took pains to paint as well-established the structural oppression he says he was elected to fix.

“We’ve had 40 years of gross neglect and disinvestment within the city of Chicago right?” Johnson said when asked about his administration’s weakest spot. “And so part of my responsibility of course is to address the age-old systems of failure and to build a better stronger safer Chicago and that is something that I’m committed to doing.”

The migrant crisis



As a candidate Johnson invoked vivid imagery of unleashing rivers of investment to flow through Chicago’s left-behind communities writing off the premise of budgeting being a zero-sum game as a “false choice.”

“The table is big enough” Johnson said during a March mayoral debate. “Now listen whether you like salt or sugar on grits it’ll be on my table. And for our brown families whether you like red sauce or green sauce it’ll be on my table.”

The mayor’s messaging since assuming office has often signaled a grimmer reality — much of that outside his control.

More than 41000 asylum-seekers have made their way to Chicago since August 2022 when Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent the first of what would become hundreds of migrant buses in a bid to overwhelm the liberal city and erode its pro-immigration values.

It soon dawned on the fledgling administration that the city’s migrant shelter apparatus though rapidly growing could not keep pace. As the population of migrants sleeping outside Chicago police stations peaked at 3900 — with up to 850 others camped out at O’Hare — that fall pictures of the threadbare tent cities shocked the nation. The Johnson administration was ultimately able to move them inside the shelter system right before the harsh winter arrived.

On the City Council floor Black aldermen who feared their communities were once again being shortchanged in favor of newcomers expressed outrage during rancorous debates over each migrant spending item.

The growing resentment in the body helped drain the good feelings out of what should have been Johnson’s early honeymoon period when new mayors are often able to accomplish important agenda planks without expending much political effort.

“That was partially what the right-wing governors intended for it to do: To cause chaos to split diverse populations” Ameshia Cross a Democratic political strategist said. “It was maniacal but it was also something that has tended to work. … Pitting them against each other is not hard when you don’t have enough resources to go around.”

The cascading tensions laid bare how the mayor who vowed to bring prosperity and equity to those in need found himself dealt an extraordinarily bad hand. But how his team navigated the next several months nonetheless drew reproach from multiple corners of the city.

The gripes have spanned turf wars over where in the city the migrants should stay to discomfort from the left over implementing shelter evictions in the face of fiscal headwinds.

In his Tribune interview the mayor struck an unapologetic stance when pressed on how he responded.

Asked how he would have differently to the situation upon taking office knowing what he knows now Johnson said “I wish that Congress would actually do its part and pass substantive immigration reform.”

On whether his philosophy of Chicago having “enough” for everyone was wishful thinking Johnson responded that his $1.25 billion bond package — which schedules the city to pay off $2.4 billion in accumulated debt through 2061 — is “20 times the amount of dollars that we have made for the migrant mission.” (Chicago’s migrant response has cost $372 million according to the city.)

“You actually can do both-and” Johnson said. “I’m optimistic in this moment because everything that I said that we need to do as a city together we are doing that.”

To be sure other local officials agree that the federal government left Chicago high and dry by allowing mass waves of asylum-seekers into the country with no support for the cities that would absorb them. But as time went on an ongoing sense of disorganization and lack of coherent answers over the most pressing issue in City Hall began to erode goodwill.

One recent sign of progress is that the city’s shelter census has dropped from a peak of 15700 at the end of last year to 7800 last week. That comes as the tempo of buses from southern states remains subdued — and after 650 shelter residents so far have been evicted under a Johnson policy dictating they can stay for no more than 60 days unless they have children or meet other exemptions.

Johnson’s closest allies on the left have pressured him about that very decision.

After a November Johnson news conference announcing the 60-day policy (on the same week he passed his 2024 city budget thereby undermining the good news for him of that major City Council victory) progressive Ald. Daniel La Spata texted the mayor: “Hey sir This quote ‘sacrifice the needs of Chicagoans in support of those who wish to become Chicagoans’ I don’t agree with it.”

Johnson promptly responded that he was available to talk according to a Freedom of Information Act request of the mayor’s texts. The eviction policy was ultimately delayed until March.

The mayor’s botched plan last fall to erect a temporary winterized base camp for 2000 migrants atop former a industrial site in Brighton Park was one of his most embarrassing defeats as Gov. J.B. Pritzker yanked state funding for the entire proposal in late November amid concerns the city’s environmental remediation work was shoddy. It was one of several tense first-year moments between Johnson and Pritzker.

Brighton Park migrant camp

But asked whether he believed that episode damaged trust in his administration the mayor reiterated that the scope of what’s required to care for and resettle the asylum-seekers is far too great for one municipality alone.

Then he applauded his November ordinance to crack down on what he said were “rogue” transportation companies dumping migrants in Chicago.

“Do you know that not a bus has arrived in the city of Chicago since the end of December?” Johnson said. “Not one bus. Why? Because we put forth a structure that I promised that I would do: to create a real operation that’s centered around people’s humanity.”

While buses have technically stopped entering the city the Tribune has reported they are instead simply dropping off migrants outside city limits now sometimes in neighboring counties. From there the passengers often board the Metra to the landing zone set up by the administration near Union Station and await a bed in Chicago’s shelter system.

That’s an outcome Johnson acknowledged privately before he sought to coordinate drop-offs with suburban leaders. In a December text to CTU President Stacy Davis Gates obtained via a public records request the mayor shared a Fox News headline with his close ally that read: “Buses respond to Chicago’s new penalties and restrictions by dropping migrants in secret locations.”

“Secret” Davis Gates responded. “Wow.”

Progressive leadership



Johnson’s April runoff victory represented a seismic disruption to business as usual at City Hall as he became the first progressive to win the Chicago mayor’s seat in decades.

In practice there have been signs the new administration has struggled with transitioning into the executive role as evidenced by his top surrogates repeatedly wading into political storms and vacancies in government positions remaining unfilled. Other figures on the left have publicly broken with him more and more.

The stunning downfall of Johnson’s signature progressive plan the Bring Chicago Home referendum in the March primary election further hinted that the political winds from a year ago have shifted.

But Davis Gates the CTU president and his longtime friend said it would be unfair to expect Johnson to dismantle the old system of government this soon.

“This idea that in a year our government is going to transform from a neoliberal ‘close consolidate and cut’ system I think is an unreasonable expectation” Davis Gates said. “We are undergoing a seismic transformation in a very small amount of time. The fact that Brandon Johnson has been able to accomplish everything that he has in the past year is nothing short of miraculous.”

Meanwhile the Democratic Socialist aldermen Johnson tapped for powerful committee assignments upon taking office have stepped into various minefields that gave opponents openings to pounce on the narrative that the mayor’s inner circle is too extreme and lacks decorum. Though Johnson isn’t necessarily concerned with being attacked for his leftist roots the constant drama has forced him to stick his neck out for his allies in remarkable ways.

Besides the November tie-breaker vote Johnson cast to rescue his former floor leader and ex-Zoning Committee chair Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa 35th following bullying allegations the mayor found himself facing an effort last month to strip Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez 25th of his Housing Committee chairmanship.

That uproar hinged on Sigcho-Lopez’s choice to stand in front of a charred American flag at a rally outside City Hall to protest the DNC. The alderman said he didn’t see the flag.

“It’s been a little bit surprising to me because I know him to be an extraordinary organizer but everything seems so disorganized” Aviva Bowen a Democratic strategist in Chicago said about the mayor. “He also seems to have empowered — and even platformed — some of the rabble-rousing.”

Sigcho-Lopez told the Tribune he believes the censure attempt against him did not show weakness in progressive leaders but their commitment to justice: “I think he has not looked away the way other administrations have.”

Asked whether there was room for improvement in his administration’s ability to maintain relationships Johnson pointed to successes. “Look at what we’ve accomplished together working with City Hall” he said before again listing his $1.25 billion bond deal and legislative victories from last year.

Months of vacancies languishing on several government-appointed boards have also led to grumblings of city business being stymied and that his administration struggles to nail down the bread-and-butter basics of running City Hall. He did not reveal his pick for commissioner of the critical Department of Housing Lissette Castañeda until December for example while other key cabinet spots took until last month to be filled.

There have been material consequences to this hesitancy. A failure to fill a Zoning Board of Appeals vacancy that existed from the previous administration for example led to a tie vote in February that sank a proposed homeless shelter in Uptown supported by both the Johnson administration and local Ald. Angela Clay 46th.

Johnson responded to a question about whether he has regrets about the ZBA inaction by saying “Our appointments are working well. We have the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago” and listing the racial makeup of his appointees.

Other vacancies for which the mayor had been publicly urged to speed up his search process include the Chicago police oversight board and the the ethics board. The latter concerns were aired by Johnson’s handpicked Ethics Committee chair Ald. Matt Martin 47th another progressive ally.

Johnson further rankled some in his progressive base when he adamantly backed the Chicago Bears’ plan for a $5 billion stadium that would be half-funded by taxpayer dollars even though he vowed on the campaign trail not to support such a public subsidy.

And he has resisted growing calls to oust Carter the CTA chief. Asked by the Tribune whether he has at least looked at potential replacements for him Johnson said discussing those topics is “irresponsible.”

“Having questions about how we build a transportation system that ultimately meets the needs and demands of the people of Chicago those questions are welcome” Johnson said. “Determining who I get to fire and hire I find that to be irresponsible and I won’t discuss personnel matters publicly.”

The Carter problem could certainly become a progressive voter one as transit issues have particularly resonated among liberals along Milwaukee Avenue and the lakefront who carried Johnson to the runoff.

Fiscal approach



Rahm Emanuel measured his economic development accomplishments by cranes in the sky. Lori Lightfoot tallied dollars spent on the South and West sides.

Johnson meanwhile centers his economic wins around workers: new jobs or protections higher pay or delivery of affordable housing.

For a business community already wary of Johnson’s “tax-the-rich” electioneering his early council pushes to expand paid time off phase out the city’s tipped wage credit and ask voters to raise a tax on property sales through the Bring Chicago Home referendum proved their apprehension right.

They punched back this spring by bankrolling the anti-Bring Chicago Home push a marked example of Chicago business leaders acting in open opposition to the mayor.

Nonetheless Jack Lavin head of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce said there are many areas in which he agrees with the administration.

Lavin approves of Johnson initiatives to explore cutting red tape for developers forging ahead with the O’Hare’s revamp and converting LaSalle Street office space into housing with city subsidies. The same goes for the mayor’s $1.25 billion bond which will be funded by phasing out the city’s reliance on tax increment financing. The mayor’s police superintendent pick Larry Snelling also put business stakeholders as well as conservative critics at ease.

Johnson kept to his word he would not raise property taxes — a chief business concern — in his first budget despite staring down a yawning $538 million deficit rising migrant response costs and ever-present pension and debt obligations. Fiscal watchdogs however warned Johnson’s reliance on one-time measures to balance the books would be difficult to repeat as structural imbalances remain.

In addition to rising pension costs the CTA and Chicago Public Schools are both facing fiscal cliffs and might also need revenue boosts.

How the mayor will shore up all these looming shortfalls is unknown but as a candidate he floated reviving the corporate head tax upping the hotel levy implementing new charges on securities trades and creating a jet fuel tax. Johnson did not answer the Tribune’s question on which of those priorities remain most viable.

“The business community can absorb some but I think their view is ‘Are you targeting us or is there a more comprehensive plan?’” said Greg Goldner an Emanuel ally CEO of Resolute Consulting and Bring Chicago Home opponent.

While the next three years are certain to be uncertain this summer will bring one of Johnson’s biggest tests yet — the arrival of the DNC.

The mass Chicago police arrest of pro-Palestinian protesters at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago this month reflected one prognosis of what could come. Speaking with the Tribune about that incident Johnson showed that a year into his term on the fifth floor of City Hall he can still speak like a radical organizer.

“In some instances arrests are part of the objective. I’ll say it like that” the mayor said. “I’ve taken arrest before. It’s not unprecedented.”

Brian Snitker told MLB.com’s Mark Bowman Sunday that he expects reliever Pierce Johnson to be activated from the 15-day injured list on Friday. Johnson was placed on the injured list retroactively to May 1 due to inflammation in his elbow.

Snit said Pierce Johnson will likely be activated Friday — Mark Bowman (@mlbbowman) May 12 2024

The Braves will return home on Monday to face the Chicago Cubs in a three-game series. They have another off day Thursday before continuing their homestand with a four-game set against the San Diego Padres.

Getting Johnson back would be a huge boost to their bullpen. Johnson has been a key part ever since coming over in a trade with the Colorado Rockies last season. He re-signed on a two-year deal during the offseason. So far this season he has appeared in 13 games and has a 3.00 ERA and a 2.83 FIP to go along with a 32% strikeout rate in 12 innings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpZ2JsdWV2aWV3LmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTIvMjQxNTQ0NDYvY2FuLWdpYW50cy10aGVvLWpvaG5zb24tYmUtYmV0dGVyLXByby10aGFuLWNvbGxlZ2UtcGxheWVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Giants' Theo Johnson be better pro than college player?,"Theo Johnson’s production as a tight end at Penn State was modest with his 34 catches at Penn State in 2023 being his best season.

The Giants drafted the 6-foot-6 259-pound Johnson in Round 4 No. 107 overall. Can Johnson develop into a more productive NFL player than he was as a college player?

“It’s really exciting for me because I think I have a super high ceiling. I think I haven’t even scratched the surface of what I’m capable of. I’m really looking forward to proving every day that I’m out here” Johnson said Saturday after the second of two rookie mini-camp practices.

“I think I have tremendous room to improve. I think I can grow a lot more than where I’m at right now. I think that’s why I’m so excited. I’m coming in here with a learning mindset. I want to develop respect from my teammates and my coaches. I think that’s going to help me continue to grow and improve. But I’m super excited to get to work and get going here because I think I have a potential to be a really special player here.”

The Giants certainly hope so. They traded for veteran Darren Waller a year ago hoping he could be a difference-making tight end. After one mediocre season in which leg injuries limited his availability Waller might retire.

That likely is part of the reason the Giants drafted Johnson.

“I think the big thing for me is consistency. Being consistent” Johnson said. “I’ll flash a lot of really good things on tape but it’s putting all that stuff together every single snap that’s going to help me reach my potential.

“Consistency comes from repetition doing it a lot and then being very detail oriented. Being very honest with yourself when you’re watching film and then having a coach that’s going to hold you to that standard every single day and not let the little stuff slide. I think that’s a big part of having consistent technique.”

Johnson understands that tight end is not a simple position to play.

“Tight end is a lot even at the college level. You’re just asked to do so much and that’s why I think it’s a great position” Johnson said. “Everything you’re asked to do it’s very unique. It’s not just a one-tool guy. The best tight ends are able to do everything. I think that’s really cool for a guy like me that I feel like I have the potential to do all the things that you can ask a tight end to do and be a guy that you can’t take off the field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmoubWlsZXNwbGl0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8zNDc5MTUvam9yZGFpbmUtam9obnNvbi1ibG93cy11cC10cmFjay13aXRoLXNpenpsaW5nLXNwcmludC10cmlwbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jordaine Johnson Blows Up Track With Historic Sprint Triple,"



Look out for Jordaine Johnson!!!

Johnson who missed the entire outdoor season last spring with a broken toe left lots of smoke at Schools Stadium on Saturday when he produced one of the greatest and electrifying sprint triples in state history at the Super Essex Conference Championships in Newark.

Johnson a junior at East Orange Campus started off his day by running a meet record 10.53 in the trials of the American Division 100-meter dash No. 5 in the state this season. He followed that up by winning the 100 dash final in 10.70.

Johnson returned to the track 15 minutes later to finish first in the 400 in 47.91 No. 2 in the state this season. Later in the day Johnson completed the sprint trifecta with his best performance of them all when he blazed his way to a meet and Essex County record 21.04 which is No. 8 in NJ history for all conditions (there was no wind gauge).

How rare and remarkable is Johnson's triple!!!?

I can only find three other sprinters in state history who ran under 10.55 under 21.10 and under 48.00 in their high school careers!!!

Olympic gold medalist Dennis Mitchell a 1984 graduate of Edgewood ran 10.47 21.06 and 46.02. The late Mario Heslop of Franklin (Class of 2019) went 10.33 20.74 and 46.73 and Shamali Whittle of Hamilton North (Class of 2022) had high school PR's of 10.48 20.55 and 47.82.

That's some fast company that Johnson joined!!

And Johnson might be the first to ever go under 10.55 under 21.10 and sub 48 on the same day!! Heslop and Whittle accomplished their times on different days. Still checking on Mitchell.

Here's some more info on Johnson's 21.04 in the 200.

Johnson's 21.04 broke the Essex County automatic time record for all conditions of 21.22 that Maxwell Booker of Essex Catholic ran when he finished second to Danny Johnson of Rahway (21.03) at the 2000 Meet of Champions at Frank Jost Field in South Plainfield. The times by Booker and Johnson were wind-aided as they were run with a tailwind of 2.3 meters per second.

In case you're wondering the state record in the 200 for all-conditions is a wind-aided 20.51 (2.8 meters per second) by Antonio Tarantino of Paul VI in the trials of the 2018 New Balance Nationals Championships at North Carolina A&T in Greensboro N.C. The wind-legal state record is 20.75 that Shamali Whittle ran in the trials of the 200 at the 2021 Outdoor National Championships at Hayward Field in Oregon.

JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI3L2phbWllLWRpbW9ucy1xdWljay1rb3d0b3ctYWZ0ZXItdGVsbGluZy10cnV0aC1vbi1jb21tdW5pc3QtY2hpbmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jamie Dimon's quick kowtow after telling truth on communist China,"The state of corporate America is a sad one: Its best and brightest are so desperate to make a buck that they need to beg forgiveness when simply stating the obvious.

Last week at Boston College JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie ­Dimon was riffing on US-China relations and said something every right-thinking person in the world should pray for: That a great American company will outlast the brutal Communist Chinese ­regime.

But CEO survival these days — even if it’s the head of the nation’s largest bank — is a bizarre spectacle. In national politics corporate chieftains dance to the tune of progressive elites fearing backlash from the media and their Twitter hordes.

Recall that Dimon himself took a knee in support of Black Lives Matter during last year’s summer of love to score some lefty kudos despite the movement’s Marxist underpinnings. If BLM had its way JPM would be shuttered and Dimon summoned for a Soviet-style show trial after being charged for crimes against humanity (a k a being a capitalist).

Maybe even worse these CEOs spend a lot of time overseas dancing to the tune of dictators in ­places like Saudi Arabia and Russia. Mostly however it’s in China as they look to tap into the country’s state-run market economy which promises enormous profits given the country’s massive population and rising standard of ­living.

And that means Jamie Dimon has to eat crow when he says the truth even about a country that represses religious minorities murders dissidents and has been credibly accused of unleashing COVID on the world and trying to cover it up.

To understand the absurdity of Dimon’s apologia to the communist Chinese let’s go back to exactly what Dimon said last week that prompted not just one bended-knee about-face but two.

“I was just in Hong Kong and I made a joke that the Com­mu­nist Party is cel­e­brat­ing its hun­dredth year. So is JP­Mor­gan. I’d make you a bet we last longer” he quipped adding: “I can’t say that in China. They prob­a­bly are lis­ten­ing any­way.”

Vintage Dimon. Left to his own devices he’s brutally and refreshingly honest. Who can forget that when most of the liberal corporate elite kept their distance from President Trump Dimon vowed to work with him. Later Dimon didn’t think twice about offending the leader of the free world when Jamie claimed he could easily beat Don in an election because Dimon’s “smarter.”

Gotta love it and also got to love what Dimon said about China and his dig at its massive and abusive surveillance state. At last week’s Boston College event Dimon said he “detest(s)” Trump’s legendary callous personality. Then he rightly gave kudos to Trump for his anti-China policies “be­cause it was time to do some­thing about” the country’s abusive trade practices and outright theft of American intellectual property as the price of doing business there.

Within a few hours came the apologies (“I regret I should not have made that comment . . . it’s never right to joke about or denigrate any group of people whether it’s a country its leadership or any part of a society and culture”) after word of the event started making its way around media circles and someone inside JPM reminded the boss that the bank does a lot business in China. For all the bad stuff that goes down on the mainland JPM is looking to do more with the ­tyrants not less. That’s why he just traveled to Hong Kong in the first place.

So before the Chinese could cancel JPM’s asset-management application and jail some of its employees who work there the mea culpa maximas hit the tape. I am told the company issued two apologies because the company thinks it knows enough about Chinese culture that overt shows of respect and contrition work with its commissars.

And it did. The Chinese later insisted all the bad things (the truth) that Dimon said about them were much ado about nothing and they’re still looking forward to working with the bank.

I asked a senior JPM executive why Dimon decided to apologize. After all Jamie was just being ­Jamie. The exec’s response: “Ha!

He doesn’t feel it’s right to joke about an entire country and its leaders.”

But in reality what he said wasn’t a joke. Given the choice between JPMorgan or the communist government of China lasting another 100 years we should all hope for the former.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvYXNpYS9pbmRpYXMtcGF5dG0tc2VwdGVtYmVyLXF1YXJ0ZXItbmV0LWxvc3Mtd2lkZW5zLTIwMjEtMTEtMjcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's Paytm Sept net loss widens says maintains growth momentum,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/indias-paytm-september-quarter-net-loss-widens-2021-11-27/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvYXNpYS9pbmRpYXMtcGF5dG0tc2VwdGVtYmVyLXF1YXJ0ZXItbmV0LWxvc3Mtd2lkZW5zLTIwMjEtMTEtMjcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9MzE5NjA10gE_aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3IvcGFnZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS5hbXAuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9MzE5NjA1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JP Morgan CEO's China apology raises questions over Shinsegae heir's 'hardball' stance,"

By Yi Whan-woo



JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon's apology last week over his offhand remark concerning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is raising questions over whether it is appropriate from a business perspective for Shinsegae Group Vice Chairman Chung Yong-jin to refuse to take back anti-communist sentiment he expressed recently.



JP Morgan and Shinsegae Group are among numerous foreign companies operating in China whose government and people have been sensitive about anything that might be construed as questioning or offending its legitimacy.



Such extreme nationalism has been best represented through consumer boycotts of multinational enterprises that whether intentional or not were judged to have offended China.



Under the circumstances the measures taken by Chung who is the first in line to succeed management control over the conglomerate are the opposite of what Dimon did after sensing that his casual remark about the CCP could jeopardize JP Morgan's China business and apologizing shortly afterward.



Dimon issued two separate apologies to China after jokingly telling a group of American business leaders that JPMorgan Chase would outlast the CCP.



The controversial comment was made during his speech in Boston Nov. 23 when Dimon said JP Morgan marks 100 years of operating in China while the CCP was also founded in 1921.



""I'll make a bet that we last longer"" he joked which attracted global attention and was addressed to the Chinese foreign ministry.



In his apologies he clarified that the comment was intended to stress the longevity of JPMorgan's China business rather than criticize the party.



The U.S. firm through its spokesperson also explained Dimon acknowledges that he should never speak lightly or disrespectfully about another country or its leadership.



The foreign ministry downplayed the issue two days after Dimon's Nov. 25 remark saying ""We hope relevant media will stop hyping up this issue.""



Chung brought up the subject of communism Nov. 15 when he posted a photo of himself posing with two staffers at a pizza restaurant.



The logo printed on the pizza box as well as the outfits of the two staffers were red and accordingly Chung wrote ""For some reason the photo looks as if it is related to the communist party.""



He went on to write ""Don't misunderstand. I hate communism.""



Chung who is 53 pointed to the Cold War that raged on during his childhood and explained that he was educated to be anti-communist.



On Nov. 24 he once again wrote ""I hate communism"" in relation to North Korea's public execution of people who watched the South Korean dystopian drama ""Squid Game"" which became the world's most-watched Netflix show.



Jung Yeon-sung a business administration professor at Dankook University viewed the Shinsegae Group scion should be ""prudent with his words.""



""Everyone has freedom of speech but in the case of Chung he is in a position of responsibility and it would be better to refrain from making comments that can be misunderstood or misinterpreted"" the professor said.

This was the most high-profile instance of the hand signal’s successful use and has prompted hopeful commentary that the sharing of secret signals on social media could serve as a vital tool against domestic violence.

And so on Thursday the UN’s annual 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence kicked off with renewed hope. This year the international campaign has a fresh focus on hand signals and how they can be used by women and girls in distress to seek – and gain – crucial help.

The Canadian Women’s Foundation a non-profit that created the gesture used in the case in Kentucky in the US – hand up palm out with the thumb tucked in and then fingers folded down – in April 2020 believes that signalling is important. To coincide with 16 Days it has now compiled a guide for people who see the gesture.

Andrea Gunraj the group’s vice-president of public engagement told openDemocracy that the new “signal responder’s guide would ensure that people are well-equipped to respond and figure out what a person needs when they make that gesture”. The responses can vary said Gunraj. “Sometimes the person making the gesture just wants to tell someone what is happening; sometimes they may want help finding services such as a shelter.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers lined up 2.5 miles of streets on Thursday morning to enjoy the pleasure and amusement brought by the annual Thanksgiving parade.Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade this year made a full return following a much shorter and mostly virtual one last year at the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic.New Yorkers are facing a kind of new normal in their life amid continuous pandemic inflation pressures and safety measures.The parade featured 15 giant character balloons 28 floats 36 novelty and heritage inflatables more than 800 clowns ten marching bands and nine performance groups a host of musical stars and the one-and-only Santa Claus according to an earlier release by Macy's.Six new floats made their debut including Birds of a Feather Stream Together by the streaming service Peacock Celebration Gator by Louisiana Office of Tourism Gravy Pirates by the Kraft Heinz Company Magic Meets the Sea by Disney Cruise Line.The event was subject to tight security measures with a number of late spectators being kept one block away from the route of the parade.Days ago a vehicle plowed through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee of Wisconsin killing six people and injuring over 60.U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday called Al Roker one of the hosts of the Macy's Thanksgiving parade saying ""My message is after two years you're back America's back.""Measures were still in place to contain risks from infections of the coronavirus as the 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases has been hovering around 90000 in the United States.Parade staffers and volunteers were required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and wear masks while some singers and performers could take their masks off.Macy's and the New York City also encouraged spectators to cover their faces though there was no mandate for inoculation.The Thanksgiving holiday also came at a time when Americans have been facing sticky inflation pressures.Macy's a household retail brand is offering discounts to woo shoppers via both online and offline channels.Macy's could sometime pass higher costs of fashion apparels to customers and raise sales prices while it faces a ""price ceiling"" for commodity items such as basic T-shirts or denim jeans according to Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette.Macy's has been running tests in the last three months to see which kinds of goods are sensitive to price changes and which ones could fetch higher prices without hurting sales much.U.S. low-end retail brand Dollar Tree Inc. on Tuesday announced that it would raise benchmark unit price to 1.25 U.S. dollars from 1 U.S. dollar at its stores all across the country following earlier pricing tests.""Now that's 125 cents.

A Mac 'N Cheese Lawsuit

One of the biggest grocery stories of the year involves a food many of us consider a favorite. Back on April 5 two plaintiffs brought a class-action lawsuit against the Kraft Heinz Company for not warning consumers of a chemical found in mac and cheese products. The two claimed the company knew about the presence of phthalates—which are synthetic chemicals used to make plastics more flexible—but did nothing about it. According to a 2015 study phthalates are linked to an increased risk of asthma and obesity.

In July the Kraft Heinz Company asked a federal judge in Illinois to throw out the case because phthalates are approved by the FDA.

Drone Delivery Services Ramping Up

If contactless shopping isn't enough for you then the technology 2021 brought should be music to your ears. Several grocery chains teased the possibility of drone delivery this year including Kroger Walmart and Greer's Market.

The retailers are currently testing this possibility but don't expect to get a full grocery run by drone quite yet. Kroger's weight limit for drone delivery is only five pounds. However it sounds like the perfect solution for when you run out of an ingredient mid-recipe. Let's just hope it doesn't drop the eggs!

Amazon's Just Walk Out Technology at Whole Foods

The days of waiting in line at the checkout are over. In September Whole Foods announced a partnership with Amazon to bring the Just Walk Out payment option to two locations (one in Washington D.C. and one in California).6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Customers just scan a QR code in the Whole Foods section of the Amazon app then shop normally. The store's sensors track everything they put in their cart (and even items they return). When finished customers scan the same code when leaving and get a digital receipt. Introverts everywhere are celebrating!

Starbucks partnership with Amazon Go

On November 18 Starbucks and Amazon Go opened the first of several planned location partnerships in New York City. The store combines Amazon's Just Walk Out technology and Starbucks' contactless payment options.

Customers can order ahead on the Starbucks app and pick up their drinks inside. To buy food they log into the Amazon app and the store's sensors track whatever customers take from the shelves (no need to wait in line to check out). The sensors can even tell if you put something back on the shelf according to a Starbucks press release. When the customer leaves Amazon charges their credit card. The combination cafe/grocery store even has tables to work or eat lunch at.

The Return of Nostalgic Food

Out with the old in with the…old? A few of our favorite nostalgic foods made comebacks this year. Some of these haven't been seen in over 10 years! Oreo Cakesters Creme Savers Lime Skittles and Jones Soda's Turkey and Gravy soda all came back to store shelves this year to the glee of fans everywhere. We can't wait to see which nostalgic foods surprise us with a comeback next year (Squeezits anyone?).

A Single-Use Water Bottle Ban

New Seasons Market a west coast grocer announced a plan to phase out sales of single-use plastic water bottles in early April Supermarket News reported. ""By committing to using reusable bottles we can remove almost 200000 single-use plastic aluminum and glass bottles a year"" said Athena Petty senior sustainability manager at New Seasons Market.

New Seasons and its sister store New Leaf Community Market will continue to sell water in plastic bottles bigger than one liter but the company believes this effort will help customers transition to using reusable bottles.

Supermarket Employee Day

In 2021 the Food Industry Association recognized grocery store workers by declaring Feb. 22 as Supermarket Employee Day. FMI says the day is ""a time for the food industry to recognize employees at every level for the work they do feeding families and enriching lives.""

It's never been more apparent how essential supermarket employees are to our communities. There are more than 40000 grocery stores in the US which means we have a lot of people to thank for keeping the shelves stocked and our families fed!

There's no doubt about it the price of shopping is rising.

Essentials like bread butter and teabags are all on the rise at a time when utility bills are increasing too.

So can you save money by shopping around?

We bought the same five products from six different supermarkets to see what the difference is in price.

Read more: The same 7 toiletries from 5 different stores here's where's cheapest

And we found there was almost a 20% price hike from the cheapest to the most expensive.

We bought each store's own brand of butter a Warburtons Toastie loaf a four-pack of Heinz baked beans six large eggs and a 240-pack of Tetley teabags from each supermarket - Morrisons Sainsbury's Tesco Asda Aldi and Lidl.

Budget retailers Lidl and Aldi were joint cheapest at £9.55 for the shopping basket.

Tesco was the next closest at £9.82 followed by Sainsbury's at £10.08 and Asda at £10.25.

The most expensive was Morrisons at £11.43 - 19.6% more than Aldi and Lidl.

Some products were exactly the same in price no matter where we shopped the Warbies loaf for instance at £1.10 across the board and butter £1.48 everywhere and just a penny more at Morrisons.

There's been a noticeable increase in beans recently and we reported last month how the boss of Kraft Heinz warned that consumers will have to get used to higher food prices with his company - the world’s fifth-largest food and drink firm – 'raising prices where necessary around the world'.

It wasn't that long ago when you could pick up a four-pack of Heinz beans for £2.

(Image: Manchester Family / MEN)

Now the cheapest seems to be £2.49 - almost a 25% increase.

That's the price in Lidl and Aldi although Aldi didn't even have them in stock when we visited two separate stores so we factored in the cost anyway.

Tesco and Asda are similar at £2.50 for four whereas Sainsbury's price was £3 and Morrisons' even more at £3.50.

Rather bizarrely they did have a six-pack on sale for the same price though so most people would surely opt for that.

(Image: Manchester Family / MEN)

Eggs varied from 99p for six up to £1.25 in Tesco and £1.50 in Sainsbury's but the latter's were extra large rather than large.

It was the teabags that seemed to vary the most though - the cheapest being £3 at Sainsbury's but that was only because of a current offer reducing them from the usual £4.

Aldi Lidl and Tesco all had them on sale for £3.49 while Asda was higher at £4.08 and Morrisons the most expensive at £4.25 - and that was reduced from the usual £5 price shelf.

A spokesperson for Morrisons said: ""This is a basket of five items and not representative of our prices across our shop. Aside from the branded bread tea and beans products we have cheaper own brand eggs and butter which could have been selected.""

But those looking to rekindle memories of the Battle Creek-based restaurant chain that had as many as 69 locations in the Midwest and Florida can still bring home a literal slice of the brand from one of its popular recipes.

The restaurant company filed for bankruptcy and closed its last remaining locations in 2002. Three years later Marty Carrier acquired the rights to the Bill Knapp's name and recipes putting the popular cakes in refrigerator isles at Meijer Kroger and Family Fare grocery chains and back on the plates of the former restaurant's loyal customers.

""It was a huge hit right off the bat"" Carrier said of the wholesale cakes. ""I learned that people valued the Bill Knapp's name because Bill Knapp's made fantastic food in their restaurants. The restaurants were used as family gatherings all over the Midwest so there was a very positive feeling towards Bill Knapp's.""

Bill Knapp's LLC is headquartered in Saline and its cakes donuts iced bread and coffee are sold around the globe through its online store billknapps.com.

In Battle Creek what remains of the once-prosperous restaurant chain is the former commissary now a storage facility on Knapp Drive and memories of a business that is part of the city's DNA.

Who was Bill Knapp?

Clinton ""Bill"" Knapp a traveling salesman from New York City moved to Battle Creek in 1936. He had spent nearly a decade in the ""Cereal City"" working for Standard Brands Inc. and as a representative for Peter Pan Bakeries when he and a group of investors decided to try their hand at the restaurant business.

Knapp and Dr. Cliff Brainard Dr. Richard Stiefel Wellington Burt and Keith Schroder formed Columbia Center Inc. The group with Schroder as its president and Knapp as vice president and manager opened their first restaurant in a colonial-style building in Battle Creek's Lakeview neighborhood on June 22 1948.

The restaurant at 826 Capital Ave. S.W. had an open view of the kitchen and capacity for 70 patrons although the parking lot was large enough to accommodate 100 vehicles. The menu specialized in steaks chicken (with biscuits and waffles) and ham sandwiches.

""I always carried this dream of having a fine restaurant"" Knapp said in a 1973 Enquirer interview. ""I always thought it would be great to be able to serve people good wholesome meals. But all of this doesn't just happen. I couldn't swing it myself. But fortunately I had a good friend in Keith M. Schroder who helped me get the show on the road.""

The first-year sales at the location topped $125000 — or $1.3 million in 2021 dollars when adjusted for inflation.

In 1950 the company built its second location at 34 W. Jackson St. in downtown Battle Creek and became a chain when it opened its Lansing location in 1955.

Over the ensuing decades many more Bill Knapp's openings would follow eclipsing $1 million in sales by 1971 and stretching beyond the Midwest into Florida by 1986. The menu also expanded to include favorites such as au gratin potatoes chicken fricassee and bean soup.

Knapp retired as president in 1967. He died at his home in Battle Creek in 1974 at age 67 as he and his wife were preparing to leave for their winter home in Texas.

Food family memories

Given the restaurants didn't sell alcohol until it neared bankruptcy Bill Knapp's was known as a family-friendly destination with food ""made from scratch"" at its three commissaries in Battle Creek Vandalia Ohio and Sanford Fla.

Bill Knapp's restaurants became a common birthday destination thanks to the popularity of its chocolate cakes and a clever marketing promotion where the customer's bill was discounted the same percentage as their age. The cakes would be presented with music played through the restaurant's sound system for all of the restaurant customers to hear with Bing Crosby crooning ""Happy Birthday"" or ""The Anniversary Song.""

On the rare occasion that a customer celebrated turning 101 years or older the company issued checks paying the extra discount to them after their complimentary birthday meal.

There is no shortage of documented of memories from Bill Knapp's on social media as a number of Facebook groups have sprung paying homage to the chain.

Eliot Rachman an East Lansing native who now lives in Carlsbad California created the ""I Remember Bill Knapp's"" Facebook page in 2009 as a way to collect and share photos recipes and memories of the eatery.

""My favorite photo to see is some kid from the 70s having his eighth birthday because that was me I did the same thing"" Rachman said. ""Just a good happy place. Food was always good and kids were always welcomed there. You had to be there with the Bing Crosby scratchy recording cinnamon ice cream waitresses in yellow dresses...

""People just really loved that place and have really good memories and everybody wishes it would come back.""

Bill Knapp's 2?

In 1998 the privately-owned company was sold and the franchise underwent some dramatic changes abandoning the commissary model while attempting to broaden demographics by adding beer and wine to the menu. There were updates to the interior and exterior décor under the marketing slogan ""That was then this is WOW.""

The moves away from the original business model along with changing consumer tastes and increased competition from national chains such as Bob Evans and Cracker Barrel likely led to the downfall of the restaurant. The last 29 locations closed by 2002.

Carrier said Bill Knapp's LLC owns the rights to all of the restaurant's recipes in addition to the name and could conceivably open a Bill Knapp's restaurant — although it's more of a ""never say never"" attitude rather than a goal of the company.

""I've had discussions one very serious round of discussions a couple years ago with people interested in tapping into that tradition and making use of those recipes; I would entertain it"" Carrier said. ""It would have to be an experienced restaurant person. Can't be somebody trying to start up... It would be a Bill Knapp's 2.""

In the meantime Bill Knapp's is expected to reopen its retail location in Saline to the public in the coming months after being closed due to the pandemic. And via online ordering or a local grocery chain customers can still have the famed Bill Knapp's chocolate cake and eat it too.

""The chocolate cake is the absolute original Bill Knapp's chocolate cake recipe"" Carrier said. ""Hopefully it captures some nostalgic time in the past of a family gathering.""

I’ve heard that sentiment on several occasions — from hunters. But if you look state-by-state you can see how a thousand tiny cuts add up to reduced hunting opportunities. The recent debacle over the 2022 spring bear hunting season in the state of Washington is a prime example.

In the 1990s the Humane Society of The United States (HSUS) worked tirelessly to ban bear baiting and hound hunting in Washington. They won. Now they’re looking at the state’s spring bear season. They’ve managed to get the 2022 season canceled and might be close to getting it shut down for good.

State biologists proposed relatively benign spring bear-hunting rule changes earlier this year. They requested lowering the quota in certain areas and a change in season length.

“Per the proposed rule for the 2022 spring season [the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife] would have provided roughly 664 spring bear permits with agency staff estimating hunters would have killed 145 black bears” reported the Spokesman-Review.

When public comments on the rule change opened up HSUS called on its members to show up and speak out. The state wildlife commission was flooded with inane criticisms of the bear season including the notion that the season is “immoral as bears tend to be lethargic and underfed when they emerge from their winter dens.”

Last Friday those against the state’s bear hunting season earned a preliminary victory. The commission held a daytime Zoom meeting — slap bang in the middle of the state’s second deer hunting season of the year. Commissioners questioned the very science their state biologists produced. When a vote was called the commission was split 4-4 on the regulation changes effectively canceling the 2022 spring bear hunt.

How did this happen and so fast?

Since the spring bear hunt is a special permit hunt any proposed change requires a majority vote to be put into effect. By the agency’s bylaws a tied vote didn’t mean reverting to the old regs but that the special permit season is completely canceled — a drastic step that surprised many.

The four commissioners who voted against the regulation changes included the chairman and vice chairwoman and the two newest most controversial commissioners: Fred Koontz and Lorna Smith both of whom were appointed by Gov. Jay Inslee. Neither are hunters.

Smith called the bear population models old-fashioned even though the state’s Carnivore Section Manager said it was the best available science they had to determine quotas. The director of the agency Kelly Susewind said the science is clear and that the hunt does not impair or cause concern for Washington’s black bear population.

That best science shows the 2022 season would result in 145 bears killed from a population of 25000-30000. That’s a 0.58% harvest.

Why would four commissioners go against the science that states like Washington regularly employ to manage wildlife resources?

Politics.

What’s worse is that the hung vote was possible because the anti-hunting governor has refused to fill a year-long vacant commission seat from eastern Washington — a rural part of the state that historically seats a commissioner who understands and supports science and hunting.

The clear focus was on environmental issues such as pollution and smog but also on everyday city and rural life industries like coal mining and logging and the racial diversity of America.

Tom Hubbard who worked as an Enquirer photographer from 1966 to 1978 was assigned to document “a pleasant urban environment” and chose Cincinnati’s Fountain Square in the spring and summer of 1973 when the Contemporary Arts Center’s D’aug Days festival brought in extra color to the atmosphere.

Hubbard photographed a boy sitting in the fountain. Dancers and sculptures and people’s reactions. Crowds on the square at lunchtime and aerial views of the cityscape. All in warm earthy but muted colors. That was an era when news photography was still done in black and white so color images of Cincinnati at that time are less common.

“It may all look simple but I am hoping that in 25 years it will be a valuable document of the times” Hubbard told The Enquirer in 1975.

Documerica ended for a lack of funding in 1977.

The U.S. National Archives has released 15000 of the Documerica photos online. A Flickr gallery contains 192 of Hubbard’s photos.

“The project takes rightful credit for the United States’ first serious examination of its rapidly decaying natural environment” C. Jerry Simmons wrote in the 2009 article “Documerica: Snapshots of Crisis and Cure in the 1970s.”

In 2012 Associated Press photographers revisited many of the locations that had been documented. An illegal landfill in New Jersey had become a field of greenery. The haze of smoke that made industrial smokestacks in Cleveland into silhouettes had been cleared away to reveal an actual city where people lived.

The view of America before the EPA and then 40 years later is striking."

On Friday November 5 tragedy struck the Astroworld music festival in NRG Park in Houston. The festival brought tens of thousands of people together to hear famous musical artists such as Earth Wind & Fire and 21 Savage amongst others. On Friday night the first of the two-night event headliner Travis Scott took to the stage.

As his performance began the riled-up crowd surged forward to get closer. With too many people in too small of a space many were trampled and some began to suffocate and yet the show proceeded uninterrupted. Emergency services were contacted to help those who were injured and even dying all as the concert continued.

By the time Scott had finished his performance eight people had died and hundreds had been injured; at the time of writing two more have since died in hospital due to their injuries. The crowd consisted of mainly younger people with the victims ranging between 9-27 in age. There has been outrage in response to the tragedy and rightly so as both Travis Scott and Live Nation Entertainment the festival’s promoter and organizer utterly failed to prevent the tragedy from unfolding. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against those in charge of the festival for inadequate safety measures.

At the center of this tragedy are questions concerning the role Scott played in the chaos. The rapper has a reputation for riling up the crowds at his concerts. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in 2017 after encouraging fans to push past security to the stage causing one fan to be thrown off a balcony and subsequently paralyzed. He also pleaded guilty to reckless conduct charges in 2015 after telling a riotous crowd to give the middle finger and chant “we want rage” to intervening security guards and police.

Though his exact role in the chaos at Astroworld is still in question Travis Scott has a history of riling up the crowds at his concerts.

In this particular case it is still uncertain what Scott could see from the stage making it unclear whether he was fully aware of the severity of the situation. There are varying eyewitness accounts of that night along with video clips floating around the internet. One shows that Scott stopped the show for a moment when he noticed an ambulance in the crowd looking to see if everything was okay. Another shows Scott telling his fans to “put a middle finger to the sky” if they’re okay and the crowd following suit. Accounts say that soon after that Scott encouraged fans to make the “ground shake.”

Scott has sent his condolences to the victims of this tragedy through a tweet sent out right after the event as well as a subsequent Instagram video explaining how devastated he was by what happened. He proclaimed his full support for the Houston Police and the community.

Scott’s Twitter account however seems to be doing more harm than good for his case as fans quickly realized that he deleted a tweet from earlier this year in response to the Astroworld festival selling out that said “NAW AND WE STILL SNEAKING THE WILD ONES IN.” He has a longer yet similar post on his Instagram talking about how he was working on a way to let more people into the festival. Posts like these are being used in various lawsuits against him to claim he incited the crowd rush that led to this tragedy.

While Scott is at the center of this tragedy he is not the only one potentially facing consequences for what happened. Live Nation Entertainment has come under fire for having scarce guidelines on handling crowd surging. A recently released 56-page operations manual for the festival details response plans for all manner of events such as an active shooting bomb threat and severe weather. It does not however outline any distinct plans for crowd surging.

Another aspect of the manual that has come under criticism is its instructions for Astroworld staff to refer to dead concert-goers as “smurfs.” Many commentators including families of the victims have found this terminology to be extremely disrespectful. Yet one of the most shocking revelations from afterwards is one security guard who alleges that he was hired over text. He claims that he did not have to give ID nor any qualifications for the position but was merely handed a security vest on site. All of these facts indicate that there were not enough resources or care put into ensuring the safety of the guests.

During Scott’s performance the crowds at the Astroworld festival were packed in far beyond capacity a major factor in the subsequent tragedy.

There was also a major disconnect in communication as the Houston Fire Department had no way to directly contact ParaDocs Worldwide the private group hired to provide medical treatment to fans at the festival. This disconnect simply added to the chaos as authorities operating outside of the festival had little-to-no information about what was happening on the inside.

What happened that night is nothing short of heartbreaking. Not only is this one of the deadliest concert-related tragedies to occur in American history but listening to the accounts of what happened presents a sobering look at the consequences bureaucratic apathy and human incompetence. There is still no official decision on who should be held responsible as lawsuits and investigations are still underway.

It seems though as if those in charge of managing and running the festival are trying to minimize their liability. Refunds have been offered for those who attended but it appears that concertgoers waive their rights to sue if they accept them. Furthermore rumors from some hospital workers in the area claim that there were more than ten deaths from this incident along with many who are still in comas due to their injuries.

Travis Scott has continued to be apologetic though these sentiments have not been met with acceptance; his apology video for example has been mocked by many and even turned into a meme by others. Nike meanwhile has paused the release of its sneaker collaboration with Scott out of respect for the victims with some speculating that the continuation of the collaboration will depend on the outcome of these lawsuits.

We pray for the victims of this disaster and for their families. We pray that the authorities will find out the truth about what happened and who was responsible so that there can be justice and so that tragedies like this can be prevented from ever happening again.

The Kylie Cosmetics founder shared with her 284 million followers a short clip to her Instagram Story of a handmade wooden pyramid spinning on her countertop. A reindeer figurine and an illuminated Christmas tree could be seen in the background.

Jenner did not appear in the short video nor did she add any text to the post but it serves as one of few things she's shared online since boyfriend Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival where 10 died and hundreds more were injured.

According to Daily Mail Jenner's holiday-inspired pyramid comes from the German company Muller and costs around $1000.

ILLINOIS FAMILIES FILE LAWSUIT AGAINST TRAVIS SCOTT LIVE NATION

Jenner released a statement on the social media platform just hours after Scott's Nov. 5 concert ended in tragedy.

""Travis and I are broken and devastated. My thoughts and prayers are with all who lost their lives were injured or affected in anyway by yesterday’s events"" Jenner wrote in her statement. ""And also for Travis who I know cares deeply for his fans and the Houston community.""

She added: ""I want to make it clear we weren’t aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing. I am sending my deepest condolences to all the families during this difficult time and will be praying for the healing of everyone who has been impacted.""

Jenner 24 is currently expecting her second child with Scott. They already share daughter Stormi 3.

Meanwhile lawsuits continue to pile up against Scott Live Nation and more performers and organizers of the event. This week the families of two close friends from Illinois who died at the concert filed a wrongful death lawsuits . The lawsuits filed by the families of Jacob ""Jake"" Jurinek 20 and Franco Patino 21 state that Scott and Live Nation failed to protect the individuals at the concert.

""Defendants egregiously failed in their duty to protect the health safety and lives of those in attendance at the concert including but not limited to the failure to provide adequate security personnel to implement crowd control measures proper barricades and the failure to provide a sufficient amount of emergency medical support"" the suits contend.

Scott was performing on stage during the surge and has since faced criticism for allowing the show to continue while people were struggling in the crowd.

The rapper claims he didn't know the severity of the situation.

---

The unmistakable roar of four jet engines broke the dead-of-night silence at Kennedy Space Center earlier this month marking the arrival of a massive Air Force transport at the landing facility once used for space shuttles.

But this red-eye flight from Buckley Space Force Base near Denver Colorado had more than just a few dozen passengers onboard. Deep in the belly of the C-5M Super Galaxy was a full-blown semitruck ready to roll out with a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather satellite in an attached container.

The 247-foot-long aircraft with a nearly identical wingspan is actually longer than the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket that will launch the satellite — named GOES-T — no earlier than March 1 2022. Set to a powerful configuration with four add-on solid rocket boosters Atlas V will reach about 191 feet in height at nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

The sheer size of the California-based C-5 meant Lockheed Martin builder of the satellite could simply roll the satellite out of its factory near Denver transport it to Buckley SFB and back up the semitruck into the aircraft before doing the opposite after landing. As with most things space-related however it's not as simple as it sounds.

About two hours after the 4:15 a.m. touchdown at the Launch and Landing Facility semitruck driver Corey Spears – mentioned as one of the best drivers Lockheed has on its payroll – began inching the truck out a delicate task that seemed imperceptibly slow. At least a half dozen other Lockheed employees and Air Force personnel helped guide the satellite out using a custom container and trailer that can lift and lower itself based on the incline of the Super Galaxy's payload bay ramp.

Rocket launch schedule:Upcoming Florida launches and landings

Just over three hours after landing the semitruck and climate-controlled GOES-T container were entirely out of the aircraft and safely on the flight line ready for the next leg of the trip to Astrotech Space Operations' processing facility in Titusville. NOAA partners with NASA for launches of its GOES weather satellites.

Several of the dozens of Lockheed employees who arrived on the C-5 will spend the coming months here on the Space Coast prepping the spacecraft for its launch and subsequent 10-year mission 22236 miles above Earth.

""This is one of a series of steps that have to happen to get the satellite in orbit and sending back weather data"" said Dan Lindsey a researcher and spokesperson at NOAA. ""NASA is very good at public spacecraft development instrument development launching assets to space and getting them on orbit so that's the role they play.""

Once up and running GOES-T will become GOES-18. It will replace GOES-17 which launched from the Cape in 2018 as GOES-S but suffered a cooling system issue. Though it still gets over 90% of the needed data Lindsey said GOES-T will move to replace it and the damaged spacecraft will be used as a spare.

GOES-17 currently covers the western half of the U.S.; GOES-16 launched in 2016 is responsible for the eastern side. Both have been responsible for an incredible boost in imagery and data especially during hurricane season that runs from June to November.

Just like previous GOES satellites this T variant will use several instruments to gather data on local and national weather lightning hurricanes and more for general forecasting and research. Its findings will also help with understanding the impacts of climate change.

After a brief on-orbit test period Lockheed will ""hand over"" the satellite to the NOAA for an expected 10-year lifespan. But before then company employees that traveled with the satellite will help oversee testing more transport encapsulation in its payload fairing and eventually launch day.

Living on the Space Coast

Like most spacecraft that arrive in Florida months before launch several employees travel with Air Force transports then briefly live on the Space Coast to help with processing.

AJ Sandora senior manager of assembly test and launch operations at Lockheed Martin is one of about 27 people who will process GOES-T. Including engineering teams that come and go he said there will be 45 to 65 people working at Astrotech. That all leads up to 12 days before launch when the satellite is slowly rolled out of the facility and over to Atlas V's Launch Complex 41.

""I'll be bringing my wife here and a lot of folks try to bring their families here too"" Sandora said. ""With the spacecraft here we still have to monitor things and make sure everybody stays safe so we usually keep a local team here just in case but a lot of folks will take some time off and rotate for the holidays.""

But it's not just people – forklift drivers hauled out package after package stored ahead of the semitruck. Included were crane attachments tools supplies and other equipment specific to GOES-T that must be available at Astrotech.

""The biggest thing I think people don't realize is how many people this takes"" Sandora said. ""It takes an army to pull this off. It's not just us who are staying here for the whole time but it's everybody.""

Just before Thanksgiving Sandora said teams would conduct several tests to make sure GOES-T handled the shipping process – especially vibrations – without issue. Instrument performance tests should happen before Christmas then fueling of the 20-foot satellite should come in the second week of January.

The satellite will put on some post-holidays weight too: Before fueling it weighs 6340 pounds. That process will add about 5000 more for a total clock-in weight of 11508 pounds.

Post-shipment vibration testing and other checkouts are critical. That was exemplified last week when the multibillion-dollar James Webb Space Telescope slated to launch from French Guiana on a European Space Agency-purchased Ariane 5 rocket potentially suffered issues during a processing mishap. NASA said a clamp designed to secure JWST to its launch adapter suddenly released sending vibrations throughout the processing facility just north of Brazil. The Northrop Grumman-built satellite is now slated to launch no earlier than Dec. 22.

Back at KSC Sandora said his teams are ready for game day.

""This is a long Super Bowl for us. The team put a lot of hard work and hours in to getting through assembly and test"" Sandora said. ""We get very excited and the team's excited. We're looking forward to the show.""

Russia showcased this fifth-generation combat aircraft at the Dubai Airshow earlier this month. Besides the Middle East Moscow is looking to market the Sukhoi-built warplane to India Vietnam and African countries.

The F-35 Agreement

The UAE has a $23 billion agreement with the US to procure Lockheed Martin stealth fighters and other weaponry. The promise of 50 F-35 Lightning II aircraft is a major chunk of this deal.

However the finalization of the contract is dependent on Abu Dhabi’s involvement in the Yemen conflict. The potential impact of the deal on Israel a key customer of F-35 jets is also being evaluated.

According to US legislation passed in 2008 Washington would assist Israel in maintaining its Qualitative Military Edge (QME) which means that Israeli forces will have superior military systems capable of defeating any credible traditional threat posed by any state coalition or non-state actor in the Middle East.

Additionally it has been reported that the Biden administration reflecting concerns about the UAE’s relationship with China has added another condition — that the Gulf state terminates its 5G contract with controversial Chinese technology firm Huawei which has been accused of corporate espionage by the US and seen as a security threat.

Amid such uncertainties Abu Dhabi has expressed interest in Russia’s Su-75. Speaking at the Dubai Airshow 2021 Sergei Chemezov head of Russia’s state defense and tech corporation Rostec said that representatives of the UAE have shown interest in the single-engine Su-75 Checkmate light tactical fighter developed by Sukhoi and want to have a closer look at it.

During a press briefing Viktor Kladov who leads Rostec’s international cooperation and regional policy department told reporters that the firm had held talks at the show with the Tawazun Economic Council Mubadala Investment Company and Edge Group about the production of telecommunications technology and composite materials. He cited Abu Dhabi’s “keen interest” in upcoming tech as the reason behind choosing this Gulf state to co-produce the aircraft.

This is not the first time that Russia and the UAE have worked with the idea of cooperating in the military sector. At the 2017 UAE defense show IDEX Moscow had declared that Rostec would co-develop a fifth-generation light combat fighter with Abu Dhabi.

Company officials did not provide a clear statement confirming or denying the speculation that the Checkmate is a result of this agreement.

Reuters quoted that Jean-Loup Samaan a senior research fellow with the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore as saying that “[t]he UAE likes the idea of cultivating ties with the Russian defense industry but it’s mainly a way to send a message to the US.”

Meanwhile Kladov revealed bigger plans for the aircraft in the near future. “We foresee that maybe in five years we have the unmanned version of Checkmate controlled by artificial intelligence” he told reporters.

Export Plans For Su-75

Commenting on the aircraft’s qualities that make it suitable for other countries to buy Zhemezov said “[w]e have one major advantage compared to all the other [foreign] aircraft.

First of all this is an open configuration plane: we are offering a platform that can carry any armaments that the customer may wish. Besides we outfit it with various electronics electronic warfare systems target acquisition capabilities and so on.”

“We offer the options that are available and have been tested on the Su-57. These systems have been developed and tested and they have proven their efficiency and thus they are simpler and cheaper” the Rostec chief said in the context of foreign armaments that have to be adapted to the Russian warplane.

“And of course the price will vary depending on these options. I hope that the baseline price will be around $30-35 million” he added.

Along with the cost the aircraft’s production timeline was also announced at the Dubai Airshow. While the first flight of the warplane is planned for 2023 its serial production is slated to begin in 2026 Yury Slyusar the general director of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) which manufactures Sukhoi jets confirmed.

In addition to advanced characteristics such as stealth characteristics and supersonic cruising speeds that are required of every fifth-generation fighter the corporation claims that the new design will also include innovative technologies especially artificial intelligence (AI) features to assist the pilot.

The firm also claims that this aircraft has been designed to reduce service costs and be easily adapted to the different needs customer countries have.

This is an improvement since Sukhoi as well as Russia’s MiG aircraft-makers has only produced twin-engine fighters since the 1980s.

Some experts believe that this has been disadvantageous to Moscow in certain foreign markets where cheaper single-engine aircraft are preferred by customers. With Checkmate Russia plans to change this trend and hence a major emphasis on its export.

Yury Borisov the Deputy Prime Minister of Russia told Zvezda TV “First of all it will indeed be oriented towards African countries India and Vietnam. The demand for these aircraft is quite high it is estimated at least 300 aircraft in the near future.”

Will India Buy Checkmate?

While the jet may be pitched to India a potential deal with New Delhi remains doubtful The Week quoted Justin Bronk a research fellow at the British think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).

Bronk in a chat with aviation magazine Hush-Kit had expressed his skepticism about India being interested in the Checkmate fighter.

“India is likely to be very wary after its experiences with the PAK FA/FGFA program and poor support for the Su-30MKI fleet post-acquisition” he was quoted as saying.

PAK FA the project that developed the Su-57 fighter was originally supposed to involve India and Russia. This was to be called the Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA). However in 2018 India decided to pull out of the project due to the Indian Air Force’s reported concerns regarding the stealth features and engines of the Su-57.

Other than this somewhat bitter experience the cost is another obstacle between India and the Checkmate. Most major stealth fighter projects have seen extensive cost overruns and development delays in their development.

Along with potential cost overruns and probable difficulties in development the IAF will also have to factor in India’s indigenous projects currently in development including the single-engine HAL Tejas Mark-2 also called Medium Weight Fighter (MWF) and the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programs.

Former IAF chief RKS Bhadauria had said that the service was supporting the AMCA which is scheduled to make its first flight by 2025-26.

“They [DRDO] are looking at a timeline of 2027 to 2030 to put the stealth fighter into production. If that materializes the fighter should be operationally available to IAF as a squadron by 2032” Bhadauria told Hindustan Times.

He had further added that the IAF was keen on the integration of sixth-generation technologies into the AMCA. Currently the Checkmate does not seem to have enough time to be ready to compete for the IAF’s requirement to buy 114 combat aircraft.

However a top Indian defense analyst told the EurAsian Times that there is a high possibility of India acquiring the Checkmate explaining that this will not impact the development of the AMCA jet.

Abhijit Iyer-Mitra a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies (IPCS) said – India’s plan to acquire a single-engine jet has been on the anvil for nearly two decades. The MMRCA tender was for a single-engine jet but was later diverted as the Su-30s were not performing well and India wanted another twin-engine jet.

“The second time they did it again with MMRCA 2.0 because Russians did not have a single-engine jet to offer. “Now that the Russians have a single-engine jet they could enter it into the new competition and I personally feel it stands a really good chance to win the Indian contract” Iyer-Mitra added.

The only other option that New Delhi has is the American F-35 but it has not been offered yet and is unlikely to be offered as India is set to deploy S-400 missiles. This leaves India with the Checkmate given it is the only visually stealth aircraft which we’ll have access to for a very long time” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3Qvd2lsbC1pbmRpYS1nZXQtaXRzLWhhbmRzLWYtMzUtc3RlYWx0aC1maWdodGVycy0xOTcxMDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will India Get Its Hands on F-35 Stealth Fighters?,"Here's What You Need to Remember: A fifth-generation multirole fighter such as the F-35 jet might give India some kind of parity with China along the border region a mountainous area filled with plateaus valleys and terrain less hospitable to any kind of major armored ground advance.

The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin have in recent years been quickly expanding the number of international F-35 partners while also seeing a fast increase in global demand for the jet an uptick in partner purchase quantities and inquiries from potential new customers.

Norway is progressing quickly with its F-35 program Denmark just received its first stealth jet and Japan is in the process of making a huge multi-billion dollar F-35 buy.

What about India? Certainly the U.S. connection to India is growing stronger given Chinese threats in the region. India is also revving up its modernization programs and stepping up interoperability and cooperation with the United States by for example hosting B-1 bombers.

Media reports such as one from the ELE Times says India has on several occasions indicated an interest in acquiring F-35 stealth jets.

“General Bipin Rawat India’s chief of defence staff says that the technology has never been offered by the U.S. to India. Indian Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Thursday scotched a longstanding rumour about India’s possible acquisition of American F-35 fighter jets as he told a foreign policy conference that Washington had never offered New Delhi the multirole combat aircraft” the ELE Times report states.

Could that change? How? What might an F-35 fighter jet do for India? There are several interesting nuances at play here one of which is that Lockheed Martin is already engineering a specially configured high-tech F-16 variant for New Delhi yet even an advanced plane such as this might not impact the Indian-Chinese balance of power in a substantial way. China already operates fifth-generation J-20 and J-31 fighter jets potentially positioned to threaten India and any kind of confrontation along the mountainous Indian-Chinese border area would likely hinge upon air superiority.

This may precisely be the reason why the Pentagon could at some point be inclined to offer the F-35 fighter jet to India given the growing extent to which the United States and India already collaborate when it comes to a China-deterrence posture. A fifth-generation multirole fighter such as the F-35 jet might give India some kind of parity with China along the border region a mountainous area filled with plateaus valleys and terrain less hospitable to any kind of major armored ground advance. This means any kind of Indian attack into China would need to rely upon lighter mobile tactical forces and even dismounted soldiers enabled by airlift helicopters and ruggedized C-130 cargo planes. These are precisely the kinds of combat conditions under which an F-35 jet might be needed as an up-gunned F-16 might clearly be outmatched in the air by Chinese fifth-generation jets.

In light of this and the fact that nobody including India has F-22 stealth fighters the F-35 stealth platform might be one of the few assets able to greatly impact the threat equation between India and China and provide close air support.

NASA's Artemis program will kickstart the colonization of our natural satellite and lay the foundation for future exploration of other worlds. But for that to happen new technologies will have to be developed including vehicles capable of conquering the rugged lunar terrain.

Not that many years ago NASA announced that the Artemis program will land the first woman and the next man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Once astronauts get to really put their boots on the Moon they'll need a lunar terrain vehicle (LTV) to explore the satellite something that can withstand the regolith encountered on the lunar surface and the long cold nights.Several automakers have already jumped on the bandwagon and presented concepts and ideas that could help the Artemis astronauts establish a long-term presence on the Moon. Toyota joined forces with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to develop a pressurized rover that would allow the crew to ride inside without needing their spacesuits.Recently GM announced that it's working on a lunar rover project together with Lockheed Martin to create an electric Moon buggy capable of exploring the rugged terrain and withstanding the harsh conditions.Now we're seeing another daring concept. This time the solution comes from Xtend Design a London-based architecture and design company focused on interdisciplinary projects for both Earth and space. Over the years the team has been creating incredible designs for major agencies such as NASA or the European Science Foundation that vision villages on the Moon and 3D-printed habitats for a moon base.Recently Xtend Design has revealed a new project - a Skoda Enyaq-inspired moon rover aptly called Luniaq. Announced during the Czech Space Week the concept was presented in the largest virtual reality laboratory in Europe the Virtuplex.This allowed guests to experience what it feels like to be on the lunar surface from our home and see what astronauts will have to face once they land on the Moon. The Luniaq is the creation of space architect Tomas Rousek who formerly worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on designs for missions to the Moon Mars and asteroids.The rover's front design was inspired by Skoda's Enyaq  and it is based on NASA's MMSEV (Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle) platform. The result? An electric lunar vehicle with large windows capable of seating up to four astronauts.The windows are made from transparent aluminum. If that sounds familiar that's because you've probably seen this tech in a "" Star Trek "" movie. While scientists are not actually capable of replicating the aluminum used in the fictional world of ""Star Trek"" they can get pretty close to it in reality by using transparent ceramics made from aluminum compounds.Using this type of material is like using bulletproof glass on steroids – a great feature for the lunar setting. As the rover moves it can kick up dust and sharp rocks that can harm the occupants. In that case the windows will sort of act as a shield. Of course the polyethylene layers would also help protect the crew from harmful UV radiation.In the front the Luniaq will feature an additional window positioned in the bottom part. This will allow astronauts to see the terrain ahead. They'll also be able to see their surroundings using stereoscopic cameras.The vehicle's wheels will be based on Michelin's Tweel design. The tires will have flexible spokes that can absorb bumps and they won't fear puncturing as the technology doesn't use compressed air.The rover has two hatches on the sides which will connect it to the Moon base's space modules. At the rear there is what the company calls a ""suitport"" hidden behind a hinged door. The suitport as the name suggests provides two spacesuits. This allows the astronauts to get equipped without having to deal with the lunar dust from the outside.Power is received from solid-state batteries that can be charged from the roof-mounted UltraFlex solar panels. Apart from the solar panels the roof will feature radiators for cooling down and antennas needed for communication with the lunar base or Earth. Remote and autonomous control of the rover will also be possible.For now the Luniaq is just a concept that lives through the renderings provided by the Xtend Design team. We'll have yet to see what the first LTV will actually look like."

Christi left this world after a short illness and joined her father Dennis Lowe on the other side of the veil on November 27 2021. She was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and loved our Savior.

While she was with us she created joy and fun for all around her and made sure that all were included. She checked on family and friends often and would leave notes of encouragement. Never without bright colors or something sparkly she sparked joy in those who called themselves her friends and family. Christi was a life-long learner who found happiness in everything associated with space often posting significant planetary events eclipses and rocket launches to social media as a public service announcement to the non-nerds of social media.

Christi found her calling working at Western Governors University for the last 13 years. First helping students find their passions and then as a project manager managing programs to help those same students succeed. She also moonlighted at Wiseguys Comedy Club in Salt Lake City often being the first face people saw on their way to laugh the night away. It started as a way to get money to travel and find random out-of-the-way places to visit. She loved the gig especially meeting the comedians particularly Fortune Feimster (her favorite) in the months before her death

In addition to her work Christi was actively engaged in volunteering often raising money and organizing donation drives for various organizations including People Helping People the Road Home the Ronald McDonald House and after various natural disasters throughout the world. Her heart extended far past her immediate borders.

Christi loved her family and friends and in the past few years graduated to Cool Aunt status spoiling both Rooney and August with science experiments movie dates and spooky Halloween craft nights. She also adored her many friends who gave her so much joy throughout the years from co-workers to church friends to any random person who shared her sarcastic wit. As a member of the Utah Voices choir she loved singing and using her voice to lift people up.

Christi is survived by her mother Cindy; her brother Trent and sister-in-law Emmy; her niece Rooney and nephew August; her grandmother Eva Herrick; many aunts and uncles as well as cousins who loved her and whom she loved.

A viewing in Christi’s honor will be held Thursday December 2 2021 at Russon Bountiful Mortuary 295 North Main Bountiful Utah from 6 to 8 pm.

During a Thursday appearance on the YouTube series Hot Ones Lowe 57 — who starred as Sam Seaborn on the Aaron Sorkin drama from 1999 through 2006 — recalled a set visit from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright plus a time when he thought he had gotten in trouble with the National Security Advisor.

Hot Ones host Sean Evans asked Lowe ""Is there any truth to the internet rumor that Madeleine Albright once crashed the set of West Wing at 3 o'clock in the morning in a robe to accost you guys for being too loud and for not having a secretary of state character?""

The actor laughed and told Evans that the question was ""conflating many different urban legends"" but confirmed it was true that Albright did visit the West Wing set.

First We Feast/Youtube

""Madeleine Albright absolutely came to the set very very late"" Lowe recalled. ""We were shooting at the [John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]. She wanted to meet everybody.""

At the time Albright was sitting secretary of state Lowe explained and he said that the cast was surprised and agreed to meet her.

He then broke down the rest of the rumor telling Evans ""I was in the White House with Bill Clinton and was summoned to the national security director's office who was a really gnarly tough bare-knuckle dude named Sandy Berger.""

NBCU Photo Bank/Getty

Berger worked as President Clinton's National Security Advisor a job he held from 1997 to 2001.

Lowe told Evans that Berger snapped his fingers and told him ""Sit down"" making the actor instantly nervous. At the time Lowe said he was thinking ""'Oh I'm f-----. This has got to be about like my taxes.' ""

But the actor said the meeting took an unexpected turn.

""And he was like 'Why isn't there a national security advisor on your show?' And I was like 'This is what this guy's thinking about in the middle of the day?'"" Lowe told Evans.

While The West Wing concluded with its seventh and final season in 2006 the cast of the hit political drama reunited last fall in an HBO Max special to encourage viewers to vote in the 2020 presidential election.

Lowe told PEOPLE last year that filming the special was ""surreal"" explaining ""in getting ready to do it it felt like it had been a thousand eons ago.""

""Then when the cameras rolled and it was just [West Wing costar] Martin Sheen and I sitting down as Sam and President Bartlet it felt like it was yesterday and everybody was as good as I remembered them"" he continued. ""It was like a great classic rock band that hadn't lost a step.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmxvY2t0b24uY29tL2F1L2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbG9ja3Rvbi1uZXctemVhbGFuZC1hcHBvaW50cy1wZXRlci1sb3dlLWFzLWNoaWVmLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1vZmZpY2Vy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockton New Zealand appoints Peter Lowe as Chief Executive Officer,"Lockton New Zealand (Lockton Companies NZ Limited Partnership) is delighted to announce the appointment of Peter Lowe as Chief Executive Officer effective from Monday 29 November 2021.

Lululemon a Vancouver-based maker of fitness clothing claimed in a Nov. 11 cease and desist letter that five Peloton products infringe its apparel design patents. Peloton then sued in Manhattan federal court Wednesday — just two days before Black Friday’s start of the holiday shopping season.

New York-based Peloton said it has been selling apparel since 2014 and began its own clothing line in September after an “amicable” termination of its co-branding relationship with Lululemon. In its letter Lululemon threatened to sue over infringement of its trademarks and trade dress — the distinctive visual appearance of its products — and theft of trade secrets.

“Lululemon’s allegations lack any merit” Peloton said in the complaint. “Even a quick comparison of the Lululemon patented designs with the allegedly infringing Peloton products reveals numerous clear and obvious differences that allow the products to be easily distinguished.”

In a statement Friday Lululemon spokeswoman Erin Hankinson said the company has “requested that Peloton cease and desist selling a number of styles of apparel which we believe infringe upon Lululemon’s design patents. We will defend our proprietary rights to protect the integrity of our brand and to safeguard our intellectual property.”

The Peloton products targeted in the dispute are its Strappy Bra Cadent Laser Dot Legging Cadent Laser Dot Bra High Neck Bra Cadent Peak Bra and One Lux Tight.

Peloton is hoping to add to its sales for athletic hardware and high-end interactive fitness classes. The company has filed its own patent lawsuits against rivals Echelon and iFit in a bid to limit the ability of rivals to offer fitness classes similar to its own.

The case is: Peloton Interactive Inc. v. Lululemon Athletica Canada Inc. 21-cv-10071 US District Court Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Wallet address “16vRq…qjzEa"" transferred out its 500 Bitcoin at block 843131 on May 12 at 7:10 pm UTC while the other 500 Bitcoin was sent by address “1DUJuH…NgfC5” two blocks later according to Blockchain.com’s Bitcoin block explorer.

The wallets each received 500 Bitcoin on Sept. 12 and Sept. 13 2013 when Bitcoin was priced at $134 according to CoinGecko.

At current prices the combined amount transferred is now worth 456 times more than their acquisition price at $61.2 million.

Since the transfers one of the receiving addresses from “16vRq…qjzEa” has already transferred the 500 Bitcoin onward to a multitude of  while the receiver from “1DUJuH…NgfC5” is still holding its 500 Bitcoin.

The proximity of the inward and outward transfers prompted blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain to pair the two transactions together onlookers believe the two wallets were owned by the same person or entity.

Prior to the transfers the two addresses were the equal 4353rd largest Bitcoin whales according to BitInfoCharts.

Less than a week ago a Satoshi Nakamoto-era Bitcoin wallet transferred 687 Bitcoin worth $43.9 million to two separate addresses.

While at least one of these early-day Bitcoin wallets tends to wake up each month there are nearly 1.8 million Bitcoin addresses that have remained dormant for over a decade according to a recent analysis by Chainalysis and Fortune.

These wallets which exclude Nakamoto’s wallet contain about $121 billion worth of Bitcoin Fortune said.

While it is impossible to know how much this has been lost the 1.8 million addresses account for 8.5% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist.

People often speculate that dormant wallets may be waking up to sell Bitcoin at an opportune time others suggest it could be to transfer the funds to a different address perhaps under a more secure noncustodial wallet service provider.

Bitcoin is currently priced at $61450 and is up 130% over the last 12 months according to CoinGecko.

Those words were hard to hear. They were my daughter’s words of despair when she received the worst news of her life: The baby she was carrying suffered from grave defects. That sweet baby named Lila was diagnosed with gastroschisis a dangerous condition in which her intestines were developing outside her body. She also had only one healthy kidney and her very small size indicated that she might have a fatal genetic anomaly.

And Camille was indeed young: 21 years old. She married her high school sweetheart while she was in college and she got pregnant her senior year. All this sounds unusual especially in an era when Americans are getting married and having children at older ages than ever before but marriage at a relatively young age fit Camille. She was always an old soul and so was her husband. They were mature beyond their years but this moment felt different. The news about Lila was terrifying — crushing actually.

I didn’t really know what to say in response. I knew she’d rise to the occasion but I could see in her eyes that she wasn’t ready for a motivational speech. When you get bad news there are times you don’t need encouragement so much as empathy. All I could think to say was “No one is old enough for this news. There is no right age for this challenge.” We cried we prayed and then we prepared. Our daughter was becoming a mother in the most difficult of circumstances.

And it was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen.

Her first concrete decision as a mom was to refuse amniocentesis. Though she desperately wanted more information about Lila the thought of any additional risk to her baby was too much for her to bear. She’d find out Lila’s true condition when she gave birth; then and only then would we know if she’d live.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM4OTIvdmVyaXpvbi10bW9iaWxlLWF0dC11bmxpbWl0ZWQtcGxhbi1mcmVlLXBob25lLW9mZmVycy1maW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile's “unlimited” plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist,"Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile will pay a combined $10.22 million to a group of states to settle claims that the carriers lied to customers about their “unlimited” plans and “free” phone offers. The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUva2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLWZhbGwtZ3V5LWlmLWdsb2JhbC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJveC1vZmZpY2UtMTIzNTkxMjQxNS_SAXpodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2tpbmdkb20tb2YtdGhlLXBsYW5ldC1vZi10aGUtYXBlcy1mYWxsLWd1eS1pZi1nbG9iYWwtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLTEyMzU5MTI0MTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Dawns Worldwide With $129M – International Box Office,"SUNDAY UPDATE AFTER SATURDAY EXCLUSIVE Refresh for latest…: 20th Century Studios/Disney’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes has dawned to a $129M global debut swinging in with $72.5M from 52 international box office markets and $56.5M domestically. The worldwide start makes it the 3rd biggest global bow of the year.

Overseas Latin America was particularly strong including Brazil delivering the market’s biggest opening of 2024. In China the movie came in No. 1 with $11.4M but as we noted yesterday (see below) this is currently a soft market after a record-breaking May Day holiday frame.

Nevertheless and giving a hopeful kick towards the start of summer KPA opened as the No. 1 non-local title in all major markets. It also scored the biggest bow for the modern franchise in Netherlands Finland Poland Turkey Hungary Indonesia Vietnam Argentina Colombia Ecuador Chile Central America Bolivia Paraguay Uruguay and several smaller markets. Across Europe it was tops in all markets save for Austria (where Sony’s The Garfield Movie purred to No. 1). KPA is the 2nd best bow of 2024 for a studio title in France (among others) as well as the highest opening for the modern franchise in Netherlands Finland Poland Kuwait Qatar Egypt and more.

In France IF started at No. 3 behind Apes and local hit Un Petit Truc En Plus grossing $3.3M at 621 locations. Belgium opened at No. 2 with $300K from 85 cinemas and behind Apes.

Next week IF expands into 56 markets including UK Australia Germany Brazil Mexico Spain Korea and Middle East region.

In holdover play the cat is meowing as Columbia Pictures/Alcon Entertainment’s The Garfield Movie added a handful of markets for $11.8M in 22 (-32% from last session). That takes the total to $36M overseas and before domestic claws in later this month.

In detail this frame Germany debuted to $2.1M which is 85% bigger than DC League Of Super Pets and 40% higher than Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. Mexico led all sophomore markets with $3.1M (-28%) to boost its cume to $12.5M and Spain added $860K (-28%) for a local total of $3.6M.

Upcoming key market releases include Korea UK and Australia throughout May. France pounces in July and Japan in August.

Universal’s The Fall Guy which stumbled out last weekend despite being a really fun ride added $9.4M this session overseas (-54%) to bring the offshore cume to $54M. Globally it’s at $103.7M.

Top 5 to date are the UK ($8.3M) Australia ($6.6M) Mexico ($3.6M) Germany ($3.4M) and France ($3.4M).

PREVIOUS SATURDAY EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios/Disney’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is beating its chest towards a $125M global bow this weekend. At the international box office we understand the Wes Ball-directed installment is at around $31M through Friday. As Anthony has reported domestic is looking at a $52M-$55M start for the full frame.

Overseas we’re eyeing $70M with some potential upside. Hindrance here is China as we noted in our preview. Even though Apes will come in at No. 1 for the frame there it’s a soft market coming off of a big holiday weekend last session. This one includes a Saturday workday. The Maoyan (9.1) and TPP (9.2) scores are good but the Douban critical note is not so hot at 6.7 which is the lowest of the recent series. Estimates for the no longer reliable market’s start are around $11M.

Looking at overseas comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

So given projections we are hearing Kingdom would land in the middle of that pack.

We understand there have been positive starts in Latin America France the Netherlands and other parts of Europe – where it bears noting there is now summer weather in some pockets. Elsewhere there are mixed results.

The Top 5 markets through Friday overseas are: France ($4.8M) China ($3M) Mexico ($2.4M) UK ($2M) and Germany ($1.3M).

Not included in the above are the Saturday numbers out of China and Korea which take those running cumes to $6.7M and $2.1M respectively.

We’ll have a full report tomorrow."

Jacob Bethel was visiting New York City from the Florida Keys where he claimed to be a lighthouse keeper at Alligator Reef Lighthouse.

The stories Bethel told provide interesting glimpses into Alligator Reef Lighthouse and the lives of those tending its flashing light. Bethel is quoted as saying: “I see the red sectors are not so common up this way as they are with us. We’re a little ahead of the north in sectors maybe because we need them more. They are the red streaks in the lantern you know. Our light for instance has a radius of 20 ¾ miles. In some directions all is clear water and in others there are dangerous reefs and shoals. The red glass is set in the lantern in such a way that when a mariner is sailing in dangerous water and looks up at the lantern he sees a red light. That is a delicate hint for him to change his course and get out. When he is sailing in clear water he sees nothing but a white light and knows all is safe. All the principal lights on the Florida reefs have recently been fitted with these red sectors and they are a great improvement.”

He also had some interesting comments about the change in lantern fuel being stored out at the lights. “I don’t know whether you’ve heard up this way that we are all in danger of having our heads blown off. It’s a fact of course you know the government has recently changed the character of oil we burn — put us to use mineral oils. We could store animal oil in the lighthouse safely enough but such quantities of petroleum as we have to keep on hand put us in constant danger. We are very exposed to lightning of course and just suppose the lightning begins to meander among those 70 barrels of oil — what is going to become of Alligator light and its keepers?”

When the first lighthouses were erected along the reef Carysfort Reef Sand Key and Sombrero Key whale oil was used to soak the light’s wick. Whale oil was derived from New England industries. By the mid-19th century whale populations had decidedly decreased and the U.S. Lighthouse Board began looking into alternative fuels. In an 1874 report to the U.S. Senate the Lighthouse Board announced it would be switching to lard.

By 1877 the Lighthouse Board had switched to a cheaper form of fuel kerosene. It would take time to convert the nation’s lighthouses to kerosene. As the stories reprinted in the Boston Globe appeared in 1896 the date of the original story published in the New York Sun is harder to pin down but the fuel at Alligator Reef Lighthouse was switched to kerosene circa 1882.

The problem with Jacob Bethel’s stories about Alligator Reef Lighthouse is the storyteller. Several Bethels served at the lighthouses along the reef including Joseph Bethel (1858-1859) and Theophilus I. Bethel (1878-1880). The only Jacob to serve at the lights marking the Florida Reef was a man named Jacob Rain who was a second assistant keeper at Carysfort Reef Lighthouse for a brief time in 1860.

In 1896 Alligator Reef Lighthouse was staffed by head keeper Edgar J. Russell first assistant William H. Curry and second assistant keeper John Watkins for part of the year. He was replaced by George E. Billberry who served until 1900. In the history of Alligator Reef Lighthouse the only man named Bethel to have worked at the post was William A. Bethel who served as a first assistant (1876-1878).

In 1870 William A. Bethel lived at nearby Indian Key with his parents William H. and Caroline. William did have a younger brother James R. Bethel. Who then was Jacob Bethel? As it turns out James is the English version of the Hebrew name Jacob and it appears that the man visiting New York and telling stories about Alligator Reef Lighthouse was William’s brother James who apparently went by the name Jacob. While his brother William has a rich history of lighthouse service in the Florida Keys Jacob or James was a bit of a prankster and seemed to have been living vicariously through his brother while telling lighthouse stories to the New York reporter.",,,,,,,,,

As Americans continue to cope with the ongoing pandemic travel has seen a steady increase once again. That means packed airports and bumper-to-bumper traffic on most major highways starting Wednesday. It also means more people will be staying in hotels.

This brings us to an interesting and highly symbolic news story one that deserves coverage.

I have done my share of travel — both in the United States and internationally — over my two decades working as a journalist. The few things you could always count on for much of that time was a newspaper at the front desk usually USA Today and a Bible in your nightstand.

Not anymore. Print is slowly dying and newspaper readers have migrated to the internet in recent years.

What about those Bibles?

They too seem to be slowly disappearing. I noticed this past summer while on a trip to Washington D.C. that there was no Bible in my hotel room.

The phasing out of Bibles in hotel rooms is actually part of a steady trend across the country over the past few years. In 2016 Marriott International the world’s largest hotel chain typically supplied both a Bible and Book of Mormon in its rooms. But the company decided that forgoing religious materials was the way to go at two of its hipper hotel brands such as Moxy and Edition. Note that both of these chains target younger guests.

Bibles used to be ubiquitous in hotel rooms. A 2017 survey by STR a hospitality analytics company revealed that 79% of hotels had religious materials in their rooms — a notable decrease from 95% of hotels surveyed in 2006. Indeed as America becomes more secular and laptops and cellphones become more common the need for a physical Bible inside your nightstand drawer is growing more obsolete.

Travel and Leisure reported that a majority of hotel franchises “allow individual hotel owners to decide whether or not to stock their drawers with religious scripture. And as more hotel chains aim to attract Millennial travelers they are taking Bibles out of their rooms.”

Here is another newsy discussion point: The Freedom From Religion Foundation back in 2015 sent a letter to major hotel chains across the U.S. requesting that Bibles be removed from rooms. On its website the group which advocates for atheists and agnostics said “Many of your guests are freethinkers — atheists agnostics skeptics or ‘nones’ — who are deeply offended to be charged high fees only to be proselytized in the privacy of their own bedrooms. Not only that the Bible calls for killing nonbelievers apostates gays ‘stubborn sons’ and women who transgress biblical double standards.”

Why are here Bibles inside many hotel rooms? It was in 1908 that The Gideons International — the evangelical Christian group — decided to provide hotels with the Holy Book.

The group on its website recalls how the tradition got started: “The Gideons International is the result of a meeting between two men who wished to band commercial travelers together for evangelism. What began in 1908 as an Association of Christian businessmen placing Bibles in hotel rooms has evolved into an expanding mission to provide Scriptures to all people in nearly every facet of life. Today we have taken more than two billion Scriptures in more than 95 languages to 200 countries territories and possessions across the globe.”

Gideons International said it has donated more than 1.4 million King James Bibles to hotels around the world between June 2018 and May 2019 alone. Of those some 650000 were in the United States the group added.

Other denominations like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — commonly known as Mormons — followed suit and also started stocking rooms at hotels motels and bed and breakfasts with their own free religious literature. Some like Trump International Hotel in Washington also provide guests with the Talmud Quran Gita and Avesta.

These days guests have many online choices. Free Wi-Fi in rooms for example allows them to read whatever they want on their phones tablets or laptops. As a result Christians also have many online choices when it comes to religious literature. Gideons International has an app while one of the most popular podcasts of the moment on Apple is a daily Bible reading by Catholic priest Mike Schmitz.

Do you have dreams of your family going down waterslides while you relax by a fancy heated pool with a cocktail but you can't justify a whole vacation spent paying for an expensive resort just to sit by the pool for a day or two? There's an app for that. Or rather there are websites that sell day passes to popular resorts so you can stay wherever you want but play at the poshest pools around.

My family uses these sites to book resort days on cruises when we are in ports we have already explored extensively in the past. However this day pass system is far from reserved for cruisers. It is alive and well in places like Miami and Hawaii too where most folks arrive by plane. Using a resort pass you could stay at an Airbnb or more budget hotel and then spend a day of your vacation living it up at the pool and beach of a pricier resort. Or you could book a day pass as part of a ""staycation"" closer to home since even some hotels in metro areas such as New York City have pool day passes available.

My colleague Betsy Eccles was in need of a reset recently and tested out a day pass at Walt Disney's Swan Hotel in Orlando. Here's her report:

The pool at Disney's Swan Hotel. (Photo courtesy of the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort)

""While working alone in Charlotte has its perks I recently decided to venture out and come work remotely in Orlando for a month. Being a big Disney fan (annual passholder and all) Orlando just seemed like the right place. I was able to find a rental close to the theme parks and with mild February temperatures thought it was the perfect time to come. Unexpectedly Orlando is unseasonably warm. Seeing that it was going to reach almost 90 degrees last weekend I knew a day at the parks would be way too hot to be enjoyable. Ironically enough I saw an Instagram ad pop up for ResortPass so I checked it out. It had the [Disney] Swan and Dolphin resort listed as a potential place to get pool access.

""For $25 I was guaranteed a reserved chair at the pool of my choosing (they have a few) access to the fitness center pool bar and grill. When I arrived I followed the instructions (ResortPass' pre-communication was excellent) and checked in. I was escorted to my chair and given the rundown of everything. I stored my backpack in one of the lockers in the fitness center right beside the pool so it wasn't in the sun all day. They've made it easy with the ability to walk up to the pool bar to order drinks or use mobile ordering from your chair for food and beverages. After a few hours of sun and cocktails I showered in the locker room (which was very clean and updated) changed into other clothes and headed to the theme park.

""It was a wonderful experience and I cannot recommend it enough. I even tried to book again for Sunday but they were already sold out I did rebook for a day in two weeks with my friend who is coming to visit. It's a great option for those that don't have annual passes and are being a bit more money conscious [but] still want a Disney-esqe experience.

""As for masks you do not have to wear one in the pool or while laying out in your chair (all chairs are spaced apart) but do [need to] wear one walking to the bar or bathrooms. Everyone did a great job of following the guidelines and I felt safe.""

How does a resort day pass work?

With a resort day pass you typically pay a flat rate — either per person or per cabana — that includes access to the hotel's recreational amenities. Some passes kick it up a notch in the value department to include a food and beverage credit for on-site dining venues and/or transportation to and from the port if cruisers are the target demographic.

Some resort day passes even include a private hotel room for your family's use during the day. In more urban areas the pass may only include use of the pool and/or fitness center. (Spa passes are also available for adults.)

It's best to reserve your day passes in advance since they are capacity-controlled. If you just show up at the resort you might be turned away if its allotment of passes has already sold out for that day. Most often the resort's recreation department handles day pass clients so you'll usually check in at the recreation desk near the pool or in the spa/fitness area.

Apps and Sites That Sell Resort Day Passes

There are a handful of sites that sell resort day passes. Start with a search of these sites:

ResortPass: Perhaps the gold standard among resort day pass purveyors for U.S.-based hotels ResortPass works with the major hoteliers including Hilton Hyatt (including Miraval) IHG Marriott (and many of its brands from The Ritz-Carlton to Moxy) Omni Fairmont Four Seasons and more. Day passes start at $25 per person.

This site works with many resorts right here in the U.S. including in California Florida Hawaii Arizona Texas and New York. If you sign up for its newsletter you'll be notified when new hotels are added.

Its list of overseas options was meager — just six Mexico resorts and eight in the Caribbean. So if you're looking for day passes beyond the U.S. one of the other options below will be a better fit for you.

Daycation: While Daycation's footprint is smaller than ResortPass it's got some nice options in the U.S. and beyond. Resort brands include Kimpton Fairmont COMO Marriott Hilton Park Hyatt and others. With Daycation you can purchase day passes as well as rent cabanas.

In the U.S. most of Daycation's resort day pass options are in Florida with more than a dozen options in the Miami Beach area. Some of the standout options in that area are the Tidal Cove Waterpark at the JW Marriott Miami Turnberry Resort & Spa ($65/day) and SLS South Beach (day passes starting at $40 per person or cabanas for up to six people starting at $375).

If you're outside the U.S. here are some of the standout offerings:

Bahamas: Breezes Bahamas Resort & Spa British Colonial Hilton Nassau and Warwick Paradise Island Bahamas.

Breezes Bahamas Resort & Spa British Colonial Hilton Nassau and Warwick Paradise Island Bahamas. Caribbean: Scrub Island Resort Spa & Marina Autograph Collection (British Virgin Islands) The Westin Punta Cana Resort & Club (Dominican Republic) Bay Gardens Beach Resort (St. Lucia) Eagle Aruba Resort & Casino and others.

Scrub Island Resort Spa & Marina Autograph Collection (British Virgin Islands) The Westin Punta Cana Resort & Club (Dominican Republic) Bay Gardens Beach Resort (St. Lucia) Eagle Aruba Resort & Casino and others. Costa Rica: Selina Manuel Antonio Selina Puerto Viejo Selina Santa Teresa and Selina La Fortuna.

Selina Manuel Antonio Selina Puerto Viejo Selina Santa Teresa and Selina La Fortuna. Mexico: Selina Cancun Lagoon Hz Selina Playa del Carmen Allegro Cozumel Melia Cozumel Golf and Occidental Cozumel.

DayPass: If you're looking to spend a day at an all-inclusive or luxury property DayPass may have what you're looking for though its inventory isn't very extensive.

It includes destinations such as Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the Middle East; Indonesia's Bali Thailand's Koh Samui and Singapore in Southeast Asia; Punta Cana and San Juan in the Caribbean; and Miami Beach and Port St. Lucie in Florida.

The day passes on offer are interesting though. Properties of note include the InterContinental Abu Dhabi (from AED 99 per day) the Hard Rock Hotel Tenerife (from 40 euros per day) and the Park Hyatt Siem Reap (from $30 per day).

Closer to home check out the all-inclusive day pass to the Club Med Sandpiper Bay in Port Saint Lucie Florida. It's $120 per person and includes lunch dinner and all the resort's amenities including four pools.

Resort for a Day: You need to be a cruise traveler to book a resort day pass from this company.

Its portfolio includes resorts in Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic Antigua Aruba Bahamas Barbados Bermuda Cabo San Lucas and Cozumel in Mexico Curacao Grand Cayman Grenada Hawaii Jamaica La Romana in the Dominican Republic Puerto Vallarta in Mexico San Juan in Puerto Rico St. Kitts St. Lucia St. Martin – and even a few resorts in Florida cruise ports like Fort Lauderdale and Miami.

While Resort for a Day usually sells Atlantis Aquaventure Waterpark passes day passes can currently be purchased in advance directly from the resort.

Day Passes: The sister site to Resort for a Day Day Passes is for non-cruise travelers but offers access to many of the same resorts.

Essentially serving the same destinations as Resort for a Day listed above Day Passes has some standout resorts including all-inclusive and adults-only options that will make for the perfect day in the sun. In Jamaica for example two Hyatt all-inclusive resorts are available Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara both starting at $132 per adult. In Bermuda the Elbow Beach Resort is available at $74 per person.

A real-world example in Miami

When TPG studied the lists of resort day passes that can be purchased across the above-mentioned services we were impressed. There are some terrific options for families that will allow them to punch above their weight class and use a day pass to gain access to some pretty cool resorts.

I was interested to see Tidal Cove Waterpark was available as a day pass from several of the companies we've talked about. Marriott spent millions renovating The JW Marriott Turnberry Resort & Spa and it added this incredible waterpark in the process. The kids' pool is 4000 square feet and there are seven waterslides a FlowRider surf simulator a meandering lazy river and 25 luxury cabanas. This could be the perfect way to spend a pre-cruise day if you're departing on a Disney Cruise Line Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise out of PortMiami. (Read a comparison of those three family-friendly cruise lines.)

ResortPass Daycation and the DayPass all offer day admission to Tidal Cove Waterpark though we noticed different pricing across the companies. ResortPass had certain dates starting at $55 per person for a Resort Membership Day Pass but that rate fluctuated between $125 and $250 for various weekends throughout 2021. DayPass and Daycation rates seem to also be between $125 and $250 any day of the week. Across the board kids under 3 are allowed in free and taxes and fees may differ across the companies.

JW Marriott own entry rates to the waterpark start at $55 for guests when access to the waterpark isn't already included in the room package.

This resort just unveiled the waterpark and there are some decent packages available to stay on site. However later in the year the per night cost creeps up. At that point you may be better off staying somewhere like the Holiday Inn Port of Miami – Downtown less than 2 miles from PortMiami from around $150–$170/night and then buying a pass to spend your pre-cruise day at the waterpark.

Call the Resort Directly

If you're traveling and want to book a day pass at a resort but it's not listed at any of the booking sites don't give up. Call the hotel directly and inquire about the availability of day passes. That approach has worked for my family in the past and it's also a great opportunity to negotiate for the hotel to throw in a day room if you're visiting during low season. It never hurts to ask.

Right now some resorts have capacity restrictions due to COVID-19 so you may need to call more than one resort to find one with availability on your preferred date.

Bottom Line

Depending on where you're traveling or how your family prefers to spend its vacation days a resort day pass may be a terrific solution. Day passes can also be a terrific way to sample a resort to determine if your crew would like to vacation there at some point in the future – or to simply have a great afternoon at the pool.

The lounge is located on the domestic pier of the Delhi IGI Airport.

American Express will amend policy for Platinum and Black Cardmembers effective December 24 2021

Till so far American Express permitted all their cardmembers Platinum and Centurion plus their supplementary cardmembers to bring along two guests to the lounge in Delhi apart from kids under 12 years of age.

American Express has now notified a change whereby guests will be no longer be admitted to the lounge free of charge effective December 2021. Here is an excerpt of a member communication sent out to Platinum and Centurion cardmembers:

While you and your Supplementary Cardmember have complimentary access beginning 24 December 2021 a fee of ₹2000 plus applicable taxes will be charged to your Card for your guest at our lounge in Terminal 3 at Indira Gandhi International Airport New Delhi.

This change takes away the complimentary lounge access for accompanying guests. This might be looked at differently by different people. For instance I have not flown out of Delhi with people this year especially those without their lounge credentials. So it does not affect me at all for now.

However others may look at it as a devaluation because they may frequently bring people to the lounge. Also in my various trips to the Delhi lounge I hardly spot people with a +1 or a +2. I do find that to be the case in the Mumbai American Express Lounge though.

With this change American Express is amending its policy to align with the global transition to their lounge access policy which was notified earlier in 2021 valid for 2023 and onwards. Here is the excerpt from the policy.

If you have not visited the American Express Lounge in Delhi here is a video about the lounge experience.

Bottomline

Complimentary guest lounge access for the American Express Platinum and Centurion Cardmembers’ guests will be withdrawn effective December 24 2021. Each guest trip will cost INR 2000 plus taxes (INR 2360) per head nett.

What do you make of the change to the guest lounge access policy at the American Express Lounge in Delhi?

Visa has complained to the U.S. government that India’s “informal and formal” promotion of domestic payments rival RuPay is hurting its business in the country. Visa reportedly raised concerns about a “level playing field” in India during meeting between U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai and company executives including CEO Alfred Kelly.

“Visa remains concerned about India’s informal and formal policies that appear to favour the business of National Payments Corporation of India” (NPCI) the non-profit that runs RuPay “over other domestic and foreign electronic payments companies” a memo sent by Visa said.

In its memo VISA cited Indian PM Narendra Modi’s “speech where he basically called on India to use RuPay as a show of service to the country” according to an email U.S. officials exchanged on the meeting’s readout.

Over the last few years Indian PM Narendra Modi has heavily promoted the homegrown RuPay cards. In a 2018 PM Modi had portrayed the use of RuPay as patriotic saying that since “everyone cannot go to the border to protect the country we can use RuPay card to serve the nation.” He had gone on to assert that the money which is generated by RuPay Card transactions was used for the development of the country.

Modi’s exhortations — and the fact that RuPay cards were issued to millions of new account holders under the Jan Dhan scheme — have made RuPay leapfrog over giants Mastercard and Visa in terms of users in India. RuPay now accounts for 63% of India’s 952 million debit and credit cards up from just 15% in 2017.

RuPay had been founded when NPCI which is owned by the RBI and a consortium of Indian banks had realized that 90% of credit and debit card transactions in India were domestic but were being served by two global companies in Mastercard and Visa. These companies charged high fees because they were the only ones with the proprietary technology — merchants in India can pay as much as 2.5% in fees during each transaction when payments are made through Mastercard and Visa cards. RuPay intended to create an alternative payments system that lowered fees and created an India-owned payments network.

Visa isn’t the only payments giant that seems spooked over RuPay’s rise — in 2018 Mastercard had similarly complained about Modi’s use of nationalistic sentiments to promote RuPay. But Modi might be well within his rights to promote a homegrown payments system — the money generated by RuPay does stay in India while the money generated by Visa and Mastercard helps in bulking up the balance sheets of these global giants. It’s also not unusual for the Prime Minister of India to promote a homegrown payments scheme that’s been initiated by the government; other constitutional officials have done it too — in 2014 the RuPay card had been formally dedicated to India by then-President Pranab Mukherjee.

But Visa and Mastercard seem to be clearly spooked by the gains in market share that RuPay has made over the last few years. After Coke and Pepsi Mastercard and Visa form the most prominent business duopolies with these two companies together accounting for a lion’s share of global transactions. That duopoly is being threatened in India — now a domestic competitor RuPay has a bigger share than Mastercard and Visa combined. Mastercard and Visa can either try to compete fairly or complain to the US government about how the Prime Minister is hurting their business by promoting a government-owned product. Mastercard and Visa at the moment clearly seem to be doing the latter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3RlbGVjb20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NlbnRyZS1vZi1leGNlbGxlbmNlLXRvLWRlYWwtd2l0aC1jeWJlci1zZWN1cml0eS10by1jb21lLXVwLWluLWd1d2FoYXRpLzg3OTQxODQ20gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vdGVsZWNvbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2NlbnRyZS1vZi1leGNlbGxlbmNlLXRvLWRlYWwtd2l0aC1jeWJlci1zZWN1cml0eS10by1jb21lLXVwLWluLWd1d2FoYXRpLzg3OTQxODQ2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Centre of excellence to deal with cyber security to come up in Guwahati,"Advt

India with its robust digital payments infrastructure no longer needs foreign players like Visa MasterCard or American Express which used to behave in a monopolistic manner.

The Indian government has asked the banks consumers and other stakeholders to issue and use RuPay cards.

In the last few years India has emerged as the undisputed global leader in digital payments. The number of monthly digital payments in India are greater than that of the next three – China United States United Kingdom – combined.

Given the fact India has a very robust digital payments infrastructure the country no longer needs foreign players like Visa MasterCard or American Express which used to behave in a monopolistic manner earlier. These card payment players not only charged hefty fees to consumers but also used to blackmail political establishments from time to time.

However with the establishment of digital payments infrastructure it is time for the Indian government to teach American MNCs a lesson and it is doing exactly that.

The RBI has already imposed several restrictions which pushed American Express out of the Indian market and stopped MasterCard from issuing new cards. Now Visa the only American player that is still issuing new cards has also started complaining about the Indian government prioritising RuPay cards.

Earlier Visa put a brave face about the competition from RuPay cards (issued by National Payments Corporation of India a PSU under Ministry of Finance) and said that the entry of a strong and technologically advanced public sector player does not hurt its business.

“That’s going to be something we’re going to continually deal with and have dealt with for years. So there’s nothing new there” said Alfred Kelly Visa executive.

But now it has been revealed that at the same time it was complaining with the United States Trade Representative (USTR) about the Indian government.

“Visa remains concerned about India’s informal and formal policies that appear to favour the business of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) the non-profit that runs RuPay over other domestic and foreign electronic payments companies” said a USTR memo prepared for Tai ahead of the meeting.

RuPay accounted for 63% of India’s 952 million debit and credit cards as of November 2020 according to the most recent regulatory data on the company up from just 15% in 2017.

However despite accounting for 63% of the market share in terms of number of cards RuPay still has a low share in number of transactions. Visa and Mastercard remain dominant players in the number of transactions.

The Indian government including Prime Minister Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman have asked the banks consumers and other stakeholders to issue and use RuPay cards. And this is not going well for RuPay and Mastercard which fear losing the Indian market altogether.

In the pre-Modi era international digital transaction players like Visa and MasterCard were involved in monopolistic practices as they were the sole players. They used to charge customers an outrageous processing fee and made card payments an elite practice. The Modi government launched the country’s own digital payments system and built infrastructure to encourage digital payments; today it is the world’s most successful payments infrastructure in the world.

Now foreign companies will also be taxed as per the tax laws of India. Till now these companies were out of the tax net of the country because they operated in India through offices in tax-haven countries like Singapore and stored the data in jurisdictions of the United States and Ireland.

Given the fact that these companies have ‘permanent establishment’ in the country which means a physical presence through data servers they will be taxed at 15% the tax rate for the companies which have invested in the country through their arms in countries like Singapore with which India has tax treaties.

The regulations imposed in the last few years and competition from Indian players is forcing the players which used to behave in monopolistic manner to indulge in ‘fair competition’."

They must not only win their game against Poland but also every match going forward if they are to retain the world cup title they won in 2016. Poland isn't the strongest opponent in the competition yet after a shock loss in their first match against France the Indian side will be looking to cover all bases before the tougher matches they face ahead.

Tougher route to the title

India's pre-tournament path to the title appeared to be a relatively straightforward one. Should they have topped their pool as was to be expected they would have faced - on paper at least -- a relatively easy match in the quarterfinal before a potentially tricky one against the Netherlands in the semifinals. An opening day loss against France has ruled that permutation out. Even if India beat Poland their only chance of topping the table lies in France losing to Canada - a relatively unlikely prospect. Should India finish in second place they will almost certainly face Belgium in a repeat of the 2016 final. ""We can't do anything about that now (defeat to France). If we have to win back-to-back titles we will have to beat every team henceforth. After losing to France it became clear to us that we need to win every match going forward to win back to back titles. It gave us a bit of clarity"" coach Graham Reid said.

Poland threat

Although Poland has a win against Canada the side (whose senior team is ranked 26th in the world) isn't expected to pose a serious threat on Saturday. While India racked up their second biggest win in the Junior World Cup (13-1) against Canada Poland only narrowly beat the Canadians 1-0. Moreover the Poles are coming off a comprehensive 7-1 defeat against France.

While India will face the prospect of a Belgium clash in the quarters the team isn't looking that far ahead. ""We will not like to think ahead of us we have a match against Poland before that and that's what we will be thinking about. We have to win that before we think about the next stage"" coach Reid was quoted as saying.

Better finishing

While India will expect to win their final match they would also wish to get things in order before the last eight stage. ""It is a learning experience for the boys. Every match is one experience. That's what I have always been telling the senior players as well"" Reid said. Despite conceding 5 goals against France India had enough opportunities themselves. They had their share of hard luck - shots twice ricocheted off the posts. There was also missed traps in taking penalty corners while also facing some excellent goal line defence from the opponents. Reid has made it clear he wants to improve on the team's finishing. ""We are creating enough opportunities. We need to work on the conversion rate"" he said

More game time

One reason for the team's lack of sharpness in their opening game was probably the lack of match practice they had - apart from games against the senior squad before the Olympics the junior team had not played a match for the last couple of years. Reid admitted this as well.

""We missed out on this learning phase for a couple of years due to the pandemic but it was good we learned quickly (following the match against France)"" he said. That lack of game sense resulted in basic errors that went on to cost the team heavily. ""It is hard to get coordination if the basics are not right. At the back we gave them (France) too many easy balls deep in our territory.""

While India were much improved against Canada Reid would want his side to get even sharper. Canada were not able to make the most of the breaks they got the squad will want to ensure Poland - and subsequently perhaps Belgium -- will not get even that opportunity either. ""We are a bit leaky at the back. We need to be stronger and get in front a little more. We were better against Canada. The best way to learn is to make mistakes. We learned from our loss to France"" Reid said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ydWdieXVuaW9uLzE2ODY5NzQ1L3NhbW9hLWhha2EtYmFyYmFyaWFucy1ydWdieS11bmlvbi1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvc3BvcnQvcnVnYnl1bmlvbi8xNjg2OTc0NS9zYW1vYS1oYWthLWJhcmJhcmlhbnMtcnVnYnktdW5pb24tY29yb25hdmlydXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch emotional Samoa team belt out national anthem and perform ‘haka’ despite match vs Barbarians AXED at...,"SAMOA players sang their national anthem in a near-empty Twickenham shortly after their match against the Barbarians was cancelled.

The rugby clash was axed 90 minutes before its scheduled kick-off due to Covid-19 as four players and two members of staff from the invitational side tested positive.

But that didn't stop the Manu Samoa from belting out their national anthem and performing their Siva Tau war dance which is similar to New Zealand's haka in what proved to be a very emotional scene at the ground.

Scotland back-row Ryan Wilson was set to captain a team which also consisted of South African stars Duane Vermeulen Malcolm Marx and Steven Kitshoff as well as Australians James O'Connor and Nic White.

PARIS: European champions Italy and Portugal could meet for a place at the 2022 World Cup after being drawn in the same playoff path on Friday. The Azzurri and Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal both finished second in their qualifying groups behind Switzerland and Serbia respectively. Italy will host North Macedonia in the playoff first round in March with Turkey visiting Portugal before the winners face off for a spot at next year's finals in Qatar. The draw means that one of the last two European Championship winners will not be at the next World Cup. Portugal won the Euro 2016 title.

The winners of Portugal's match with Turkey will host the final-round game in Path C. ""It's a very difficult draw for us"" said Italy coach Roberto Mancini. ""North Macedonia is a very good team and if we win we have to play away."" Italy -- who beat England on penalties in the Euro 2020 final earlier this year -- are hoping to banish the memories of their playoff heartache from four years ago when they lost to Sweden and failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958.

Portugal have featured at every major championship since missing out on the 1998 World Cup. They only narrowly missed out on automatic qualification when Aleksandar Mitrovic's late goal snatched a 2-1 win for Serbia in the two teams' last group match. Portugal coach Fernando Santos said all the focus now was ""to beat Turkey"".

""It's the important match to go through to the final and to win it. We now have to prepare well to be at a good level in March"" he said. ""Sometimes they (Turkey) play well other times not. They're a team that always present difficulties but I'm totally convinced that we'll be going to the World Cup."" Elsewhere in the playoffs British rivals Wales and Scotland could play each other in the final of Path A. Scotland will welcome Ukraine to Glasgow in their semi-final game. Wales take on Austria in Cardiff with the winners to have home advantage in the final. The Welsh are hoping to play in the global showpiece for the first time in 64 years while Scotland have not qualified since 1998.

""We've given ourselves a great opportunity"" said Wales manager Robert Page. ""It was in 1958 that we last qualified for the World Cup finals and through the playoffs again so the incentive is there for us. We worked ever so hard to get that runners-up position in the group and earn that home draw and we've had the luck of the draw that if we win that semi-final we will also be home for the final so there's everything to play for."" Russia face Poland in the Path B semi-finals with the winners to host Sweden or the Czech Republic. The Russians who reached the 2018 quarter-finals as the host nation have only ever lost one World Cup qualifier at home -- against Germany in 2009. - AFP"

As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee. The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ka3BpdHRzYnVyZ2hzcG9ydHMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvbG9nYW4tbGVlLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zaWduLXRoZWlyLXJvb2tpZS1jb250cmFjdHMtd2l0aC10aGUtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmZsLW5ld3MtY2Rj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Logan Lee Mason McCormick sign their rookie contracts with the Steelers,
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpZGVvcGVuY291bnRyeS5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLW1lbnUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Menu: 6 Things You Should Never Order,"Fast food restaurants are working hard to keep up with the growing number of fast-casual options out there so they introduce new combo meals dollar menus and menu items to attract customers. McDonald's menu has added new cold brew coffee drinks and limited edition donut sticks as well as making their Quarter Pounder burgers now with fresh beef instead of frozen patties.

How do you know when something on a fast food menu is worth ordering? (How many people actually order the yogurt parfait or ranch snack wrap?) Check to see if the crew that makes the food also eats it (you ever see a Mcdonald's employee on their break eating a sausage McMuffin with egg?). While the discount McDonald's employees get on their meals might encourage them to eat at the restaurant they don't have to eat everything on the McDonald's menu. There are some McDonald's menu items that employees say they never eat and you shouldn't either and we've got the reasons why.

1. No Fish

According to Business Insider who spoke to some McDonald's Drive thru employees the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is definitely a least favorite menu item especially set beside the Big Mac. Part of it is a matter of taste but other current and former employees have a problem with the freshness. Several Reddit commenters who said they were either current or former McDonald's employees noted that the fish sandwiches at their restaurants were so rarely ordered that they tend to sit around in a heated cabinet for a long time after being cooked. If you must order one their advice was to order it ""cooked to order.""

2. ""Healthy"" Items on the McDonald's Menu



Some of the so-called healthy options aren't necessarily all that healthy according to employees. Several employees mentioned the high-calorie count to Business Insider and a quick check of the chain's website backs that up.

Salads might seem like a healthier choice but as an example the Bacon Ranch Salad with Buttermilk Crispy Chicken has 490 calories. If that doesn't seem like a lot to you (especially when you're considering it an entire meal) then look at the rest of the nutritional information. It has 28 grams of fat 95 milligrams of cholesterol and 1120 milligrams of sodium (that's almost half the salt you should have in one day). Plus if you add a soft drink or chocolate chip cookie the calorie count can really add up. Sorry Crispy Chicken Salad it almost seems like a double quarter pounder with cheese and medium fries or even ice cream would be a better option.

If you do want a salad with your Big Mac instead of french fries get a plain side salad.

Other employees on a Reddit thread also noted that some food items like chicken salads aren't ordered much and so they also tend to sit around compared to hot menu items like a double cheeseburger or a bacon McDouble.

McDonald's restaurants also offer grilled chicken sandwiches but their Artisan Grilled Chicken still isn't really what you might consider ""healthy."" One employee noted that they used to be grilled in margarine; the chain has since started using clarified butter to grill the chicken. If you want a slightly healthier chicken sandwich skip the grilled one and go for the McChicken. The crispy chicken sandwich has fewer calories (400 vs 430) and less salt ( 560 vs 1040 mg).

And hopefully it goes without saying that apple slices are far and away the healthier option over the apple pie on the McDonald's menu even though we'd never tell you to skip the apple pie because it's great.

3. Sweet Drinks

https://www.instagram.com/p/BYgscUKFv6n/

You know the issues with drinking too much soda (just like you know that Coke tastes better at McDonald's) but sweet tea isn't really any better. A McDonald's medium sweet tea has 29 grams of sugar in it; the American Heart Association recommends no more than 25 grams of added sugar per day for women and 36 grams for men.

Even worse than the sweet tea is the caramel frappe where the smallest size still has 420 calories 18 grams of fat and 55 grams of sugar. A small hot chocolate has 430 calories 17 grams of fat and 52 grams of sugar; a small mocha has fewer calories (300) and less fat (10 grams) but still 42 grams of sugar. And while the fruit smoothies do come in at a much lower calorie count they still have 39 grams of sugar. At least when you order a McFlurry or sundae you're expecting a sugar-filled dessert. If you're going for a coffee drink get a latte instead. Or better yet a soft drink Fanta orange juice or Dasani to play it safe.

Other Reddit users say that they never order McCafé coffee drinks because the machines are often not cleaned well. Of course it varies from location to location but one employee's point was that the machines are difficult to clean and so they don't receive a lot of attention in many of the fast-food chain's locations.

4. Everyone Else's Favorite Sandwich

We know the McRib is a fan favorite partly because it's only around for a limited time. Anytime it shows up on the McDonald's menu people can't wait to dig in. But don't expect your local McDonald's employees to be as excited — some of them can't stand the appearance of the bbq sandwich saying: ""The way it looks before we put the sauce on it is absolutely revolting. It doesn't look like meat at all it looks like a scab.""

5. Chicken Nuggets

These little nuggets are a staple on the McDonald's menu and especially the happy meal menu. The chicken McNuggets have been all-white-meat since 2003 however people are still convinced that there's more to these chicken nuggets than what meets the eye. Or should I say meats the eye?

During an AskReddit session user Dfunkatron shared that when he worked at McDonald's and accidentally left a bag of frozen nuggets on the counter all day. When he checked back later the entire thing was a puddle of liquid. It didn't age gracefully like McDonald's collectibles.

6. McDonald's Breakfast Menu

Okay we're not saying don't ever order breakfast off the McDonald's menu because the all day breakfast menu is a good thing. However if you're keeping an eye out for more nutritious options avoid these breakfast items. The Big Breakfast with Hotcakes might work if it was your only meal of the day. Clocking in at 1340 calories this deluxe combo has hotcakes scrambled eggs a biscuit hash browns a sausage patty and no joke lists three kinds of butter as part of the dish. That's 64 grams of fat 2090 milligrams of sodium and 505 milligrams of cholesterol.

The egg McMuffin isn't that bad all things considered; it has the same amount of calories and less fat and sodium than the sausage burrito and few calories along with everything else than the bacon egg and cheese biscuit (or any of the biscuit or McGriddles sandwiches for that matter).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLXZlZ2FuLW1jcGxhbnQtYnVyZ2VyLWtpbmctcGxhbnQtYmFzZWQtd2hvcHBlci1jb21wYXJpc29uLTIwMjEtMTHSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL21jZG9uYWxkcy12ZWdhbi1tY3BsYW50LWJ1cmdlci1raW5nLXBsYW50LWJhc2VkLXdob3BwZXItY29tcGFyaXNvbi0yMDIxLTExP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's vegan McPlant Burger King plant-based Whopper: comparison,"The first thing that struck me was the difference in size.

Beloved Wife Mother and “Nani” Carol Jean McDonald who lived and worked alongside her soulmate husband (dad) and love of her life passed away peacefully November 27th after a long battle with complications from rheumatoid arthritis. She passed in the company of her family at their ranch and was one month shy of 90.

Our “Christmas Carol” was born December 25th to Albert Eugene Jacobsen and Lillian Isabel Juhlin in Salt Lake City in 1931. Even as a little girl her exuberant fun loving personality won her a spot on the “Major Bowes Amateur Hour” to dance with Shirley Temple. However she developed whooping cough and had to forfeit to the actress we know as “Josephine the Plummer” (Jane Withers). That didn’t stop her from dancing and entertaining when her father would show off his darling daughter who loved to make others happy.

Love was a main theme of her existence in every way and this was reflected in the physical beauty that she kept up to the very end. “Let’s be happy!” and “It’s all about family” were mantras with her. Even her Christmas birth date reflects the gift that she was to others and to this world bringing her own kind of bubbly cheerfulness and undeviating optimism as a gift to the world. The words on the tombstone of her daughter Marji who died in an airplane crash in 1978 are the same we could easily put on our mother Carol’s tombstone: “Our Sunshine”. She was that to all of us and especially to her beloved husband and eternal companion whom she called “Dickie” most the time and “Richard” when she gently corrected him or when he was teasing her. She fell for dad junior year at East High School in Salt Lake City listening to him play the piano during lunch hour and staring at the back of his head in U. S. History finally asking him to Sadie Hawkins and the rest is a sort of Romeo and Juliet story with a happy ending. Despite being married for 70 years anyone who would swear they were newlyweds❤️

During the following years mom and dad raised five daughters in Logan Utah where she was a devoted stay at home mom. In 1969 the family moved to Flagstaff Arizona where they resided for 4 years and then on the Mesa Arizona where mom earned her Real Estate license and with her extroverted and sincere personality became a Million Dollar Seller for Tom Fannin Realty.

In 1990 dad brought her to the Black Hills (where he has abundant ancestral and family history) and bought a business and property and since then she supported her man in turning those few purchases into 4 successful downtown Keystone buildings that they rent to businesses and a 50 acre ranch with three restored Bed and Breakfast rental cabins known as McDonald Mountain Ranch. Mom was always the perfect help mate in whatever our dad chose to do. She believed and trusted in him with all her heart and was a wonderful example to all of her family and friends of true unconditional love.

Her glass was always half full she had empathy forgiveness and cheerfulness to spare. She was an active life long member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and to her last moments would pray often for us speaking to Heavenly Father as a deep personal friend.

She is survived by her husband Richard McDonald and four daughters: Jini Hyde Linda Hite Marianne (Norm) Smith and Barbi (Craig) McLaws as well as 15 grandchildren and 31 great-grandchildren. We love you mom and will miss you with all our hearts but know we will be together for eternity❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

If a Big Mac costs more in America but the Danish burger-flipper earns significantly more where is the money going? Armchair economists will offer varying answers to this question but it is worth noting that the pay ratio of CEOs to unskilled workers is 48/1 in Denmark — as in CEOs there make 48 times more money than the ""average worker"" — while here it's a whopping 354/1 (via Washington Post).

Those prolific social media experts offer all kinds of responses to this kind of data. One response to Junker's tweet called out the Danish tax rate asserting that employees often pay 40%-50% in taxes. What they get in return for their tax money is a different story — Denmark is often recognized as the world's happiest country per Visit Denmark.

Plus at their McDonalds locales Danish people can treat themselves to a Homestyle Pickled Red Onion Big Mac or a Homestyle Bearnaise sandwich created by a Michelin-starred chef (via Street Food Guy and Eat This Not That!). Is this why they're all so happy? Or could it have something to do with ""Janteloven"" a concept seen as integral to their mentality and culture which basically posits that no one is better than another everyone is equal and accepted? Perhaps being adequately compensated for their work has something to do with it? Go figure."

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Financial details and the exact terms of the deal were not disclosed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvbWVyY2stbXJrLWVhcm5pbmdzLXExLTIwMjQuaHRtbNIBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDI0LzA0LzI1L21lcmNrLW1yay1lYXJuaW5ncy1xMS0yMDI0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck beats earnings expectations raises outlook on strong Keytruda and vaccine sales,"The exterior view of the entrance to Merck headquarters in Rahway New Jersey on Feb. 5 2024.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand.

But they could be key players in the metaverse.

Metaverse millionaire has a nice ring to it doesn't it? There probably will be some investors who become millionaires if the metaverse delivers on its potential.

Several metaverse stocks are receiving the most attention right now. Obviously Meta Platforms (META 0.16%) formerly known as Facebook could be a huge winner. The company is pouring billions of dollars into its development efforts. Nvidia Unity Software and Roblox also are staking their claims to the metaverse.

But there are some less-prominent companies that could be big winners. Here are two under-the-radar metaverse stocks that could make you a fortune.

1. Matterport

Some envision the metaverse as a giant video game. However a better way to think of it is as a new 3D virtual world that seems as real as the physical world. Matterport (MTTR -1.56%) stands out as one company that's helping to bring the physical world into the metaverse.

Matterport's technology enables the creation of ""digital twins"" of physical spaces. Homes apartments offices boats and more can be virtually replicated. So far Matterport has 6.2 million spaces under management -- more than 100 times the rest of the market combined.

There are lots of applications for digital twins. Potential homeowners can take 3D tours of the houses they're considering. Designers can import digital twins into computer-aided design software to improve efficiency in building information modeling. Insurers can process claims faster with 3D models of property damage. And those use cases represent just the tip of the iceberg.

Matterport estimates that its total addressable market tops $240 billion by focusing on these kinds of applications. But the company's opportunity could be even bigger than that by moving the physical world into the metaverse.

It's already partnering with Meta Platforms in making 1000 digital twins available in a dataset for academic non-commercial uses. This data set is being used by researchers to teach robots and artificial-intelligence systems how to interact with the physical world.

Matterport's technology could be key in uploading real-world buildings into the metaverse. With Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisioning the ability to teleport anywhere in the metaverse bringing the physical world into the metaverse seems to be important to his company's efforts.

Although Matterport stock has more than doubled this year the company's market cap is still around $6 billion. Even without the potential for the metaverse Matterport should have plenty of room to run. But with the metaverse this stock could be a really huge winner.

2. Immersion

Investors haven't fared so well with Immersion (IMMR 2.72%). The tech stock has lost nearly half of its value so far this year. But the metaverse could present a tremendous opportunity.

The company is a pioneer in the development of haptic technology which provides touch feedback to users. It holds more than 1700 issued or pending patents for its haptic technology.

Immersion's business model is to license its technology to manufacturers. Customers include automotive suppliers gaming-device makers and mobile-device makers. Apple Bosch Google Nintendo Samsung Sony and many other companies use Immersion's haptic systems.

Haptic technology will likely be in high demand as the metaverse takes off within the next few years. There are other companies including Meta Platforms that will be major players in meeting that demand. However Immersion's haptic expertise and broad intellectual property portfolio could give it a key advantage.

The company's market cap is only around $200 million. Immersion could grow much larger if the rise of the metaverse serves as a major catalyst for haptic-technology licensing sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFncmFtLXN1Y2tzLWJlY2F1c2UtaXRzLWJlY29taW5nLWEtc3VwZXItYXBw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta Facebook Instagram and the metaverse: super apps suck,"Instagram is becoming a one-stop-shop for all of your social media needs. And it sucks.

On the app everyone can share links . You can go shopping . Influencers can create their own online stores  and more. With the help of Facebook's newly rebranded Meta  Instagram is well on its way to becoming a super app — basically one app in which you can do practically anything. It's a digital ecosystem all on its own a place where you can go shopping and order a car and message your friends and set up doctor appointments. You don't need to have any other app on your phone.

There are plenty of good reasons users might be attracted to a super app. It's convenient everything is in one place and the user experience is simple as you don't have to learn to navigate multiple different platforms.

But as Instagram adds more and more tools it becomes less and less useful. Scrolling through Instagram in the hope of finding a post from someone you actually know is like looking for a designer shirt in your size in the bargain bin during a semi-annual sale — you might find it but it won't be easy. That's because the platform is now crammed with shopping ads and sponsored posts designed to turn Instagram into an ecommerce site on top of a social media platform. And when you aren't inundated with products for sale recommended posts fill up your feed in what appears to be a sad attempt of Pinterest inspiration that might keep users tied to their screens. Instead it's bothersome and frustrating. Posting on your grid has become secondary to posting on your stories. Shopping is more attractive than connecting. They launched reels which is just a less fun ripoff of TikTok . And the messaging system simply isn't that good. Instagram is starting to suck because it's following the steps of a super app. It turns out a place for everything feels very much like a place for nothing.

A place for everything feels very much like a place for nothing.

The lack of competitiveness within an app ecosystem can cause platforms to have less of a drive to be actually good. Usually when you don't like an app you can leave it for another platform. When Facebook got lame users left it for Snapchat and Instagram. As Instagram started becoming less fun to some users they left the app for TikTok. But where do you go when you want to escape the one app that is necessary to do everything online? When there is smaller app to app competition because one app does it all there's less of a driving force for the developers to create something good.

""The extreme example is WeChat"" Kaniyet Rayev the CEO of Appboxo a startup that helps companies create mini-apps inside their apps. ""Right now there are 2 million mini-apps that are accessible in WeChat. Just to put that in comparison I think the Apple app store has like 3 million apps. So they have two-thirds of that accessible in one app basically.""

WeChat is based out of China which has a sort of political ecosystem that makes it easier for a super app to thrive than say in the U.S. where there are some regulations that work to ensure a free market. But according to Business Insider  there's a list of Western companies like PayPal that are using WeChat's framework to create their own mini-ecosystem.

But entrusting our entire digital life to one company might not be a smart idea — for our mental health our privacy or our general enjoyment.

""I think in general Facebook unfortunately — as born out in the Facebook papers and documented by their own researchers — is willing to make tremendous sacrifices on as far as societal costs in order to maximize their own profits"" Jesse Lehrich the co-founder of Accountable Tech  a ​​nonprofit working to reform social media in an effort to foster a healthier democracy told Mashable. ""And so I think in general super apps are somewhat concerning because the whole point of a super app is that they're for-profit companies trying to get users to never leave their ecosystem. That's generally somewhat concerning but is especially concerning when you have a company that has a 15-year record of putting its own profits before democracy and before the safety and wellbeing of minority communities.""

Is this the future we want? Credit: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images

This comes in the middle of an intense time for the platform. In September the Wall Street Journal began publishing a series of reports called ""The Facebook Files "" based largely upon leaked internal Facebook documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen. We learned that Facebook knew Instagram was harmful to the health of young people  and didn't share that information with the public. Haugen testified in front of the Senate just days before the platform was shut down for nearly six hours when an update to Facebook's routers went awry . Since then more documents called the "" Facebook Papers "" have been leaked which show a continued disregard for the health of Facebook's users.

In the days following this CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the companies' plan to build and lead its version of the metaverse : a massive interconnected set of experiences in a new online world. No one company will own this metaverse but it appears to be Zuckerberg's prerogative to ensure that Facebook or Meta will lead the space. And having one super app certainly aligns with that goal. But after the past few months of revelations allowing Zuckerberg and Meta to hold even more power over our digital lives isn't exactly what we want.

How do you hold a company accountable when it is the only one people use?

Rayev says much of that responsibility falls upon governmental regulations on everything from antitrust laws to privacy protections. But as Lehrich says that is ""incumbent upon Congress to stop being Congress and start actually doing things.""

Let's be clear: Instagram is not yet a super app especially not in comparison to WeChat. And one of the more glaring differences is in its bones: It's simply built differently.

""Facebook and Instagram right now they build each vertical in-house and then they just get suppliers of content to it"" Rayev said. ""With ecommerce they build their own ecommerce capability but then you can't redesign the experience. Whereas the mini-app experience is slightly different where you can build the way you want it and then deploy it within the app.""

They're years off from that if it's even what they move towards. But as Zuckerberg announced at Facebook's Connect event they've got all eyes on the future. He said he wants Facebook to be seen as ""a metaverse company.""

""As they move toward this new fangled internet that they conceive of — the metaverse — it seems like a pretty clear play to build that infrastructure and architecture and to follow the playbook of the super app"" Lehrich said.

And that playbook is making social media worse for us all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3JhbHRlY2h3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExLzI3L2RlbXlzdGlmaWVzLXRoZS1ndXQtcnRwLWJpb3RlY2gtbWV0YWJvbG9uLXVudmVpbHMtbmV3LW1ldGFib2xvbWUtcGxhdGZvcm0v0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly93cmFsdGVjaHdpcmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjcvZGVteXN0aWZpZXMtdGhlLWd1dC1ydHAtYmlvdGVjaC1tZXRhYm9sb24tdW52ZWlscy1uZXctbWV0YWJvbG9tZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Demystifies’ the gut: RTP biotech Metabolon unveils new metabolome platform,"RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK – Metabolon a Research Triangle Park precision medicine company has unveiled a new platform and tool to help visualize the metabolome.

The metabolome refers to the complete set of small-molecule chemicals found within a biological sample.

Metabolon’s Microbiome SmartPanel the company said “demystifies” the gut microbiome by zeroing in on biologically relevant microbial and host-derived metabolites along with xenobiotic molecules to reveal

“deep insight” into microbiome function and its impact on host health.

Meanwhile its proprietary Heliogram visualization tool allows users to explore 13 microbiome pathways for rapid connectivity to the impact of therapeutic interventions on the host microbiome.

“Metabolomics is an untapped under-appreciated biological resource” said Rangaprasad (Ranga) Sarangarajan Ph.D. Metabolon’s chief scientific officer.

“It can significantly contribute to the evolution of healthcare system technologies because the insights revealed influence almost every aspect of health treatment of diseases and health outcomes.”

Founded in 2000 Metabolon specializes in a technology called metabolomics which is the large-scale study of small molecules commonly known as metabolites within cells biofluids tissues or organisms.

The company said it plans to unveil additional SmartPanel offerings in the coming months.

In addition the company is developing novel methods for a number of targeted assays which can be validated up to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements if needed.

“This is the beginning of a robust portfolio of new dynamic and easy-to-understand metabolomics solutions” said Rohan Hastie Ph.D. Metabolon’s president and CEO.

“Our belief is that by making metabolomics solutions more accessible for use by the broader market we can make it possible for more drug developers to leverage the power of metabolomics to develop new therapies to improve patient care.”

In September 2020 Metabolon wrapped up a new round of fundraising with $72 million in debt and equity.

Investors in the $72 million round include Perceptive Advisors EW Healthcare Partners and other previous investors.

UNLV and one of the area’s biggest employers are partnering on a job training program to help former foster youth overcome the long odds of their circumstances.

The MGM Resorts Public Policy Institute at UNLV’s Greenspun College of Urban Affairs is behind the Foster Youth Initiative which is gearing up to help recently aged-out foster care kids get interpersonal and financial stability after they stop being wards of the state at 18 — an age when many young people in conventional homes are still in high school or living with their parents.

About 4300 children are in foster care in Nevada. About 3000 of them are in Clark County. It’s a large group that doesn’t get much support but needs it said Robert Ulmer the Greenspun College dean.

“The outcomes for foster youth are really challenging” Ulmer said. “Twenty percent will be homeless by 18 a quarter suffer from PTSD or will a quarter won’t graduate from high school half will be unemployed by 24 and only 3% will get a college degree.”

They help the participants describe their life experiences as an asset and how to design a stable adult life drawing on their adaptability. Half a dozen young people went through the first cohort this fall and another 15-20 will start up in January. Future groups could be the ones to land jobs at an MGM Resorts International property.

Robert Nailen learned about the initiative through a county social worker who helps aged-out foster kids transition to adulthood.

Nailen the eldest of five and a Centennial High School graduate said his mother was just too immature to be a parent and he was in and out of “the system.” He was close to 18 when he last went into foster care and chose to ride it out rather than go back to his mom.

He is now 21 and as introspective as a man with a couple more decades of life experience.

He said he learned about corporate culture and the importance of professional presentation — but also that high-ranking executives are just regular people. “That’s something big” he said.

Wanda Smith-Gispert vice president of workforce development for MGM said the company has the resources to prevent people from falling through the cracks in Las Vegas.

An entry-level part-time job with MGM offers perks that can help young people with limited resources hold onto a job she said: things like free food employee locker rooms and showers and a clean uniform every day. After six months MGM will help pay college tuition.

A young adult still in their teens or just hitting their 20s might start at a gift shop arcade or quick-serve restaurant or in a behind-the-scenes role like the dry cleaning and tailoring operation that takes care of employee uniforms but every job has a pathway within the organization or industry Smith-Gispert said.

She refers to herself as an example — she did entry-level front desk housekeeping and dishwashing jobs for other hospitality companies before coming to MGM and climbing the human resources ladder.

MGM doesn’t guarantee every program participant a job but Smith-Gispert feels confident the program can prepare them for some kind of hospitality work.

Ulmer said Clark County Family Services identifies candidates for the program. Once at UNLV program officials help them set up a profile on LinkedIn take professional headshots and polish their interview skills.

“Our job is to get them thinking about a future that is optimistic that has opportunities for them. We know that for foster youth the No. 1 predictor of their success is their ability to develop and maintain relationships” he said. “We’re working with them on interpersonal skills managing conflict but also building their employment skills.”

Smith-Gispert said foster youth have a fundamental work ethic that stems from their challenging childhoods. A high school or college student with a more stable family life might take a part-time job for pocket money. A foster youth knows their job is to keep their head above water and will take work seriously as an opportunity for self-sufficiency and self-improvement.

“They come to work like their life depends on it and it does” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtY29sdW1ucy9rYXRzL2dhcnJldHQtaGFzLWEtbmV3LW1nbS1sb2NhdGlvbi1hbmQteW91LWNhbi1zZXQtaXQtdG8tbXVzaWMtMjQ4Njk4Mi_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWNvbHVtbnMva2F0cy9nYXJyZXR0LWhhcy1hLW5ldy1tZ20tbG9jYXRpb24tYW5kLXlvdS1jYW4tc2V0LWl0LXRvLW11c2ljLTI0ODY5ODIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garrett has a new MGM location and you can set it to music,"Brad Garrett’s new room seats about 210 for comed and he can pack about 85 ticket-holders into the lounge at the entrance.

Brad Garrett is seated in a VIP booth in his MGM Grand comedy club. The stage is maybe 20 feet away close enough to envision how imposing the 6-foot-8 inch comic will be when he tears into his act. The familiar “BG” logo ripples along the new black velvet curtain.

Garrett is not making jokes at the moment. Sounding like a grizzled Las Vegas bingo caller he’s shouting out numbers. “Try 20! Go to 25! Now 30!” This is the percentage of available light to set the mood for the audience’s walk-in the way Garrett will set the stage for his new stage.

Clearly Garrett is involved in every dang detail from the position of the art around the room most of them paintings his favorite artist Steve Altman. The tables chairs and booths are all his concepts. To borrow a line from the man for whom he once opened Frank Sinatra “We even picked out the furniture.”

All this activity is to meet the deadline for the reopening of Brad Garrett’s Comedy Club this weekend with Garrett hosting a show with headliner Butch Bradley and featuring Trixx both Vegas vets. Showtimes in the new place are 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.

Pedestrian location

Garrett’s new comedy haunt is on some choice real estate on the MGM Grand’s casino level along restaurant row and on the walk to the Grand Garden Arena. The club has taken over former China Tang space across from Tom Colicchio’s Craftsteak and Emeril’s New Orleans Fish House. Garrett has hauled out of his Underground space where he operated for nearly a decade after opening in March 2012 (after two years running what is now Laugh Factory at the Trop).

When China Tang closed in February 2020 opportunity knocked (or called) for Garrett.

“MGM called and they said ‘Do you have Ray’s number?’” Garrett jokes referring to the “Everybody Loves Raymond” sitcom star and good friend Ray Romano. “I said ‘No but I’m working his gift shop how can I help you?’”

By partnering in the just-vacant space. Garrett’s new room seats about 210 for comedy roughly 40 fewer than the underground locale. But he can pack about 85 ticket holders into the lounge at the entrance where vintage Vegas performers George Bugatti Laura Shaffer Wes Winters Vanessa LeGrand Doug Taylor and Trey Ordaz will perform before the funny starts.

“It’s completely that iconic type of room you know?” Garrett says. “In order to have that music room I had to keep the seating down in the comedy room. It’s exactly what I wanted to do.”

Garrett has business challenges of course. Fewer seats means an emphasis on selling the room even when Garrett is not performing. Garrett plans to bump the numbers by appearing monthly himself. “We think we’ll get a lot more walk-in business just because of our location” he says.

No ‘woke’ here

There is too the issue of Garrett’s material. He claims “I don’t have an act” but the comic is famous for eviscerating any cultural demographic. Insult comedy is also classic Vegas as Don Rickles ascended from Sahara’s Casbar Lounge by destroying audiences in the 1960s. But today’s comics are aware that audiences can recoil at Garrett’s flavor of stereotypical humor.

“I’m not very woke. I just go for the funny” Garrett says. “But I’ve got to be honest. A lot of people after COVID were asking ‘What are you going to do?’ I said ‘It’s what I’ve done my whole life.’ Now we might be in a climate where people in society think it’s this or that but that’s the act I’ve done my whole life. That’s been my style.”

Garrett has also made the tough calls as a club operator. He’s requiring his crew to be vaccinated for COVID. He’s vaccinated (with the booster) himself. And the incoming comics need to be vaxed or they won’t be booked. That policy has led to Garrett’s original New Year’s Eve headliner anti-vaccination crusader Rob Schneider being taken off the schedule. This even as Garrett says “I am a huge fan” of Schneider’s act.

“You have to have and I just have to use this word respect for other people” Garrett says. “It’s not just about me. I’m meeting families. I’m meeting people’s children. I’m around thousands of people a week. Yeah I would feel terrible if I did something harmful to them. I’m not preaching here. It’s just how do we keep everyone safe? You’ve got to be vaxed.”

Ring in the new club

Garrett is a married gentleman today. He and IsaBeall Quella were married on Nov. 11 (as in 11-11 make a wish) in Santa Barbara. The couple have been together for 13 years and had four other wedding dates and sites undercut.

“It was the fifth attempt we had the fires cancel us in Malibu then the mudslides after the fire took out the next venue” Garrett says. “She kept using excuses like ‘The Beatles broke up I’m just not myself.’ That was kind of a red flag.”

But he does shoot straight when talking about his life now as a Vegas headliner and club operator.

“You know I’m not the best when it comes to relationships” Garrett says. “But boy — I know this sounds corny but my goodness it’s just amazing. You just know when it’s right.”

Las Vegas’ past success in hosting the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo won’t skip a beat when the event commonly referred to as the Super Bowl of Rodeo gallops into town this week.

While dozens of conferences and events have cautiously predicted smaller turnouts than usual because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of international traffic operators of NFR say the 10-day rodeo event starting Thursday will be stronger than ever.

“The entire rodeo community is excited to be back in Vegas” said Tom Glause the new CEO of the Colorado Springs Colorado-based Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association sponsors of NFR. “Everybody I talk to is ecstatic to be back.”

How ecstatic?

This year’s rodeo at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center has been sold out since March. The city’s resorts are charging room rates well above the normal average. While the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has no estimate of the economic impact of this year’s rodeo every indication is that it will meet or surpass the 2019 level estimated at $175.8 million.

“We have anxiously awaited the return of the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo and welcoming back their loyal rodeo fans” said Steve Hill president and CEO of the LVCVA. “Las Vegas resorts and attractions continue to outdo themselves in transforming the destination into the ultimate country western destination with A-list entertainment and nonstop ‘Only-Vegas’ experiences.

“NFR returning to Las Vegas also serves as a vital December economic boon for our community and another important step in our recovery efforts.”

The 2021 version of NFR comes a year after the event was moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2020.

The reason for the change of venue was because Nevada had imposed a COVID-19 social-distancing mandate that made it impossible to sell as many tickets to the performances in the 15000-seat arena. Because ticket sales fund the more than $10 million prize pool for winning cowboys the PRCA and Las Vegas had to come up with an alternative plan.

One stop in Texas

The solution was to move the event for one year to Texas which had no social-distancing requirements and the rodeo was staged at Globe Life Field the home of the Texas Rangers baseball team. Las Vegas Events wrangled a one-year extension of NFR’s contract as part of the deal. It’s now scheduled in Las Vegas through 2025 and talks are underway to add more years.

“It was painful to sit on the sidelines for two years” said Pat Christenson president of Las Vegas Events the special event-sponsoring arm of the LVCVA.

But from the moment the agreement was reached to allow Dallas-Fort Worth to stage the rodeo in 2020 local sponsors went to work preparing for 2021.

Christenson said regular Zoom calls were made among more than 25 resort partners to prepare for this year. The biggest change between this year and a year ago is that the social-distancing mandate has been lifted. But fans attending the rodeo will be required to wear masks. There won’t be any requirements for attendees to prove they’ve been vaccinated for COVID-19.

The pent-up demand will make for more people coming to Las Vegas than in past rodeos Christenson said.

Demand continues to grow

“The demand has already been growing every year” he said. “About 97 percent of our season ticket holders renewed. There are two to three times more fans wanting tickets than tickets available. We have a waiting list of at least 10000 and most of them are wanting up to four tickets each.”

Christenson said the rodeo database grew from around 15000 to 20000 a decade ago to 150000 now. He said more than 1 million fans are following NFR on social media and through word of mouth.

The success of NFR can be traced to three things Christenson said.

Ninety-five contestants will be vying for a championship gold buckle and $10 million in prize money in a well-orchestrated synchronized show at the Thomas & Mack Center. The resorts have created a custom festival experience across the valley. Finally the marketing machine of Las Vegas Events the LVCVA and the PRCA — done inexpensively through social media and websites — keeps fans interested through the rodeo season leading up to NFR.

Template for other events

The NFR formula is so successful that it’s being used as a template for other major events in Las Vegas. Now that resorts are familiar with the process they too can lay out related events for attractions such as the Las Vegas Bowl and next year’s NFL Draft.

Christenson said resorts have always been a part of the rodeo’s success but it was near the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008 that resort properties supercharged their efforts.

They began adding their own events to tie in with the rodeo arranging for special appearances by competitors hosting viewer parties of the rodeo and filling their showrooms and entertainment venues with country acts.

Many resorts modify their personas during NFR. Mandalay Bay becomes “Cowboyville”; the MGM Grand hosts the “Gold Buckle Zone”; Resorts World Las Vegas is “Rodeo World”; and the Westgate is the host hotel for Cowboy Christmas a gift show with 350 exhibitors that kicks off Wednesday.

Most of the properties say they specialize in hosting participants of specific rodeo events. Most resorts offer free transportation to and from the Thomas & Mack Center for rodeo performances.

The viewer parties have expanded over time. Properties once took the live feed directly from the rodeo and just put it on screens throughout their casinos. Now they have organized watch parties that often draw up to 1000 people to view the direct rodeo feed.

Country acts dominate the Strip during the rodeo. The LVCVA listed 73 different country performers in town during NFR. Some of the big names: George Strait at T-Mobile Arena Dec. 3-4; Shania Twain at Planet Hollywood’s Zappos Theater Dec. 2 4-5 9 and 11-12; Jason Aldean at Dolby Live at Park MGM Dec. 9-11; and Reba Brooks & Dunn at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace Dec. 1 3-4 7-8 10-11 and 14-15.

Higher room rates

Resorts are taking advantage of supply and demand for hotel rooms particularly on weekends when the rodeo crowd will be competing with the typical Southern California crowd. A recent survey of room rates on hotels.com indicated an average rate of $384 a night among 18 properties. High-end Resorts World’s Conrad rooms were going for $3149 a night and the least expensive available room was at North Las Vegas’ Cannery at $89.

The midweek prices were closer to normal averaging around $200.

The resorts take advantage of the range of prices promoting it as “NFR-Stay Your Way.”

With each hotel having their own niche markets to appeal to Las Vegas becomes a citywide rodeo festival grounds.

“The hotels are fully vested in going out and doing unique events that get people to book there but collectively it becomes this festival that’s not just about the NFR” Christenson said.

Each property capitalizes on a joint marketing effort on NFR360.com. Christenson said a series of videos explaining what is offered at the rodeo and behind-the-scenes looks at what it takes to produce the event are housed on the website.

Livestock stars

One video shares what some of the stars of the rodeo — the livestock — eat. Some 580 animals have begun being penned on the UNLV campus. Before the rodeo ends they will eat 60 tons of grain 120 tons of hay and 70 tons of grass.

A new partnership with the Cowboy Channel which has become the title sponsor for Cowboy Christmas provides rodeo fans with information throughout the rodeo season. The PRCA formerly worked with NBC which would broadcast six to eight big rodeos. The Cowboy Channel not only broadcasts twice as many rodeos but it also livestreams other smaller rodeos — up to six a week — through its app. All of the digital content promotes NFR as the championship event.

Christenson and Glause believe the future of NFR for Las Vegas is bright and there’s virtually no chance of the event moving back to Texas.

“The thing Texas has going for them is that it’s Texas and there are a lot of people from Texas that think that’s the only place the rodeo should be” Christenson said. “The only rationale is ‘It’s Texas.’ It’s about local pride for the state. The reality is no one is going to top the experience of going to the NFR in Vegas. They (Texas) don’t have the infrastructure they don’t have the expertise and they don’t have the same commitment to the visitors that we have here. Texas is about ranching and cowboys but Texas isn’t Vegas for an event.”

Expensive in Texas

Christenson said the cost of attending the rodeo in Dallas-Fort Worth last year was around twice as much as in Las Vegas when including hotel rooms ticket prices transportation and parking.

Glause a former saddle bronc rider on the PRCA circuit who served as state insurance commissioner in Wyoming believes the rodeo will remain stronger than ever in Las Vegas.

“Texas was a great option under the circumstances we faced” Glause said. “We were thankful that we had a venue to crown our champions. NFR is one of the most coveted tickets in the sports world. So we’ve started negotiations and we will continue our negotiations and I think it’s everybody’s hope that we can continue our partnership with (Las Vegas Events) and the LVCVA to have the NFR in Las Vegas.”

With Covid-19 rearing its ugly head and wreaking havoc much of the world shut down - but Coronavirus isn't the only reason for the issues that followed.

Poor planning was a major factor as was competition between specific industries for the attention of the chip manufacturers and even natural disasters had a role to play - in short the global chip shortage is even more complex than you might imagine.

Primary factors

Looking back it's impossible to point to one or two reasons for the chip shortage as it was a whirlwind of problems coming together at the wrong time.

But to begin with there was a lack of incentive for silicon chip producers to build enough foundries to satisfy automakers and others says Mario Morales Program Vice President of the semiconductor group at analyst firm IDC. Morales claims nobody is investing in ”legacy technology” which although dated still plays a major role in many industries.

During the pandemic original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the automotive sector “canceled orders from a lot of the supply chain” he explained. “So a lot of disgruntled suppliers found other markets that were still doing well despite the pandemic.”

But the problems can be traced further back. In the fall of 2018 for example the United States placed trade sanctions on China. This led to Huawei one of the biggest smartphone makers in China placing huge orders for chips before these sanctions were implemented. Apple and others followed suit in a bid not to be left behind - and then the pandemic took hold.

It’s no surprise that the pandemic lockdowns had a role in the silicon shortage but it also affected other areas. Pretty much anything that has a battery or plugs into a wall uses chip-based technology.

For example the demand for cloud computing services went through the roof as many consumers started purchasing products they typically wouldn’t need to work from home – with many businesses doing the same.

Smartphones remain the most popular electronic commodity in the world so demand remained high and crypto enthusiasts and entrepreneurs snatched up graphics processing units (GPUs).

What other factors contributed to the global chip shortage?

A number of other underlying factors also contributed to the chip shortage with the complexity of items such as semiconductors also a significant factor.

According to Craig Barrett former boss at Intel the company’s microprocessors are the most complicated devices ever made by man. The process is so delicate that the rooms where semiconductors are built are cleaner than hospital operating rooms. In an operating room they allow 10000 particles of air pollution for one cubic meter of air. In a room where a semiconductor is built they only allow 10 for every cubic meter.

So making silicon chips isn’t easy but the people who do it are talented and backed by excellent resources. So what’s the real problem?

Whether it’s easy or hard to build a semiconductor the fact is the process takes billions of dollars and a lot of time. And if you’re off by a fraction in the process you’ll most likely lose out to another manufacturer.

Making a chip from start to finish takes about three months and involves million-dollar machines. There are also molten metal and lasers involved as you’re taking a silicon wafer and turning it into a transistor to power your computer smartphone or other smart device.

Finally multiple factors outside of the semiconductor industry’s control also played a part. Power outages in Texas where the majority of the United States’ chip manufacturing is done and drought in Taiwan also contributed to the shortage.

The world’s largest chip manufacturer TSMC also had to cut back its water usage (fundamental to the production of chips) due to government orders. Taiwan makes up over 60% of the world’s total global chip foundry revenue and the country wasn’t able to keep up its usual output.

What industries are most affected?

Automakers have been practically immobilized for over a year and the situation might get worse. A new outbreak of Covid in South East Asia where most US automakers’ chip manufacturing is done could hit the industry even harder next year.

Production in countries such as Vietnam the Philippines and Malaysia was halted due to the outbreak but US automakers rely heavily on those countries to keep their production lines moving since home-grown fabs only account for 12.5% of chip manufacturing.

Another suffering industry is consumer electronics manufacturing. For instance Hon Hai Precision Industry an Apple supplier said about 10% of its shipments would be affected. Xiaomi meanwhile said its smartphones would see a price increase because of the global chip shortage.

Apple’s MacBook and iPad products have also encountered production issues and in March Samsung announced its new Galaxy Note would indefinitely delayed.

The latest data shows smartphone sales have fallen 6% year-on-year and this is because production has stalled and in some cases halted. On top of that chip manufacturers are increasing their prices to prevent over-ordering - and whether that influences the price of smartphones next year remains to be seen.

Smartphone manufacturers like Samsung and Apple dodged the initial bullet of the microchip shortage having seen what was coming a lot sooner than the automotive industry - although some issues are still arising.

However the auto industry and others are catching up. Accenture’s Global Semiconductor Lead Syed Alem says “smartphone companies benefited from the extra capacity left behind by automotive businesses which led the automotive sector to experience a chip shortage when demand for cars rose faster than they anticipated.""

“Now that the automotive sector and others are catching up and starting to reclaim the capacity they had given up there is fierce competition for semiconductor supplies. This has created supply pressure for smartphone chips.”

Due to pent-up demand and an improved consumer outlook the first quarter of 2021 saw worldwide smartphone sales grow 26%. However chip manufacturers are unable to meet the demand and that probably won’t change by the end of the year.

Impact on price

Along with the possible price increase on smartphones several other products have become more expensive as a result of the shortage.

GPU and CPU pricing has skyrocketed since the global chip shortage began with the latter saoring to about 50% above MSRP in most markets according to some experts.

In March to May 2021 alone the price of GPUs increased 14% with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and RTX 3080 GPUs are selling for quadruple their MSRP and RX 6700 XT or RX 6900 XT going for double the MSRP.

There are three main factors that have contributed to the increase in GPU and CPU price hikes: scalpers supply chain issues and distributors playing hardball.

We’ve already covered price rises but for many manufacturers there’s another reason for doing so: they want to keep scalpers from purchasing the GPUs at MSRP and then gouging the market.

Although they don’t control pricing for CPUs and GPUs distributors are more or less forcing retailers to buy bundles of products. Simply put they’re telling retailers a particular CPU or GPU is only available if they buy XY and Z along with it. In turn retailers increase the price of the GPU or CPU to offset the additional products they had to pay for just to get the GPU/CPU they need. Or you’ll see retailers trying to push bundles when customers need nothing of the sort - a trickle-down effect that isn’t helping the current chip shortage situation.

However there’s more to it. Fabrication plants (fabs) have a limited amount of chips they can make and supply. Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) which supply Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) respectively can’t currently produce any more GPUs. Furthermore there are ongoing problems with substrates raw materials GDDR memory and components. That’s also why the price of GPUs has spiked more dramatically than CPUs.

Black Friday and Christmas

The holidays are fast approaching and the global chip shortage will play a part in it. You can't predict precisely what will happen with products for Black Friday but there are strategies you can pursue to mitigate problems.

With Covid-19 still prevalent in Southeast Asia where many goods are manufactured you can expect shelves to be barer compared to years past. You can also expect prices to continue to rise for just about everything due to a lack of manpower supply shortages and longer shipping times.

Commentators also predict the price of goods will continue to rise through the end of 2021 with typical Black Friday sales and promotions set to be scaled back across many retailers.

Christmas will likely also be affected with retailers facing issues in stocking shelves with children's toys especially those with electronic chips. According to the Head of Sky Castle Toys Lev Nelson aside from the chip shortage itself toy companies are often pushed to the back of the semiconductor line by higher-margin items such as cars smartphones and washing machines.

To avoid getting price gouged on or before Black Friday and Christmas you should start shopping now. The sooner the better especially for anything that uses a silicon chip.

What other products are affected?

According to Goldman Sachs the global chip shortage has touched 169 different industries. Any industry that spends at least 1% of its GDP on semiconductor chips is adversely affected - with the auto industry spending nearly 5% of its GDP.

One other area that has been particularly affected acutely is telecoms. Telecommunication carriers have struggled to fill orders since the chip shortage began as have satellite and telecommunication resellers along with internet publishing broadcasting and web search portals.

In the wholesale trade sector professional and commercial equipment supplies have also taken a big hit with companies unable to fulfil orders due to supply chain issues.

Used cars and rental companies have also had to make adjustments due to the chip shortage as for the first time in 68 years of tracking used cars saw their first yearly price increase with prices rising almost 10% in 2021.

When might the chip shortage end?

While many predict the global chip shortage will likely end sometime in 2022 Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger expects it won’t end until 2023. In an interview with CNBC Gelsinger said “we’re in the worst of it now; every quarter next year we’ll get incrementally better but we’re not going to see supply-demand balance until 2023.”

However AMD CEO Lisa Su thinks the shortage will end sometime in 2022. She said production will be tight “[but will get] better next year not immediately but it’ll gradually get better as more plants come up.”

Gelsinger stated that it isn’t only a lack of chips but a “combination of parts.”

""We call it match sets where we may have the CPU but you don’t have the LCD or you don’t have the Wi-Fi. Datacenters are particularly struggling with some of the power chips and some of the networking or ethernet chips” he explained.

One way the global chip shortage might be solved is by the Internet of Things (IoT).

IoT technology can collect data and use it to prevent future chip shortages with a chip fabrication plant that has “smart” connected equipment able to use real-time data allowing all members of its production team to make informed decisions that will reduce waste speed up delivery times and increase product quality.

Next-gen innovation can also play a role as the GaN semiconductor platform for example will be 3x lighter 3x smaller with 3x faster charging - with a combined effect of a 40% saving on energy costs.

Diversifying supplier bases can also help to mitigate the chip shortage or prevent it in the future. Creating strategic relationships with distributors resellers and traders can help when extra chips are needed in urgent situations.

What will happen to the chip manufacturing industry?

In the coming years there will be a mixing of technologies from 200mm (mature/legacy technology) and newer 300mm (for cutting-edge chips).

Pursuing only one of these avenues might keep the chip shortage going even longer - but building more 200mm fabs and 300mm fabs will get us out of the woods.

In 2020 there were 212 200mm fabs with are a total of 222 expected by 2022. There were 129 300mm fabs in 2020 and experts expect a total of 149 to be live by 2022 with this growth trend expected to continue over the next decade.

The $52 billion US Innovation and Competition Act should also help funding by providing subsidies to chip manufacturing companies - if it passes through Congress as well as the Biden Executive Order signed on February 24 2021.

Finally there's the ongoing trade war between the US and China which sees semiconductor chips as a crucial pawn.

In September 2020 former President Donald Trump imposed import restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) China’s largest chip firm forcing China to source parts elsewhere and rework its supply chain causing a big slowdown in imports of chips to the US and elsewhere.

What does this mean for national security?

“[The chip shortage is] a challenge to the supply chain that could create threats to the very security of our nation” Matt Hayden former Assistant Secretary for Cyber Infrastructure Risk and Resilience of the US Department of Homeland Security told Kitco News.

According to Hayden US information systems defense systems and sensitive electronics are what the government uses for homeland security with all these affected by the shortage.

Shipments of semiconductors are being help up over 200 days. “We’re looking at days from 200 to past a year for specific chips that range from consumer electronics to major manufacturing across the world” said Hayden.

An anonymous source told a Fox News Investigative Unit that whoever wins the race for the next generation of semiconductor products will have an extremely strong military become a global economic force and possibly dominate the geopolitical landscape.

There are also thoughts that China may try to take over Taiwan which is the largest chipmaker in the world accounting for 63% of Asia’s chip manufacturing production. If China did attempt and succeed in a military takeover of Taiwan it would hold the key to the future of the modern world.

Where do we go from here?

It's been over a year since the first signs of the global chip shortage and companies across multiple industries have been affected and will continue to be in the coming weeks and months.

Barring any more natural disasters like droughts and severe winter storms cutting power supply should start to turn around early in 2022 - but the overall situation doesn’t look like it will return to normal by the end of next year or by the start of 2023. Some steps can be taken to turn the ship around or at least mitigate it from sinking further and those measures are at our disposal.

We don't know exactly what the future holds but the global chip shortage will end at some point. It's just going to last longer than anyone initially thought.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9vcGluaW9uLzU4MzA0Ny10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tY29udW5kcnVtLXdpdGgtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy_SAWJodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2NoYW5naW5nLWFtZXJpY2Evb3Bpbmlvbi81ODMwNDctdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWNvbnVuZHJ1bS13aXRoLWVsZWN0cmljLWNhcnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The American conundrum with electric cars,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/changing-america/opinion/583047-the-american-conundrum-with-electric-cars/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9vcGluaW9uLzU4MzA0Ny10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tY29udW5kcnVtLXdpdGgtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy_SAWJodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2NoYW5naW5nLWFtZXJpY2Evb3Bpbmlvbi81ODMwNDctdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWNvbnVuZHJ1bS13aXRoLWVsZWN0cmljLWNhcnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Bloomberg





United Microelectronics Corp (UMC 聯電) and Micron Technology Inc yesterday said they have settled a civil lawsuit in which the US memorychip maker accused the Taiwanese company of stealing and leaking its intellectual property to a Chinese partner.

UMC is to make a one-time payment of an undisclosed amount to settle all competing claims between the companies globally a joint statement said.

UMC said that it did not expect the payment to have any significant impact on its financial status.

The move ends a high-profile chapter in tensions between the US and China with the international case serving as a focal point for Washington complaints of Beijing facilitating forced technology transfers a charge that China denies.

The case concerned an allegedly illegal transfer of Micron’s memory designs in a chip manufacturing deal between UMC and Jinjiang-based Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co (福建晉華).

Following the move Micron said that it would continue to seek “full restitution” from UMC in a separate civil lawsuit the statement said.

Last year UMC pleaded guilty in San Francisco federal court in a deal with US prosecutors who agreed to drop charges of economic espionage and conspiracy.

UMC instead admitted to trade-secret theft and agreed to pay a US$60 million fine.

Evidence submitted in connection with the guilty plea showed that the three workers — Steven Chen (陳正坤) Ho Chien-ting (何建廷) and Wang Yung-ming (王永銘) — were employed at Micron Taiwan before joining UMC.

Chen who had been president at Micron Taiwan and was made senior vice president at UMC brokered a deal with Fujian Jinhua to develop DRAM technology for the Chinese firm.

The US Department of Justice in 2018 formally charged UMC and Fujian Jinhua as well as Chen Ho and Wang with crimes related to conspiracy to steal convey and possess stolen trade secrets from a US firm.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The report warned the world must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. To achieve this not only must the emissions released by countries and companies be dramatically curtailed but billions of tons of carbon dioxide must be sucked out of the atmosphere.

These findings directly informed Microsoft’s climate policy said Willmott. In January 2020 the company announced that it would be carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 it would have removed from the atmosphere all the carbon it has emitted since it was founded in 1975. By making this pledge the company joined a small group of businesses including Ikea and the software company Intuit committed to going further than net-zero.

Microsoft is often ranked as a leading business on climate action. Its policies – from making it easier for people to repair their devices to launching software to help companies measure and manage carbon emissions – have been praised for going beyond the company’s own operations to the footprint of its suppliers and customers.

“Being a large well-known brand and putting a stake in the ground talking publicly for years about the importance of climate change is really critical” said Simon Fischweicher head of corporations and supply chains for the environmental non-profit CDP North America.

However Microsoft has also been criticized for actions that appear to contradict its bold rhetoric on climate including membership of trade associations that lobby against climate legislation contracts with oil and gas firms and donations to politicians who obstruct climate policy.

These connections make it “complicit” in efforts to push against climate action said Bill Weihl a former sustainability executive at Google and Facebook and the founder of the advocacy group ClimateVoice.

Scaling up goals

Microsoft has been operating as a carbon-neutral company for nearly a decade a feat it has achieved through buying carbon offsets as well as securing renewable power directly from clean energy companies and installing onsite renewable energy such as solar panels at its offices.

Since 2012 Microsoft has also implemented an internal carbon fee currently set at $15 a metric ton making business units pay for emissions related to their operations and electricity as well as from business air travel.

“The money gets collected and spent” said Willmott whose carbon management team uses the money to fund initiatives such as buying clean energy and carbon offsets. “I have to pinch myself regularly because that was something we dreamed about and didn’t think was actually going to happen.”

It’s a “powerful mechanism” says Fischweicher to push a company to think more deeply about the impact of its activities: “To pay a fee you start to think about: ‘What can I do to reduce that so I have more money in my budget?’”

But the company has recognized that much more is required to tackle the climate crisis and the plan to go carbon negative was a big step up in ambitions.

Microsoft has laid out milestones for reaching the target. By 2025 it aims to reduce the emissions from its direct operations to “near zero” through gains in energy efficiency and using 100% renewable energy. By 2030 it has committed to reducing by at least 50% its direct emissions and those from its supply chain.

The company’s supply chain – more than 58000 suppliers provide everything from office furniture to the metals and plastics used in its products – makes up the bulk of its emissions. Last year the company implemented a carbon reporting requirement for suppliers and it extended the internal carbon fee to cover supply chain emissions.

But in order to remove more emissions than it produces the company will rely heavily on carbon removal projects. These include nature-based initiatives such as funding reforestation projects but the company is also pinning its hopes on technology. Microsoft is investing $1bn to support emerging technology that can reduce capture and remove carbon from the air.

As part of this the company has invested in and purchased carbon removal from Climeworks which operates the world’s largest direct air capture plant in Iceland removing CO2 from the air and trapping it in rock underground.

In 2020 Microsoft removed 1.3m metric tons of carbon through a range of initiatives from nature based programs to carbon capture technology.

However these projects face obstacles. Relying on forests and soil to trap endless amounts of carbon is increasingly difficult in the face of worsening wildfires pests and changes in land use. And carbon removal technology is not anywhere near the scale needed. There are 19 direct air capture (DAC) plants in operation globally capturing just over 100000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. The International Energy Agency has estimated that reaching net zero by 2050 would require the world to scale up DAC to capture more than 85m tons each year by 2030 and around 980m tons a year by 2050.

It’s a challenge that Microsoft is grappling with. The number and type of projects currently available is “far short of what we need” said Willmott. By 2030 the company estimates it will need to remove 5m to 6m tons of carbon. This means the technology will need to be considerably scaled up to meet Microsoft’s demands alone she said “and that’s to say nothing of the fact that there’s a real spike in corporate demand”.

It’s not just the amount of viable carbon capture projects that’s lacking Willmot said; there’s also a quality issue. The industry doesn’t fully distinguish between avoided emissions and those that are actually removed from the atmosphere she said. More robust quality standards would go a long way to making sure “it’s not quite a wild wild west that it is today” Willmot said.

“[Microsoft is] opening up new conversations about historical emissions without having all the answers” said Aoife Brophy departmental research lecturer in innovation and enterprise at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School. “Leaders on climate need to acknowledge the complexity of the problem and be transparent about the fact that there are not always clear solutions.”

Microsoft’s focus on historical emissions could also help spur a deeper conversation she said about “responsibility for the past and may lead to much better ways to think about issues like climate justice that have not yet been adequately addressed by companies”.

A wider influence

The modern corporate sustainability movement requires companies to also consider their impacts on customers peers and society more broadly. This shift in perspective said Fischweicher “is a really critical turning-point moment … because what you’re also talking about is shifting your business model overall”.

To Microsoft’s critics this means the company should reconsider its work with oil companies. The same week that Microsoft made its carbon-negative announcement it sponsored an oil conference in Saudi Arabia. A 2020 Greenpeace report digging into tech companies’ work with the oil and gas industry – such as providing software to support fossil fuel extraction – found that its contract with ExxonMobil “could lead to emissions greater than 20% of Microsoft’s annual carbon footprint”.

The company also spent about $200000 during the 2020 US election cycle supporting politicians with a history of climate denial. And this October Microsoft – along with other corporations – was criticized by the watchdog group Accountable.US for its membership of trade organizations with a history of fighting climate crisis legislation including the Business Roundtable and the US Chamber of Commerce. Most recently these groups have lobbied against climate legislation included under Joe Biden’s reconciliation bill.

“I feel really strongly that we need to be able to work with everyone to make this transition to a low-carbon economy in the future” said Willmott responding to these criticisms. “I really think it’s important not to villainize any particular sector or villainize any particular entities but rather really work hard from within to shape the journey.”

Weihl whose organization ClimateVoice is calling on Microsoft and others to devote one-fifth of their lobbying dollars to climate policy in 2021 remains skeptical. “Companies are putting their narrow self-interest ahead of actually addressing the climate crisis at scale” he said. “Silence and unwillingness to publicly distance themselves [from these groups] is not neutrality it’s complicity.”

Whether it’s Microsoft’s customers and affiliations or the type of work it does experts agree the company’s size and political heft as well as its position within trade groups give it immense power – and it’s all about how the company chooses to use it.

“Tech companies shape how we engage with the world and the information we see on a daily basis” said Brophy. “We need to think of impact beyond measuring emissions and consider ways in which technology can be used to create change across different systems.”

Microsoft’s climate commitments are laudable she said but ultimately success will require collective action. “The biggest challenge is that Microsoft’s goals cannot be achieved by Microsoft alone” said Brophy. “But that’s exactly what we need to see companies across industries doing more of: coming out and being bold recognizing that they need to be systems leaders.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoL2NvbHVtbmlzdC8yMDIxLzExLzI3L2dvb2dsZS1hcHBsZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtY2xvdWQtc3RvcmFnZS84NzQyNDQ0MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Apple or Microsoft: Which cloud storage is best for you?,"Rob Pegoraro

Special to USA TODAY

The forecast for your next phone tablet laptop or desktop includes not just a chance of clouds but a choice of them. As in which cloud storage service will you use to back up your files?

The wrong answer is “none.” Any device that will leave your house needs a backup system that doesn’t depend on you remembering to plug it into a drive or another computer once at home. Plus cloud storage vastly eases access to your most important files across all your devices.

But unless you exist entirely in Apple’s orbit you’ll have to choose between cloud services that fit better on some devices than on others.

Here are your options from Apple Google and Microsoft with costs on an annual basis:

Apple’s iCloud+ gives 5 gigabytes of free storage after which you can buy 50GB for $11.88/year 200GB for $35.88/year or 2 terabytes for $119.88/year.

Google One starts with 15GB free then offers 100GB for $19.99/year 200GB for $29.99/year and 2TB for $99.99/year.

Microsoft’s OneDrive provides 5GB free followed by a 100GB tier at $23.88 a year and a 1TB offering at $69.99 a year plus a family plan with 1TB per person for up to six people for $99.99/year.

On Macs iPhones and iPads iCloud+ allows for the simplest backup and now offers such additional privacy features as iCloud Private Relay to cloak your browsing and Hide My Email to create random addresses that forward to your actual email.

In Windows OneDrive provides an equally simple backup of your core data folders as well as the useful extra of Microsoft Office’s apps.

Google’s backup service does not come with add-ons to match Apple and Microsoft’s – but it’s also your only recourse for a Gmail inbox that’s grown beyond your ability to keep it under the 15 GB line.

►Unfriending Facebook:How to deactivate or permanently delete your Facebook account

Beyond those three you can also buy cloud storage from the likes of Dropbox where 2TB runs $119.88/year while Amazon Prime subscribers get unlimited Amazon Photos storage; those third-party services however lack their integration with major computing platforms.

My advice: Let the computer that most needs online backup – meaning the device that spends the most time out of the house and holds the most content in need of safekeeping – drive your cloud choice. In my case that device is an HP laptop running Windows 10 so I pay for OneDrive to sync its documents photos and music.

My other advice: Try not to pay list price for cloud storage if you can help it. Credit card cash-back offers such as a targeted American Express 20%-off deal for Google One may trim your costs but you can also often purchase Apple and Google gift cards good for their cloud services at a discount.

For example Target rewards buying a $100 Apple gift card with a $15 gift card Amazon earlier offered a $5 credit for buying a $50 Apple gift card and AARP members can buy $15 Google Play gift cards for $13 through that organization’s AARP Rewards page.

Subscription fatigue is real but chipping away at these expenses is one way to feel less wary about this cost of doing digital business.

This furthers Microsoft's embrace of Java such as providing its own downstream distribution of OpenJDK and offering continuous improvement with Java support in Visual Studio Code. Microsoft is also a strategic member of both the Eclipse Foundation and the Eclipse Adoptium Working Group.

Discussing the importance of Microsoft's involvement in the Java community Bruno Souza principal consultant at Summa Technologies and president of the SouJava an executive committee member of the JCP stating:

The JCP is the place where we define and discuss the future of Java and where we need the collaboration of all the Java community. Microsoft has been an important part of this community with their involvement in OpenJDK but also supporting Java User Groups and community events.

Microsoft highlighted that it has ""more than 500000 JVMs in production running hundreds of internal Microsoft systems"" in its Azure cloud. This number does not include JVMs of Microsoft customers and has not increased since Microsoft first introduced Microsoft Build of OpenJDK in April 2021.

Mike Milinkovich executive director of the Eclipse Foundation commented on Microsoft's announcement:

It is great to see Microsoft joining the Java Community Process and becoming a full-fledged member of the Java community. There is a lot of old history there including the ghost of the J++ lawsuit that was settled 15 years ago. I see this as part of Microsoft's overall strategy of making Azure the platform of choice for Java developers.

Azure was the biggest Microsoft business unit with 46% of overall revenue up 36% year over year in its most recent earnings report. Microsoft does not break out Java revenue in its financial statements but running Java applications does contribute to Azure.

Amazon Microsoft's most significant cloud rival joined the JCP two years ago. Google is the other big cloud competitor who is also a member of the JCP.

Along with joining the JCP Microsoft also announced that they endorse the two-year LTS release cadence proposed by Oracle just after the release of JDK 17. There ha​​d been no public update on this subject since September 21 2021.

Microsoft also promoted the Microsoft Build of OpenJDK and highlighted its support for running Jakarta EE and Spring applications on Azure. It also acknowledged the recent 1.0 release of the Java Language Support in Visual Studio Code.

Earlier this year the Adoptium Steering Committee formally approved the Adoptium Working Group Charter. Formerly known as AdoptOpenJDK the group changed its name to Eclipse Adoptium after joining the Eclipse Foundation in June 2020. The Adoptium Working Group stewards of the Adoptium project will work in collaboration with the former AdoptOpenJDK Technical Steering Committee to provide the Java community with fully compatible high-quality distributions of Java binaries based on OpenJDK source code.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L01pY3Jvc29mdC1TdXJmYWNlLVByby04LUNvbnZlcnRpYmxlLVJldmlldy1Qb3dlcmZ1bC0xMjAtSHotYW5kLWZpbmFsbHktVGh1bmRlcmJvbHQuNTgxNzY5LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Surface Pro 8 Convertible Review: Powerful 120 Hz and finally Thunderbolt,"The eighth generation of the Surface Pro offers some important improvements and you will immediately notice the larger screen. The chassis size is similar and the bezels are narrower but there is still sufficient room for a good 5 MP webcam. The PWM issues of the Surface Pro 7 Plus are also gone and the 120 Hz mode (unfortunately hidden in the settings) creates a much smoother picture impression.

The high chassis quality did not change only the integrated kickstand is still very thin and flexible and there is also some play in the hinges. Microsoft upgraded the connectivity; in addition to the familiar Surface connector the convertible is now equipped with two USB-C ports including Thunderbolt 4 support. This means users are not limited to docking solutions from Microsoft anymore. A convertible is usually great for mobile work but Microsoft still does not offer the LTE module for private customers. In the end of 2021 we would have expected an optional 5G modem for all models.

The new Surface Pro 8 is also faster than before and the Core i7-1185G7 benefits from high power limits and the fastest version of the Iris Xe Graphics G7. However this results in louder fan noise as well as higher chassis temperatures under load. We can live with that because the convertible is still silent during most everyday workloads and you can still influence the behavior via Windows power settings.

The new Microsoft Surface Pro 8 now features Thunderbolt 4 a larger screen with 120 Hz refresh rate and a powerful Core i7 CPU but such a mobile device should be available with an optional 5G modem for all customer groups.

The optional keyboard-pen combination is definitely a useful addition but it is not cheap at 280 Euros. We really like the integrated tray for the pen which also supports automatic charging. However the combination of the tablet and the keyboard is not lighter or thinner than many subnotebooks with 13-inch displays.

The two major convertible rivals from Dell and Lenovo use less powerful Tiger Lake UP4 processors but have advantages in other categories. The ThinkPad X12 offers a better keyboard a quieter fan and LTE connectivity for all users while the Latitude 13 7320 convinces with a brighter screen and longer battery runtimes. Apple’s iPad Pro 12.9 on the other hand offers the efficient M1 processor and is ahead in some sections (silent operation better screen longer battery runtime optional 5G connectivity and less expensive) but devices with Windows are often still more versatile. It really depends on the software you use but the iPad Pro is definitely a good alternative for some users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9taWNyb3NvZnQtZWRnZXMtbGF0ZXN0LWZlYXR1cmUtY2FsbGVkLXNoYW1lbGVzcy1jYXNoLWdyYWItY3JpdGljc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Edge's latest feature called a 'shameless cash grab' by critics,"What you need to know

Microsoft recently started testing a buy now pay later integration in Edge powered by Zip.

The option has drawn criticism from users of the browser.

The feature allows people to split purchases made online between four installments over a six-week period.

Microsoft Edge recently gained a feature that allows people to pay for online purchases in installments. It's known as buy now pay later (BNPL) and it's currently in testing on Microsoft Edge Dev and Canary. The option drew criticism from fans and users of the browser that expressed frustration in the comments section of the post announcing the feature.

The center of most complaints is the belief that Microsoft Edge is becoming bloated with shopping features rather than delivering a pure browsing experience. BNPL is optional but its detractors are against the concept of Edge having shopping features built in.

""It's impressive how quickly you can throw away years of hard work and good will with a ridiculous feature like this"" said vyrotek. ""The Edge teams need to pause and think how they possibly thought this was a good idea. Even the Bing features are getting too aggressive.""

Cameron_Bush states asks for Microsoft to reconsider the addition. ""This sounds like an awful idea that will only be seen as a shameless cashgrab are/or bloat by media outlets. I beg you reconsider pushing this to live. The negative press this feature is going to receive isn't worth it.""

GNS722 echoed similar sentiments. ""As many have mentioned above please don't keep on adding such bloat. Edge has become a really good alternative to others but if you are going to follow this path it won't be anymore.""

A comment by examinedliving contrasts the open nature of some parts of Microsoft with the addition of BNPL to Edge. ""It seems like Microsoft had been divided into competing biblical entities. One is pure and creates things like VS Code and Powertoys. The other is the demonic beast who comes up with this ridiculous insulting garbage.""

There are several pages worth of comments most of which are negative. Edge has several features that help people save money. Critics seem to believe that features like these should be left to extensions and dedicated websites rather than being built into a browser."

It's not clear whether new formulations will be needed or if current Covid vaccinations will provide protection against the new variant that has begun to spread around the globe.

""We should know about the ability of the current vaccine to provide protection in the next couple of weeks but the remarkable thing about the MRNA vaccines Moderna platform is that we can move very fast"" Burton said on BBC's ""Andrew Marr Show.""

Omicron has been classified as a ""variant of concern"" by the World Health Organization meaning it is more contagious more virulent or more skilled at evading public health measures vaccines and therapeutics. The variant contains 30 mutations to the spike protein that allows the virus to enter the body. Officials have warned that many of these mutations could lead to increased antibody resistance and transmissibility which could limit the effectiveness of existing Covid vaccines.

The vaccine maker ""mobilized hundreds"" of workers starting early Thursday morning on Thanksgiving to start studying the new variant the company said in a statement.

In this day and age there is no shortage of subjects for ""spirited debate"" whether it's on social media in the beauty shop at the liar's table at the local diner or around the dinner table.

You know the sensitive subject list - right vs. left all things COVID Cardinals/Cubs (although Cub fans are kinda quiet these days) and especially Missouri vs. Illinois.

But there is one debate that has raged through the ages and I see it as my duty to see if I can throw some gas on that fire.

Here goes - who has the best maid rites in the universe - Maid Rite in Quincy or the Mark Twain Dinette in Hannibal?

For the uneducated the maid rite (if you live in Iowa it's a loose meat sandwich but who really cares what they call it?) is some combination of seasoned ground beef pickles and onions - and don't ever EVER call it a Sloppy Joe.

Maid Rite on North 12th in Quincy has become an institution in business since 1928.

Quincy Maid Rite Quincy Maid Rite loading...

The Mark Twain Dinette on North 3rd in Hannibal has been a fixture in America's Hometown since 1942.

Mark Twain Dinette Mark Twain Dinette loading...

Yes a check of Maid-Rite's corporate website shows both establishments as franchisees so you may ask wouldn't the sandwich you get at either place be the same?

I believe I speak for everyone when I say that that kind of logical thinking has no place in this debate.

So what say you? Who has the better Maid-Rite? Quincy or Hannibal?

I don't want to sway you one way or the other but let's just say I prefer my maid-rite with a half-foot of onion rings and a frosty mug of root beer - just sayin'.

Simply sign up to the Private equity myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Historically low interest rates and high stock valuations are driving return-hungry investors to rush into private markets with non-publicly listed assets under management expected to rise 60 per cent between 2020 and 2025.

Alternatives — a category of unlisted assets that include private equity private debt hedge funds real estate infrastructure and natural resources — are set to surpass $17tn in AUM within the next four years. Private equity and private debt will be the main drivers of this growth according to data provider Preqin.

“Because of lower rates clients are ready to give up some liquidity to get a higher return” said Cyril Marie chief financial officer and head of strategy at Natixis Investment Managers.

This boom in demand has spurred consolidation in the sector including the recent purchase of Oak Hill Advisors by Baltimore-based asset manager T Rowe Price.

The private capital industry has grown to exceed $7tn in the past few years. Projected growth is expected to be strongest in Asia with Preqin citing low penetration rates and fast GDP growth as attractive factors.

Preqin’s forecasting model draws on historical AUM data across asset classes and regions along with fundraising and deals and various macroeconomic data. The data provider said its 2025 estimate was supported by questionnaires asking for the expectations and intentions of investors and fund managers.

Lesser volatility and opacity in private markets can also be attractive for investors. “With a listed asset the day after lockdown you’ve lost 40 per cent whereas with a non-listed asset there is less volatility so the perception of risk is smaller” said Natixis’ Marie who added that “in reality it is the same risk fundamentally”.

Bruce Hamilton an analyst at Morgan Stanley said that even wealthy investors with traditionally low allocation to private assets are planning on adding to their positions in part due to “product innovation and new distribution platforms”.

Private equity and private debt are expected to grow 15.6 per cent and 11.4 per cent a year respectively up to 2025. Other alternatives are projected to grow 5 per cent or less annually. Private equity has been the strongest performing and least volatile alternative asset class since 2008 according to the consultancy McKinsey.

Private debt has evolved “from a niche product” at the turn of the century to the “mainstream” according to JPMorgan. Two-thirds of its assets are invested in North America and one-third in Europe.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou analyst at JPMorgan said one of the reasons private debt has grown in Europe is that banks “stepped back from loan creation” after the euro debt crisis allowing room for private debt markets such as direct lending funds to flourish.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9iaXRjb2luLWF1bS1mYWxscy05LTUtdG8tcmVjb3JkLWxhcmdlc3QtbW9udGhseS1wdWxsYmFjay1zaW5jZS1qdWx50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin AUM falls 9.5% to record largest monthly pullback since July,"While Bitcoin’s (BTC) position as a viable hedge against fiat inflation continues to attract investors new data reflects a change in sentiment as Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrency products pick up steam against falling Bitcoin assets under management (AUM).

The Bitcoin AUM market fell 9.5% to $48.7 billion in November marking the year’s largest month-on-month pullback since July according to a CryptoCompare report. On the other hand altcoin-based crypto funds such as ETH saw their AUM rise 5.4% to $16.6 billion.

As shown in the above graph the total AUM across all digital asset investment products has fallen 5.5% to $70.0 billion which coincides with the ongoing bear market ever since Bitcoin achieved an all-time high of above $65000.

As a result of the 9.5% fall the Bitcoin AUM market represents 70.6% of the total AUM share. Ethereum’s AUM however rose 5.4% to $16.6 billion while AUMs representing other crypto assets were up by $2.6 billion.

Most notably Courtnay’s Kitchen donated and prepared 24 ten-pound roasted turkey breasts traditional stuffing buttered green beans mashed potatoes and in-house made cranberry compote.

“The Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich is happy to partner with Courtnay’s Kitchen who supplied and prepared the food for our 19th Annual Thanksgiving Feast for our Club kids” said Cristina Vittoria Chief Executive Officer of the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich.

“We are thrilled to return to an in-person celebration at the Club and are enormously grateful for the generosity and dedication of Courtnay and her team. This event highlights the support we receive from the Greenwich community and their kindness and generosity” Vittoria added.

When first approached to open her Kitchen to prepare the annual feast for the Club kids Courtnay Arpano did not hesitate. “This is just the way we roll” said Arpano noting that in addition to herself her staff was also volunteering their time.

“I applaud Courtnay Arpano and Courtnay’s Kitchen for supporting the BGCG’s time-honored Thanksgiving feast for the Club Kids” said First Selectman Fred Camillo.

Courtnay’s Kitchen has been located at 136 Hamilton Ave for a little over three years during the bulk of Covid. In March 2020 Courtnay’s Kitchen made a complete pivot from in-store to home delivery. In those early days of Covid people were reluctant to go to the grocery store. Because of the influx of family members including college students returning home to Greenwich and the increase in people working from home needing at-home food options during the workday Arpano saw a surge in demand for her online weekly delivery service which offered breakfast lunch and dinner. In fact Courtnay’s Kitchen experienced a sixfold increase in sales compared to 2019. At the beginning of 2021 comfort levels began to rise as the vaccine became available. She then re-launched her popular cleanses which always sell out.

Healthy cooking and providing healthy options are a passion for Arpano but so is giving back.

“It is a calling” she said. “I don’t think twice about it – it’s morally the right thing to do.”

Over the years Arpano has donated countless cooking parties and donations to silent auctions supporting many local charities including the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich The Undies Project Neighbor to Neighbor the Backpack Project Bridgeport and Make a Wish among several others. Proceeds from a partnership with the Breast Cancer Alliance “Cleanse for a Cure” resulted in a $3500 donation.

In April 2020 she raised over $12000 for Neighbor to Neighbor with her Family Fried Chicken Fundraiser. Then last Thanksgiving she provided over 100 Thanksgiving meals for our local senior citizens through the Commission on Aging and the Greenwich Senior Center.

“I received thank you notes from all over the country thanking me for taking care of their parents who were shut-in because of Covid” Arpano said.

Arpano’s charitable activities extend beyond her Kitchen. Twelve years ago Arpano and her friends Vicki Carver and Toby Peters started the Spirit of Friendship. The trio gathers their friends every year for a communal celebratory meal during the holidays. In lieu of a gift exchange the Spirit of Friendship became a collective giving circle to contribute funds to local charities. Arpano said it was something her mother did in Hilton Head South Carolina. Over the past 11 years the three have raised over $140000 in donations to local charities. Arpano provides the food to the 40-50 attendees each which generally raises $12-$15000 a gathering. The 12th Spirit of Friendship will take place in early December at a local home.

In addition to her charitable contributions Arpano also lifts people up. Arpano was introduced to an aspiring fellow chef Robert Cox who started his culinary career at Boulud Sud in New York City. Cox then went to Paris cooking at Le Rigmarole and Septime a Michelin-rated restaurant but returned to the States because of Covid. Looking to make ends meet during a pandemic Cox became the beneficiary of Arpano’s grace and hospitality. In September and October of 2020 Cox used Courtnay’s Kitchen as a base to cook his one-star Michelin dinners for curbside pick-up every Thursday evening.

“Robbie Cox is a brilliant chef and I was so happy to give him a place to cook and provide the resources he needed” smiled Arpano acknowledging that she helped her peer get through the Covid rough patch. Currently Cox is an acclaimed chef at Fradei in Brooklyn NY. Of her acts of kindness Arpano said “I do it because I can.”

“It is important to recognize Greenwich’s locally-owned small businesses that have stepped forward to support those in need during these challenging times” Camillo said. “Courtnay’s Kitchen is an excellent example of a small business owner who has given back to her Greenwich community to help her Greenwich neighbors quietly and without asking for recognition. Courtnay and her business illustrate how compassionate our Greenwich community is.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzRjNjhjMzdiLTU3YWUtNDdiMS05OGRkLWY0YTgxNWIzMTgyZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Half of this year's big IPOs are trading below listing price,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

With the U.S. economy steadily on the rise electric vehicle (EV) charging stocks appear to be the next hot thing in the stock market. After all EVs need charging and they are a growing market among consumers. Not to mention EV stocks have been making waves recently. We could look at Rivian Automotive’s (NASDAQ: RIVN) recent initial public offering (IPO) for instance. Sure the company’s shares appear to be seeing bouts of volatility but investors are eyeing them nonetheless. Regardless with more EV owners the need for charging solutions would increase. But where do most people charge their EVs? Enter EV charging stations and EV charging stocks by extension.

At the same time the industry seems to be receiving support from the government as well. Companies managing charging stations are set to benefit from the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. This would be after President Joe Biden signed it into law last week. The Biden administration’s goal is to increase the number of EV charging stations in the country to 500000. As a result this could benefit EV charging stocks in the stock market now.

When it comes to EVs Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) often comes to mind. The electric vehicle manufacturer has charging stations at over 4500 locations globally. Elsewhere leading Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) offers battery-swapping services a unique take on charging solutions. Could any of these EV charging stocks be a good pick for your watchlist?

Best EV Charging Stocks To Watch Ahead Of December 2021

ChargePoint

ChargePoint is a known name in the EV charging industry. It operates the country’s largest EV charging network with 26000 public charging stations located across the US. ChargePoint also operates in other countries with 118000 charging stations globally. Apart from public charging stations the company also produces a home EV charger called the ChargePoint Home Flex. In October the company announced its partnership with leading residential solar and storage service provider Sunnova Energy International (NYSE: NOVA). The partnership allows Sunnova customers to receive ChargePoint home EV chargers under the Sunnova Adaptive Home bundle.

During its second fiscal quarter ChargePoint posted an increase in revenue by 61% year-over-year totaling $56.1 million. The company also raised its full-year revenue outlook to between $225 and $235 million from between $195 and $205 million. Given ChargePoint’s experience in the EV charging market could CHPT stock be one of the best EV charging stocks to buy?

Blink Charging

Blink is another established company in the EV charging industry. The company focuses on placing its charging stations at accessible locations such as residential blocks healthcare facilities and office buildings. In May this year Blink acquired Belgian-based EV charging company Blue Corner NV to expand its European presence. The acquisition allows the company access to Blue Corner’s network in countries such as Belgium the Netherlands and France.

For its third fiscal quarter results Blink reported $6.4 million in revenue up by 607% year-over-year. The company contracted sold and deployed over 3000 commercial and residential chargers in the recent quarter. Blink CFO Michael Rama said that the company has sufficient cash on hand to fund its strategic initiatives. These include building innovative product and software platforms and onboarding additional talent. The company also plans to extend its market reach globally potentially acquiring businesses that could accelerate the company’s growth. As Blink continues to strengthen its position in the EV charging industry BLNK stock could be worth keeping tabs on.

Volta

Volta is another interesting EV charging company to consider now. The company’s EV charging stations double up as digital advertising billboards. Its Volta Media Network was formally launched this month. Among the brands that have signed up to advertise with Volta include video streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) multinational food and beverage company Nestle and popular coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX).

What’s more the company announced in October that it has reached the milestone of delivering 100 million electric miles to EV drivers across the country. Volta also launched its machine learning and artificial intelligence solution for infrastructure planning called PredictEV in August. This is in partnership with the second-largest utility company in the US Southern Company (NYSE: SO). During the third quarter Volta recorded a 77% increase year-over-year in revenue to $8.5 million. Volta said that it added 168 stalls in the quarter bringing its total of installed stalls to 2137 as of September 30. With its unique edge VLTA stock could be an EV charging name to watch for some.

EVgo

EVgo is serious about fast charging. The EV charging company boasts a charge time of between 15 to 45 minutes at its charging stations. As you can imagine convenience is the name of the game for EVgo. This is evident seeing that the company installs its stations at major retailers in the country. In March this year EVgo inked a partnership with Midwest grocery store chain Meijer to install its EV charging stations at the chain’s 256 locations. The company is also working with automotive giant General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) in a partnership that will see 3250 charging stalls deployed by 2025.

In its recently released third-quarter results EVgo recorded a 29% quarter-over-quarter revenue increase to $6.2 million from $4.8 million. The company saw its customer accounts grow by 36368 to over 310000. It also increased its full-year 2021 revenue guidance to between $20 and $22 million from $20 million projected before. Taking into account EVgo’s solid growth could EVGO stock be a good addition to your watchlist?

Wallbox

EV charging and energy management company Wallbox is a new kid on the stock market block despite its global presence. The company founded in 2015 in Barcelona Spain just went public last month. Wallbox mainly focuses on providing home EV charging solutions. Its main product Pulsar Plus aims to deliver a compact yet powerful and fast EV charger at home.

This month the company launched the Eco-Smart and Power Boost home energy management features on the Pulsar Plus. The Eco-Smart feature allows EVs to be charged using solar energy making for more sustainable charging. The company also recently teamed up with Uber (NYSE: UBER). In detail this will give Uber drivers a discounted package for Wallbox chargers seamless installation and the option to finance the package. Wallbox also recently reported that its third-quarter revenue stood at $22 million a rise of 250% year-over-year. With its impressive offerings will you be investing in WBX stock anytime soon?

With the resurgence of Covid-19 in many countries worldwide tech stocks could be gaining investors’ interest again. This comes as Austria enters its fourth nationwide lockdown and the Netherlands reinstates a partial lockdown. Having said that the Biden administration reiterated that it has no plans to impose another nationwide lockdown in the event of another devastating Covid-19 wave. In light of all this it is safe to say that tech companies that offer work-from-home (WFH) and remote capabilities to organizations worldwide would continue to thrive despite the ongoing pandemic.

For instance owning shares of Zoom Video Communications during the onset of the pandemic has been rewarding for many investors. The company’s business soared as businesses scrambled to enable employees to work from home. There’s no denying that companies globally are increasingly investing in infrastructure that would allow for either remote or hybrid work. Just this past week HP (NYSE: HPQ) posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. The strong results were driven by strength in the company’s commercial PC business. This shows that enterprises continue to grow despite the pandemic. With all that in mind could the following tech stocks make their way to your portfolio in the stock market today?

Best Tech Stocks To Watch Right Now

Zoom Video Communications

Zoom needs no introduction as its name is often synonymous with virtual meetings and meet-ups during the pandemic. The communications technology company allows virtual calls and conferences to take place on its cloud-based peer-to-peer software platform. From team meetings to virtual hang out between friends the company’s easy-to-use platform has been a choice for many.

Despite a better-than-expected earnings released earlier this week Zoom stock slid over 14% on Tuesday. For the quarter the company’s revenue came in 35% higher year-over-year to $1.05 billion. It also predicts its full-year revenue to be in the range of $4.079 billion to $4.081 billion up 54% year-over-year.

No doubt the slowing growth and incremental pressure on profitability has troubled both analysts and investors. However some believe such a pullback is overblown. If you share the sentiment would you buy ZM stock on dips in the stock market today?

DocuSign

It is safe to say that digital signature company DocuSign is here to stay as remote work becomes a norm for many organizations. DocuSign enables companies and individuals to sign and manage contracts and agreements digitally under its DocuSign Agreement Cloud.

Its range of products under the DocuSign Agreement Cloud also includes DocuSign Insight which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify risks and opportunities within an agreement.

DocuSign posted $511.8 million in revenue for its second fiscal quarter an increase of 50% year-over-year. Its CFO Cynthia Gaylor said that the company will continue to invest in additional sales capacity. With DocuSign’s current momentum would you include DOCU stock on your watchlist ahead of its third-quarter earnings on December 2?

Salesforce.com

Cloud-based software company Salesforce.com focuses on providing customer relationship management (CRM) service to its users. Its platform enables a company’s marketing sales commerce service and IT teams to work on one platform and also connect with its customers. The company acquired Slack a business communication platform popular with remote-working companies earlier this year. It has since integrated its CRM products with Slack making for a holistic service.

Last month the company entered into a partnership with Rocket Mortgage the largest mortgage lender in the US and a part of Rocket Companies (NYSE: RKT). Rocket Companies vice chairman and CEO Jay Farner said that the partnership will allow Rocket Mortgage to provide an end-to-end ‘mortgage-as-a-service’ solution through the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud platform.

During its fiscal second quarter Salesforce posted a 23% increase in revenue year-over-year to $6.34 billion. CEO Marc Benioff said that the Delta variant of Covid-19 failed to make a dent in its business. It is safe to say that with cloud platforms a rise in remote working can only accelerate the platforms’ growth. Keeping that in mind would you be watching CRM stock ahead of its third-quarter earnings on November 30?

Twilio

Virtual is the word of the day when it comes to living through a global pandemic which puts Twilio on the list. For starters Twilio provides a cloud communication platform which utilizes Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that act as intermediaries to allow two entities to communicate to each other. The company has grown steadily since its start in 2008. It now lists among others house-sharing platform Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) virtual marketplace eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and e-hailing platform Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) as its customers.

The company announced its latest product Twilio Engage late last month. For those unfamiliar Engage is a marketing automation platform which combines features such as data integrations analytics and messaging so that marketers can deliver more personalized digital campaigns. This latest introduction is another step toward investing further in customer engagement platform strategy.

In its recently announced third-quarter results Twilio reported $740.2 million in revenue up by 65% year-over-year. Its number of active customers rose by 20% to over 250000 from 208000 last year. As Twilio continues to expand on its cloud communication products TWLO stock is an interesting one to watch.

Teladoc Health

Teladoc Health is a pioneer in the telemedicine and virtual healthcare industry. The company’s products are focused on holistic virtual medical care which includes physical as well as mental health services. The company recently launched its primary care offering Primary360 to its users.

For those uninitiated Primary360 allows its users to choose a primary care provider and work with a care team. Despite the company’s leadership position in the telehealth sector its stock performance has been underwhelming this week. This could be due to a series of analyst price target cuts.

This past week Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Close slashed his price target for TDOC stock to $160 per share down from $188 previously. Nevertheless Close is sticking with his ‘Buy’ rating on the telehealth company.Teladoc reported $522 million in revenue for its third-quarter results up by 81% year-over-year. For the quarter the virtual healthcare company recorded a 37% jump year-over-year of virtual visits at 3.9 million visits. With no end in sight to the Covid-19 pandemic would the recent weakness in TDOC stock present an opportunity to scoop up the tech stock at discount?

The month is going to see some notable big departures including all six seasons of Glee and a few other beloved shows too.

Now you may notice our list looks considerably different to other outlets online. That’s because while they copy and paste from a PR release we list titles on the actual day of removal rather than the last day to watch. Netflix’s own interface generally now displays the last day to watch.

For those unaware of how removals work on Netflix it all comes down to licensing. Netflix doesn’t own all of its library and rents from other providers such as Warner Brothers Sony or Disney. They license titles for fixed periods of time and when that time is up it’s up to both parties to renew or the title departs.

This list will be updated throughout November 2021 (don’t miss all the November 2021 removals here) and we’ll receive an extended list from Netflix in the two weeks leading up to December 2021.

Chef Thiago Silva and a handful of the world’s top pastry chefs put their skills to the test in Netflix’s new special “School of Chocolate” which debuted Friday. Silva will bring his new chocolate expertise to the bakery he’s opening in Newton’s Piccadilly Square this winter SALT.

Silva is no stranger to the world of baking shows—he’s already shown his stuff on Food Network and beyond. In 2007 he won the first all-baking version of “Chopped” and since then he’s won “Dessert Games” and was a finalist on “Best Baker in America.” He’s also served as a judge on Netflix’s “Sugar Rush” and “Chopped Sweets.”

In his newest show Silva stars as one of eight pastry chefs taking their work to the next level under the guidance of Amaury Guichon a renowned French pastry chef who founded The Pastry Academy in Las Vegas. Guichon’s jaw-dropping whimsical chocolate creations have earned him over 4 million Instagram followers and inspire the eight pastry chefs as they compete for the winning prize: $100000.

“This show was different” said Silva comparing his experience filming “School of Chocolate” to his other television shows “because the main point is to learn and grow.”

“There’s a great prize but we all get some one-on-one lessons with Chef Amaury so it’s a win-win” he said explaining that many challenges required contestants to work together which you don’t often see on cooking competition shows.

“I had no idea that I could sculpt chocolate the way I did” said Silva although his pastry-making talents have certainly got him noticed in other ways — he’s made custom creations for the tables of celebrities like Sophía Vergara Derek Jeter John Legend and Miranda Kerr.

Silva worked as the executive pastry chef at New York City’s EMM Group (now Catch Hospitality) for several years before moving to Boston in 2016 to accept a position as director of chocolate with food innovation lab CHEW until he recently left to pursue his new Piccadilly Square venture.

At SALT Silva plans to sell morning pastries bread grab-and-go items cakes and coffee. He plans to utilize some of the chocolate sculpting skills he honed on “School of Chocolate” on specialty cakes at SALT.

Silva said viewers should tune into this new Netflix special because it’s unlike other competition shows that follow the same model.

“We all genuinely want to see each other grow and succeed” said Silva of his co-stars “during the show and after the show.”

Viewers can watch the first season of “School of Chocolate” on Netflix now. “There is just some truly amazing artistry happening” said Silva.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIyODA2MTc0L3JlZC1ub3RpY2UtbmV0ZmxpeC12aWV3ZXItbnVtYmVycy1tb3N0LXdhdGNoZWQtbW92aWUtb2YtYWxsLXRpbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Notice is Netflix’s biggest movie on par with Avengers: Endgame,"According to data provided by Netflix Red Notice fever is sweeping the globe. The number one movie in 93 countries from Bahrain to Bangladesh Israel to Indonesia Poland to Peru Spain to Sweden the United States to Uruguay Venezuela to Vietnam and many more viewers poured in 129100000 hours into watching stars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot during the week of Nov. 15 alone.

Related The best movies on Netflix

Red Notice which debuted on the streaming service after a small theatrical run (where it garnered a paltry $16200 in an international release with U.S. totals gong undisclosed) has so far been viewed for total of 277.9 million hours according to Netflix. That translates into just over 31702 years meaning if the ancient humans who first arrived in North America queued up and viewed every clocked second of Red Notice they would only be done today. It also gives Red Notice the second-strongest hourly 28-day debut in Netflix history behind 2018’s Bird Box which was viewed for 282020000 hours or 32172 years. Hurry up ancient humans!

The strong result for the action-comedy adventure was celebrated by Johnson on Instagram. The Rock suggests the movie may have already surpassed Bird Box though Netflix has yet to formally report the victory.

What does being the “biggest” movie on Netflix mean these days? In an era where major companies like Facebook have been accused of knowingly inflating video metrics and YouTube numbers can easily be exaggerated through bots tech giants’ shareable metrics always come with a grain of salt. Netflix itself has been the subject of controversy with critics noting that these internal metrics have no independent verification outside of the company.

Netflix itself has responded to some criticism of how it used to publicly measure viewership by watching the first two minutes of any given title. That metric was dropped in October in favor of measuring success based on total hours offering what the company referred to in an earnings call with shareholders as a “better read on viewing engagement and satisfaction.” And the company has hired accounting firm EY to run an audit of its rankings which it says will be released next year. While a one-time audit does not offer consistency it fits into larger industry trends of rejecting the longtime standard Nielsen ratings.

To put Red Notice which lasts 118 minutes into context let’s look at a longer movie with a huge cultural impact: Avengers: Endgame. As one number-cruncher points out based on the number of people who showed up to Endgame in the first two weeks the reported hours-viewed number for Red Notice would make it a bigger draw in its first two weeks than the Marvel blockbuster.

Endgame is 182 minutes and based on rolled-up ticket sales data sold around 349.2 million tickets meaning theater-goers watched around 1.047 billion hours of the movie. The time devoted to Endgame got even more hardcore: back in March a superfan earned a spot in the Guinness World Records by watching it 191 times in theaters. That’s roughly equal to 24 days and three hours (shout out this time data calculator) which is a long time to watch a movie but barely a blip in the evolution of humanity which is where Red Notice’s fans are reaching.

Let’s extrapolate further. Let’s say that the Marvel superfan wasn’t content with just watching Endgame but wanted to watch every MCU from Iron Man through Spider-Man: Far From Home 191 times. Even Thor: The Dark World. That’s 23 movies equaling out to 49 hours and 56 minutes as per ScreenRant’s math. That would equal out to 397 days and nine hours or about a year and a month. If he got nine friends to come along with him that would equal out to 10 years and eight months. If he got 99 True Believers to come along with him that would amount to a combined 108 years and six months worth of time. Our Marvel superfan would have to recruit 28550 MCU stans to watch 23 Marvel movies 191 times in a row to start approaching Red Notice numbers hitting 31032 years.

Such a thing isn’t out of the realm with famously devoted Marvel fans who have made the MCU an inescapable part of not just pop culture but culture culture. No longer is knowledge of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet the realm of comic book nerds. A lyrics search of Genius shows Thanos getting mentioned on Eminem and Ghostface Killah albums not to mention many many more. Is Red Notice getting this same level of pop culture devotion?

The Netflix blockbuster’s 92 percent audience approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes suggests that it is a well-liked movie despite mostly negative reviews. Netflix’s global reach gives it around 209 million subscribers. Unlike the original Marvel fan Ramiro Alanis the vast majority of Red Notice viewers didn’t have to watch the movie in theaters. The movie also banks on its tremendously popular stars like The Rock Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot whose local appeal most likely made the movie popular in Israel.

A quick scan of Rotten Tomatoes verified reviews surfaces a handful of five-star reviews for Red Notice. Take this one from Deb G which calls it “just really a fun movie. Good chemistry between the actors. Ryan Reynolds is a hoot and the Rock is solid too.” User Lisa’s five-star review says that Red Notice has a “good story line Ryan Reynolds was his typical sarcastic self lots of humor and action packed. Great movie... thoroughly enjoyed it.” The general consensus from the audience raves: The Rock Reynolds and Gadot made an enjoyable if not life-changing movie experience.

Perhaps some people are mainlining Red Notice and others are putting it on while looking at their phones and trying to ignore their cousins after Thanksgiving dinner. But the true test of Red Notice’s popularity might lie ahead. Cinemark a theater chain with hundreds of screens in America Taiwan and Brazil has announced 12 Days of Red Notice bringing the movie into domestic theaters.

“At Cinemark we love when we have the opportunity to create a cultural moment and comprehensive entertainment experience around a film” said Wanda Gierhart Fearing Cinemark Chief Marketing and Content Officer in a press statement promising “surprises giveaways and a Veteran’s Day discounted ticket offer” to sweeten the Red Notice theatrical experience.

If Red Notice is as beloved as its official numbers suggest fans might be filling up the seats no matter what. And unlike Bird Box the under-the-radar titan of Netflix’s originals game which is only getting a continuation in the form of a Spanish-langugae sidequel true success might be clearer by whether there’s a fast-tracked sequel. There’s certainly an intent — just see the end of Red Notice — but like everything in Hollywood a Red Notice 2 will only happen if the numbers make sense. And maybe they do?"

It was a fraught negotiation process described as a three-way tug-of-war between the government the digital platforms and the news media. The code has been strongly criticised by organisations – including The Conversation and SBS – that have missed out on deals even though they fall within its definition of news.

Another concern is for smaller and regional players that do not meet the $150000 threshold for a news business to qualify under the code.

In early 2022 the Department of the Treasury will start its review of the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code legislation to see if it remains fit for purpose by ensuring digital platforms contribute to the sustainability of the Australian news industry.

How will they do that given the code is yet to be put to the test?

To date no digital platforms have been designated by the treasurer under the code. If the treasurer is satisfied Google and Facebook have adequately contributed to the Australian news industry they may never be.

A range of commercial content agreements between Facebook and/or Google and news businesses have been concluded outside of the legislation. This allows their content to be provided on Google News Showcase and Facebook News Tab. No comprehensive list is available but company announcements and media coverage reveal deals have been done with The Guardian Australia Junkee News Corp Australia Schwartz Media The New Daily ABC Australian Community Media The Conversation Country Press Australia Ten Seven West Media Nine Entertainment Co. Times News Group Crikey and Solstice media and others.

These deals are commercial-in-confidence so very little is known about how much they are worth how the money will be spent and how effective they will be in supporting news businesses.

On the one hand several news organisations that struck deals with Facebook and/or Google have made announcements about hiring more journalists.

On the other hand companies have announced reductions in print services and job cuts despite striking deals with the platforms. Because of the lack of transparency it is not clear how the commercial deals struck have influenced these business decisions. It is even harder to predict the longer-term impact of these content agreements on the sustainability of the news industry and whether they will contribute to a diverse Australian news ecology.

Reviewing the code will be a major task. To explore possible options the News and Media Research Centre (N&MRC) at the University of Canberra held a Chatham House rules roundtable discussion with representatives of the news industry platforms government and the community.

The aim was to identify gaps in research to help inform media policy into the future. The bargaining code was one of the key topics discussed on the day. Based on our interpretation of those discussions and our research expertise we have come up with a list of indicators to monitor the impact of the commercial content agreements on the sustainability of news businesses and the health of the wider news environment.

Different indicators are needed to reflect the distinct accountabilities of the three key actors involved: digital platforms news businesses and government. Some of the suggested indicators below are observable and can be measured externally. Others will require collaboration with independent researchers.

Indicators to estimate the impact of the voluntary content agreements on the news industry could include:

changes in the number of journalists and other staff

closures contractions or expansions of news outlets

the size of investment in cadets and staff training.

Other important measures would be to track the volume of public interest journalism content as well as readership subscription and membership figures. In the longer term enrolments in journalism courses and their graduate employment outcomes will also provide useful indicators of the health of the industry.

The assessment of the government’s performance may include independent evaluation of current and former government support programs for the news media industry and if other countries adopt the code. For Google and Facebook they will need to satisfy the treasurer that the power imbalance has been corrected and enough has been done to help sustain the Australian news media.

It must be stressed that the news media bargaining code was never designed to be a silver bullet to fix the ailing news industry. It was part of a wider suite of supports for the news media that the ACCC recommended.

These suggested indicators are by no means exhaustive but they paint a picture of the complexity of the task at hand. It will require co-operation and collaboration between government industry and academia. After all it is journalism in the public’s interest that is at stake here.

The award-winning actor Rose Byrne and her partner Bobby Cannavale who have two young children rented the glamorous residence last year and having been given an exclusive tour for next week’s Wentworth Courier House of the Week I can confirm its star quality.

Owners Craig Carroll the Fintech founder and his wife Kathryn bought the five-bedroom four-bathroom home with double garage at 5-7 Attunga St Woollahra in 2012 for $4.6m in 2012 after a decade living in the US.

Under the guidance of Bill Shipton one of Sydney’s most acclaimed property developers (Mona Estate Darling Point Leura Bellevue Hill Yoorami Estate Bellevue Hill and Verona Double Bay) they’ve done extensive renovations and improvements to the house pool and gardens.

The couple and their three children are now relocating to the UK so the transformed home on a 1100 sqm hillside block is up for auction with a $15m price guide on December 4 via The Agency’s Ben Collier.

“It’s so rare to be just an easy stroll to the amenities of Queen Street while enjoying 1100 sqm of parklike grounds” Collier says.

While Shipton has retained the home’s architectural integrity it’s been completely modernised as a luxury home without compromising its heritage and character.

He added wraparound sandstone terraces expanded the footprint of the main house and commissioned Annie Wilkes to install garden of palm trees and ferns on the slope with a fire pit outdoor lounge area and pond.

The Carrolls have enjoyed living there. “We fell in love with the unique character of the home — its balconies balustrades romantic pool and sandstone terraces along with the open-plan rooms that spill out to the pool and gardens” they say.

“You feel like you are living in a piece of Hollywood tucked away in Woollahra.

“It’s been the perfect family residence for us and our three children with its close proximity to schools the beach parks local cafes and an easy commute to the city.”

The owners having lived in Boston and New York for many years were influenced by a classic East Coast aesthetic which is evident in the interior design of the home.

“We wanted to instil some classic Hamptons glamour so we reinstated the American oak floorboards throughout the kitchen and family living areas and installed stone bench tops and new joinery in the kitchen bathrooms and laundry” they advise.

“We also redesigned the entrance to create some formality and a sense of grandeur to the gardens with formal hedging water features and large trees.

“The house already had great bones it just needed some modernising.”

“During the lockdowns we felt so grateful to have this sanctuary with all its privacy space abundant sunlight greenery and serenity from which you could work from home and the kids could comfortably study.

“We all had plenty of space and yet we are within a five-minute walk of Queen St Village Cooper Park or Double Bay.”

The highlight for me during my tour of the house which has a north-easterly aspect so full of light was the easy access to the outdoors — every one of the bedrooms and even the garage has French doors opening to a balcony. Three of the bedrooms have ensuites and another bedroom has a bathroom right next door.

And I was most impressed by the walk-in-wardrobe in the master suite — the slickest I’ve seen since Jackie O’s in Vaucluse (It was Collier who sold the radio star her new house in Woollahra for $11m last June).

Visitors to the home would love the downstairs guest quarters which opens through French doors to the pool and is close by the kitchen.

On the other hand companies have announced reductions in print services and job cuts despite striking deals with the platforms. Because of the lack of transparency it is not clear how the commercial deals struck have influenced these business decisions. It is even harder to predict the longer-term impact of these content agreements on the sustainability of the news industry and whether they will contribute to a diverse Australian news ecology.

Reviewing the code will be a major task. To explore possible options the News and Media Research Centre (N&MRC) at the University of Canberra held a Chatham House rules roundtable discussion with representatives of the news industry platforms government and the community.

The aim was to identify gaps in research to help inform media policy into the future. The bargaining code was one of the key topics discussed on the day. Based on our interpretation of those discussions and our research expertise we have come up with a list of indicators to monitor the impact of the commercial content agreements on the sustainability of news businesses and the health of the wider news environment.

Different indicators are needed to reflect the distinct accountabilities of the three key actors involved: digital platforms news businesses and government. Some of the suggested indicators below are observable and can be measured externally. Others will require collaboration with independent researchers.

Indicators to estimate the impact of the voluntary content agreements on the news industry could include:

changes in the number of journalists and other staff

closures contractions or expansions of news outlets

the size of investment in cadets and staff training.

Other important measures would be to track the volume of public interest journalism content as well as readership subscription and membership figures. In the longer term enrolments in journalism courses and their graduate employment outcomes will also provide useful indicators of the health of the industry.

The assessment of the government’s performance may include independent evaluation of current and former government support programs for the news media industry and if other countries adopt the code. For Google and Facebook they will need to satisfy the treasurer that the power imbalance has been corrected and enough has been done to help sustain the Australian news media.

It must be stressed that the news media bargaining code was never designed to be a silver bullet to fix the ailing news industry. It was part of a wider suite of supports for the news media that the ACCC recommended.

These suggested indicators are by no means exhaustive but they paint a picture of the complexity of the task at hand. It will require co-operation and collaboration between government industry and academia. After all it is journalism in the public’s interest that is at stake here.

The award-winning actor Rose Byrne and her partner Bobby Cannavale who have two young children rented the glamorous residence last year and having been given an exclusive tour for next week’s Wentworth Courier House of the Week I can confirm its star quality.

Owners Craig Carroll the Fintech founder and his wife Kathryn bought the five-bedroom four-bathroom home with double garage at 5-7 Attunga St Woollahra in 2012 for $4.6m in 2012 after a decade living in the US.

Under the guidance of Bill Shipton one of Sydney’s most acclaimed property developers (Mona Estate Darling Point Leura Bellevue Hill Yoorami Estate Bellevue Hill and Verona Double Bay) they’ve done extensive renovations and improvements to the house pool and gardens.

The couple and their three children are now relocating to the UK so the transformed home on a 1100 sqm hillside block is up for auction with a $15m price guide on December 4 via The Agency’s Ben Collier.

“It’s so rare to be just an easy stroll to the amenities of Queen Street while enjoying 1100 sqm of parklike grounds” Collier says.

While Shipton has retained the home’s architectural integrity it’s been completely modernised as a luxury home without compromising its heritage and character.

He added wraparound sandstone terraces expanded the footprint of the main house and commissioned Annie Wilkes to install garden of palm trees and ferns on the slope with a fire pit outdoor lounge area and pond.

The Carrolls have enjoyed living there. “We fell in love with the unique character of the home — its balconies balustrades romantic pool and sandstone terraces along with the open-plan rooms that spill out to the pool and gardens” they say.

“You feel like you are living in a piece of Hollywood tucked away in Woollahra.

“It’s been the perfect family residence for us and our three children with its close proximity to schools the beach parks local cafes and an easy commute to the city.”

The owners having lived in Boston and New York for many years were influenced by a classic East Coast aesthetic which is evident in the interior design of the home.

“We wanted to instil some classic Hamptons glamour so we reinstated the American oak floorboards throughout the kitchen and family living areas and installed stone bench tops and new joinery in the kitchen bathrooms and laundry” they advise.

“We also redesigned the entrance to create some formality and a sense of grandeur to the gardens with formal hedging water features and large trees.

“The house already had great bones it just needed some modernising.”

“During the lockdowns we felt so grateful to have this sanctuary with all its privacy space abundant sunlight greenery and serenity from which you could work from home and the kids could comfortably study.

“We all had plenty of space and yet we are within a five-minute walk of Queen St Village Cooper Park or Double Bay.”

The highlight for me during my tour of the house which has a north-easterly aspect so full of light was the easy access to the outdoors — every one of the bedrooms and even the garage has French doors opening to a balcony. Three of the bedrooms have ensuites and another bedroom has a bathroom right next door.

And I was most impressed by the walk-in-wardrobe in the master suite — the slickest I’ve seen since Jackie O’s in Vaucluse (It was Collier who sold the radio star her new house in Woollahra for $11m last June).

Visitors to the home would love the downstairs guest quarters which opens through French doors to the pool and is close by the kitchen.

“Nike is progressive. They easily could have been like ‘Don’t do this. You can’t have the heel counter exposed — that needs to be covered.’ Instead they said ‘We did a collaboration to find new space'” Abloh told FN in 2017 about his take on the iconic Air Jordan 1 silhouette.

In May 2017 Abloh who died today after a cancer battle previewed the style at the Met Gala. It was an atypical version of the basketball-turned-lifestyle shoe created to showcase its features and functions. Abloh’s reimagining of the shoe had sneakerheads clamoring for a pair and that energy was further fueled by A-list celebrities wearing early pairs including Roger Federer A$AP Rocky and Bella Hadid.

It was his creativity paired with the hype around the shoe that earned Abloh’s Air Jordan 1 the coveted Shoe of the Year honor at the 2017 FN Achievement Awards.

“I know for Virgil personally that this collaboration fulfilled a lifelong dream of working with Nike” famed designer Heron Preston said at the FNAAs presenting the award to Abloh.

Not long before the awards Abloh — while in FN’s office in New York City — said the Air Jordan 1 as it released to the public almost didn’t happen.

While walking through the airport in Newark N.J. Abloh recalled that he spotted a pair of sneakers that resembled the look he had just finished designing. “I couldn’t tell if they were [Nike] Dunks or Jordans. The lightbulb went off in my head: What makes the shoes iconic is the colorway. That’s when I was like I almost made a mistake” Abloh explained.

He quickly called Nike to make changes which presented a big problem for the athletic brand. “Internally we were like ‘Could we pull this off?'” Andy Caine Nike’s VP of footwear design recalled. “When you’re producing shoes there’s a moment where you have to lock in everything to order the materials to produce the quantities. We were on top of that deadline literally two days out.”

Ultimately Nike and Abloh agreed that it needed to be done. “The powerful narrative from Virgil’s side plus the color heritage of the Jordan 1 and the story of the original colorway being banned [by the NBA in 1985] linked and made a lot of sense” Caine explained. “That’s where we came together and said ‘Let’s drive this through.'”

Although the public was enamored with Abloh’s Air Jordan 1  that excitement wasn’t lost on those who work at the brand. “There’s so much on this AJ1 that’s completely new yet completely familiar and to me that’s the magic. It has so much more depth than anyone has ever brought” Caine told FN.

And Abloh’s Air Jordan 1 wasn’t the only look he created with Nike that would make headlines in 2017.

Abloh’s Air Jordan 1 would go on to become the statement look of a 10-shoe collaboration with Nike dubbed “The Ten” which the sportswear giant would reveal three months after its Met Gala debut in August 2017.

Billed as “reconstructed 10 Nike footwear icons” the range was split into two themes. Nike said the first theme which was named “Revealing” was designed to look accessible. The second dubbed “Ghosting” was designed with translucent uppers “to further the idea of revealing and unite the second set of silhouettes through common material.”

The shoes chosen although dominated by Nike looks spanned the company’s footwear banners. In addition to the Air Jordan 1 the other non-Nike shoe that Abloh reimagined for the range was the Converse Chuck Taylor. The collection also featured new-look takes of the Air Max 90 Air Presto Air VaporMax Blazer Mid Zoom Fly SP Air Force 1 Low React Hyperdunk 2017 and Air Max 97.

“The st Virgil [Abloh] did with [Nike] is fking incredible; the deconstruction repurposing. And getting Nike to let him do that was huge. That’s one of the illest things I’ve seen in a long time. The [Jordan] 1 and the [Air] Presto are my favorites — I’m a huge Presto guy” famed sneakerhead “Hawaii” Mike Salman told FN in 2017.

In the years since Abloh and Nike delivered hit collaboration after hit collaboration. And as one would expect sneakerheads did whatever they could to get their hands on a pair. After 2017 Abloh continued to reimagine several of the shoes from “The Ten” including multiple takes of the Air Force 1 Blazer Air Max 90 and Air Max 97 to name a few.

He also gave several other Nike Inc. staples new looks. For instance Abloh — a soccer fan and player since childhood — delivered a collaborative Nike Football collection featuring the Nike Mercurial Vapor 360 boot his bold takes on the Air Zoom Tempo Next% running shoe became instant standouts the Air Jordan 4 “Sail” for women quickly became one of the most coveted sneakers in recent years and his new-look Air Jordan 5s were arguably two of the best sneakers released in 2020. And Nike delivered Abloh’s expansive Off-White x Nike Dunk range in August of this year featuring 50 different iterations of the iconic sneaker.

Abloh also often delivered messaging that was just as impactful if not more than the product he created. For instance Nike revealed the collaboration between tennis great Serena Williams and Abloh in May 2019 ahead of French Open. The superhero-themed look boasted a printed cape-jacket that featured the words “Mother Champion Queen Goddess” in French throughout.

And the relationship extended beyond footwear and apparel. In January Nike revealed “Icons” a book done in collaboration with Abloh that provided sneakerheads a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of “The Ten” which also revealed never-before-seen sneaker prototypes which include Swooshes striped away from Air Jordans and reapplied with new materials. It also showcased original text messages between Abloh and Nike designers and looks from the Nike archives.

Abloh the prolific designer who founded and built Off-White into a formidable brand and made a huge mark at Louis Vuitton as the men’s artistic director died on Sunday at age 41. His death was confirmed by LVMH in a statement.

“We are heartbroken by the news of Virgil Abloh’s passing. Since 2016 Virgil has been a beloved member of the Nike Jordan and Converse family. He was a creative force who shared a passion for challenging the status quo pushing forward a new vision while inspiring multiple generations along the way. But more than a collaborator colleague and prolific creative Virgil was a husband father son brother and friend. We are proud to call him family. We offer our condolences to the many who shared a connection. He will be greatly missed” Nike wrote in a statement on Instagram.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWVuc2hlYWx0aG1hZy5jb20vZml0bmVzcy9nMzgwMjQxMDAvYmxhY2stZnJpZGF5LXNuZWFrZXItZGVhbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Black Friday Cyber Monday 2021 Sneaker Deals: Nike Adidas,"Women's Health may earn commission from the links on this page but we only feature products we believe in.

HIRAM Ga. — A derailed train is blocking roads in downtown Hiram. It derailed late Saturday night at around 10:30 p.m. according to Norfolk Southern.

The train is derailed between Highway 92 and Church Street closing the local roads in downtown. Traffic is detoured. The Paulding County Sheriff’s Office sent a notice to residents asking them to avoid parts of downtown Hiram.

Hiram Fire Department said two people were inside one of the three locomotives and one needed to be extricated because of a knee injury. Norfolk Southern said the conductor and engineer were both were taken to the hospital and have been released.

Seven of the train's 88 cars derailed but Norfolk Southern said they remained upright. While the cards didn't have any hazardous material some of the 4000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled from the overturned locomotive. The company said in a statement they do not expect any environmental impact and said there was no threat to the community.

Paulding County Officials said the train was previously carrying ethanol but those cars were empty.

The Southern Health Trust is currently in the process of providing the facilities.

It has indicated “a minimum of six” will be commissioned and ready for use by the end of the current financial year.

The information was provided by Health Minister Robin Swann in response to a question by Newry and Armagh DUP Assemblyman William Irwin.

He provided a breakdown of what was available for staff use in terms of electric charging infrastructure.

All but the Western Trust either have – or are in the process of developing – charging points for their staff.

In relation to the Southern Trust it does not intend to limit the introduction of charging points to Craigavon.

As Minister Swann explained: “They are also looking at the feasibility of installing other points at main sites and currently assessing available electrical infrastructure and capacity.

“The Trust hope to be in a position to install charges points across more sites in 2022/23.”

The Belfast Trust provides five electric vehicle charge points for both patient and staff use – two at Belfast City Hospital two at Musgrave Park Hospital and one at the Mater Hospital.

The Northern Trust implemented a pilot scheme at Antrim Area Hospital with two electric vehicle charge points installed solely for staff use. Such was the success of this scheme that further charge points are currently being rolled out across the estate with completion during the 2021/22 financial year.

The South Eastern Trust provides two electric vehicle charge points with two chargers each at Ards Community Hospital with one charger and two charging points at both Lagan Valley Hospital and Downe/Downshire Hospitals and three charges each with two charging points at the Ulster Hospital.

And according to Mr Swann a further 15 charging units are now available which the Trust intends to use in conjunction with the purchase of electric fleet vehicles for use by responding operational community nurses.

The Western Health Trust currently has no electric vehicle charging points available for staff on any sites.

But it has been working on a proposal that involves both moving towards electric vehicles for the Trust’s transport fleet and supporting staff with charging points for their own vehicles.

In relation to the charging points for staff the Trust is working through issues in relation to how best to manage this “whilst dealing with any revenue/taxable benefit in kind implications”.

Added Minister Swann: “The Trust has recently purchased its first two electric vehicles as part of the Trust’s transport fleet and has installed two charging stations in the transport compound to support these.”

Mikel Arteta was delighted after his team rewarded his trust (Zac Goodwin/PA)

Mikel Arteta hailed Arsenal’s young Gunners for repaying his “real trust” to hit back from their Liverpool humbling and sink Newcastle 2-0.

Bukayo Saka netted the opener only to hobble out with a thigh problem before his replacement Gabriel Martinelli delivered a sumptuous second.

Arsenal were hammered 4-0 by Liverpool at Anfield last weekend leading to a difficult week’s training for the Gunners’ fast-developing talents.

Newcastle offered organised resistance for the first half but once Arsenal exploited the inside forward channels the home side swept to victory as stylish as it was simple.

“The second half we had to be patient not to lose structure in our play” said Arsenal boss Arteta.

“But we needed to threaten much more in certain spaces and we did.

“You have to try to give the players confidence after difficult moments – if not it’s not real trust.

“I thought they deserved another chance and they’ve done it today.

“They showed in the week how much they were hurting after that defeat and how much they wanted to put it right today.”

Emile Smith Rowe could have put Arsenal ahead early in the clash only to head straight at Martin Dubravka.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had no excuses for missing the rebound however tapping against the outside of the post from point-blank range when it appeared easier to score.

Arsenal targeted the channels after the break rightly identifying points of weakness in the Newcastle system.

And the ruse twice paid full dividend leaving boss Arteta impressed with his side’s fortitude.

“The finish and the combination from Bukayo and the composure to place the ball in the right area was excellent” said Arteta.

“And Gabby’s great movement run the ball as well the technique to keep the ball down and have that quality to finish it’s impressive.”

With Saka’s injury concern the only blot on an otherwise positive day Arteta added: “He said he felt something and he wasn’t comfortable to continue.

“We’ll have to assess him tomorrow and scan him to see if there’s an injury.

“He felt something muscular so let’s see.”

Eddie Howe centre saw his side well beaten (John Walton/PA)

Eddie Howe insisted his Newcastle side deserved a penalty when Callum Wilson went down in the Arsenal box in the second half.

The officials both live and in review dismissed the incident but Howe was adamant Wilson would not have turned down a chance to shoot on goal.

Asked if decisions generally went against his side Howe said: “I’d say that’s a fair assessment but it’s just my gut feeling.

“I’m not seeking any controversy here but the 50-50 calls tended to go against us.

“Against top clubs away from home that can happen.

“When Callum gets goal-side of the defender in on goal I don’t think he’s going to go down in that situation unless he’s fouled.

“The key moment came with that one-on-one.”

Newcastle have now leaked 29 goals in 13 Premier League matches remaining both winless and rooted to the foot of the table.

Howe still believes he can turn the situation on its head however having just taken the St James’ Park helm.

“When you’re lacking in confidence you’ll naturally attract criticism and we’ll have to take that and be broad-shouldered” he said.

“But if we stay committed like we were today then we will have a chance.

“We can only do our talking on the pitch and try to fight back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vd2h5LW1vcmUtcGVvcGxlLWFyZS10YWtpbmctaW50ZXJlc3QtaW4tY29jb251dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why more people are taking interest in coconut,"Experts explain how farmers can reap maximum profits For several years Alhaji Muftau Oyelekan who lives and farms in Badagry has been a coconut farmer.…

Experts explain how farmers can reap maximum profits

For several years Alhaji Muftau Oyelekan who lives and farms in Badagry has been a coconut farmer. It was inherited from his parents and his children are also into coconut farming and processing. Every year he harvests coconuts from his trees and sells every part of it from the flesh the water/milk to the shell and the husk. He does this four to six times in a year.

As he and other coconut farmers harvest the customers are already there waiting with their trucks. Some are from the Northern part of the country some from the East and people from other Southwestern states also take their trucks to Badagry to buy coconuts in their hundreds.

When the coconut farmer is busy and cannot arrange for a climber during harvest the customers arrange for it as they are already waiting. They assist in ensuring a smooth harvest including assisting the climbers to get the coconuts down from the tree.

Investment

Many would wonder what is special about coconut to attract people to Badagry and other parts of Lagos? Driving home his reasons for investing in the cash crop Oyelekan who is a Director at Biodun Eko farm Ltd emphasized there has been an increase in the demand for coconut from all parts of the country. People troop into Lagos to purchase it during harvest.

“People don’t know what they are losing by not investing in coconut. Anyone who invests in coconut will surely have their money back. It drives in money both the fresh and processed ones. If you have up to 50 coconut trees relax because you are in money.”

Farming

Why do people visit Lagos to buy Coconuts? According to brainly.in coconut trees only grow in tropical climates and are likely to be found in coastal areas. The trees require regular rainfall to grow and also they only grow in sandy soil.

The past president of Lagos State Apex Fadama Community Association Alhaji Muftau Oyelekan mentioned that in the past once a seedling has been planted it takes a coconut tree six to 10 years to be ready for harvesting. Nowadays there are improved varieties which make a coconut ready to be harvested within three and half to four years.

The coconut plant which can stand for at least a 100 years according to Oyelekan can be harvested between four to six times in a year under very good management.

“As a coconut farmer there are a lot of things that can be done to enhance the growth of a coconut seedling. After planting coconut organic manure is needed as a raw fertilizer. We don’t use inorganic. Asides that we water during the dry season. It is best to establish a coconut farm or plantation during the rainy season if it is done during the dry season it will become dry. Before the next season it is fully established all that is required is to maintain the weeds around it” Oyelekan lectured.

He emphasised that coconuts are managed seasonally. Due to the long term of harvest it is usually advisable to inter-crop by planting other crops besides it which could be cassava maize or other things. As the farmer is maintaining the other crops the coconut farms are equally maintained.

Why coconuts are so important

The coconut trees as well as their products are widely sought after as various products could be derived from the tree right from the leaves down to the root. It provides food fuel cosmetics folk medicine and building materials among many other uses.

In a more vivid explanation dengarden.com described the products from coconut as; flesh (from this individuals eat it as food and derive milk and process flour from it). The water inside the coconut is highly sought after in beaches and other parts of the country due to its medicinal use. The oil is used by some for cooking as a skincare product and for hair growth. The shells are used by some in making crafts and it is used to steam food. The husk is used by some as a natural scrubber a craft material and it serves as a rope too. The tree leaves are used for thatching while the sticks are used in making brooms used in sweeping homes and the environment.

“The coconut water flesh husk and shell are raw materials for so many companies. Coconut shells are being used as mosquito coils and a lot of factories are looking for them. The shell can be used for so many designs and interior decorations. The coconut flesh itself where oil is derived is anti-cancer. Some use coconut oil for their cooking. A lot of restaurants are looking for coconut oil Oyelekan related.

A coconut processor Mrs. Zainab Adebowale Alogba on her part hinted that after using the flesh the coconut shell is sold to those who use it for various things including making an activated charcoal a main ingredient used for all types of batteries such as car inverter and other batteries.

Latest intervention

Few days ago the Lagos State government signed a 200000 dollars Unilateral Trust Fund Agreement (UTF) with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN (FAO-UN) for development of the coconut value chain.

This agreement was part of efforts by the state to plant 10 million productive coconut trees within the next five years with a projection of over 800 million husked nuts with potential economic value of over N120bn which could be tripled to a tune of N360bn worth of transactional volume with value addition.

The General Manager Lagos State Coconut Development Authority (LASCODA) Mr Dapo Olakulehin admitted that in the past coconut was grown in the wild along the beaches and people just harvested it. Now there are lots of farmers who are deliberately cultivating coconut as if they are cultivating oil palm.

Lagos has over three million coconut trees out of which more than two million are active and productive in Badagry Ojo Epe Apapa Ibeju Lekki among others.

The Coconut Agency boss in his estimation stated that at the moment the farmers that are cultivating coconut in hectares and are doing it commercially are about 100 in Epe and Badagry while the peasant farmers who plant in the traditional way on the other hand are close to 40000 across the state.

Categorizing Coconut products he noted that from each coconut the edible and non-edible products can be derived. The edible products he emphasised are left in the hands of small-scale processors so they can thrive instead of having gigantic coconut factories.

“The non-edible the husk and shell on the other hand is technologically driven. From the husk we can get more than 120 products. Without a coconut husk a greenhouse for farming cannot be built. One of the products from the husk is used in greenhouse farming.

“We are working with the private sector to establish a coconut husk processing factory so they can process the husk to get various products.”

Olakulehin acknowledged that from the shell so many products can be derived too including coconut charcoal. The shell is a waste to many but it can be converted. Coconut charcoal is one of the best in terms of quality more than that of wood charcoal. It can be used as a water treatment a source of energy.

“Using coconut shells for charcoal will reduce deforestation and we will be less dependent on wood for charcoal.”

He explained “These two non-edibles are technological driven which the small-scale processors cannot do. To achieve it it will be private sector driven. Ours is to create an enabling environment. One factory will be at Epe/Ibeju Lekki axis and the other one at Badagry axis. If the factories are put in place it can give direct employment to close to 2000 people. We have gotten one or two investors. All things being equal the Badagry factory will kick off in 2022.”

LASCODA boss further revealed “We are training youths on coconut arts and crafts. We have trained close to 1000 youths so far and some have taken up the business for survival. There is no way someone can do a coconut business alone. Even when processing as low as 20 coconuts you cannot crack it yourself. It is a labour-friendly value chain” he indicated.

Challenges

Mrs Alogba explained that though coconut derivatives are profitable it comes with its challenges.

“There is no support from the government for marketing. If the government can give take off grants it will make it easier. If the export promotion council can get us market outside Nigeria it will go a long way. NAFDAC SON for instance are only after registration and renewal with a huge amount of money. The economic situation in the country also affects us. An average Nigerian is only after how to put food on the table not in using coconut.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vZ2lkYW4tZ2FsYS13aGVyZS13b21lbi1naXJscy1hcmUtZXhwbG9pdGVkLWFidXNlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gidan Gala: Where women girls are exploited abused,"A long way from home some girls and women looked for greener pastures in local entertainment houses popularly known as Gidan Gala. However their hopes…

A long way from home some girls and women looked for greener pastures in local entertainment houses popularly known as Gidan Gala. However their hopes were dashed when their expectations turned nightmares leaving many with deep scars of regrets. Daily Trust on Sunday goes undercover to investigate the abuse and exploitations of girls at Gidan Gala in Kaduna and Abuja.

Talatu (not real name) left her hometown in Bauchi following a small family tiff for Abuja where she went in search of greener pastures: make money and maybe get access into the Kannywood industry.

Thinking Gidan Gala will help actualize her dream she pushed her way in and soon became a household name. Several years later Talatu is neither a Kannywood actor nor rich. Instead she is left with profound regret for leaving her hometown for Abuja where she said she has suffered a lot with almost nothing to show as a benefit.

Talatu now lives as a single mother left with the responsibilities of providing for the needs of her little daughter.

“We were like slaves” she said remorsefully.

Gidan Drama Gidan Solo or Gidan Gala is the name given to the old local Hausa entertainment houses that are now gathering momentum in major cities across Nigeria including Abuja.

Gidan Gala became more popular after some of their artistes such as Shuaibu Lilisco that started gala and Sani Musa Mai Iska graduated to become popular Kannywood stars; thus making it a breeding ground for Kannywood actors and actresses.

Outwardly these places seem normal going by the performances put up but investigations show they are a cover mission as the girls are mere sex workers.

The ‘chairmen’ exploit the girls beating them at the slightest misstep which could be anything he fancies among other abuses and if they fail to generate money for them.

There are claims that the places have the backing of security agencies who receive ‘returns’ (bribe) periodically from the operators. It is also alleged that proprietors use ‘charms’ to hold unto the girls that fetch them more money.

To get to the root of what is actually happening our reporter investigated some selected houses and reports what is actually transpiring.

Undercover mission to Gidan Gala

Within Magadishu area close to Ahmadu Bello Way in Kaduna metropolis there are no fewer than three Gidan Gala.

In Abuja there are Gidan Gala at Zuba there are two at Daki-Biyu Jabi Nyanya Kubwa and other areas attracting a high population of northerners as patrons and operators.

At ‘Yan Doya Gidan Gala in Kaduna our reporter paid his entrance fee instead of a ticket. On entering the place there were many young girls and boys; and many adults already seated.

The show started at exactly 4pm and 6pm the MC announced that they would go for a break to enable people to pray the Maghrib prayer.

At Galaxy Gidan Gala at Kaduna tickets were availed and our reporter purchased one at N200.

A girl our reporter met there told him the show would start by 8pm.

“Are you one of the artistes here?” our reporter asked.

“Yes. Can I help you?”

“I see you’re smoking a cigarette where did you buy it from?”

“It is over there” she said pointing at a small kiosk.

“What about weed or codeine and other hard drugs. Can I get them there?”

“No you can’t. The dealers come in and you can only buy them if you are a regular here. They are hiding it” she said.

Show starts

At exactly quarter to 8pm the show started at Galaxy Gidan Gala. All the entertainers came out and danced in what they called ‘all artistes’; and after that the girls were asked to come and greet the audience and get some money to pay what they call dressing money (kudin wanka).

Those who pay are allowed to come on the stage and select the music they want to dance to. As you are dancing the onlookers spray money on you. That is what is done for all the artistes. And at the end the MC who is the chairman of the house will ask the audience to come and ‘bail’ the artiste. Fan then take turns to bail the artiste.

With the help of fixers our reporter was able to convince some girls to speak to him after a long ‘bargain’.

You must be like a prostitute to get money – Rabi

Rabi is a 22-year-old young woman who said she started acting in gidan gala when she was 15.

She said she started acting in Gidan Gala in Abuja before relocating to Kaduna.

“It was my friend that introduced me. The first day I danced one Alhaji sprayed money on me. After the show the chairman asked me to go and thank him. I went and he asked for my contact but I didn’t have a phone then. The next day he came again sprayed more money on me and gave me a phone. After the show I thanked him again and he said he would take me out. I said to him I am not a prostitute I was just there to get money.

“The next day he refused to spray money on me. That was when my friend called me and told me the standard. She said if I truly wanted money then the money the chairman would be paying me will not be anything” she said.

“I have to be doing my runs with men to get money. And that was how I started going to that Alhaji. On the first day he gave me N20000.

“Before I realized it I became an expert runs girl. If you spray money on me and you want me to go out with you we will bargain and I will go with you.”

Is your chairman aware of the runs you are doing? Our reporter asked Rabi.

“Yes he is aware. Everybody knows. Nobody will come and spray money like N100000 or even more on you for nothing. What the chairman wants is the money they are spraying not what will happen.

“The arrangement is that the chairman rents a house for his artistes. He will warn you not to bring men to the house. But you can go out and meet them.”

On the allegation that the chairmen seized money the girls make going out with men Rabi said “No they don’t seize it. But if you are in love with a male artiste we call it (soyayya da dan solo) which means love between male and female solo artistes they don’t get money outside what the chairmen give them. So in that case some give them money out of what they got outside. But I can’t do that. You will become like husband and wife. In many cases the guys maltreat the girls.

“You will go out with a man give your body to him get money and bring it to your lover. He will also sleep with you collect your money and even beat you at the slightest mistake. In most cases if you hear of abortion it is from pregnancy in this kind of relationship” she said.

On the allegation that the police collect bribe at such places Rabi said “If the chairman knows what he is doing he must be settling the police. So they hardly come and arrest us.

“I was once arrested in Kaduna. But other than that I have never seen any arrest.”

On drug abuse she said “I can confidently tell you that one-third of the artistes are drug addicts. It was there that I was introduced to drugs. In some cases our chairman tells us not to take drugs because if the police who come in mufti see us dancing and notice we are high on something there could be a problem.”

On the sale of drugs Rabi said “in the house I am staying now we used to smoke shisha and even weed in the open. But now the chairman has stopped that. But we still smoke but not as freely as before. We know the dealers; you can go and buy what you want to buy without anybody knowing. If you want to smoke you sneak into a toilet or go and find a place where the chairman will not see you.”

On whether the chairmen go to bed with the girls Rabi said “They do. If he wants to sleep with you he will ask you out. If you refuse which is very unlikely he will hate you. And sometimes he will ask you to go out with his friend especially if the friend is fund of spraying money on the dance floor.

Asked if she has aborted a pregnancy she said “Haba! If you know what you are doing you will not get pregnant. But I had accompanied many of my friends to go and abort pregnancies.”

Asked if she knew the number of men that slept with her she laugh and said “how? I can’t. To be frank with you I get a lot of money from this gala. And most of the money I get is from my runs not dancing.”

On the allegation that the chairmen are using charm on them she said “Yes they are doing that. I know I have tried many times to quit but couldn’t. But I have the feeling that it is perhaps because I am enjoying it now not necessarily a charm.

“I am planning to quit in the near future though. I want to marry and settle down.”

I escaped killing in Port Harcourt – Maryam

Maryam (not her real name) is another gala artist who has spent more than eight years in the industry crisscrossing Maiduguri Abuja Port Harcourt and Abia.

She was lured by a friend who said she will introduce her to Hausa film but instead of film Maryam is now a drug addict that narrowly escaped being killed in one of the crises in Port Harcourt.

“My friend took me to Maiduguri to start a Hausa film. On my arrival I was asked to dance which I refused to but the chairman threatened to send me out. That was how I started.

“The first day I danced the name of the place is Home Theatre in Maiduguri. I got money but I suffered. In no time I became a runs girl.

“The first day one man asked me out I refused. The next day he paid the chairman and asked the chairman to make sure I was molested on the floor. And I was so molested in front of the crowd. I will never forget that in my life.

“After that I still refuse to follow him and you know there are people that are spending a lot of money if they want you and you refuse they will stop spraying money. And the chairman will be angry with you. I was later locked in one small cage they call cell. It was then that a man bailed me out and started spraying money for me.

“You see I had no option than to start doing the normal thing to avoid the abuse and molestation. Some guys will come direct and ask for sex. Some will ask for love relationship we call (dadiro) where he will camp you in his house. You will come and perform and after performing you will go back to his house. You will be staying with him like his wife.”

On drugs she said “it was my friend that took me there that introduced me to drugs. Now I smoke anything. From Maiduguri I went to Abuja and from Abuja to Port Harcourt then to Abia all for gala.”

My worst experience

“It was at Port Harcourt. My boyfriend kept me in a room at Eleme Junction. He bought me food and drugs and whenever he is around he will come and spend the night with me.

“One fateful night I was alone in the room when NDLEA operative storm the room and arrested me. At their office I called him and he said he will not come. After serious begging and beating they released me. When I came out the Obibo crisis broke out. I saw many corpses at Obadu junction. That was my worst experience.

“Another bad experience was when my chairman at Abuja asked me for sex and I refused because he liked too many girls and if you are with him you can never follow another man. He will not pay you much and he will not allow you to go out and get money. So I refused. He started molesting me.”

On the allegation that they used charm on them she said “it is not an allegation they are using charm. Girls hardly run away. Even if you run you will come back except if you are lucky. Even the audience if you start going there you will hardly stop it. Some girls will spend up to five years without going back home.

“But I am praying for God to help me and get me out of this. I want to marry.”

Gidan Gala is like slavery – Talatu

Talatu left Bauchi State for Abuja. She told our reporter that acting in Gidan Gala is the worst thing she has ever done in her life.

Talatu acted for many years before she retired after realizing she is only wasting her time helping other people to get rich. She left Bauchi because of a small family misunderstanding but here she is now full of regret with no money to show and has to do petty work to cater for her needs and that of her daughter.

“All that you are talking about is real. The girls in Gidan Gala are prostitutes. And you must just do it that way.

“The way they are doing it is that when you are dancing on the floor guys will be spraying money on you. After the show the chairman of the house will ask you to go and thank the people that sprayed you. That is where you will make your arrangement with the man spraying money on you if he is a newcomer. If you wish you will follow him to his house or a hotel.

“But in some cases you must follow him because if you refuse to follow him he will not come back to the place again and that is a big loss to the chairman. So he will force you to go with him.”

So the leaders of the house are the ones pushing the girls to become sex workers? our reporter asked.

“Yes they are. They don’t have any problem with that. It is the money they want. You know all the money people sprayed for the artist are for the chairman. The only money that is fully yours is the one you get when you follow a guy out. So if you want to get money you just have to be following men out.”

“I left Bauchi to Abuja not knowing where to go. It was one okada man that took me to the Gidan Gala. I stayed at Shagari Villa Gidan Gala that is at Yan Lemu for a very long time before I went to Bayelsa State to continue there in one Gidan Jogodo house.

My worst experience

“While at Bayelsa we had a small disagreement with my chairman. I was sick and I told him I cannot perform that day and he said I must perform. For just that disagreement he started beating me and even hit me with a stick on my eye. I thought I will lose my eye that day. I ran out and called one of my guys who is a soldier that took me to his house and later took me to hospital.”

On drug abuse Talatu said “majority of the artistes are drug addicts. That is why they hardly save money. Some of them cannot perform unless they are high.

On pregnancy and abortion she said “That is very common. This is a group of people living together both boys and girls some sleeping together in one room. Even when I left Bayelsa back to Abuja some of my friends were pregnant; some have even given birth.

“But at Shagari Villa in Abuja our chairman late Shagari did not allow pregnancy. If you are pregnant he will give you money to go and abort it.”

Regret advice to young girls

“My main regret is how I worked for many years just to get money for someone else. In a gidan gala they can get between N200000 and N500000 a day using us as their tools. We are the ones who dance for the audience but the money sprayed is for him. He only pays us some token.

“I am now regretting all the years I wasted. The chairmen are getting rich while we only suffer. It is even better to go into full-time prostitution than to go to Gidan Gala because at least in prostitution the whole money is yours. Not this one that you will join both prostitution and working for someone to get rich.

So I will advise young girls to know what they are doing. The earlier the better for them.

How I started Gala-Lilisco

Shuaibu Lilisco a veteran Kannywood actor said he is the one that started gala.

In a chat with our reporter he said the way the gala is going on now is not what he started saying they have derailed.

“We started gala in 1999. I was the one that named it gala. Before it was stage drama and ‘koroso’ dance.

“I was the first person that started modern music and dance in Hausa film in my movie ‘Dashen Allah’ with my friend Sani Musa Mai Iska. So after the film I organized a show in Lale Cinema in Kano and instead of the usual stage drama I brought stereo speakers and we played songs and danced and I called it gala.

“It was supposed to be a one-day show but people seeing a new thing begged us to continue and we had to do the show for three days straight. It was after that that many places started organising gala shows. So that is how it started.

“It was mainly for entertainment reasons. That was why it is usually in the evening and up till now it is an evening thing because it is assumed people have closed from work and are exhausted. So they go to the gala places and catch some fun.”

On how the event has derailed he said “there are a lot of differences between what we started and what is happening now. During our time the girls wore decent clothes and there is space between the girls and the boys if they are dancing. But now some girls even wear a pair of short trousers and even skin tight to dance. What we did we considered our tradition and religion but now they are only after the entertainment aspect.”

On the allegation that gala is now a hiding place for criminals and sex workers in the guise of entertainers he said “This problem is common in some houses. If you go to some gala places you will think you are in a jungle of smokers. And I think it is the fault of the chairmen.”

Advice

“I will advise the chairmen to retrace their steps and take full control. They shouldn’t allow people to be engaging in immorality. They should tell them the business they are doing.

“And on the girls that are acting they should encourage them to seek for their parents’ consent. If they didn’t they should take them to their parents and tell the parents what their children are doing. If the parents agree they should also help the girls by encouraging them to save some money and help themselves. And most importantly they should be advising the girls to get married in time.”

How we are handling our artistes – Chairman

In a phone interview with our reporter the chairman of Freedom Theatre in Lagos Alhaji Mamuda Akashe said they have standing orders on receiving artistes.

He said “There are leaders in all gala houses. If you want to start you will have to register with Art and Culture or at least meet some leaders of the industry and ask them.”

On receiving new artistes he said “If a new artiste arrives we have those that will receive him and brief him. We will ask him which gala house he is coming from and if he is an artiste. We will then call them to verify his claim. We will also ask for his parents’ address where we will call and confirm his details.

“You see in our place smoking and other forms of drug abuse are not allowed. And no artiste is allowed to go out without permission.”

On the allegation that the girls go out as runs girls he said “we have a house where we keep them. We do not stay with them but we try our best to look after them. If we notice any bad thing we try to stop it by all means by advising them and other ways.

“If you are in love with one of our artistes we connect them up with their parents. In our place we have connected more than 10 marriages. I travelled to Niger Republic with one of our artistes after a guy said he loved her and they got married. So we are not doing things anyhow.”

He however said some chairmen are not doing the right thing. “I am calling on such chairmen to please respect these children. In the near future they are housewives and mothers. So they deserve respect from their chairmen. Don’t allow anybody to disrespect them because of money.

“We know that in some houses the chairmen treat the girls like animals. They expose them to all sorts of abuse and molestation. They send the girls to the people that spray them with money. That is bad. Nobody will try that with us.”

He also called on the government to invest in them saying they can do well in producing films and other cultural activities if given the capital and orientation.

We are different from them – Kaduna film industry chairman

Speaking with our reporter the chairman of Kaduna film industry Kadawood Nura MC said “Before we were together because most old Hausa film actors started from stage drama. But as time went on it was observed that most of the gala artistes most especially the girls are independent girls or runs girls.

“That started affecting our industry negatively which was why the film industry introduced registration where in the form your parents must sign. That was how they had no option but to leave. So now most of our actors are coming from their parents’ homes and are under their care.

“Most gala artistes have a bad image. So we have no relationship with them anymore. We however still use the boys that dance for them in our background dance in our movies.”

Government should do something about gala houses – Girls rights advocate

Speaking over the phone with our reporter the Women Leader of International Northern Women Forum (AHAD) Peace Ambassador and girl child rights activist Hajiya Ummi Mohammad said the girls in gala places are exposed to a slavery of sorts.

“As a girl child rights activist and a mother this issue of Gidan Gala is very disturbing. It has been disturbing us for long. This is a place you will find girls between the age of say 14 or 15 to 18 years. Their so-called chairmen will camp them in a place.

Their work is to come on the stage in the evening to dance. You see a girl dance to a point that she is very tired. And after the show their leaders will ask people from the crowd to come and bail them. And they know that if a man bails a girl he will take her to his place. This is a big problem. It is also at the gala houses that they learn drug abuse.”

She then called on government to check the activities of the gala houses. “Government should do something. These girls are exploited and are molested in a very cheap manner. They are forced to endure and the leaders that get more of the money.

“I recently traveled to Nasarawa State and the place I went to was close to a gala house. Even the people close to them are suffering because they disturb them with noise and music late into the night. This is a big challenge to us as mothers and should be to government.”

‘Why we are patronising Gidan Gala’

One Abdul (not real name) a regular patron of gidan gala in Seme Border and Alaba Rago of Lagos State spoke to our reporter said the leaders of the places are just using the girls to enrich themselves.

“You can’t go and spray money on a girl for nothing. They know if you spray money for them they will follow you after the show. You this is prostitution” he said.

Another patron who also preferred anonymity said such places are aiding girls to run away from home and later find it difficult to marry.

He said some of the girls ran away from their hometowns because they didn’t want to stay with their husbands and so they find the places as hideaway from their parents and relatives.

He however said the patronizers spend money unnecessarily on the girls. “That is why when a wife discovers that her husband goes to gidan gala trouble always ensued. This is because in most cases the money they spend or spray at the gala house they hardly spend it on their wives” he added.

We have our men undercover in their midst – Police

Reacting Kaduna State Police PPRO ASP Muhammad Jalige in a phone interview with our reporter said “We used to raid those places some times because criminals hide there. And drug dealers also go there because they get customers there. But we have our surveillance teams that are together with them in mufti. Whenever they see something wrong they effect arrest. After the arrest we will interrogate them and take those found wanting to court.”

On the allegation that police officers collect bribe to allow criminal activities he said “Police is not so bad that our men will collect bribe from prostitutes. All we know is that our undercover teams go there. And if they detect anything wrong they arrest and bring the culprit to us. We will later screen them and free the ones that are innocent. By so doing we have tracked from among them some criminals we have been looking for over a long time after they have been trying to evade arrest.”

New Mexico State University

LAS CRUCES - Engineering students at New Mexico State University are working with aerospace industry leader Northrop Grumman on projects that may someday solve issues for military and commercial satellite missions with CubeSats — miniature space vehicles that have a big impact on our lives today and the promise of even more for the future.

This multi-disciplinary endeavor started in fall 2019 is led by Steven Stochaj interim department head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering; and Hyeongjun Park assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. It came about through discussions with Christopher Long NMSU engineering alumnus and former vice president of National Security Systems at Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. Long also serves on the College of Engineering Executive Advisory Council.

Northrop Grumman made a grant to NMSU in fall 2019 for engineering students to work on satellite alignment system and space maneuvering. The two-year project was extended one year due to the pandemic and plans call to apply for renewal when the grant ends in spring 2022. The ultimate goal is to launch two CubeSats that can align and dock.

“They are looking for autonomous docking of satellites” said Stochaj who is also NMSU’s NanoSat Lab director. “They have huge military satellites and when they run out of fuel for example they need to dock with another satellite to refuel. In theory they do this while staying in orbit but there is the tug of the sun and the tug of the moon and the Earth is not exactly round so it is really difficult for the satellites to stay in position. Some of these satellites are car-sized. It’s not an easy thing to do.”

In addition to refueling there are a lot of things that small satellites can do such as on-orbit services repair malfunctioning space craft or manufacturing in space. The space industry is using smaller and smaller devices. But Stochaj pointed out future opportunities in commercial and military applications from providing internet connectivity to operations.

CubeSats are small built from aluminum units of standard dimensions approximately 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm (just shy of four-inches square) and typically weigh less than 3 pounds per unit. They can be constructed in combination up to 24 units. Because of their small size and weight they are easier and less expensive to launch as a payload on a rocket.

The advantages afforded by these small space vehicles also face the biggest challenges – they cannot use large components or actuators or big thrusters. The onboard CPU is small and limited so they can’t function at the same level as much larger satellites.

Park director of Robotics Unmanned Vehicles and Intelligent systems CONtrol Lab (RUVICON Lab) said the students are developing technologies for autonomous rendezvous using an optical alignment system for satellites.

They are using algorithms with two CubeSats – one being the target and the other the being imager. The target CubeSat will have five LEDs attached one for each corner and one in the middle. The imager CubeSat equipped with a high-quality camera takes pictures of the target to find the its position with respect to the imager. Both CubeSats can align with each other.

“In addition to alignment we are looking at docking” said Stochaj. “One of our students had the idea to use electromagnets to draw the satellites together which are smaller lighter and gentler than robotic arms that have been used. Northrop Grumman liked this idea and expanded the scope of the projects.”

Once the project is ready Stochaj and Park will apply to have the CubeSats grab a “rideshare” on a rocket launch. The NASA CubeSat program provides opportunities for small satellites to fly on rockets as auxiliary payloads on previously planned missions.

It won’t be the first time an NMSU engineering small satellite has been launched in space. The SmallSat program now led by Stochaj was started by former NMSU engineering professor Steve Horan in 2001. Horan’s Three-Corner Cube mission won the first Air Force Research Laboratory University NanoSat Competition earning a launch opportunity from the Air Force.

Stochaj and Park joined forces in 2018 when Park was hired at NMSU and have received SmallSat funding from NASA the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Research Laboratory.

For the current Northrop Grumman project alone Stochaj estimates there have been close to 75 students involved through their senior design projects (required for all engineering students) along with the Student Satellite group and a few computer science students.

“Mechanical and aerospace engineering students learn orbital mechanics and space craft dynamics and control so they know how to control spacecraft and how to design spacecraft but there are a lot of sensors and electronic equipment that require the skills of electrical engineering students. Also we need computer science and astronomers for science missions. This CubeSat project has a combination of students from engineering and science” said Park.

During the kickoff meeting for the projects the Northrop Grumman innovative technology team indicated they wanted to test some of their components in space using these CubeSats Park explained. “For them it’s a really good opportunity to test because students will develop those CubeSats and then if they provide some components that need near-space certification in space flight. it’s a great benefit for both sides.”

The relationship offers benefits and opportunities for the students with the company.

“They want to develop workforce for space engineering” Park said. “They are in a way developing brand loyalty for students to work in their company. Having students understand the complexities of this industry makes them very valuable employees. It is really a big investment in student talent.”

Stochaj noted a couple of students have already been offered employment by the company.

“This is like an internship for these students while they are at school” Stochaj said. “You just can’t say how important this is to students. It’s hard to identify student specialties initially but this offers an opportunity for cross-training in a real-world experience. This kind of experience gives students that extra factor that will expand their opportunities in industry and academia.”

“Now is the New Space Era” said Park. “With companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin and in Las Cruces Virgin Galactic it’s a new era for aerospace engineering.”

During a “consent to fuel” review held Wednesday Nov. 24 mission managers gave approval to begin the propellant loading process at the French Guiana spaceport the following day.

“Additional testing was conducted this week to ensure the observatory’s health following an incident that occurred when the release of a clamp band caused a vibration throughout the observatory” NASA said in a statement Wednesday.

The start of propellant loading keeps the $9.7 billion James Webb Space Telescope on track for liftoff Dec. 22 aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket. The half-hour launch window opens at 7:20 a.m. EST (1220 GMT; 9:20 a.m. French Guiana time).

The propellant loading operations inside the S5B fueling cell at the Guiana Space Center will take about 10 days to complete according to NASA. The 10-day period includes steps to prepare purge and pressurize elements within the spacecraft bus the lower section of the 35-foot-tall (10.66-meter) observatory.

The propellant loading itself will occur over several hours on two separate days mission team members told Spaceflight Now.

The Webb telescope’s spacecraft bus built by Northrop Grumman will be filled with 42 gallons (159 liters) of hydrazine and 21 gallons (79.5 liters) of dinitrogen tetroxide a mix of storable fuel and oxidizer to feed the mission’s 20 rocket thrusters according to Mark Voyton NASA’s launch site manager for Webb.

Four of the small engines — a primary and redundant thruster in two pods — will consume fuel and oxidizer for major course correction maneuvers. Webb has eight more thruster modules each with two small hydrazine-fed engines to nudge the observatory with a single pound of thrust providing pointing control in concert with spinning reaction wheels inside the spacecraft.

Ground teams wearing self-contained protective suits will be inside the clean room during loading of the toxic propellants. Technicians will also load helium pressurant into the spacecraft.

Webb’s spacecraft bus provides propulsion electrical power and communications for the observatory.

NASA announced last week that Webb’s launch was delayed from Dec. 18 to Dec. 22 after managers ordered additional testing on the spacecraft.

The space agency said a “sudden unplanned release” of a clamp band sent a vibration through the observatory Nov. 9 when technicians were mating Webb to its launch vehicle adapter a device that connects the observatory with the upper stage of the Ariane 5 rocket.

The adapter’s high-tension clamp band system secures the spacecraft to the rocket until the command to separate Webb about a half-hour after liftoff.

RUAG Space a Swiss company that specializes in building rocket structures and other components supplied the payload adapter system for the Ariane 5 rocket and Webb according to posts on the company’s social media pages.

The processing work inside the S5 payload facility at the Guiana Space Center is being performed under the “overall responsibility” of Arianespace the French launch services provider for the Ariane 5 program. The European Space Agency a junior partner on Webb is paying for the launch as part of its contribution to the mission.

Once fueled Webb will be transferred to the final assembly building at the spaceport in French Guiana where a crane will hoist the observatory on top of its Ariane 5 launcher.

The James Webb Space Telescope is folded up in launch configuration to fit inside the Ariane 5 rocket’s 17.7-foot-wide (5.4-meter) payload fairing. Once in space the observatory will unfurl a power-generating solar panel and a high-gain communications antenna then start a series of make-or-break deployments of its five-layer sunshield which will open to the size of a tennis court.

Webb designed to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before has 18 gold-coated beryllium mirror segments that will combine to create the largest telescope mirror ever sent into space with a diameter of 21.3 feet (6.5 meters). Some of the mirrors are mounted on deployable wings that must fold into place to configure the telescope for science observations.

Then the telescope’s infrared detectors have to cool down to cryogenic temperatures with parts of the instruments chilled to near absolute zero at a temperature of 7 Kelvin (minus 447.1 degrees Fahrenheit).

The telescope’s mirror segments each have tiny mechanical actuators to adjust focus and alignment. The design makes Webb the most expensive and most complex science mission ever launched into space.

“When you work on a $10 billion telescope conservatism is the order of the day” said Thomas Zurbuchen head of NASA’s science mission directorate.

NASA has given the green light to begin fueling the observatory for launch after engineering teams found no sign of damage from an incident last week.

While attaching the telescope to the launch vehicle adapter a clamp band released suddenly and unexpectedly sending vibrations through the observatory. A review board led by NASA determined that additional testing needed to be conducted to ensure that no damage had been done to any components shifting the launch window from December 18 to “no earlier than” December 22.

This additional testing has now been completed and thankfully the conclusion was that no components were damaged. As such NASA removed the ambiguity of the launch window setting a target of December 22 at 7:20 am EST. The observatory is currently being fueled ahead of launch.

The James Webb Space Telescope has seen many delays over the years but the new launch date looks set to stick. Once it gets up into orbit the observatory will peer deep into the cosmos with its infrared eyes searching for clues to some of the most profound mysteries of the universe. Its main goals include studying the very first stars and galaxies that formed in the early universe how galaxies evolve over time how stars and planetary systems are born in dusty clouds and what the composition of exoplanet atmospheres is like. That last point could even reveal biosignatures of extraterrestrial life.

NASA's Artemis program will kickstart the colonization of our natural satellite and lay the foundation for future exploration of other worlds. But for that to happen new technologies will have to be developed including vehicles capable of conquering the rugged lunar terrain.

Not that many years ago NASA announced that the Artemis program will land the first woman and the next man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Once astronauts get to really put their boots on the Moon they'll need a lunar terrain vehicle (LTV) to explore the satellite something that can withstand the regolith encountered on the lunar surface and the long cold nights.Several automakers have already jumped on the bandwagon and presented concepts and ideas that could help the Artemis astronauts establish a long-term presence on the Moon. Toyota joined forces with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to develop a pressurized rover that would allow the crew to ride inside without needing their spacesuits.Recently GM announced that it's working on a lunar rover project together with Lockheed Martin to create an electric Moon buggy capable of exploring the rugged terrain and withstanding the harsh conditions.Now we're seeing another daring concept. This time the solution comes from Xtend Design a London-based architecture and design company focused on interdisciplinary projects for both Earth and space. Over the years the team has been creating incredible designs for major agencies such as NASA or the European Science Foundation that vision villages on the Moon and 3D-printed habitats for a moon base.Recently Xtend Design has revealed a new project - a Skoda Enyaq-inspired moon rover aptly called Luniaq. Announced during the Czech Space Week the concept was presented in the largest virtual reality laboratory in Europe the Virtuplex.This allowed guests to experience what it feels like to be on the lunar surface from our home and see what astronauts will have to face once they land on the Moon. The Luniaq is the creation of space architect Tomas Rousek who formerly worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on designs for missions to the Moon Mars and asteroids.The rover's front design was inspired by Skoda's Enyaq  and it is based on NASA's MMSEV (Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle) platform. The result? An electric lunar vehicle with large windows capable of seating up to four astronauts.The windows are made from transparent aluminum. If that sounds familiar that's because you've probably seen this tech in a "" Star Trek "" movie. While scientists are not actually capable of replicating the aluminum used in the fictional world of ""Star Trek"" they can get pretty close to it in reality by using transparent ceramics made from aluminum compounds.Using this type of material is like using bulletproof glass on steroids – a great feature for the lunar setting. As the rover moves it can kick up dust and sharp rocks that can harm the occupants. In that case the windows will sort of act as a shield. Of course the polyethylene layers would also help protect the crew from harmful UV radiation.In the front the Luniaq will feature an additional window positioned in the bottom part. This will allow astronauts to see the terrain ahead. They'll also be able to see their surroundings using stereoscopic cameras.The vehicle's wheels will be based on Michelin's Tweel design. The tires will have flexible spokes that can absorb bumps and they won't fear puncturing as the technology doesn't use compressed air.The rover has two hatches on the sides which will connect it to the Moon base's space modules. At the rear there is what the company calls a ""suitport"" hidden behind a hinged door. The suitport as the name suggests provides two spacesuits. This allows the astronauts to get equipped without having to deal with the lunar dust from the outside.Power is received from solid-state batteries that can be charged from the roof-mounted UltraFlex solar panels. Apart from the solar panels the roof will feature radiators for cooling down and antennas needed for communication with the lunar base or Earth. Remote and autonomous control of the rover will also be possible.For now the Luniaq is just a concept that lives through the renderings provided by the Xtend Design team. We'll have yet to see what the first LTV will actually look like."

The NVIDIA A2000 now has an upgrade. A few months ago we had the NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU launch. At the time it was a 6GB GPU meant for the lower-end of the market. Now we have the NVIDIA A2000 12GB bringing twice the memory to the line.

NVIDIA A2000 12GB Launched

This is perhaps one of the more interesting launches for our readers. Here are the key specs of the line now including the 12GB model.

As one can see we have 12GB of GDDR6 with ECC. That is something we see more in the NVIDIA professional GPUs of this generation whereas in previous generations lower-end cards like this one would often not have ECC. Now here is where things get interesting. With these specs one has something very competitive with the NVIDIA A2 with a few catches. First is the form factor as a dual-slot actively cooled PCIe Gen4 x16 card. Second one only gets 12GB of memory instead of 16GB on the A2. The power consumption is slightly up at 70W. With all of that the A2000 12GB is fairly close on the memory side and yet seems to have a much higher-performance GPU. For example FP32 performance is only 4.5 TFLOPS on the A2 and 8.0 TFLOPs on the A2000. The A2000 has 26 RT cores while the A2 only has 10. NVIDIA does not list consistent specs across its models but this is certainly going to be interesting for many.

Final Words

The A2000 6GB usually sells for mid $600’s and we would expect a premium for the 12GB model. Still the T4 held a $1400-1500 price point for a long time so this may end up being half the cost for more compute resources making it an interesting option.

Still we wish that NVIDIA just announced these all at the same time instead of stringing along these releases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWFzLXJldmFtcGVkLXJ0eC0yMDYwLWdwdS1jb3VsZC1iZS1mYXN0ZXItdGhhbi13ZS1leHBlY3RlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's revamped RTX 2060 GPU could be faster than we expected,"Nvidia’s rumored new RTX 2060 might be a more powerful resurrection of this Turing graphics card than we expected going by the latest speculation.

Previously the rumor mill has held that the only difference with the new RTX 2060 – providing it does exist and comes out on December 7 as predicted – will be that it doubles up the VRAM from 6GB to 12GB.

Now VideoCardz is saying – and claiming confirmation from three separate sources but we should remain skeptical of any rumor of course – that the incoming RTX 2060 will not just run with 12GB but will also up the CUDA core count to 2176. That would put it on a par with the RTX 2060 Super and clearly be a nice boost to its power level (remember that the original RTX 2060 ran with 1920 cores).

It’ll also have a TDP (power usage) of 184W which is actually a touch more than the 175W consumed by the RTX 2060 Super. The boost clock has been pegged at 1650MHz by default at least going by two sources.

The upshot is that the refreshed RTX 2060 should be equivalent to the old 2060 Super but with a touch more power consumption and a stingier memory bandwidth (192-bit rather than the 2060 Super’s 256-bit bus).

Analysis: A delicate GPU balancing act for Nvidia

This is an interesting one considering that rumors about the new RTX 2060 have been flying about for some time now all insisting that it will maintain the same spec as the original 2060 save for doubling the VRAM. And now with the launch supposedly imminent – as mentioned the refreshed card will theoretically arrive the week after next – we discover that it could be more in line with the 2060 Super or at least pretty close.

That seems a little odd considering it would bring performance quite close to the RTX 3060 which as VideoCardz points out is something in the order of only 8% faster than the RTX 2060 Super.

We’d imagine that there would have to be a more substantial difference between a new 2060 and the RTX 3060 particularly when you consider that Nvidia is reportedly planning a desktop RTX 3050 of some kind – and this has to fit into the overall range as well. We can’t rule anything out obviously and this fresh rumor does marry with the assertion from yesterday that the theoretical RTX 3050 would be slower than the revamped 2060 of course.

If these cards are all inbound as rumored it’s going to be something of a delicate balancing act regarding where they slot into Nvidia’s relative GPU power scale. Although at this point however fast these cards are gamers are likely to happily take whatever they’re given in terms of better stock levels of more wallet-friendly contemporary GPUs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9OdmlkaWEtR2VGb3JjZS1SVFgtMzA1MC1hbmQtUlRYLTMwNTAtVGktZGVza3RvcHMtdmFyaWFudHMtY291bGQtaGl0LXNoZWx2ZXMtc29tZXRpbWUtaW4tUTItMjAyMi41ODE4NTkuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti desktops variants could hit shelves sometime in Q2 2022,"A new leak tells us that the desktop version of the GeForce RTX 3050 will run a GA106 GPU with 8GB of VRAM and perform on par with the GTX 1660.

The laptop variants of Nvidia's entry-level RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti GPUs have been out and about for quite some time now. However we're yet to see a desktop-grade version of either card. A new report from Videocardz suggests that we may have to wait till 2022. We can expect Nvidia to launch the graphics cards alongside their beefier siblings such as the rumoured GeForce RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 2060 12GB.

Both the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 will allegedly use a GA106-150 GPU. The latter is expected to feature 8GB of VRAM 3072 CUDA cores 72 SMs and perform on par with the GTX 1660 Super. Similarly we can expect the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti to offer GeForce RTX 2060-level performance. Our in-depth analysis concluded that the laptop versions of both cards were somewhat lacklustre and it'll be interesting to see how their desktop siblings hold up against the competition.

Despite the GeForce RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti's late arrival both cards will serve as a breath of fresh air for those on a tight budget. One can't blame Nvidia for taking its own time to launch the graphics cards as it would much rather use its facilities to push out high-end SKUs instead of entry-level ones. Furthermore one would still have to pay exorbitantly high prices to get their hands on an RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti as they'll probably be scooped up by scalpers/crypto miners the moment they get launched.

We've been hearing more and more about NVIDIA's new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB graphics card a refreshed Turing-based RTX 2060 with 12GB of GDDR6 memory (up from the 6GB GDDR6 on the regular RTX 2060).

But it looks like it'll be more than just double the VRAM of a regular GeForce RTX 2060 as the new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB will reportedly have a higher TDP of 184W (with the RTX 2060 SUPER having a 175W TDP). This means that the RTX 2060 12GB will actually be around the same performance as the RTX 2060 SUPER.

The 12GB of GDDR6 memory on the new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB will be on a 192-bit memory bus while the RTX 2060 SUPER has its 12GB of GDDR6 on a wider 256-bit memory bus. Not only that but the overclocked AIB variants of the new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB could see GPU boost clocks at default 1650MHz and up to 1690MHz and beyond with OC.

NVIDIA is expected to unveil the new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB on December 7 and it will act as a cheaper alternative to the RTX 3060 12GB. The RTX 3060 cards have been sucked up by miners and I'm sure the RTX 2060 12GB won't be any different but priced competitively it could be an interesting refresh thrown into the mix at the end of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDUwLXJ1bW9yZWQtZm9yLXEyLTIwMjItbGF1bmNoLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLWJlLWZhc3Rlci10aGFuLWd0eC0xNjYwLXN1cGVyL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDUwLXJ1bW9yZWQtZm9yLXEyLTIwMjItbGF1bmNoLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLWJlLWZhc3Rlci10aGFuLWd0eC0xNjYwLXN1cGVyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Rumored For Q2 2022 Launch Expected To Be Faster Than GTX 1660 SUPER,"It looks like NVIDIA's most entry-level Ampere graphics card the GeForce RTX 3050 isn't planned for launch until 2022. In new information revealed by Videocardz it is stated that the RTX 3050 is going to launch close to mid-2022 and will tackle AMD's entry-level Navi 24 and Intel's DG2-128 parts.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 To Launch In Q2 2022 & Rumored To Be Faster Than GTX 1660 SUPER But Will It Be Enough To Tackle AMD's Navi 24 & Intel's DG2-128 GPUs?

While the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 (Ti) for laptops rocks the Ampere GA107 GPU core the RTX 3050 for desktops is said to feature the Ampere GA106 GPU core. Previously there have been a series of reports that the RTX 3050 series would include two variants a Ti and a non-Ti part. The non-TI part was expected to feature the GA107 GPU while the Ti SKU was expected to feature a GA106 GPU configuration. However the latest report suggests that even the Non-Ti variant will feature a GA106 GPU which means it should end up with much higher performance than the Ti variant for laptops.

Coming to the specifications there are reports of an NVIDIA GA106-150 GPU for the 'PG190 SKU 70' board being cooked up. The GA106-150 GPU allegedly features 3072 CUDA cores in 24 SM units. It is also reported that the card might end up with 8 GB GDDR6 memory which gives it a big memory advantage over AMD and Intel entry-level parts. The card is expected to offer performance faster than the GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER but will be slower than the RTX 2060 12 GB variant which also launches in the coming weeks.

Based on these performance figures the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 is going to be competitive against AMD's Navi 24 (Radeon RX 6500 / Radeon RX 6400) and Intel's DG2-128 (ARC Alchemist) graphics cards which launch next year too. What will be interesting is to see whether prices can be maintained for these budget tier cards though we shouldn't keep our hopes high as supply issues aren't expected to be resolved till 2023.

One reason why NVIDIA could have delayed the RTX 3050 so much could be that they don't want to mess things up in the entry-level market with jacked up prices and to offer an intermediate solution they have refreshed the RTX 2060 with 12 GB till GPU prices and supply get slightly better than what they are now.

The professor Allyn Walker who was put on leave earlier this month over the controversy and reported threats to their safety and that of the campus did not respond to a request for comment. Previously Walker said their comments defending nonoffending “minor-attracted persons” had been taken out of context or willfully misunderstood by critics.

In a joint statement announcing the resignation Old Dominion University and Walker said that Walker will remain on leave through the end of their contract in May and officially step down from the university after that.

“We have concluded that this outcome is the best way to move forward” President Brian O. Hemphill said in that statement. “We hope today’s action helps bring closure for our Monarch family. As we move forward I encourage all members of the Monarch family to continue our efforts toward healing and civil discourse.”

Walker said their scholarship aims to prevent child sexual abuse but that this work “was mischaracterized by some in the media and online partly on the basis of my trans identity. As a result multiple threats were made against me and the campus community generally.”

Walker thanked Old Dominion “for giving me the opportunity to teach and to conduct my research and the ODU Department of Public Safety for monitoring the threats against me and the community. I am particularly grateful for the outpouring of support from many among the ODU community as well as others in my research fields who have publicly affirmed the value of my work in advancing child safety.”

In a separate statement Hemphill said that “our decisions were made to protect the life and safety of faculty members and others on campus and beyond.”

Regarding academic freedom and free speech Hemphill said “Debate and disagreement are at the heart of research and learning. ODU faculty members in many disciplines are engaged in cutting-edge research that by its very nature tests boundaries and challenges accepted wisdom. Some of it may be controversial and controversial research is often misunderstood and mischaracterized.”

‘We Have More Work to Do’

The “vast majority of Monarchs engaged in civil discourse even those among us for whom personal experience made the subject of child sexual abuse especially painful” Hemphill also said. Yet “clearly we have more work to do in order to generate greater understanding of research without acts of intimidation or threats of violence.”

Walker’s research attracted attention much of it negative after they granted an interview with an advocacy group called the Prostasia Foundation. The foundation describes itself as a “child protection organization combining an evidence-based approach to child sexual abuse prevention with its commitment to human rights and sex positivity.”

During the interview Walker said “A lot of people when they hear the term ‘pedophile’ they automatically assume that means a sex offender and that isn’t true and that can lead to a lot of misconceptions about attractions toward minors.” Walker recommended that affirming therapies—as opposed to “conversion” therapies—become more widely available to help nonoffending “minor-attracted persons” navigate their attractions in moral and legal ways.

“Having an attraction to minors as long as it isn’t acted on doesn’t mean that the person who has those attractions is doing something wrong” Walker told Prostasia. “From my perspective there is no morality or immorality attached to attraction to anyone because no one can control who they’re attracted to at all. In other words it’s not who we’re attracted to that is either OK or not OK it’s our behaviors in responding to that attraction that is either OK or not OK.”

While fellow academics and said that Walker’s statements aligned with current research and best practices some students and parents along with others from outside the Old Dominion campus community accused Walker of taking a weak stance against pedophilia or even endorsing it. The campus reportedly experienced safety threats as did Walker.

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education which supported Walker throughout their brief suspension from campus and teaching said in its own statement about Walker’s resignation that “threats of violence (or violence itself) must not dictate what can be said or researched in higher education. By removing Walker from the classroom Old Dominion capitulated to the loudest angriest voices and gave hecklers a veto over what faculty can research publish or say. The First Amendment rights of free speech and academic freedom protect the ability of public college faculty to explore ideas no matter how controversial or how many people agree or disagree with them.”

Daniel P. Richards associate professor of English at Old Dominion University and president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors said that he and his colleagues “are—first and foremost—glad that Dr. Walker as well as our faculty staff and students are safe and that no violent acts were carried out.”

That said “We vehemently condemn the transphobic hate speech and physical threats directed at Dr. Walker” Richards continued. Referring to Walker’s book A Long Dark Shadow: Minor-Attracted People and Their Pursuit of Dignity on which Walker’s comments to Prostasia were based Richards said it’s “apparent” that those who have criticized it have not read it.

“We understand the resistance to the topic especially from those affected with past trauma” Richards said. “These concerns are valid and legitimate and we should continue to discuss them. Even so we are disappointed in the public reaction to Dr. Walker’s research and the continued misunderstanding of academic freedom and mischaracterization of rigorous peer-reviewed research.”

Noting that Walker’s research was known to and even funded by the university prior to the controversy Richards said Old Dominion “could have done much more in their messaging to draw a useful distinction between the value of Dr. Walker’s work and the right they have to pursue it and the discomfort and controversy around the topic itself.”

Richards said the AAUP chapter is working on a formal statement about the Walker case and is “committed to creating better conditions for faculty moving forward in the areas of shared governance academic freedom and coalition building so that we don’t lose a cherished colleague like Dr. Walker again.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZm9vdGJhbGxzY29vcC5jb20vbmV3cy9vbGQtZG9taW5pb24tcGVubi1zdGF0ZS1vZmZlbnNpdmUtY29vcmRpbmF0b3ItYm93bHMta2lyay1jYW1wYmVsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sources: Old Dominion making change at offensive coordinator despite winning streak,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://footballscoop.com/news/old-dominion-penn-state-offensive-coordinator-bowls-kirk-campbell on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZm9vdGJhbGxzY29vcC5jb20vbmV3cy9vbGQtZG9taW5pb24tcGVubi1zdGF0ZS1vZmZlbnNpdmUtY29vcmRpbmF0b3ItYm93bHMta2lyay1jYW1wYmVsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2Zvb3RiYWxsLzIwMjEvMTEvMjgvZm9ybWVyLW5vdHJlLWRhbWUtcWItYnJlbmRvbi1jbGFyay1yZWJvb3Qtb2xkLWRvbWluaW9uLzg3ODk3MDcwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Notre Dame QB Clark will reboot at Old Dominion,"Former Notre Dame quarterback Brendon Clark’s reboot will take shape at Old Dominion the junior announced via Twitter on Sunday evening.

The decision comes roughly six weeks after the 6-foot-2 225-pound Midlothian Va. product abruptly put his name in the transfer portal and left the Irish scrambling for a scout-team quarterback.

The Monarchs finished the regular season 6-6 overall 5-3 in Conference USA and riding a five-game winning streak. ODU’s current No. 1 quarterback is redshirt freshman Hayden Wolff.

Clark spent most of Notre Dame’s 2020 season as the No. 2 quarterback on the Irish depth chart behind starter Ian Book.

His last game played in an Irish uniform came Oct. 24 2020 in a 45-3 Notre Dame road romp over Pittsburgh. He completed one of three passes for seven yards in that game and ran the ball once for a four-yard loss in relief of starter Book.

Shortly after the Pitt game in 2020 though Clark’s right knee began to give him trouble. It’s the same knee he underwent surgery on as a high school freshman for an ACL tear.

Clark underwent surgery on it last December. The rehab was protracted prompting Clark to miss last spring’s practices and becoming a non-factor in a three-man quarterback competition through fall camp.

Wisconsin grad transfer Jack Coan emerged as Notre Dame’s starter with freshman Tyler Buchner tag-teaming at the position in special packages. Sophomore Drew Pyne also leapfrogged Clark on the depth chart.

With a redshirt season and COVID exemption year preceding this season Clark could have as many as three years of eligibility remaining at ODU located in Norfolk Va. about a two-hour drive from the Manchester High program he led to a Class 6A state title three years ago.

Ballard Stadium. Old Dominion should still be feeling good after a win while Charlotte will be looking to get back in the win column.

The Middle Tenn. Blue Raiders typically have all the answers at home but last week the Monarchs proved too difficult a challenge. Old Dominion walked away with a 24-17 victory. The score was all tied up at the break 10-10 but they were the better team in the second half. Old Dominion QB Hayden Wolff was slinging it as he passed for two TDs and 240 yards on 24 attempts.

Meanwhile Charlotte was expected to have a tough go of it last week and well they did. They have to be aching after a bruising 49-28 loss to the Marshall Thundering Herd. Charlotte was down 42-14 at the end of the third quarter which was just too much to recover from. Charlotte's defeat came about despite a quality game from WR Cameron Dollar who snatched two receiving TDs.

The Monarchs are the favorite in this one with an expected 9.5-point margin of victory. They are currently four-for-four against the spread in their most recent games a trend bettors might want to take into account.

Old Dominion's victory brought them up to 5-6 while the 49ers' loss pulled them down to an identical 5-6. A couple defensive stats to keep an eye on: Old Dominion is stumbling into the contest with the 231st most passing touchdowns allowed in the nation having given up 24 on the season. Charlotte is completely their equal: they are 231st worst in the nation in passing touchdowns allowed with 24 on the season. It's possible one of these Achilles' heels will wind up tripping the losing team up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbml0dGFueWxpb25zd2lyZS51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yOC9yaWNreS1yYWhuZS1ob3Blcy10by10YWtlLW9sZC1kb21pbmlvbi10by1hLWJvd2wtZ2FtZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former PSU assistants are bowl eligible in first years as head coach,"While much of the focus around these parts may have been on Penn State’s regular-season finale loss at Michigan State it was quite an eventful day around the world of college football. Between intense rivalry games having an impact on division conference and playoff scenarios and teams battling for bowl eligibility there was a lot going on in Week 13 of the college football season. Among the schools fighting to become bowl-eligible was Old Dominion coached by former Penn State offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne.

And in his first season on the sideline with the Monarchs Rahne is hoping to take Old dominion to a bowl game. And how Rahne’s program got there is quite a story to tell.

First Rahne was hired to be the new head coach of the Old Dominion program following the conclusion of the 2019 season. Unfortunately for Rahne he would have to wait longer than anticipated to coach his first game in Norfolk Virginia. Old Dominion made the decision to not play a college football schedule in 2020 due to concerns revolving around the COVID-19 pandemic. Old Dominion was one of three FBS programs that chose not to play any college football in 2020 joining UConn and New Mexico State in that decision. That put a pause on the debut of Ricky Rahne as a head coach although he issued a statement at the time remaining committed to the future of the program.

Old Dominion returned to the field this fall of course and for a while it looked like a team that took a year off from playing football. Old Dominion was blasted by Wake Forest and Liberty in two of their first three games of the season although few would have guessed at the time Wake Forest would be playing in the ACC Championship Game back in Week 1. Rahne got his first coaching victory in Week 2 with a win against FCS Hampton but the Monarchs started the year off on a 1-6 start to the season. While the first two losses were in blowouts Old Dominion kept things close in losses to Buffalo UTEP and Marshall before suffering a 23-point loss at home to Western Kentucky.

Playing in a bowl game looked like a near impossibility after the 1-6 start to the season. Had Old Dominion lost just one more game they would have been ineligible for postseason play per NCAA postseason regulations requiring a minimum of six wins to play in a bowl game.

But that’s the thing. Old Dominion didn’t lose another game.

A 23-20 victory against Louisiana Tech at home was the start of a seemingly unlikely five-game winning streak that culminated with a 56-34 victory over Charlotte in the final game of the regular season to clinch bowl eligibility.

#ClubMonarch was on a whole new level of Scud 📈 pic.twitter.com/6JhEDdhdIt — ODU Football (@ODUFootball) November 28 2021

Rahne is likely taking Old Dominion to its second bowl game in program history and its first since the 2016 season. The school moved up to the FBS level from FCS in 2014 when it made the quick jump into Conference USA during a time of significant conference realignment changes around the country.

Rahne is now in a position to have the second winning season in Old Dominion’s brief time as an FBS program but the Monarchs will have to win their bowl game to do so. And whether or not they will get that opportunity remains to be seen.

Wins by LSU Memphis & West Virginia makes it 83 bowl-eligible teams for 82 bowl spots meaning a 6-win Group of 5 team will not go bowling — Brett McMurphy (@Brett_McMurphy) November 28 2021

There are 82 bowl spots to fill this season and 83 teams clinched bowl eligibility. That means unless one team pulls out of the bowl season some program is going to be left at home. And it’s not going to be one of the 13 bowl-eligible teams from the SEC staying home. It’s going to be a Group of 5 program and Old Dominion could be on the chopping block.

There is still a decent chance Old Dominion will get to play in a bowl game somewhere and perhaps we will learn more in the coming days. Bowl game matchups will be made official no later than Sunday December 5.

We’ll be keeping an eye on Rahne’s Old Dominion program.

Charles Huff has Marshall bowling too

Another former James Franklin assistant is also taking his program to a bowl game. Charles Huff who left Penn State and his role as a running backs coach and special teams coordinator to join former offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead at Mississippi State in 2018 just wrapped up his first season as head coach at Marshall. Huff will also be taking his program to a bowl game following a 7-5 season.

This was Huff’s first season as head coach of the Thundering Herd who came up short of winning the Conference USA East Division crown this fall. Huff did win the head-to-head matchup with Rahne earlier in the season as referenced above.

We’ll watch to see where Huff will be coaching in the postseason as well.

With Covid-19 rearing its ugly head and wreaking havoc much of the world shut down - but Coronavirus isn't the only reason for the issues that followed.

Poor planning was a major factor as was competition between specific industries for the attention of the chip manufacturers and even natural disasters had a role to play - in short the global chip shortage is even more complex than you might imagine.

Primary factors

Looking back it's impossible to point to one or two reasons for the chip shortage as it was a whirlwind of problems coming together at the wrong time.

But to begin with there was a lack of incentive for silicon chip producers to build enough foundries to satisfy automakers and others says Mario Morales Program Vice President of the semiconductor group at analyst firm IDC. Morales claims nobody is investing in ”legacy technology” which although dated still plays a major role in many industries.

During the pandemic original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the automotive sector “canceled orders from a lot of the supply chain” he explained. “So a lot of disgruntled suppliers found other markets that were still doing well despite the pandemic.”

But the problems can be traced further back. In the fall of 2018 for example the United States placed trade sanctions on China. This led to Huawei one of the biggest smartphone makers in China placing huge orders for chips before these sanctions were implemented. Apple and others followed suit in a bid not to be left behind - and then the pandemic took hold.

It’s no surprise that the pandemic lockdowns had a role in the silicon shortage but it also affected other areas. Pretty much anything that has a battery or plugs into a wall uses chip-based technology.

For example the demand for cloud computing services went through the roof as many consumers started purchasing products they typically wouldn’t need to work from home – with many businesses doing the same.

Smartphones remain the most popular electronic commodity in the world so demand remained high and crypto enthusiasts and entrepreneurs snatched up graphics processing units (GPUs).

What other factors contributed to the global chip shortage?

A number of other underlying factors also contributed to the chip shortage with the complexity of items such as semiconductors also a significant factor.

According to Craig Barrett former boss at Intel the company’s microprocessors are the most complicated devices ever made by man. The process is so delicate that the rooms where semiconductors are built are cleaner than hospital operating rooms. In an operating room they allow 10000 particles of air pollution for one cubic meter of air. In a room where a semiconductor is built they only allow 10 for every cubic meter.

So making silicon chips isn’t easy but the people who do it are talented and backed by excellent resources. So what’s the real problem?

Whether it’s easy or hard to build a semiconductor the fact is the process takes billions of dollars and a lot of time. And if you’re off by a fraction in the process you’ll most likely lose out to another manufacturer.

Making a chip from start to finish takes about three months and involves million-dollar machines. There are also molten metal and lasers involved as you’re taking a silicon wafer and turning it into a transistor to power your computer smartphone or other smart device.

Finally multiple factors outside of the semiconductor industry’s control also played a part. Power outages in Texas where the majority of the United States’ chip manufacturing is done and drought in Taiwan also contributed to the shortage.

The world’s largest chip manufacturer TSMC also had to cut back its water usage (fundamental to the production of chips) due to government orders. Taiwan makes up over 60% of the world’s total global chip foundry revenue and the country wasn’t able to keep up its usual output.

What industries are most affected?

Automakers have been practically immobilized for over a year and the situation might get worse. A new outbreak of Covid in South East Asia where most US automakers’ chip manufacturing is done could hit the industry even harder next year.

Production in countries such as Vietnam the Philippines and Malaysia was halted due to the outbreak but US automakers rely heavily on those countries to keep their production lines moving since home-grown fabs only account for 12.5% of chip manufacturing.

Another suffering industry is consumer electronics manufacturing. For instance Hon Hai Precision Industry an Apple supplier said about 10% of its shipments would be affected. Xiaomi meanwhile said its smartphones would see a price increase because of the global chip shortage.

Apple’s MacBook and iPad products have also encountered production issues and in March Samsung announced its new Galaxy Note would indefinitely delayed.

The latest data shows smartphone sales have fallen 6% year-on-year and this is because production has stalled and in some cases halted. On top of that chip manufacturers are increasing their prices to prevent over-ordering - and whether that influences the price of smartphones next year remains to be seen.

Smartphone manufacturers like Samsung and Apple dodged the initial bullet of the microchip shortage having seen what was coming a lot sooner than the automotive industry - although some issues are still arising.

However the auto industry and others are catching up. Accenture’s Global Semiconductor Lead Syed Alem says “smartphone companies benefited from the extra capacity left behind by automotive businesses which led the automotive sector to experience a chip shortage when demand for cars rose faster than they anticipated.""

“Now that the automotive sector and others are catching up and starting to reclaim the capacity they had given up there is fierce competition for semiconductor supplies. This has created supply pressure for smartphone chips.”

Due to pent-up demand and an improved consumer outlook the first quarter of 2021 saw worldwide smartphone sales grow 26%. However chip manufacturers are unable to meet the demand and that probably won’t change by the end of the year.

Impact on price

Along with the possible price increase on smartphones several other products have become more expensive as a result of the shortage.

GPU and CPU pricing has skyrocketed since the global chip shortage began with the latter saoring to about 50% above MSRP in most markets according to some experts.

In March to May 2021 alone the price of GPUs increased 14% with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and RTX 3080 GPUs are selling for quadruple their MSRP and RX 6700 XT or RX 6900 XT going for double the MSRP.

There are three main factors that have contributed to the increase in GPU and CPU price hikes: scalpers supply chain issues and distributors playing hardball.

We’ve already covered price rises but for many manufacturers there’s another reason for doing so: they want to keep scalpers from purchasing the GPUs at MSRP and then gouging the market.

Although they don’t control pricing for CPUs and GPUs distributors are more or less forcing retailers to buy bundles of products. Simply put they’re telling retailers a particular CPU or GPU is only available if they buy XY and Z along with it. In turn retailers increase the price of the GPU or CPU to offset the additional products they had to pay for just to get the GPU/CPU they need. Or you’ll see retailers trying to push bundles when customers need nothing of the sort - a trickle-down effect that isn’t helping the current chip shortage situation.

However there’s more to it. Fabrication plants (fabs) have a limited amount of chips they can make and supply. Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) which supply Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) respectively can’t currently produce any more GPUs. Furthermore there are ongoing problems with substrates raw materials GDDR memory and components. That’s also why the price of GPUs has spiked more dramatically than CPUs.

Black Friday and Christmas

The holidays are fast approaching and the global chip shortage will play a part in it. You can't predict precisely what will happen with products for Black Friday but there are strategies you can pursue to mitigate problems.

With Covid-19 still prevalent in Southeast Asia where many goods are manufactured you can expect shelves to be barer compared to years past. You can also expect prices to continue to rise for just about everything due to a lack of manpower supply shortages and longer shipping times.

Commentators also predict the price of goods will continue to rise through the end of 2021 with typical Black Friday sales and promotions set to be scaled back across many retailers.

Christmas will likely also be affected with retailers facing issues in stocking shelves with children's toys especially those with electronic chips. According to the Head of Sky Castle Toys Lev Nelson aside from the chip shortage itself toy companies are often pushed to the back of the semiconductor line by higher-margin items such as cars smartphones and washing machines.

To avoid getting price gouged on or before Black Friday and Christmas you should start shopping now. The sooner the better especially for anything that uses a silicon chip.

What other products are affected?

According to Goldman Sachs the global chip shortage has touched 169 different industries. Any industry that spends at least 1% of its GDP on semiconductor chips is adversely affected - with the auto industry spending nearly 5% of its GDP.

One other area that has been particularly affected acutely is telecoms. Telecommunication carriers have struggled to fill orders since the chip shortage began as have satellite and telecommunication resellers along with internet publishing broadcasting and web search portals.

In the wholesale trade sector professional and commercial equipment supplies have also taken a big hit with companies unable to fulfil orders due to supply chain issues.

Used cars and rental companies have also had to make adjustments due to the chip shortage as for the first time in 68 years of tracking used cars saw their first yearly price increase with prices rising almost 10% in 2021.

When might the chip shortage end?

While many predict the global chip shortage will likely end sometime in 2022 Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger expects it won’t end until 2023. In an interview with CNBC Gelsinger said “we’re in the worst of it now; every quarter next year we’ll get incrementally better but we’re not going to see supply-demand balance until 2023.”

However AMD CEO Lisa Su thinks the shortage will end sometime in 2022. She said production will be tight “[but will get] better next year not immediately but it’ll gradually get better as more plants come up.”

Gelsinger stated that it isn’t only a lack of chips but a “combination of parts.”

""We call it match sets where we may have the CPU but you don’t have the LCD or you don’t have the Wi-Fi. Datacenters are particularly struggling with some of the power chips and some of the networking or ethernet chips” he explained.

One way the global chip shortage might be solved is by the Internet of Things (IoT).

IoT technology can collect data and use it to prevent future chip shortages with a chip fabrication plant that has “smart” connected equipment able to use real-time data allowing all members of its production team to make informed decisions that will reduce waste speed up delivery times and increase product quality.

Next-gen innovation can also play a role as the GaN semiconductor platform for example will be 3x lighter 3x smaller with 3x faster charging - with a combined effect of a 40% saving on energy costs.

Diversifying supplier bases can also help to mitigate the chip shortage or prevent it in the future. Creating strategic relationships with distributors resellers and traders can help when extra chips are needed in urgent situations.

What will happen to the chip manufacturing industry?

In the coming years there will be a mixing of technologies from 200mm (mature/legacy technology) and newer 300mm (for cutting-edge chips).

Pursuing only one of these avenues might keep the chip shortage going even longer - but building more 200mm fabs and 300mm fabs will get us out of the woods.

In 2020 there were 212 200mm fabs with are a total of 222 expected by 2022. There were 129 300mm fabs in 2020 and experts expect a total of 149 to be live by 2022 with this growth trend expected to continue over the next decade.

The $52 billion US Innovation and Competition Act should also help funding by providing subsidies to chip manufacturing companies - if it passes through Congress as well as the Biden Executive Order signed on February 24 2021.

Finally there's the ongoing trade war between the US and China which sees semiconductor chips as a crucial pawn.

In September 2020 former President Donald Trump imposed import restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) China’s largest chip firm forcing China to source parts elsewhere and rework its supply chain causing a big slowdown in imports of chips to the US and elsewhere.

What does this mean for national security?

“[The chip shortage is] a challenge to the supply chain that could create threats to the very security of our nation” Matt Hayden former Assistant Secretary for Cyber Infrastructure Risk and Resilience of the US Department of Homeland Security told Kitco News.

According to Hayden US information systems defense systems and sensitive electronics are what the government uses for homeland security with all these affected by the shortage.

Shipments of semiconductors are being help up over 200 days. “We’re looking at days from 200 to past a year for specific chips that range from consumer electronics to major manufacturing across the world” said Hayden.

An anonymous source told a Fox News Investigative Unit that whoever wins the race for the next generation of semiconductor products will have an extremely strong military become a global economic force and possibly dominate the geopolitical landscape.

There are also thoughts that China may try to take over Taiwan which is the largest chipmaker in the world accounting for 63% of Asia’s chip manufacturing production. If China did attempt and succeed in a military takeover of Taiwan it would hold the key to the future of the modern world.

Where do we go from here?

It's been over a year since the first signs of the global chip shortage and companies across multiple industries have been affected and will continue to be in the coming weeks and months.

Barring any more natural disasters like droughts and severe winter storms cutting power supply should start to turn around early in 2022 - but the overall situation doesn’t look like it will return to normal by the end of next year or by the start of 2023. Some steps can be taken to turn the ship around or at least mitigate it from sinking further and those measures are at our disposal.

We don't know exactly what the future holds but the global chip shortage will end at some point. It's just going to last longer than anyone initially thought.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzLzMtY2hpcC1zdG9ja3MtdG8td2F0Y2gtYXMtdGhlLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Utd29yc2Vucy0xMDMxMDA3MjU00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Chip Stocks To Watch As The Semiconductor Shortage Worsens,"A global shortage in semiconductor chips has been wreaking havoc on the tech sector automotive industry consumer electronics industry and everything in between thanks to massive supply chain snarl ups. The global Covid-induced supply crunch for chips has badly hurt production across a number of industries ranging from cars to consumer appliances smartphones and personal computers.

The trade war between the United States and China has only served to make a bad situation worse.

About a year ago the U.S. Commerce Department declared Chinese chip manufacturer Semiconductor Manufacturing International or SMIC persona non grata after determining the company supplies the Chinese military with chips thus making it a threat to national security. The federal government restricted SMIC from obtaining some U.S.-regulated chip-making equipment leading to U.S. buyers cutting back orders from the company. SMIC is one of the largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips accounting for about 5% of global semiconductor supply. Although the Biden administration recently granted SMIC and Huawei suppliers billions of dollars worth of licenses from November through April that allows them to sell them goods and technology despite their remaining on the U.S. trade blacklist it remains to be seen if the move will ease the shortages.

The alarming part: Some experts expect the supply chain glitches to drag on into 2022.

But whereas the global chip shortage has been a nightmare for businesses that make cars and home appliances as well as people who buy them semiconductor stock investors are hardly complaining as they continue to see outsized gains on their investments.

For instance shares of gaming and auto chip manufacturer Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) have gained 40% over the past 30 days; those of smartphone chip maker Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) are up 38% while those of computer chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have added 25%.

Overall the biggest semiconductor benchmark iShares PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is up 15% over the past months compared to a modest 4% gain by the S&P 500.

Investment bank JPMorgan is recommending that investors pursue longer-term trends in the semiconductor space that are more structural than cyclical. Structural trends tend to be longer-term permanent changes in an industry whereas cyclical trends are influenced by the business cycle and tend to be short-lived.

JPM recommends investing in very high-end computing segments noting there’s ongoing disruption in high-end computing globally which used to be very monolithic but is now being fragmented as more companies enter the space.

JPMorgan also recommends investing in semiconductor companies that focus on legacy long-tail technologies. These companies manufacture a variety of less advanced chips in areas like power management microcontrollers sensors and other consumer-related segments.

Bearing this in mind here are our top semiconductor chip stocks for long-term investors.

#1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest contract manufacturer for semiconductor chips. The company counts tech heavyweights such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Nvidia and Qualcomm as its clients. In fact TSMC is so dominant that it accounted for 54% of total foundry revenue globally last year as per TrendForce data.

Source: CNBC

TSMC manufactures some of the most advanced chips for fabless tech companies that do not own their own foundries. Last month Wedgewood Partners an investment management firm had this to say about TSMC:

""Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing detracted from performance as the market attempted to price in a downturn in the semiconductor cycle. Although there are some signs that memory markets might be somewhat oversupplied we have yet to see any tangible signs that logic semiconductors – particularly at the leading-nodes where the Company dominates – are in anything but short supply. In addition and as a result of this strong demand the Company should be able to pass through price increases to help fund very attractive returns on the rare leading-edge capacity that serves this demand.""

Indeed TSMC is reportedly raising prices by 10% for advanced chips while less advanced chips–used commonly by automakers--would cost 20% more.

#2. ASML Holding

ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch semiconductor equipment maker. ASML develops produces markets sells and services advanced semiconductor equipment systems consisting of lithography metrology and inspection related systems for memory and logic chipmakers. The company is the world's largest manufacturer of lithography machines used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Indeed ASML is the world’s sole manufacturer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines required to manufacture the smallest and most advanced chips.

It’s therefore hardly surprising that ASML counts Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  Intel (NASDAQINTC) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) as top customers for its EUV machines. ASML has been recording robust demand for its advanced chip-making machines helping the company to grow the topline by 35% in the current year compared to 18% growth in 2020. Further a product mix that increasingly lean towards high-end machines has helped boost its gross margins by 75 basis points to 52.2% in 2021 compared to 2019.

#3. UMC Corporation

United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC) is another Taiwan-based wafer foundry with operations in the United States Europe China Singapore Hong Kong and Japan. The company serves fabless design companies and integrated device manufacturers and provides circuit design mask tooling wafer fabrication and assembly and testing services.

Unlike TSMC which manufactures some of the world’s most advanced chips UMC primarily manufactures larger and cheaper auto and IoT chips for cars and other gadgets. You can think of UMC as TSMC’s smaller less glamorous peer.

UMC has reported that YTD sales were up 17.89% Y/Y to NT$173.07B with October net sales growing 25.36% Y/Y to NT$19.16B compared to NT$18.75B in September. Wall Street remains fairly bullish on UMC with a $13.77 price target good for 21% upside.

TAYLOR Texas — Samsung's arrival to Taylor brings approximately 6500 construction jobs and 2000 long-term jobs once the facility is built.

""It's a spur that will create more more retail more housing more of everything building more schools"" Paul Fletcher who oversees the Workforce Solutions Rural Capital Area said.

Manufacturing has been an economic mainstay in Texas providing resilient jobs for decades. Within manufacturing advanced manufacturing of computer chips and electronics has had the most Gross Domestic Product growth in the past 20 years in the state according to the Texas Comptroller's Office.

In Williamson County the number of manufacturing companies jumped from 290 in 2010 to 425 in 2020 an increase of 46%. The number of manufacturing jobs went up by 88% in the same timeframe according to data collected by JobsEQ and provided by Fletcher's office.

Samsung while providing more jobs to that sector is also bridging a gap exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We've all seen the stories of appliances and automobiles that can't be made right now because there's a semiconductor chip shortage"" Fletcher said. ""Plants like the one the Samsung is going to bring online will help provide that capacity for the future.""

Williamson County Judge Bill Gravell affectionately calls the county ""The Technology Superhighway of the World"" because of the boom of advanced technology manufacturing: Apple's campus in the western area of the county Dell's Round Rock headquarters and now Samsung's future facility on the eastern side.

""What's the future for Williamson County look like? Two days ago no one around the world knew Taylor Texas"" Gravell said Wednesday. ""Today many cities in our world know who Taylor Texas is. What the future is for Williamson County is pretty simple. We are no longer just a destination for Texas businesses or American businesses. We're now a destination location for businesses from around the world.""

On top of the jobs the facility will bring directly as a result of employment Fletcher and other industry experts look forward to other smaller outfits cropping up to support Samsung.

""We're looking at 6500 or so plus construction jobs which relate to the 2000-plus advanced manufacturing jobs and then all the indirect jobs that go along with that that increased career opportunity in the area for supply industry"" Fletcher said.

""You're going to see another influx of vendors and suppliers that follow this host project if you will"" Tony Bennett who leads the Texas Association of Manufacturers said. ""It's just going to ripple through the entire economy with very high-quality high-paying high-benefit jobs for the citizens of the region.""

On top of the jobs coming to the area Samsung also agreed to host 24 internships for Taylor ISD students every year. The internships don't have a direct definition yet according to Samsung but Gravell claims they may start in the spring of 2022 as construction gets started.

""We just climbed one mountain and we got many more mountains to climb"" Taylor ISD Superintendent Devin Padavil said Tuesday. ""Now we need to seize that opportunity that we've been given through having a partnership with a company like Samsung and really make the most of it by giving our kids an outstanding experience where they can go into career fields that they may not have previously imagined.""

""This gives the opportunity for educators to know that there's a demand we can begin to work more on a career path coming out from high school to some kind of post-secondary credential that will help people get started on their career path in the semiconductor industry or just advanced manufacturing in general"" Fletcher said.

Samsung plans to start construction in 2022 in the hopes of producing its first semiconductor chips by the end of 2024."

In 1972 Grup started to circulate exploring more “grown-up” stories about the fandom’s favorite starship. In its third issue Grup published one of the first popularized narratives of Spock and Kirk as a romantic couple “A Fragment Out of Time”.

The tenderness of their bond whether intentional or not was a rare outlet where queer people could see something that looked like the romances they themselves experienced. Spock and Kirk’s relationship inevitably became something precious and important to them.

The queer side of Star Trek fandom is full of stories like that: looking up to Riker as a bisexual icon supporting the romantic subtext of Garak and Dr. Bashir’s relationship relating to Seven of Nine awkwardly trying to fit into the mold of heterosexuality.

That kind of representation matters deeply to fans questioning their own gender or sexual identities: getting to be themselves and having people accept them as such.

Why wouldn’t queer fans feel connected to characters that made them feel that way?

And these assumptions are not just fan conjecture. Andrew Robinson (Garak) Alexander Siddig (Dr. Julian Bashir) Terry Farrell (Jadzia Dax) Jonathan Frakes (William Riker) and many other Star Trek actors have all discussed their perception of their characters’ sexuality being something much more fluid. Even Gene Roddenberry himself planned to add a gay character to TNG’s main cast in the show’s fifth season. That is until his untimely death put his progressive idea on ice.

But Roddenberry’s death didn’t stop Star Trek’s queer representation from being as important as it is. After all most other queer portrayals in entertainment are based in tragic history or the complex present. Star Trek in itself is a vision of a better future. No matter how much war they face or enemies they have to outsmart no Trek character even bats an eye at the concept of complex sexuality. That is the kind of future the queer community dreams of one where they can be themselves fearless and supported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vcnVtYmxlLW1vdmllLXRyYWlsZXItcGFyYW1vdW50LXBsdXMtcmVsZWFzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rumble Trailer Reveals Early Paramount+ Release,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vcnVtYmxlLW1vdmllLXRyYWlsZXItcGFyYW1vdW50LXBsdXMtcmVsZWFzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3RqYXJlZC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yNy9wYXJhbW91bnRzLXJ1bWJsZS1hbmltYXRlZC13cmVzdGxpbmctbW92aWUtZ2V0cy1lYXJseS1wcmVtaWVyZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paramount+'s 'Rumble' Animated Wrestling Movie Gets Early Premiere Date,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.justjared.com/2021/11/27/paramounts-rumble-animated-wrestling-movie-gets-early-premiere-date/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3RqYXJlZC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yNy9wYXJhbW91bnRzLXJ1bWJsZS1hbmltYXRlZC13cmVzdGxpbmctbW92aWUtZ2V0cy1lYXJseS1wcmVtaWVyZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuaW1hdGlvbnhwcmVzcy5jb20vYW5pbWF0aW9uL2FuaW1hdGVkLXNwb3J0cy1maWxtLXJ1bWJsZS10by1yZWxlYXNlLW9uLXBhcmFtb3VudC1pbi1kZWNlbWJlci_SAXBodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmltYXRpb254cHJlc3MuY29tL2FuaW1hdGlvbi9hbmltYXRlZC1zcG9ydHMtZmlsbS1ydW1ibGUtdG8tcmVsZWFzZS1vbi1wYXJhbW91bnQtaW4tZGVjZW1iZXIvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Animated sports film ‘Rumble’ to release on Paramount+ in December,"The highly anticipated trailer for the latest animated Paramount film Rumble is finally here with an earlier release date than initially expected.

Rumble saw numerous delays; it was originally supposed to release in theaters back in July 2020 but was subsequently pushed to January 2021. It was then moved to May before Paramount announced that it would finally bow on 18 February 2022. Rumble takes place in a world where monsters are considered superstar athletes in the global sport of monster wrestling focusing on Winnie a 17-year-old aspiring monster manager and her latest trainee Steve.

Buy something on the fashion website Boohoo for example and you can choose from seven ways to check out: credit and debit cards PayPal Amazon Pay and four different “buy now pay later” companies.

But in some cases payment methods are being taken away. Earlier this month Amazon announced it is banning people from using UK Visa credit cards from 19 January. And when it comes to physical shops Covid transmission worries mean some are steering clear of notes and coins.

Here we look at the pros and cons of different payment methods.

Credit cards

One big plus is that you usually get up to 56 days’ interest-free credit from the moment of purchase. However some providers are offering new customers 0% interest on purchases for up to 23 months. Some credit card holders never pay any interest because they settle up in full each month.

Using a credit card for large purchases offers protections if things go wrong

Using a credit card for large purchases offers protections if things go wrong. Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act if a retailer goes out of business or fails to deliver goods as promised and the items cost £100-£30000 the credit card company is “jointly and severally liable”. So if you buy a big item and the retailer goes bust the card company should cover the cost.

On top of that some credit cards offer decent rewards such as cashback air miles or money-off vouchers. American Express’s Platinum Cashback Everyday card is currently offering new customers 5% cashback on purchases for the first three months (up to £100).

But as the government’s MoneyHelper website says if you only make the minimum payments or run up a bill you can’t pay back “credit cards can be costly and can lead to a spiral of debt”. Many charge more than 20% interest. You could also damage your credit score.

Debit cards

With these the money comes directly out of your bank account. The protection you enjoy isn’t as good as that offered by credit cards although some banks offer something called chargeback which means they might be able to get some or all your money back if there’s a problem.

Some banks offer rewards linked to spending: for example the new digital bank Chase is offering its current account holders 3% cashback on Amazon.co.uk spending until 31 December. It was already offering 1% cashback on all eligible debit card spending for 12 months.

Store cards

These are a form of credit you can only use to pay for items at a particular retailer or group. There are still a few around offered by retailers such as Argos. The interest rates are often quite high: the Argos one has a representative APR of 34.9% for example.

Buy now pay later

These services let you delay payment for an item with no interest or charges – unless you fail to pay back on time at which point some firms impose late fees.

The three main BNPL firms are Klarna Clearpay and Laybuy. Klarna lets shoppers “pay in 3” where the cost is split into three equal interest-free payments the first taken immediately and the next two 30 and 60 days later or they can pay in 30 days’ time. With Clearpay you can pay in four fortnightly instalments and with Laybuy it’s six weekly instalments. PayPal and the digital bank Monzo have also launched their own BNPL services.

Klarna doesn’t impose late fees but some others such as Clearpay do. There have been claims that those falling behind with their payments are experiencing more than just debt – some say they have seen their credit score drop while others believe they have been rejected for loans after missing repayments.

PayPal

Lots of big and small retailers including John Lewis and Marks & Spencer allow people to pay online via PayPal. It offers a “buyer protection” scheme covering all eligible purchases that entitles you to reimbursement of the full price plus shipping costs when you don’t receive your item or it isn’t what you ordered. However even if your PayPal account is attached to your credit card you will lose out on the arguably stronger safeguards offered by section 75.

Some retailers have Zettle payment terminals which allow people to pay in-store with PayPal via QR codes.

Apple Pay

You can use this to buy items in shops on the web and in apps – you just add a credit debit or prepaid card to the Wallet app on your iPhone. You can add your card(s) to other Apple devices (Apple Watch Mac iPad) you want to use with Apple Pay. Devotees like the fact that Face ID Touch ID or your passcode are required for purchases making it arguably more secure than using a physical card and that your card number isn’t stored on your device or on Apple’s servers or shared by Apple with retailers. It works in any physical outlet that takes contactless and you can use it to pay online in Safari or within apps when you see it listed as an option.

Google Pay

This has a lot of similarities to Apple Pay. It lets you make purchases in stores and on websites and apps. You download the app and add a payment method such as a credit card. If a physical store accepts contactless you can pay with your phone. In apps and on websites you can pay wherever you see the logo. When you pay in stores Google Pay doesn’t share your card number.

Amazon Pay

If you have an Amazon account you can use this service wherever you see the Amazon Pay button which includes the online checkouts of many retailers. It uses the information and payment methods stored in your Amazon account. And you can use Alexa to pay by voice. It says eligible purchases of physical goods are protected by its “A-to-Z guarantee”.

But campaigners have long urged shoppers to boycott Amazon over its tax avoidance among other things.

Interest-free credit

This lets you spread the cost over a set period (which might be as little as three months or as long as five years) via monthly payments. That’s all fine if you stay up to date with your repayments but if you don’t you could be hit with interest and additional fees and your debt could mount up rapidly.

Cash

Notes and coins are still hanging on in there despite the UK seemingly hurtling towards becoming a cashless society. Pluses include the fact that you can’t go into the red you know exactly what you have spent and there are no hidden fees or interest. However some places have stopped taking cash or never did in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PEP,PepsiCo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZWlnbnBvbGljeS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8yNy9wZXBzaS1uYXZ5LXNvdmlldC11c3NyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pepsi's Soviet Submarine Fleet Was the Endpoint of Business Dreams,"In 1989 PepsiCo Inc. the maker of Pepsi acquired 17 submarines a cruiser a frigate and a destroyer from the Soviet Union. In recent years an internet legend has grown up around this deal which holds that Pepsi briefly possessed the sixth-largest fleet in the world. In one way that isn’t far off. According to an analysis of Jane’s Fighting Ships 1989-90 a country operating a squadron of 17 submarines would have tied with India for possessing the seventh-largest fleet of attack submarines.

In 1989 PepsiCo Inc. the maker of Pepsi acquired 17 submarines a cruiser a frigate and a destroyer from the Soviet Union. In recent years an internet legend has grown up around this deal which holds that Pepsi briefly possessed the sixth-largest fleet in the world. In one way that isn’t far off. According to an analysis of Jane’s Fighting Ships 1989-90 a country operating a squadron of 17 submarines would have tied with India for possessing the seventh-largest fleet of attack submarines.

Yet in any real sense the story is false. What PepsiCo acquired were small old obsolete unseaworthy vessels. The Pepsi navy no more conferred military power than a rusting Model T could have been a Formula 1 contender. What’s more the ships themselves were immediately turned over to a Norwegian shipyard to be scrapped. PepsiCo was more a middleman than a maritime power.

Most interpretations of the story get its meaning wrong too. The Pepsi navy is sometimes portrayed as an embarrassment for the USSR. Far from it. The multinational firm and the country founded by Vladimir Lenin were business partners and in 1989 Pepsi executives were bullish on Soviet prospects. PepsiCo acquired the rusting fleet as part of a multibillion-dollar bet on the long-term stability of the Soviet Union an enormous market that had little to trade immediately besides raw material and the promise of future profits.

The Pepsi navy isn’t a story from the era of Soviet collapse. It’s from the brief moment right before when the Soviet Union looked likely to survive even though the Cold War had ended. The rusting submarines were one way in which Soviet leaders and Western corporations could establish world peace and a new post-communist prosperity led by business.

American leaders hoped that exposure to Western business could transform the Soviet Union into a country just like theirs. Pepsi executives influenced U.S. policymakers to gain a major advantage in its rivalry with Coca-Cola. Soviet officials saw the deal as part of a larger strategy of external trade that could help revitalize their creaking economy. In the end almost nobody got what they wanted.

Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev tries a cup of Pepsi alongside U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon in Moscow in 1959.

The Pepsi navy begins with one man’s driving ambition to sell soda to Soviets. Bluff hearty and ambitious Donald Kendall started as a worker in a Pepsi-Cola bottling plant but he swiftly climbed the corporate ladder becoming head of the company’s international division by 1957 when he was only in his mid-30s.

As a corporate executive engaged in international business Kendall filled a role sometimes slighted by scholars. Theorists can make international relations seem far removed from everyday experience: nuclear strategy treaty negotiations human rights principles.

Yet formal interactions between governments are only a small part of international relations. Most of what happens among countries concerns something far simpler and more direct: business. International business executives and their attendant lawyers accountants and fixers handle the complexities of cross-border trade and investment but such complex deals still chase a simple goal: making money.

There’s no mystique in that ambition which may explain why it’s written about far less often than the deals of politicians and diplomats. Yet it is the Donald Kendalls not the Henry Kissingers who steer much of international relations. The constant pressure business executives exert as they dig for profit can wear away at even the supposedly rock-solid foundations of national policy. If the quest for profit proves compatible with official objectives so much the better; if not then executives will try to manufacture opportunities to pursue their narrow interests.

These pressures manifest in unexpected ways. In the late 1950s as Kendall assumed his executive role U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower tried to use propaganda to counter the early advantages of the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Soviet leaders could point to the country’s sizzling postwar economic growth rates which outpaced U.S. growth so substantially that even leading American economic textbooks assumed that the USSR would soon overtake the United States. Soviet triumphs in space including the launch of the first artificial satellite Sputnik exemplified the communist world as the wave of the future—and American racial apartheid in the South made the United States seem like the champion of an imperialist past.

One part of Eisenhower’s counteroffensive involved organizing the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow. Eisenhower bet that showing the ordinary bounties of American living as showcased by the wares of such leading brands as Kodak General Electric and Pepsi-Cola would convince the Soviet people that peace was desirable—and more important that they would be better off under capitalism.

The most notable part of the exhibition came with the visit of Eisenhower’s vice president the anti-communist zealot Richard Nixon who escorted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on a tour of the pavilion. The two sparred over the relative merits of their systems in front of a media entourage who broadcast their exchanges.

Eisenhower’s vision of holding an exhibition that would shake the foundations of communism was a bust. But three other men got what they wanted from the display. Khrushchev demonstrated to his domestic audience that the Soviet Union could excel in peaceful competition. Nixon received a huge poll boost and media plaudits for defending the American system.

Kendall was the third. In 1999 he recounted that he had told Nixon the night before the visit that some at Pepsi-Cola headquarters viewed participating in the exhibition as a waste of money. The next day Nixon deftly guided the Soviet premier to the Pepsi booth. Pepsi photographers recorded Nixon and Khrushchev drinking the soda together.

Even though Khrushchev’s verdict on the soda was ambivalent (Time magazine recorded his reaction as “skeptical”) the publicity coup accelerated Kendall’s career. In 1963 Kendall became the company’s president and chief executive officer.

Kendall was now positioned to repay Nixon for the favor. Nixon needed it. He was then best known as a loser both in the 1960 race for president to John F. Kennedy and then humiliatingly the 1962 California governor’s race.

Kendall handed Nixon a lifeline: a promise that whatever law firm took the politician on as a partner would also receive Pepsi-Cola’s legal accounts. The prominent New York law firm Mudge Stern Baldwin & Todd leapt at the sweetener. The deal enriched Nixon and gave him excuses to travel around the country and globe as a Pepsi representative. Thanks to Kendall Nixon was rich and laying the groundwork for a political comeback.

Kendall’s role as a political sugar daddy paid off when Nixon won the presidency in 1968. The most visible return on Kendall’s investment came when the businessman used his relationship to broker one of the first deals between the Soviet Union and an American firm in the Cold War period. In the 1920s U.S. companies like Ford Motor Co. had been prominent in the Soviet Union which idolized American management practices but they exited the market before World War II.

In 1972 Kendall and Soviet officials announced a deal that would exchange equivalent values of Pepsi for Soviet vodkas made by Stolichnaya and Sovetskaya. Not only would Pepsi become the first American soft drink available in the USSR but the deal also locked Coca-Cola out of the Soviet market.

Nixon’s friendship paved the way for the deal. In 1971 U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger’s deputy Alexander Haig lobbied Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin to have the Soviets accept a trade delegation Kendall would head. In one of his regular phone calls with Nixon and his aides Kendall asked Kissinger (whom he greeted with “Hello handsome”) to press Kremlin leaders to finalize the deal. The Soviets got the message: This deal mattered to Nixon personally.

In a 1975 meeting in Geneva Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko wondered why the Soviets had Pepsi but not Coca-Cola. Dobrynin diplomatically observed that it was because “their chairman is more energetic.” Kissinger more bluntly said it was because Kendall “was a friend.”

Kissinger was not always so generous. In a 1973 meeting with the AFL-CIO’s foreign-policy adviser Kissinger thanked organized labor for their support of the president’s foreign policy and exclaimed “The businessmen in this country are a disgrace. Look at Kendall of Pepsi-Cola he would sell the country for a contract.”

The Pepsi-for-vodka swap may have been consistent with Nixon’s policy of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States but it was also a triumph for Kendall. The 1972 PepsiCo annual report featured a two-page photo spread of Kendall standing in front of the iconic St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow’s Red Square with a quote that made him sound more like a statesman than an executive: “I have long believed that trade between nations could help to build bridges of greater understanding between different cultures and economic systems.” Kendall was asserting that private enterprise could succeed in ways that the Kissingers of the world could not—that he could have both the profits of a salesman and the mystique of a statesman.

The deal faced obstacles. The cumbersome Stolichnaya-for-soda swap resulted from the difficulties of trading with a communist country outside the normal trading rules of the capitalist world. Because Soviet currency the ruble could not be traded on international markets and the Soviet Union hoarded its reserves of hard international currencies every deal involved complicated time-consuming and risky exchanges of material goods not the simple ease of currency.

Other obstacles were political. Jewish groups in the Soviet Union boycotted Pepsi charging that the deal placed profits before the rights of Soviet citizens of Jewish descent locked inside the country. (Soviet policy required Jewish emigres to pay exorbitant fees.) Activists in Congress linked U.S.-Soviet trade and human rights to block a planned 75 percent reduction of U.S. tariffs on imports including those of Stolichnaya.

Political and economic challenges could also combine especially as detente crumbled later in the 1970s. PepsiCo aggressively marketed Stolichnaya as an authentically Soviet vodka. That left the brand open to boycotts when Cold War tensions ran high as when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan or a Soviet fighter jet shot down a Korean Air Lines passenger aircraft in 1983.

Still Pepsi’s Soviet market grew and by 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev took power in the USSR Pepsi had built 16 bottling plants there.

What were the Soviets getting out of all this? For Soviet leaders after Joseph Stalin trade with the West offered many advantages something they repeatedly made clear. Khrushchev stressed Soviet openness to trade when he met a delegation of U.S. state governors weeks before the American exhibition opened in Moscow.

Trade in such raw materials as gold and oil offered the Soviet Union the ability to earn hard currency which it could use to purchase advanced equipment (or when the harvest failed food) on world markets. Yet Soviet leaders conscious of their disadvantages relative to the leading technologically sophisticated capitalist countries also found commercial dealings to be a promising way to import more sophisticated technology. In 1966 for example the Italian automaker Fiat signed an accord to build a major automobile factory in a partnership with Soviet industry an investment whose impact in real terms far exceeded that of the Pepsi deal.

In the early 1970s Soviet leaders hoped that the Pepsi agreement would be only the first in a series of more such deals with the United States Western Europe and Japan. Reform-minded technocrats calculated that the occasionally pragmatic Nixon administration offered a window to accelerate Soviet growth. When the U.S. Congress tied human rights to the trade deal it weakened those reformers and detente—which were dealt another blow by the ascent of the hard-line anti-communist U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

Gorbachev’s ascent meant a return to the broad Soviet policy of international relaxation economic cooperation and domestic reform. Yet circumstances had changed. Western businesses were now warier of the political risks associated with trade with the Soviet Union. They had also learned at great cost about the less dramatic but real headaches involved with doing business in the Soviet Union: customs hassles contract violations truculent workers a primitive financial system and creaking logistics.

Despite those hardships American brands including McDonald’s Pizza Hut (also owned by PepsiCo at the time) and even Baskin-Robbins cautiously entered the liberalizing Soviet market. Even Coca-Cola entered the market (in a limited way with its flagship Coke at first only available in hard-currency stores open to tourists) when Pepsi’s exclusive deal expired.

There were some secondary benefits from entering the Soviet market: Pepsi ran television ads in the United States implying that its sodas had caused glasnost. The more important bet was on the long term. Executives like Kendall still thought that such hassles would be worth building a business that could be profitable as the reforming Soviet economy took off. Corporations got the best of all worlds: the ability to out-compete bumbling Soviet firms while using clout to exclude foreign rivals.

1989 turned out to be an axial year. Tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in June. The Berlin Wall fell in November. Less remembered but almost as important to observers at the time was that the Soviet Union held meaningful elections for its new legislative body the Congress of People’s Deputies another step that seemed to confirm the power of Gorbachev and reformers.

That was the environment in which PepsiCo concluded the deal that delivered the Pepsi navy. The ruble was still worthless internationally and Stolichnaya’s growth prospects were more limited than in 1972 so enlarging Pepsi’s sales in the USSR meant turning to new sources of revenue.

These were the circumstances in which PepsiCo struck the deal for the submarines and other vessels. The novelty of the submarine trade grabbed headlines even at the time but PepsiCo never even took possession of the watercraft. As the Associated Press reported in July 1989 PepsiCo was just the middleman for the vessels bound for the scrap heap which went to a Norwegian ship-breaker instead.

Indeed there was little notable about the sale of the submarines except that it involved Pepsi. The Soviet navy had begun selling its obsolete and unseaworthy vessels for scrap in the late 1980s one component of a flood of scrap exported from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Economist reported in 1990 that the Eastern bloc glut had contributed to scrap prices’ slide from 70 British pounds (over $100 at the time) per ton to less than 40 pounds per ton in only a few months. By then a Soviet Whiskey-class submarine could be had for $50000 or a destroyer for $400000. Even at those prices they were hardly worth the cost of ship-breaking not least because Soviet ships could contain loads of asbestos. Hard-liners in the West warned that such deals could simply help fund Soviet naval modernization making the Soviet navy of the 1990s a far more formidable foe.

The sale of the Pepsi vessels for scrap may have been worth a few million dollars which brought the Soviet navy much-needed hard currency. Yet it was a sideshow. The real soda-for-ships deal involved ships that would work. Initially PepsiCo arranged for its vodka countertrade arrangement to include two 28000-ton Soviet oil tankers which PepsiCo bought in a joint arrangement with a Norwegian shipping firm run by a friend of Kendall’s. In April 1989 according to the Financial Times PepsiCo joined a similar bigger deal with a Soviet trade organization and two Norwegian firms valued at nearly $2.6 billion to deliver as many as 85 Soviet-built ships over a decade. (The reported value of the deal varies by source possibly because American firms that were engaged in bartering could understate their true value to avoid tariffs and taxes.)

Pepsi announced the deal would double its sales of soda inside the Soviet Union over a decade and enable it to open Pizza Huts in the country. The Norwegian partners would handle the marketing of the Soviet ships (and bear the risks of selling the vessels). And the Soviet Union would receive not only a market for its ships but also investment by the Norwegian partners to overhaul shipyards where the vessels would be built.

With a reformist government moving forward executives such as Kendall assured themselves that the future looked bright for their investments in the Soviet Union. But one consequence of liberalization was a new wave of public criticism. Anatoly Sobchak the democratic mayor of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) attacked the expanded Pepsi deal as an exercise in “gigantomania” that would destabilize the market. Kendall ruefully observed in early 1991 that it had been easy to do business with the centralized economy before Gorbachev but “Dealing in a democracy in the Soviet Union today is much more difficult.”

Yet the fact that those objections could be voiced seemed only to confirm that reform was real and that progress was possible. On July 30 1991 U.S. President George H.W. Bush announced major steps toward full trade normalization. “My country stands ready to assist in this new Soviet revolution” Bush said. But Bush cautioned “Western governments—with their own strapped resources—are limited in what they can do. So we must bring together the businessmen from Europe and America and their partners from all across the Soviet Union.” Finally Kendall’s vision would be realized: Western capitalism would end the Cold War and get rich in the process.

Less than three weeks later hard-line forces launched a coup against Gorbachev. Within months leaders of key Soviet republics dissolved the union. On Dec. 25 1991 Gorbachev resigned as president of the USSR which vanished with the stroke of his pen.

To be sure Pepsi’s interests in Russia didn’t disappear. In 2020 PepsiCo reported revenue of $3 billion in Russia its third-largest market behind Mexico and the United States. In 2004 Kendall received the Order of Friendship for his contributions to Russian commerce from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yet there was no longer any mystique. Russia was now just one developing and newly competitive market among many.

The Pepsi navy has been remade as part of a narrative in which Soviet collapse was inevitable a can-you-believe-this story about an American victory lap over a terminally ill enemy. It fits the era of economic chaos that followed when the Russian economy crumbled oligarchs plundered industries and resources and military stockpiles—with functioning weapons not rusted submarines—really were traded on the black market.

But the thesis that foreign economic trade and investment could transform a moribund communist economy was tried in the People’s Republic of China at about the same time. Chinese technocrats wagered that international firms would bring new techniques and experience. And just as the Soviets gave Pepsi a monopoly in exchange for these benefits China granted Coca-Cola exclusive rights to its market in 1978.

Perhaps the Soviet Union could not have managed what China accomplished. Yet the idea that only one communist juggernaut could succeed was far from obvious at the time. Had events unfolded the way Kendall hoped and Gorbachev planned the 1990s might have been a decade of democratization and economic growth for a strengthening Soviet Union. And the story of how Pepsi scrapped 17 Soviet submarines to cement its hold on the Soviet market would have been just one among thousands about how American investments helped a former foe become an economic competitor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vdXMtc3BvcnRzLW5ld3MteW91dmUtb3ZlcmNvbWUtc28tbXVjaC11c2Fpbi1ib2x0LXNlbmRzLWluc3BpcmluZy1tZXNzYWdlLXRvLWVtaXJhdGktb2x5bXBpYW4td2hvLWlkb2xpemVzLWhpbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You've Overcome So Much: Usain Bolt Sends Inspiring Message To Emirati Olympian Who Idolizes Him,"Usain Bolt of Jamaica reacts as he wins the Olympic mens 200m final in a new world record time in the Birds Nest stadium Beijing on August 20th 2008 in Beijing China (Photo by Tom Jenkins/Getty Images).

This hasn’t reached South Africa yet – but John Blake expects it to not least because local businesses are bargains.

Heineken’s proposed R40.1 billion offer for Distell is the latest in a series of notable bids for large South African businesses. This follows DP World’s recent proposed R12.7 billion offer for Imperial Logistics and PepsiCo’s R26 billion acquisition of Pioneer Foods in 2020. A key driver for all three deals is using the local companies as a platform for African expansion.

Could this be indicative the country is the next hot spot for merger and acquisition (M&A) activity?



Typically our businesses are bargains compared to their overseas counterparts.

With M&A activity at an all-time high in Europe and the US it is likely that there will be further spill-over to local shores; especially given the select value proposition that certain South African companies present. This has major positive implications for the country’s economic recovery prospects.

Local companies are generally subject to a risk premium which discounts their value making them cheaper than like-for-like companies overseas.

South African companies that are profitable and globally competitive are being sold at a significant discount compared to their global peers.

Why the discount?

The main reason for the discount is the inherent risk factors attached to South African and African companies. This risk premium is reflected in the country’s undervalued currency and high cost of borrowing.

Translink South Africa recently advised a local investment holding company with their acquisition of a SA-based manufacturer of high-tech ink for digital printers. Their client is an example of this in action.

The target earns 85% of its revenue in US dollars exports to 80 countries and boasts a state-of-the-art manufacturing set up. This company could be anywhere in the world. Yet because it’s in South Africa it was sold at a significant discount compared to peer transactions in its sector in the US and Europe. It was an incredible deal for our client.

There’s lots of gloomy news dominating discourse around South Africa – from the looming drop in the country’s credit rating to load-shedding government borrowing looting and more. This means most companies listed on the JSE are viewed through the same lens. As such when people invest here they expect higher returns to compensate for the risk  which means they’re serially undervalued.

But many top-performing local companies have different far more positive risk profiles. Between 2015 and 2021 Mergermarket reported 145 transactions involving South African companies as buyers or sellers across all sectors with the EBITDA multiple disclosed.

The average multiple paid for SA companies is 6.2 times EBITDA in the past 12 months; according to the Argos Index - which tracks the prices paid for mid-market companies in Europe - average deal multiples have climbed to an all-time high of 11.6 times EBITDA in Europe for the same period.

Some of the recent large local deals were done at deep discounts:

PepsiCo’s acquisition of Pioneer Foods: The acquisition valued at approximately $1.7 billion implies approximately 11 times forward 2020 consensus EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation) for Pioneer Foods.In Pioneer Foods' sector on the JSE the average trading EBITDA multiple is 8.3 times. In its sector in Europe the average trading EBITDA multiple is 19.1 times and in the US it is 22.1 times.

In its sector in Europe the average trading EBITDA multiple is 19.1 times and in the US it is 22.1 times. DP World's offer to acquire Imperial Logistics: This offer is approximately 3.1 times historical EBITDA for the FY2020 and 3.8 times the estimated June 2021 EBITDA.The average trading multiple of Imperial for the last 2 years is 2.5 times in Europe and the US across 179 listed logistics companies it is 12 times.

This offer is approximately 3.1 times historical EBITDA for the FY2020 and 3.8 times the estimated June 2021 EBITDA.The average trading multiple of Imperial for the last 2 years is 2.5 times in Europe and the US across 179 listed logistics companies it is 12 times. Heineken’s offer to Distell: Heineken’s offer to Distell shareholders come to R180 per share – which was below Friday’s share price of R182.59. But Heineken says the price is 35% above the average share price of Distell in the month before 17 May when it first announced that it was considering a takeover. It is currently trading at 10 to 11 times EBITDA multiple. For the distillers and vintners sectors in the EU and the US (126 listed companies) the average trading EBITDA multiple is 16.89 times.

The real growth story

South African companies in certain sectors are often more profitable than their overseas counterparts. Most local sectors are dominated by a few large companies and lack the level of competition from mid-sized companies in the same sector that would constitute the bulk of most sectors in more mature foreign markets. Also many top-performing local companies have mitigated risk exporting and diversifying away from SA risk and hence offering lower risk profiles.

Clearly many big-name brands are starting to realise this and are prepared to pay a premium for top SA companies.

Comparing the average EBITDA multiple of a transaction involving a local business buying a local business to a foreign business acquiring a local business it’s evident foreign companies pay on average 40% more for South African companies than local buyers do.

Why?

Foreigners are prepared to pay what is considered a premium by South African standards for the cream of our local company crop’ because of what they’d expect to pay for these companies in their home markets.

We advised on the disposal of South Africa’s largest hazardous waste disposal company in 2019. We marketed the company locally and abroad. On average offshore companies offered us 30% more than local companies. The offshore companies viewed it as an opportunity for strategic intercontinental expansion whereas local entities saw it as more of a ""bolt-on"" addition to grow their existing operations. This difference in thinking may also account for offer discrepancies.

Business is booming – and it’s just the beginning

Europe and the US are experiencing the highest levels of M&A activity ever on record. This hasn’t reached South Africa yet – which is sitting at 2019 levels. But we he expects it to.

There’s a lot of money moving around overseas which should fall all the way through here.

In fact it’s already started to. We’ve seen some massive deals in the last year.

This is a good news story that shows that strong confidence in South African companies is returning.

They offer unparalleled value for money and prospective profitability. Right now many eyes are on the country as the next major opportunity for M&A activity.

Although no infections linked to the Omicron variant have been detected in the UK or the US so far there has been a case in Belgium involving an unvaccinated person who had travelled abroad.

Salim Abdool Karim one of South Africa's top epidemiologists told Sky News he ""would expect it to be in the UK"" by now.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that there is a ""possibility it might have a different impact on individuals"" who get coronavirus.

However he stressed the UK remains in a ""strong position"" due to the high vaccination take-up - adding that Omicron's presence means getting a booster jab is even more important now.

British scientists first became aware of the new strain on 23 November after samples were uploaded on to a COVID variant tracking website from South Africa Hong Kong and then Botswana. A total of 59 samples have been uploaded so far.

Amid the concerns flights to the UK from South Africa and five other southern African countries - Namibia Lesotho Botswana Eswatini and Zimbabwe - have been suspended until 4am on Sunday.

CEO Pascal Soriot said this might explain the United Kingdom’s more stable hospitalisation rate compared to the escalating COVID situation in continental Europe.

The UK used the AstraZeneca vaccine a lot more widely than other European countries many of which restricted its use to older age groups or abandoned using it altogether after reports of very rare blood clots.

The theory behind this is the AstraZeneca vaccine may provide more durable “T cell protection”. T cells are a crucial part of our immune system and differ from antibodies.

There’s not enough evidence yet to support the CEO’s claim. But we do know a lot more about adenovirus vector vaccines such as AstraZeneca’s as they’ve been around for decades while mRNA vaccines are relatively newer.

Theoretically it is possible adenovirus vector vaccines do give more durable protection against COVID via T cells.

Let me explain.

What is AstraZeneca’s vaccine again?

AstraZeneca’s COVID vaccine is an adenovirus vector vaccine.

This means it uses an adenovirus – a common type of virus that affects humans and many other animals. The adenovirus is genetically modified so it doesn’t replicate.

It’s used as a way to deliver the vaccine’s information into our cells.

In this case the information packaged in the adenovirus tells our body how to make the coronavirus spike protein. This teaches our immune system how to deal with the coronavirus if we’re exposed.

Adenovirus vectors have been used in medicine for a few decades in other vaccines and also cancer therapy. They’re very good at stimulating both antibody production and T cell responses.

What are T cells?

Antibodies bind tightly to a specific target locking onto invading viruses and preventing them from entering our cells.

But the immune system is more than just antibodies.

T cells are also really important for our immune response and have different roles. One type known as “killer T cells” attack and destroy virus-infected cells.

Another type known as “helper T cells” interpret the nature of the infection and help the immune system respond appropriately. This includes activating killer T cells to destroy virus-infected cells and also helping B cells make antibodies.

Antibodies wane over time which can lead to more breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people.

When viruses are not stopped by antibodies we rely on killer T cells to eradicate the virus. And T cells almost certainly help prevent severe outcomes if you get COVID.

It’s a lot harder for a virus to escape a T cell-based immune response. So a vaccine that generates strong T cell immunity should help retain effectiveness over time against variants including Delta and Omicron.

Read more: Why are we seeing more COVID cases in fully vaccinated people? An expert explains

All COVID vaccines stimulate our bodies to produce both antibodies and T cells.

So the key questions are: does AstraZeneca’s vaccine produce a longer-lasting T cell response than the mRNA vaccines? And might this be one reason why the UK which relied heavily on the AstraZeneca vaccine has a more stable hospitalisation rate than other parts of Europe?

Unfortunately there are not enough data yet to answer these conclusively.

There are many reasons why hospitalisation rates can vary between countries so it’s difficult to know how much of a factor the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine would be.

But we can lean on what we know about adenovirus vector vaccines to break down this theory.

Read more: From adenoviruses to RNA: the pros and cons of different COVID vaccine technologies

It’s plausible

Adenovirus vector vaccines are very good at stimulating immune responses particularly T cell responses.

Current wisdom tells us the mRNA vaccines provide a stronger antibody response than the viral vector vaccines like AstraZeneca’s.

But this antibody protection seems to wane relatively quickly over 4-6 months.

It’s possible immune memory with the mRNA vaccines isn’t as strong and the AstraZeneca vaccine may produce a longer-lasting T cell response that supports more durable immune memory.

This could slow the loss of antibodies and generate a better killer T cell response.

Why might AstraZeneca produce a longer-lasting response?

One reason might be because the RNA in Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines doesn’t last very long in the body only a week or so because RNA is very fragile.

But the DNA delivered by adenovirus vector vaccines will likely hang around in the body for a bit longer.

DNA is more stable than RNA and might allow for a more prolonged low-level activation of our immune system that provides longer-lasting protection.

This might explain longer-lasting T cell responses with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

But this is only speculative for now as such direct tests haven’t been done yet.

If true we can learn from this

This isn’t about which vaccine is “better” or picking and choosing which vaccine to get.

Both are excellent vaccines that have saved many many lives already. We shouldn’t play a tribal game where we say we’re only going to get one type of vaccine.

It’s important to learn from both types of vaccine while we continue to learn about immunity to COVID so we can incorporate the best characteristics of both into next-generation vaccines that help us better fight COVID and future pandemics.

I’m sure mRNA vaccine producers will learn from this and develop new formulas to give a longer-lasting response.

It’s worth remembering Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are the first mRNA vaccines ever approved for use in humans.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times. They were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder this year with Williamson unavailable due to a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-in tournament loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uYmEvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtbGFrZXJzL3ByZWRpY3RlZC1ub3QtdHJhZGUtZm9yLXRyYWUteW91bmcv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWF2eS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL25iYS9sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1sYWtlcnMvcHJlZGljdGVkLW5vdC10cmFkZS1mb3ItdHJhZS15b3VuZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lakers Predicted to Not Trade for $215 Million All-NBA PG,"The Los Angeles Lakers will have a tough decision to make this offseason when they search for a third star to pair with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Making bold predictions for the offseason Andy Bailey of Bleacher Report predicted that the Lakers won’t trade for Trae Young. Young is one of multiple players viewed as a potential suitor for the Lakers if the Atlanta Hawks trade him.

“The logic is pretty simple. Young is a star. He didn’t fit well with Dejounte Murray for the last two seasons. The Lakers went out in the first round and they’ve historically loved to go star-hunting” Bailey wrote on May 11. “There’s certainly a world in which Young in L.A. would work. He’s one of the game’s most dynamic offensive engines and pick-and-roll ball-handlers. He and Anthony Davis could form a potent one-two punch that could potentially grow beyond LeBron James’ eventual retirement.

“But the Lakers just got bullied by the bigger Denver Nuggets in the playoffs. The Nuggets are now getting bullied by the even bigger Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. It’s hard to watch this postseason and think the answer to L.A.’s problems is to get smaller and more offense-first.”

Los Angeles Lakers Looking to Move Draft Picks for Roster Upgrades

The Los Angeles Lakers hold the No. 17 pick in the 2024 NBA draft and have two other tradeable first-round picks. Having three picks and a young player like Austin Reaves with other movable contracts should put them in a position to land someone this offseason and according to Jovan Buha of The Athletic that’s the plan.

Buha said on May 10 that he expects the Lakers to shop that pick to upgrade the roster.

“It will be the first time that they could use all three of their tradable first-round picks and it’s a prime opportunity for them to potentially get either a third star or to improve the roster by attaching one or two or three of those picks alongside players under contract to upgrade the starting lineup or the bench” Buha said. “But it’s the first time they’ll have more than one pick at their disposal and my understanding is that they’re going to be aggressive.”

While there are many possible moves they could make Buha added that it remains to be seen what they’ll do but mentioned Young.

“Whether that is a significant move like a trade for Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell or a smaller move bringing in a 3-and-D wing or another big man remains to be seen. The Lakers are going to explore their options on draft night.” Buha said. “My understanding is that they will be active and aggressive and try to use that pick.”

Trae Young’s Fit With the Lakers

Adding Young would be to improve the Los Angeles Lakers offense. The 25-year-old is just 6-foot-1 and is known as a below-average defender on the perimeter despite averaging 1.3 steals per game this season.

Bailey wrote that the Lakers need a perimeter defender to add to their defense.

“What it needs is perimeter defense and some bruising bigs who can spare Davis from some of the punishment that comes from playing center.”

While Young isn’t that his offensive game has been impressive in his six-year NBA career. An All-NBA selection and three-time All-Star Young averaged 25.7 points and 10.8 assists per game in 2023-24.

His best seasons came in 2021-22 averaging 28.4 points and 9.7 assists per game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2AFodHRwczovL25ld3MucGcuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMjQvUHJvY3Rlci0tR2FtYmxlLVJlY2FsbHMtOC4yLU1pbGxpb24tRGVmZWN0aXZlLUJhZ3Mtb2YtVGlkZS1HYWluLUFjZS1hbmQtQXJpZWwtTGF1bmRyeS1EZXRlcmdlbnQtUGFja2V0cy1EaXN0cmlidXRlZC1pbi1VUy1EdWUtdG8tUmlzay1vZi1TZXJpb3VzLUluanVyeS9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter & Gamble Recalls 8.2 Million Defective Bags of Tide Gain Ace and Ariel Laundry Detergent Packets ...,"Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) today announced a voluntary packaging recall of Tide Pods Gain Flings Ace Pods and Ariel Pods liquid laundry detergent packets packaged in flexible film bags.

PLAQUEMINES PARISH La. — We have new information about the planned layoffs in Plaquemines Parish from the Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery.

According to the notice filed with the state the permanent layoffs will begin on January 7 2022 or within 14 days of that date. They say 470 employees will be impacted.

We spoke with Plaquemines Parish President immediately after the announcement was made. “If you know anyone in Plaquemines Parish they’ve had someone affiliated with Phillips 66 a brother a cousin a dad my brother is personally retired from Phillips 66” Kirk Lepine said.

FULL STORY FROM REPORTER PAUL MURPHY: Plaquemines Parish will lose hundreds of jobs millions in tax dollars with refinery's closure

The Alliance Refinery is also the largest taxpayer in the parish. The shutdown is expected to cost the parish public school district and the sheriff’s office millions of dollars in sales and property tax revenue.

The parish government gets about $1.5 million a year from the refinery.

The parish public school district gets more than $5 million in property and sales taxes.

The sheriff’s office gets close to $2 million.

“Their portion of our taxes; they are about 12 percent of our tax base” Lepine said.

Phillips 66 plans to convert the facility into an oil storage terminal.

The 50-year-old refinery was severely damaged after several feet of water flooded it during Hurricane Ida in August.

Forecast offers no promise of relief.,"Fueled by dry and windy conditions a fire that started off a popular trail at Pilot Mountain State Park on Saturday afternoon grew Monday to encompass hundreds of acres. The blaze forced campers to evacuate and the park to close for the foreseeable future.

The fire has consumed some 500 acres meaning it doubled in size overnight. And a cold front bringing more wind to the area is likely to make firefighting efforts more difficult.

The park’s closure extends to all areas of the park including the river section.

The knob the park’s most distinctive feature was shrouded in a veil of smoke on an otherwise clear morning. Several patches of smoke were visible on the long north-facing slope indications that the fire had spread rapidly.

“Right now there’s pretty much fire all around the top of the mountain basically” said Jimmy Holt the Guilford County ranger for the N.C. Forest Service. “It’s dry windy conditions. We haven’t had significant rainfall in several weeks so suppression is difficult.”

Holt said around 7 p.m. Sunday that the fire is still spreading.

About 30 firefighters from the forest service and the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation are on the scene at the fire. Crews from local fire departments responded to the initial call which came in around 5 p.m. Saturday.

Those local crews are on standby to protect surrounding structures Holt said.

Nearby landowners have not been evacuated and are not in harm’s way Holt said.

Gov. Roy Cooper said in a tweet that he appreciated the work of firefighters and others who are working to keep people safe.

Though the fire has not been contained it is confined to state-owned property.

“We plan on holding the fire to the mountain” Holt said.

Prescribed burns at the state park over the years will help firefighters suppress the fire Holt said.

In addition the base of the mountain has a fire line that was established in 2012 when a wildfire burned nearly 800 acres. That fire started as a prescribed burn.

Madison Abbott who lives in Pilot Mountain said she learned about the fire through social media. Around 9 p.m. the “sky was bright red” and the smell of smoke was strong she said.

She and a few friends drove to Pinnacle View Baptist Church where they got a good view of the fire.

Through binoculars Abbott said she could see flames climbing trees and quickly spreading.

“From far away it looked slow moving but up close you could definitely see it spreading” she said.

On Sunday morning lots of people were out taking pictures of the smoky knob. The stench of smoke was strong around the towns of Pinnacle and Pilot Mountain drifting onto U.S. 52. A scout plane occasionally buzzed overhead.

Against the backdrop of the burning mountain several people with Bibles in hand walked into services at Friendly Chapel Church in the town of Pilot Mountain.

Firefighters have been taking steps to protect structures within the park including the $4 million visitors center that opened in 2020.

Holt said crews are building containment lines around the structures and removing flammable debris.

He encouraged local landowners to avoid burning anything until the fire is out.

There is little chance for rain in the 10-day forecast noted Pilot Mountain Mayor Evan J. Cockerham in a Facebook post.

“Our fire department could use your donations of bottled water snacks Gatorade and other items like that to stay hydrated and on the job” Cockerham said. ”You can drop them off at the fire station (Pilot Knob Volunteer Fire Department) on Key Street. Our firefighters are working to provide water for the aerial response right now.”

The fire comes almost two weeks after a wildfire started by an abandoned campfire burned more than 40 acres at nearby Sauratown Mountain in southwestern Stokes County.

Historians Pat McDaniel and Kathy Shannon say that with little but determination and rudimentary technology the wildcatters sometimes hit 10 dry holes in a row before finally making the big strike.

“Those days of the wildcatters from west of Abilene made this part of the world significant in the oil and gas industry” said McDaniel director of the Haley Memorial Library and J. Evetts Haley History Center in Midland. “C.T. McLaughlin brought in numerous wells on his Diamond M Ranch at Snyder and George H.W. Bush Earle Craig Toby Hilliard Pomeroy Smith and Ed Leede brought the eastern cultural influence in the early 1960s.

“O.C. ‘Kip’ Harper was one of the first oil scouts who literally camped out while studying surface geology. Clayton Williams was a wildcatter in the vein of the old-time wildcatters. He made the Gataga No. 2 gas strike in 1975 in Loving County near Mentone but then the bankers and accountants got ahold of him and he had to think about how to sustain the growth.

“It was hit and miss. They knew after they had drilled some wells and got core samples that there was a sedimentary basin. They didn’t have the benefits of seismic information but they used surface geology to start and got lucky in the 1950s and hit the Spraberry Field which was pretty shallow.”

McDaniel said the wildcatters “would hit maybe one in 10 but they never started a project without believing that they would make a well.

“The odds were stacked against them” he said. “If they found a field they developed inside it and then stepped out from where the edges of it were. In those days a well didn’t pay out very quickly. Midland and Odessa didn’t have much going for them at all till the post-World War II ‘50s when they started developing these oil fields and giving the GIs who stayed here jobs. The eastern families of wealth sent their children or relatives out here to diversify their investments.

“They were drilling with rotary bits right after rotary bits were invented in 1933. Now they have all this information from downhole technology guided by GPS. It took a bunch of people including landmen geologists and brokers to make it come together and work.”

McDaniel said other important early day figures were William M. Fuller the ranching Cogdell family Fred Hogan who built the Hogan Building in 1928 and provided much-needed office space where the Yucca Theater is now in downtown Midland and Clarence Scharbauer who built the Scharbauer Hotel in ‘28 “where lots of oil and cow deals were made.

“Then Jack Wilkinson Sr. built numerous high-rise buildings to give those oil companies office space” he said. “The key elements that were needed to make it work were office space transportation and money. Oil is a commodity subject to the vagaries of the markets but the wildcatters were not afraid to take risks and they were smart enough to do their homework and make a go of it.

“It took a special kind of personality to see the opportunities and then decide to step out and take their risks seize those opportunities.”

After the 1983 failure of Midland’s First National Bank in the midst of the worst oilfield slump that the Basin ever had McDaniel said most of the major oil companies fled in 1986 when oil prices fell below $10 a barrel. “A lot of people thought that was the end of this part of the world but all it did was open up opportunities for independent producers like Joe Parsley and his partner Howard Parker” he said adding that Parker & Parsley Petroleum merged with Mesa Inc. in 1997 to form Pioneer Natural Resources.

“In the early years of oil exploration there developed a co-dependent relationship between the rancher and the oilman. The rancher held the key to the development of the minerals underneath his surface and the oilman held the key to wealth produced by the development of those minerals.

“At times there were strained relationships between the two but in the end they all benefitted.”

Shannon executive director of the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum said Sid Richardson Mack Chase the John E. Mabee family and the Martin Yates family in Eastern New Mexico also figure heavily into the story. “They had a never-give-up attitude” Shannon said.

“They kept trimming and drew something out of nothing. The early geologists thought the land had reserves of oil. It was hard to find it but they did after O.C. Harper’s maps gave them a better idea of where to drill.

“Sid Richardson didn’t know how many dry holes he drilled before he hit his first well.”

Shannon said the beginning of the Basin as a worldwide oil and gas hub was investor Frank Pickrell’s and driller Carl Cromwell’s 1922 initiative near Big Lake in Reagan County to form the Texon Oil & Land Co. and spend 646 days drilling the Santa Rita No. 1 well named for “the Saint of Impossible Causes” and making only 4.7 feet of daily progress finally to hit dolomitic sands and bring up natural gas bubbles just before the oil came blowing out from 3050 feet.

“The early oil wells were very shallow and when they first learned how to drill to 10000 and 12000 feet the Basin became a natural gas field not so much oil” she said. “The Santa Rita set it in motion and helped establish it as an oilfield. Fracturing shale brought it back to oil which they had known was there. They just couldn’t get it out.”

Shannon said another crucial development was the construction by 1950 of 15000 miles of pipelines to move the oil and gas to markets on the Gulf Coast. “George Mitchell figured out how to frac and the Jim Henry group perfected it with slick or soapy water in the early 2000s” she said.

Following a series of consultations1 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has implemented two new cross-border exemption frameworks which came into effect on 9 October 2021.

Together the new exemption frameworks exempt foreign related corporations head offices and branches of Singapore financial institutions from Singapore licensing representative registration and business conduct rules (as applicable) when such foreign institutions conduct activities regulated under the Securities and Futures Act Cap 289 (SFA) and the Financial Adviser Act Cap 110 (FAA) for clients in Singapore under an arrangement with their related Singapore financial institutions. To qualify under the new framework certain qualifying conditions and ongoing requirements will need to be met by new or existing arrangements.

Background

With effect from 9 October 2021 the MAS has implemented a new cross-border exemption framework for: (a) foreign related corporations of Singapore financial institutions (“FRC Framework“); and (b) foreign head offices or branches of Singapore financial institutions (“Branch Framework“).

The FRC Framework exempts foreign related corporations (FRCs) of Singapore financial institutions from licensing and representative registration requirements and business conduct rules under the SFA and FAA when the FRCs conduct activities regulated under the SFA and FAA with clients or prospects in Singapore under an arrangement with their Singapore related financial institutions. The FRC Framework replaces the previous exemptions promulgated under paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule to the SFA and paragraph 11 of the First Schedule to the FAA commonly known as the “Paragraph 9 Approval” and “Paragraph 11 Approval” respectively.

The Branch Framework is a new framework that seeks to close the gap under the previous Paragraph 9 Approval and Paragraph 11 Approval regimes which applied only to arrangements between Singapore financial institutions and their FRCs but not to foreign head offices or branches (collectively “Foreign Offices“) of Singapore financial institutions. The Branch Framework provides a level playing field by operating in a similar manner to the FRC Framework and exempts Foreign Offices from representative registration and business conduct rules when the Foreign Offices conduct SFA- and FAA-regulated activities with clients or prospects in Singapore under an arrangement with their related Singapore financial institution(s).

In the context of the frameworks “Singapore financial institutions” refers to entities branches or head offices in Singapore that are: (i) capital markets services licence holders under the SFA; (ii) financial advisers licence holders under the FAA; (iii) exempt capital markets intermediaries under Section 99(1)(a) (b) (c) or (d) of the SFA (e.g. licensed banks and merchant banks that are registered with the MAS to conduct SFA-regulated activities); (iv) exempt financial advisers under Section 23 of the FAA (e.g. licensed banks and merchant banks that are registered with the MAS to conduct FAA activities) other than pursuant to subsection 1(ea) and (f); and (v) exempt persons under paragraphs 3(1)(d) or 3A(1)(d) of the Second Schedule to the Securities and Futures (Licensing And Conduct Of Business) Regulations (i.e. exempt brokers).

FRCs and Foreign Offices may only rely on the FRC Framework or Branch Framework respectively if they meet certain qualifying conditions. The Singapore financial institution will need to file a notice of commencement of activities carried out under the FRC Framework or Branch Framework (as applicable) with details of the relevant FRCs or Foreign Offices contained in the prescribed Form FN and confirm compliance or commitment to comply with the qualifying conditions and ongoing requirements (“Initial Filing“). The Initial Filing must be filed within 14 days of commencement of the cross-border arrangements. Unlike the previous Paragraph 9 Approval and Paragraph 11 Approval regimes prior approval from the MAS is not required under the new FRC Framework and Branch Framework.

The Singapore financial institution is obliged to ensure that the qualifying conditions and other ongoing requirements are met on a continuing basis. We discuss some of the key aspects of each of the qualifying conditions and ongoing requirements further below.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

In internal trainings companies from Disney to Lockheed-Martin ask their employees to “challenge colorblind ideologies” and “deconstruct their white male privilege.” Firms spend vast sums of money on such trainings on diversity-related speakers and on maintaining a progressive image. Employees find themselves wondering why their workplace has transformed into a progressive propaganda center.

Much has been made of the propagation of certain ideas—call them social-justice ideology critical race theory or wokeness—in American institutions. But surprisingly little attention has been paid to the question of why institutions “go woke.” Some address this question in philosophical or ideological terms noting the continuity between these ideas and the work of certain twentieth-century intellectuals from the Frankfurt School in the 1920s to the critical race theorists of the 1980s. But a historical and sociological analysis can help explain why institutions accepted these ideas as legitimate in the first place.

Race-conscious policy has become a self-sustaining force in the modern workplace. Where companies once adhered to a paradigm of “compliance” in which they adopted affirmative action to satisfy a new legal regime they now follow the rule of “diversity” which encourages race-consciousness as an end in itself. If social-justice ideology is the food that universities and businesses give to their students and employees diversity is now the air that they breathe the set of taken-for-granted assumptions without which woke ideas would be ignored. The story of diversity’s institutionalization in American corporate culture tells us much about how we got to this current moment—and how we can move beyond it.

The story starts in the civil rights era—not with marches sit-ins and the broader social movement but with the sprawling bureaucracy that this movement produced. Lyndon B. Johnson’s landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically expanded the responsibilities of the executive and judicial branches compelling regulators to intervene in education housing and welfare. It also created new regulatory entities such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to carry out its mandates. “Civil rights ideology” writes journalist Christopher Caldwell “especially when it hardened into a body of legislation became most unexpectedly the model for an entirely new system of constantly churning political reform.”

The new regime however well intentioned came with a complexity that private enterprise struggled to understand. As sociologists Frank Dobbin and John Sutton have argued the machinery of civil rights suffered from many of the problems that plague the rest of the U.S. regulatory state. It was ambiguous in that it broadly prohibited discrimination without clearly articulating what that meant; it was continuously expanding so corporations constantly had to update their awareness of relevant rules; and it was fragmentary in that it was carried out by redundant and often conflicting agencies at different levels of government. Such terms as “affirmative action” and “discrimination” were rarely defined their meanings always in flux.

Still enforcement took off in the 1970s as both political parties embraced the new apparatus. The doctrine of disparate impact enshrined by the Supreme Court’s unanimous 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. lowered the burden of proof for bias. Richard Nixon set up “goals and timetables” for corporate affirmative-action commitments and established hiring quotas for federal contractors Gerald Ford promulgated regulations mandating bilingual education and Jimmy Carter consolidated enforcement power under the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) while welcoming “hundreds of complaints” against employers for various violations. Under all three presidents the EEOC aggressively targeted some of America’s biggest employers including AT&T General Electric and Ford.

Facing the dual challenges of inscrutable regulation and aggressive regulators businesses responded by complying with the new mandates for race-consciousness under the Civil Rights Act’s Title VII. They implemented race-conscious policies to avoid the ire of regulators and the risk of lawsuits or federal investigations. Diversity consultants Rohini Anand and Mary-Frances Winters note that corporate trainings were primarily legalistic affairs “a litany of dos and don’ts and maybe a couple of case studies for the participants to ponder.” As civil rights regulations grew so did corporations’ tools for complying. In 1970 Dobbin observes fewer than 20 percent of firms had written equal-employment or affirmative-action rules; by 1980 after a decade of heavy-handed enforcement nearly half had done so.

Yet large majorities of the country opposed affirmative action which became a chief target of Ronald Reagan. On the campaign trail in 1980 he identified affirmative action as an example of government overreach and micromanagement promising to roll back “bureaucratic regulations which rely on quotas ratios and numerical requirements.” Once Reagan took office an entrenched bureaucracy a hostile Congress and courts frequently thwarted his ambitious agenda. He did however ease compliance pressures for a time. William Bradford Reynolds Reagan’s appointee to run the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division publicly opposed the use of quotas and endorsed colorblindness in hiring. Then–EEOC chairman Clarence Thomas shifted the focus from big systemic cases to individual instances of discrimination and tried to minimize the use of “goals and timetables.” The OFCCP downshifted and both agencies saw their staffing and funding levels slashed.

If corporations were still complying with affirmative action merely because of legal pressures this regulatory relaxation should have induced them to reverse course. But astonishingly they strengthened their commitment to affirmative action even filing amicus briefs and sending telegrams to Reagan in support of it. A 1985 survey of Fortune 500 companies that Dobbin cites found that 95 percent would “continue to use numerical objectives to track the progress of women and minorities” even if such objectives were no longer imposed. A 1986 survey found that despite reduced enforcement 90 percent of firms planned to keep their affirmative-action programs unchanged while the other 10 percent planned to expand them. Once a product of compliance with government regulation race-conscious corporate policy had taken on a life of its own.

“The doctrine of disparate impact enshrined in a 1971 Supreme Court decision lowered the burden of proof for bias.”

Corporations were not going to give up race-conscious policy just because Reagan told them to but they needed a rationale for continuing to pursue it. The Reagan administration unwittingly handed them one with Workforce 2000 a 1987 report commissioned by the Department of Labor and authored by two fellows at the Hudson Institute that unexpectedly became a bestseller. The report’s blockbuster finding: by the end of the millennium only 15 percent of those entering the workforce would be white men while the large remainder would be women and minorities. This pending demographic tidal wave gave business leaders a new reason to care about race- and sex-conscious policy—namely the need to create a workplace that could cater to a wide variety of workers.

Thus the diversity paradigm was born. R. Roosevelt Thomas the godfather of workplace diversity management argued that affirmative action had been designed to help women and minorities enter a monolithically white and male labor market. But by 1990 women immigrants and minorities were part of the workforce and Workforce 2000 argued would soon be the overwhelming majority of new entrants. “Women and minorities no longer need a boarding pass” wrote Thomas. “They need an upgrade.” Building a corporate culture that helped them achieve their full potential meant “managing diversity”—not only ensuring that the new heterogeneous workforce was as productive as the old homogeneous one but extracting the added value that this heterogeneity could bring. As one academic puts it diversity management is “aimed at maximizing every individual’s potential to contribute towards the realization of the organization’s goals through capitalizing on individual talents and differences within a diverse workforce environment.”

The shift from compliance to diversity constituted a regime change. Compliance was naturally limited: businesses followed the rules to avoid legal and cultural strife. But diversity was potentially unlimited: one could always do more to make the corporate culture more welcoming to members of various identity groups. Unlike compliance diversity had a business case: it was said to be the key to survival in the twenty-first-century economy. And diversity came to dominate discussions of race-consciousness in the workplace. One analysis of professional management journals found that discussion of diversity-related concepts was more or less nonexistent prior to 1987 but after Workforce 2000 appeared it took off—a trend that has persisted.

While the business case for diversity still commands the support of corporate leaders it is empirically lacking. Workforce 2000’s most sweeping conclusion—that by the turn of the century white men would make up just 15 percent of new entrants to the workforce—was wrong. In reality those entering the workforce by 2000 would look much like those in 1987. Even today the workforce remains majority white particularly at the top end of the skill distribution where the economy is growing fastest. The demographic tidal wave never came.

Meantime research generally doesn’t support the notion that diversity is good for the bottom line. Meta-analyses of the literature on measures of cultural or demographic diversity among employees routinely yield mixed findings reporting no effects or even small negative effects of such measures as racial and sexual diversity on team performance. Cultural diversity—that is the immigrant share of the workplace—can sometimes have small positive effects on innovation but those effects are both modest and contingent on other factors. Evidence from studies that randomly assign students to new businesses is similarly equivocal. One study based on Dutch students found a U-shaped relationship between team diversity and business performance suggesting that there can be both too little and too much diversity. Another based on MBA students at Harvard found that greater gender and race diversity resulted in worse performance by randomly assigned teams.

“Research generally doesn’t support the notion that diversity is good for the bottom line.”

Perhaps diversity improves business performance in some situations but it clearly doesn’t do so all the time. That’s unsurprising: diversity introduces new perspectives which can spur innovation but it can also make teamwork more challenging. Diversity is far from the “killer app” that its proponents make it out to be.

If the findings on diversity and productivity are ambiguous the evidence for whether diversity trainings or similar programs succeed is unambiguously negative. Research on online diversity trainings finds limited durable behavioral change. A 2016 report from the EEOC found that harassment training had little effect on workplace behavior. An analysis of some 700 companies found that diversity trainings and diversity evaluations for management can actually result in fewer minorities represented among management. And at least some evidence exists that adopting diversity goals and teaching about stereotypes can actually serve to reinforce stereotypes.

In short race-conscious policy is not fundamental to business success. Yet every year businesses spend billions on diversity initiatives which they believe are both urgently necessary and good for their bottom line. Why did they adopt a belief based on faulty evidence—and why do they persist in that belief?

Compliance had a rational basis: engage in (or appear to engage in) affirmative action to avoid legal trouble. Diversity’s rational basis—to compete in an ever more diverse economy—appears to be a mirage. Instead diversity seems to have survived because corporations have been unwilling to drop an entrenched practice even after justification for its original purpose receded. Diversity was a norm that had become by the 1990s “institutionalized.”

In a classic 1977 paper sociologists John Meyer and Brian Rowan argue that an organization’s behavior is structured not only by the pursuit of efficiency or productivity but also by the social context in which that organization exists. That social context—including everything from public opinion and the law to the “views of important constituents” and “knowledge legitimated through the education system”—often results in the adoption of practices that determine an organization’s structure. These practices are not necessarily adopted because they are optimal for profit-making though but because they are simply what is done. As Meyer and Rowan remind us corporations don’t always do things to enhance the bottom line; they also create and participate in “ceremonies” and “myths.” And failure to do so can endanger their social position.

History suggests that by the time Ronald Reagan came to power and began to ratchet back affirmative-action enforcement race-conscious policy had become institutionalized in the sense that followers of Meyer and Rowan (often called the “neo-institutional” school of sociology) mean. Diversity emerged not because it served the bottom line but because race-consciousness was simply what was done: it was an end in itself after which the business case was always a post-hoc justification.

As conditions have changed since the 1990s workplace diversity has evolved. Where diversity management was once the watchword human-resources officers now talk about “diversity equity and inclusion” while still insisting that race-consciousness is an essential principle of business success. Most firms have followed the trend to appease their employees. As liberal views and employability (as measured by education) have become closely correlated firms compete for skilled workers by adopting woke corporate cultures making wokeness a form of nonpecuniary benefit. In the process the demands of diversity become increasingly excessive. Corporate executives routinely spend their weekends “dismantling whiteness” in elaborate performances.

The transition from compliance to diversity converted race-consciousness from a legal mandate to a feature of doing business and thereby legitimated the pursuit of race-focused political agendas in the workplace. When employees demand or employers proactively grant that the company should tweet about Black Lives Matter or hold segregated training events it is partly because they have adopted the superficial logic of diversity agreeing that race-conscious policy is fundamental to profitability.

The institutionalization of diversity also explains why worker and activist demands have grown more extreme from the awkward multiculturalism of the 1990s office to the outright struggle sessions of today. Compliance had limits: though firms competed to prove their level of compliance a fundamental relationship existed between what regulators said and what companies did. The transition from compliance to diversity marks the moment at which race-conscious corporate policy became unmoored from rational purpose and mutated into a myth. Unlike compliance diversity is unlimited—unbounded by a rational goal and pursued for its own sake. Organizations have no capacity to reject new diversity initiatives; more diversity is always better. In fact because diversity is institutionalized questioning its efficacy at achieving its stated goals gets you nowhere (except fired). Radical ideas leak from the academy into the corporate world as diversity easily absorbs ever more elaborate definitions of race-conscious policy.

In a recent essay political scientist Richard Hanania argued that wokeness is a direct product of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its outgrowths. An anti-woke agenda Hanania reasons must therefore strike at the root of the post–civil rights regime tearing up the laws and rules that perpetuate it.

That argument is incomplete. Yes contemporary racial progressivism is linked genealogically to the post–civil rights dispensation. But even if the post–civil rights regime of aggressive federal oversight and disparate-impact enforcement were undone tomorrow wokeness would persist—just as it did when Reagan sought to draw back the regulator’s reach slightly and just as it did under the Trump administration.

Legal solutions do exist to check the excesses of institutionalized diversity. As Hanania notes corporate decision-makers can’t ignore the cudgel of state power: compliance concerns may not be dominant any longer but organizations must still follow the law. Because American civil rights law remains ambiguous broad and unevenly enforced it is exploited by a class of personnel experts with a vested interest in perpetuating extreme forms of racial progressivism. Overbroad lawmaking begets arbitrary and capricious administration inducing firms to go further and further in fear of the long arm of the law. Clarifying what compliance with civil rights laws really means then could help firms that want to follow the rules without succumbing to insanity. Such regulatory reforms are almost certainly more desirable—and more electorally palatable—than wholesale assaults on the civil rights state including its many benefits.

Undoing the corporate diversity regime which doesn’t generate profits and permits harmful radicalism to seep into the workplace should be the ultimate goal. One plausible approach is to heighten the contradictions between colorblindness which still commands the support of most Americans and nominally remains the law of the land and the color-consciousness that has come to dominate workplaces. Racial discrimination remains illegal under Title VII; while the battle to enforce its actual language will be difficult successful legal action would endanger the diversity paradigm. Making clear to firms that if they are too woke they will face lawsuits from disgruntled employees may prove sufficient incentive to curb the worst excesses. An overly woke workplace can count as a “hostile environment” too particularly in the hands of a skilled litigator and a judiciary that has grown more conservative over the past half-decade.

Regulators could facilitate this process. An elite consensus in favor of affirmative action stymied Reagan’s reform efforts. But contemporary wokeness by contrast seems comparatively more polarizing especially among elected Republicans who see it as an inviting political target. Hanania rightly emphasizes that the Trump administration could have been far more aggressive on this front and future administrations should consider the Reagan agenda—both its strengths in theory and the barriers to its implementation in practice.

All this is simply a sketch of what could be done. To move forward however it is important to understand how we got here.

The new movie adapts Progressive light novels – a spin-off of sorts that tells the story of SAO’s first arc but from Asuna’s point of view. However the difference is that this series will cover the entirety of the Aincrad arc unlike the original.

The movie takes the story a bit further while changing some things. The light novels do include Asuna’s SAO beginnings but they also alternate between her and Kirito. The movie mainly focuses on Asuna and also includes a whole new anime original character – Mito.

Overall Production Quality

A-1 Pictures animated the movie and it’s pretty much what the fans are used to when it comes to SAO. Top-tier animation and some breathtaking fighting scenes complete with the character designs we’re all used to. This was the directorial debut for Ayako Kouno who previously worked as assistant director on Studio WIT’s After the Rain. Kento Toya (character designer for Sword Art Online: Alicization – War of Underworld) did character designs for the movie. Yusa Itou was the art director while Yuki Kajiura composed the music. Of course Kajiura has been with the franchise since the very first season of the anime and hearing Swordland throughout the movie was truly nostalgic. The theme song for the movie Yuke by LiSA has been very hyped since the release and it was great hearing LiSA in another SAO project.

The main cast reprised their roles. Haruka Tomatsu and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka are already a well-known duo but this time Inorise Minase is joining them as Mito. It’s worth noting that Aniplex of America is releasing the movie in a dubbed version in which Cherami Leigh and Bryce Papenbrook voice Asuna and Kirito with Anairis Quiñones as Mito.

Story and Characters

First off let’s start with some basics for new fans. Can you watch this movie without having seen the original series? Yes. Should you? Probably not. And this is why: While the story does start from the very beginning of SAO you will still be missing some chunks. Light novels solved this by including Kirito’s point of view as well but the movie mainly focuses on Asuna so while you essentially won’t know what you missed any seasoned SAO fan will recommend the Aincrad arc first. And as far as the series goes those first 12 episodes were truly magical.

There are some deviations from the light novels – such as the lack of Argo the Rat. Since we have no idea what Kirito did before he met Asuna we don’t really get to see what happens on his end which of course means that a lot of side characters simply haven’t been introduced properly. Mito’s contributions are also important especially in the first half of the movie. But more on that later.

This May Be a Game But It’s Not Something You Play

Sword Art Online franchise has always been full of ups and downs. But one thing it never lacked were impactful ideas which may or may not have been well executed. A death game might not be too original but SAO was always entertaining and fairly plausible. Akihiko Kayaba’s intentions may have been psychotic but he does manage to create a whole new world with a different set of rules. And all these different people are simply stuck in it.

As players settle in internal conflict arises. The movie takes the time to explore the BETA testers vs newbies situation even though it skips over some moments from the source material. Despair fighting but also the will to survive are all the very base SAO world was formed on. Although beautiful it’s very difficult for players to take the time and enjoy it. But as time progresses new bonds form and small things become joyful.

Asuna in Spotlight for Once

Making this movie about Asuna brings a whole new dimension to the SAO world. We get to see a completely different side of her which is far from what the main series focused on. She’s been in Kirito’s shadow for the most part even though she is very capable. From her family life to her relationship with classmates Mito and then later Kirito – we get to see a new side of her. This isn’t Asuna who is the second-best player. Nor the Asuna who is a supportive girlfriend who cheers Kirito on while in a bath. This Asuna is scared hurt and determined. Once the initial shock wears off she becomes reckless. And this is how Kirito finds her.

One thing that stood out in all this was Mito’s role in Asuna’s survival. Once again we have Asuna heavily relying on someone else even though she is perfectly capable of surviving on her own and figuring things out. That doesn’t last too long but is another way of making Asuna dependant on someone else which again she really doesn’t need to be doing.

Asuna’s motivation to even start playing SAO was also explored. We see bits of her relationship with her mother in the Mother’s Rosario but the movie gives it a bit more background. Always forced to be perfect by her mother and neglected by her busy father Asuna’s only ally is her brother. Sadly he had a similar upbringing and now as a successful adult he is often away leaving his sister to fend for herself. It is actually Asuna’s classmate who tells her about the game but Asuna doesn’t think twice about getting it. However the loneliness and pressure collide and after finding the gear in her brother’s room Asuna ends up using it.

A Different Side of Kirito

Kirito takes a back seat in the Sword Art Online: Progressive – Aria of a Starless Night but the relationship between him and Asuna has always been an essential part of what made SAO good. Meeting Kirito and learning about him through Asuna kind of gives off a different vibe. The plot armor is still there to an extent but the self-confident slightly cheeky Kirito is gone. Instead we get to see the guilt-ridden side of him as he struggles to adapt to the new world. But after all it is Kirito that changes Asuna’s mind on BETA testers so he is probably managing to pull it off just fine.

Overall the movie manages to make him a bit more… human. He is just a kid and he is also scared even though he is doing his best to hide it. It will be interesting to see how things develop in the sequel and if he gets a bit more air time.

Mito – Did Aria of a Starless Night Need Her?

A lot of the movie’s marketing revolved around Mito. She is in the trailers posters and other promotional material so obviously it made sense that she would play an important role. But it didn’t really work out that well. Don’t get me wrong in a way she did a lot for Asuna. Misumi Tozawa – Mito was the one who got Asuna into SAO in the first place. She is also one of the BETA testers who met Kirito before. But her whole character just falls flat.

The first half of the movie focused on Mito and her relationship with Asuna and tried to make way for her to fit into the story seamlessly. And it worked for a while anyway. Mito’s actions were the motivation behind Asuna and some of the decisions she makes later on but as the story progresses Mito loses importance. She doesn’t really interact with anyone outside of Asuna. By the end of the movie she’s basically third-wheeling and it becomes obvious that the story would still be the same without her there.

Final Thoughts on Sword Art Online: Progressive – Aria of a Starless Night

Sword Art Online: Progressive – Aria of a Starless Night is overall a decent movie but also one that will do better with existing fans of the franchise. It can serve as an introduction but you really should take the time to watch the first half of season 1. That said this movie obviously isn’t marketed towards new fans much like the Progressive light novels themselves. Aria of a Starless Night makes a good addition to the highly-popular franchise and it works decently well in movie format. If this becomes a series and it probably will since the sequel was announced in November it will be interesting to see where it goes. It’s a bit of a shame that it didn’t get released in a TV anime format simply because there would be more time to adapt everything. However the movie did meet expectations.

The sequel is titled Sword Art Online: Progressive – Scherzo of Deep Night and if it follows the source material fully we might even get a time-skip. But that is still far off as it is coming in 2022.

The campaign launched by a global shoe brand succeeded in capitalising on the frenzy of millions of fans around the world.

However in an ecological context the phrase “Bleed Blue” seems aptly suited to describe our “bleeding” marine ecosystems and the environmental degradation caused by anthropogenic global warming. It could perhaps prove more useful if we can recalibrate the narrative around “Bleed Blue” and build a campaign to help galvanise urgent attention and investments required to conserve and sustain India’s Blue Economy.

According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report the Indian Ocean is warming at a rate higher than the global average and almost three times of the Pacific Ocean. Coastal areas will witness rising sea levels which will cause coastal erosion and frequent flooding. With a coastline of 7517 km India will be significantly prone to natural disasters which has the potential to submerge lands and decimate both the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. There will be serious implications on food security as well.

With a coastline of 7517 km India will be significantly prone to natural disasters which has the potential to submerge lands and decimate both the lives and livelihoods of millions of people.

Marine biodiversity is already threatened with a languishing flora and fauna. Rainforests marine reefs and other ecosystems are all feeling the heat. Increasing pollution levels and unsustainable fishing practices too have severely depleted and damaged the marine ecology. It is really not surprising then that India holds the dubious distinction of being the 12th largest source of marine litter and ranks 120th among 122 countries in the Water Quality Index with water contamination rate estimated up to 70 percent. India’s oceans seas and marine resources are all indeed bleeding.

A compounding water crisis with growing coastal vulnerability will increase the risk of maritime security for India particularly in light of China’s inexorable pursuit to bestride the Indo-Pacific. There will also be an inevitable impact on India’s trading and economic partnerships.

In the afterglow of the recently concluded COP26 there couldn’t be a more opportune moment to refocus our strategies on maritime conservation. With a growing consensus consciousness and commitment to attenuate the claims of climate change and India’s recent Net Zero declaration for 2070 preservation and conservation of our natural blue carbon sinks should be a pressing imperative. It will also be in line with realising SDG14 asserting protection and sustainable use of marine resources.

Enhancing resilience of our coastal lines and water bodies will require substantial financial resources but at the same time poses tremendous opportunities to generate revenues enhance local livelihoods and upskill human capital. Innovative financing mechanisms can be useful in this regard. Blue financing instruments such as the blue bonds are gaining traction and can be used as an effective tool to employ capital markets in connecting investors with projects that support sustainable water management and ocean development.

With a growing consensus consciousness and commitment to attenuate the claims of climate change and India’s recent Net Zero declaration for 2070 preservation and conservation of our natural blue carbon sinks should be a pressing imperative.

With the recent success of green and sustainable bonds blue bonds emerged as a corollary to the former in an attempt to steward investments in the blue economy. So far almost six blue bonds have been issued globally pioneered by the Seychelles government in 2018. The setup typically involves a tri-partite arrangement between the government private investors and a multinational development bank which comes in as an underwriter. In the case of Seychelles the World Bank helped develop the blue bond framework and succeeded in raising US $15 million from three primary investors: Calvert Impact Capital Nuveen and US Headquartered Prudential Financial Inc. The role of the multilateral development banks is seminal in this regard given they act as guarantors and risk mitigators which is crucial to boost investor confidence especially in a developing country context.

It could serve India well to forge a similar arrangement to issue blue bonds which can be instrumental in raising substantial private finance from global capital markets for investments in marine conservation and protection. A pipeline of scalable projects should be conceptualised and designed with favourable risk-reward profiles in order to attract the requisite funding. Potential areas of investment could be coastal conservation and restoration flood prevention and management protection of aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity water infrastructure marine energy wastewater treatment and management sustainable land use polluted water treatment sustainable fisheries among other climate mitigation and adaptation activities. This will not only improve the overall health of the marine ecosystem but also be an opportunity for local communities to transition to a more sustainable employment one that will be less susceptible to the vagaries of the climate.

With the recent success of green and sustainable bonds blue bonds emerged as a corollary to the former in an attempt to steward investments in the blue economy.

The veritable challenge here lies in the measurement and management of impact due to incomplete inconsistent and incomparable reporting information. Instead of reinventing the wheel several green bond taxonomies and standards already exist which can be contextualised and aligned to the “Blue Imperative”. Harmonising global reporting standards and mechanisms are crucial to give a fillip to investment in this sector.

Another point of concern could be with the multi-stakeholder format involved in structuring blue-bonds which may be difficult to coordinate and facilitate. However just as Bleed Blue as a campaign has been instrumental in fuelling passion and fostering connections among Indian cricket fans from across the globe similarly our bleeding blue resources should become a cause for a global cooperation. A collaboration among capital market agents multilateral development banks non-profit agencies the government and the community at large will be crucial in promoting marine mitigation and adaption measures as well as harnessing the untapped potential of the Blue Economy.

FULL SENSE is a team name that might not have come to mind when thinking of teams stepping foot in Berlin and competing against the finest in VALORANT Champions 2021. However that was before they rose above anyone’s expectations in the VCT Asia-Pacific Last Chance Qualifier.

A region full of stars Thailand has been producing some of the most high-skilled players in Southeast Asia. One of the highlights in the international scene is Patiphan “Patiphan” Chaiwong who showed his capability at Masters 2: Reykjavik — not to mention his being one of the most prominent personalities in VALORANT. Still there is more to come from Thailand starting December as two teams will raise the flag of Thailand at the year’s most prestigious VALORANT competition VALORANT Champions 2021.

The region has long produced amazing talents yet their exposure outside of Southeast Asia has been minimal. The consistency of Thailand’s flag appearing on the international stage whether individually or as a team can be seen back during the heyday of Counter-Strike in Asia. Behind it all there has always been a strong force of organizations that continually support the scene. Signature Gaming Beyond Esports ALPHA Red Lucid Dream FPSThailand & Made in Thailand are all examples.

Now as the trend has shifted to VALORANT in Asia with all of the experience they gained early in their respective careers it was an opportunity to prove themselves against the rest of the world.

Prior to being “FULL SENSE”

Prior to being recognized as the current FULL SENSE the team was formed in August 2020 under King of Gamers Club before being acquired by NG Esports in November. During that year they have already placed highly in the fierce competition of Thailand’s upper-echelon. NG.Black FULL SENSE (1st gen) Attack All Around Overtime Esports and MiTH were just a few of the names that were often seen during those days. Results had always bounced between these teams with Attack All Around usually coming out on top.

The collapse of MiTH and Attack All Around in January of this year on the other hand seemed to disrupt the whole narrative of Tier 1 VALORANT in Thailand. The situation made NG Black remain high in rank. The tip of an iceberg of their story began with a victory in the second week of VCT Thailand Stage 1. Despite still having a mixed bag of results the squad was able to secure tickets to every Tier 1 competition in both the domestic and Southeast Asian scene.

However NG.Black were dissolved in early April one month before the organization’s entire operation was terminated due to financial issues.

FULL SENSE were also impacted by a major roster turnover in the Thai scene when Patiphan was acquired by X10 Esports (now X10 CRIT) resulting in the team releasing their entire lineup shortly after in April.

Two days later FULL SENSE signed the former lineup of NG.Black and Kititkawin “PTC” Rattanasukol.

PTC himself has been recognized as a household name in both VALORANT and Counter-Strike as one of the most decorated FPS players in Thailand. The AWPer is most known for his time spent with 7642 and 5POWER Gaming. In the latter team he spent a brief time with NGX’s Ngô “crazyguy” Công Anh and other foreign players in the China-based organization.

In 2018 it was relatively uncommon to see a Southeast Asian player being picked up for an international squad and PTC was given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have that experience. Not long after VALORANT’s release PT jumped ship to Riot’s first-person shooter.

Quite quickly PTC began his VALORANT stint under Attack All Around which dominated the overall second half of 2020. There was also a brief period that he played alongside current Team Secret player Riley “witz” Go and NGX player Franz “Astro” Del Rosario in an international team known as NG.Blue that was eventually acquired by Made in Thailand.

The New FULL SENSE

After Made in Thailand disbanded in April PTC got into FULL SENSE reuniting him with Chanawin “JohnOlsen” Nakchain his former teammate in Lucid Dream CS:GO. The move also shifted Theethawat “Zelyn” Taechavitidkhul behind the desk as an analyst for the team until the present.

Since then the current iteration of FULL SENSE has always been on an upward trajectory.

It’s tough to imagine a more perfect year than the one FULL SENSE had. After early exits from tournaments to tournaments with their first-gen team it was as if a switch was flicked and they started winning trophies after trophies.

FULL SENSE flourished as a new household name in the scene with X10 CRIT serving as their primary adversary. After a somewhat slow start the lineup picked up the pace and began to showcase what they were capable of at the biggest events. They continuously stayed on top in every event they have participated in with a semi-final finish being their “worst” overall performance and never more.

Not only were the results consistent but they improved over time. FULL SENSE also came close to securing tickets to Masters 2: Reykjavik but fell short in the final versus X10 CRIT. In short it has always been FULL SENSE walking in the shadow of X10 CRIT including Patiphan who formerly represented FULL SENSE’s first-generation lineup. Both were topping the Southeast Asian stage especially after the two placed first and second respectively in the Stage 2 SEA Challengers Playoffs.

As everyone expected both teams secured their spot comfortably. FULL SENSE entered the Stage 3 SEA Challengers Playoffs as one of the favorites. However it seemed as if the weight of expectations deterred them. FULL SENSE finished fourth after losing in the semi-finals against Alter Ego. They were meant to be favorites but failed to make an impression in the Southeast Asia region.

FULL SENSE raised their expectations (again)

That left FULL SENSE with one last opportunity to secure their tickets to Berlin and attend the most prestigious VALORANT tournament of the year VALORANT Champions 2021.

At the Last Chance Qualifier held for ten of the best teams not qualified for Champions the odds were genuinely stacked against them as NUTURN F4Q and Paper Rex were vying for their second LAN appearance of the year while DWG Global Esports and others were attempting to make a big statement in their first international debut.

FULL SENSE entered the tournament as the #4 seeded team in the SEA. However with the weight removed off their shoulders FULL SENSE charged into their first confrontation against REJECT with all guns blazing. They dictated the phase of the game getting their first win of the LCQ.

This was followed by their largest triumph to date a 13-0 victory against NUTURN – their second-ever 13-0 victory after one over FW Esports. They dashed the dreams of FPS veteran Kang “solo” Keun-chul of participating in his first VALORANT world championship as well as prodigy Yoon “hyeoni” Hyun-debut seok of making his exceptional debut. FULL SENSE stayed in the driver’s seat throughout the whole tournament and culminated it by beating Japan’s NORTHEPTION 3-2 in the final en route to Berlin.

A beacon of consistency – JohnOlsen & PTC

For people who have been following Southeast Asian competition with a keen eye JohnOlsen and PTC are two of the players who have had a significant impact on FULL SENSE’s victory to Champions.

While both players have Jett as their primary pick both have always been flexible with their selection. Over the last two months for example PTC has used ten different agents demonstrating his rich ability to adapt and function in thousands of scenarios. He currently sits with KAY/0 as his best agent boasting an average of 279.2 ACS with the agent followed by Raze and Jett.

While both players have Jett as their primary agent they have always been open to other options. For example PTC has used ten distinct agents during the past two months demonstrating his extensive capacity to adapt and perform in many scenarios. He presently has a cumulative average of 279.2 ACS with KAY/0 followed by Raze and Jett.

While all five players have Counter-Strike experience only PTC and JohnOlsen have competed in Tier 1 SEA Counter-Strike in the past.

Both played under the Lucid Dream banner together consistently qualifying to Asian RMRs during that era. Towards the end of their journey in Counter-Strike they were ranked among Asia’s top five. However when opportunities on the other side emerged the squad dissolved in July.

Despite all of that the team is not centered on the two players. Frankly FULL SENSE would have been unable to reach such heights without the support of the other three players. When one of them is having a rough day ChAlalala LAMMYSNAX and SuperBuSs may all assist them. Their squad is harmonious and doesn’t depend on a single player to be the X factor.

The Thai representatives to face the undoubtedly best Asian teams in attendance

FULL SENSE are looking more polished than ever as they enter Champions. They will battle the other 15 best teams in the globe and are slated to face Vision Strikers in their debut touching the low ping at VALORANT Champions 2021

The song has been released recently under T-Series which is sung by B Praak whereas the rap is penned and written by Dino James. The music video depicts how a man's mental stability changes when someone he cares about abandons him. Ahan Shetty and Tara Sutaria have the passion of love and the love that transcends in the song. Ahan on the other hand is seen crossing the line into obsessive love. The song depicts love in an unusual way.

There's a trade-off on Wall Street with which every dividend investor needs to come to terms: risk versus reward. When you see a giant yield it most likely means there's also giant risk involved in the investment. But that doesn't mean you can't find attractive though not giant yields from real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have increased their dividend for decades. Here are three of the best REITs for low-risk investors and each has a yield that's more than twice that of the S&P 500 Index.

1. The king

The undisputed Dividend King of REITs is Federal Realty (FRT) with a huge 54 consecutive annual dividend hikes under its belt. It is the longest streak of any REIT. The current dividend yield is roughly 3.3%. Compared to the S&P 500 Index's 1.3% yield that's pretty generous noting that despite the headwinds this retail landlord saw in pandemic-hit 2020 it still managed to increase its dividend.

The key is that Federal Realty focuses on quality over quantity when it buys strip malls. Indeed with only around 106 properties it's pretty small but the locations are so strong that even during the pandemic downturn it was fielding calls from retailers looking to upgrade from nearby locations. The REIT also puts a lot of effort into redeveloping its assets to maximize the rent they generate and grow its top and bottom lines.

This brings up the most exciting thing here: Federal Realty bought a handful of new properties during the downturn giving it additional growth levers in the years ahead. That includes adding a new region (Phoenix) to its opportunity set.

Federal Realty will never be a really exciting REIT and the yield will rarely be huge but if a slow and steady dividend payer is your speed you'll want to keep an eye on this one.

2. Bigger and better

Realty Income (O 0.70%) is the next REIT up here. The company owns single-tenant net lease properties which means the tenants are responsible for most of the costs of the properties they occupy. Spread over a large portfolio it's a pretty low-risk way to invest in real estate.

This helps explain why Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for more than 25 consecutive years making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The dividend yield is 3.98%. And the dividend is paid monthly which makes it easier to deal with budgeting for those looking to live off of their dividends.

However the most exciting thing right now is that Realty Income has just stepped up its game using its acquisition of VEREIT to increase its portfolio from around 6600 properties to over 10000. In the net lease sector scale provides a number of benefits.

For example the investment-grade rates REIT has access to cheap capital the heft to take on deals that its peers couldn't manage the ability to spread its costs over more properties and enough diversification in its portfolio that no tenant or sector niche should be too problematic even in a downturn.

On that note the REIT increased its dividend four times in 2020. If you want to own the biggest and the best Realty Income has to be on your list.

3. The all-in-one

W.P. Carey (WPC 0.93%) is the last name on this list with a generous yield of 5.4%. While it isn't a Dividend King or a Dividend Aristocrat it has increased its dividend every year since its initial public offering in 1998. And like Realty Income it hiked the payout every quarter in 2020.

The key here is that W.P. Carey which is also a net lease REIT has long been an opportunistic investor putting money to work where it sees the best opportunities. That investment approach has led to a uniquely diversified portfolio spread across the industrial warehouse office retail and self-storage sectors and across geographies with roughly 37% of rents coming from outside the United States (mostly Europe).

It is probably one of the most diversified REITs you can buy which makes it somewhat of a one-stop shop for investors looking to own a single REIT. It doesn't have the scale that Realty Income offers but that hasn't stopped it from achieving a pretty incredible dividend record. And given its generous yield compared to Realty Income and the broader market it looks relatively attractive today.

The ones to own

Federal Realty and Realty Income both tend to be afforded premium prices by investors most of the time. That includes today which means that value-conscious investors will probably find them less than appealing. However if your goal is reliable income from a relatively low-risk investment both are worth a deep dive.

Meanwhile W.P. Carey has been cheaper in the past but still looks pretty attractive given its above-peer dividend yield and strong dividend history. Most income investors will probably find it appealing right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI2NjY2NzU4MjEwMDEwNDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artificial intelligence: A powerful paradigm for scientific research,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675821001041 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI2NjY2NzU4MjEwMDEwNDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

According to GSMArena the leak was spotted in a staging site for the company. The title of the page is 'Testing icon' and the icon in question sits beside a 'Test123' label.

Clearly this is a template that is meant to be filled in with real text (that is the point of the staging site) but that hasn't happened yet.

The name of the new flagship chipset was supposed to be 'Snapdragon 8 Gen 1'. Qualcomm didn't actually confirm the exact name; it just referred to ""our newest flagship Snapdragon 8-series platform"". So it's possible that the 8-series chips will actually be named '8Gx'.

Qualcomm already has chips named '8cx' the flagship offerings for Windows-on-ARM laptops. There is also an 8c which sits just below the 8cx and an entry-level 7c. If 'c' stands for 'computer' what does the 'G' stand for?

As per GSMArena according to the current naming scheme some chipsets get a 'G' suffix to denote higher clock speeds for the GPU e.g. the Snapdragon 765 and 765G. And the 'x' simply means high-end.

According to a report in GSMArena it will be December 12 because of the smartphone’s name 12/12/21 and the symmetry all over. Allegedly the initial idea was to hold the event on December 16 but that just does not sound right for a smartphone that is named “12” the report said. The Xiaomi 12 is said to sport a curved screen with a centre punch-hole for the selfie camera 120 Hz refresh rate and “2K” resolution dual speakers and a triple rear camera system with a 50 MP main sensor from Samsung or Sony.

Other possible features include 120W fast charging and an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor as per the report. A recent report said that the vanilla model of Xiaomi 12 will feature support for 100W fast charging technology which is unlike 120W fast charging technology that is included in Mi 10 Ultra and Mi 11T Pro among others. As chipmaker Qualcomm is soon expected to unveil its next flagship mobile chipset which will be a direct successor to the Snapdragon 888 Xiaomi 12 is tipped to be the first phone to be powered by the new chip.

The new chip may come with an all-new Qualcomm chipset which is expected to bring significant improvements in graphics performance compared to the Adreno 660 in the Snapdragon 888 and 888+.

We saw plenty of smartphones powered by the Dimensity 1200 SoC in 2021. One of the reasons for that is the fact that the Dimensity 1200 chip was an affordable offering especially when compared to Qualcomm's counterpart. According to a report from Digital Chat Station the Dimensity 9000 might cost double that of the Dimensity 1200 SoC.

Smartphones powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 could cost a lot more than the smartphones powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 1200 SoC. Hence we could expect the price of the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 SoC-powered smartphones to be similar to the smartphones based on the Snapdragon 870 or the Snapdragon 888 processor.

Qualcomm's Offering Will Still Be A Bit More Expensive

Qualcomm's offering -- the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or the Snapdragon 8Gx Gen 1 is said to be more expensive than the Dimensity 9000 SoC. Hence smartphones with Qualcomm's flagship processor will cost a lot more than the smartphones based on the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 SoC.

Coming to the MediaTek Dimensity 7000 the chipset is expected to cost a lot less than the Dimensity 9000 SoC. In fact the Dimensity 7000 might cost similar to the price of the Dimensity 1200 SoC. A phone with the Dimensity 7000 SoC is likely to cost similar to a smartphone with the Dimensity 1200 SoC.

2022 Will Be An Interesting Year For Smartphones

Qualcomm is all set to launch the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or the Snapdragon 8Gx Gen 1 on November 30. While MediaTek is coming with chips like the Dimensity 9000 or the Dimensity 7000 SoC. Hence we could expect a lot of high-end smartphones at various price points. The price of these devices could start from Rs. 30000 and might go up to Rs. 100000 on the high-end Android smartphones.

All these smartphones will have great computing power with the latest connectivity standards and more. These devices will also bring 5G to the mainstream and we could also expect to see affordable 5G smartphones launching in Q1 or Q2 o 2022 from various OEMs such as Vivo Oppo Xiaomi Realme and more.

Xiaomi Could Be The First Brand To Launch Phones With Both Qualcomm And MediaTek Processor

The upcoming Xiaomi 12 is said to be the first smartphone in the world based on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or the Snapdragon 8Gx Gen 1 processor. Similarly Xiaomi is also expected to launch another variant within the Xiaomi 12 series based on the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 SoC.

She then took her talents to Quest Diagnostics from 1999 as a phlebotomist until overcome by illness.

She was often requested by her patients who said she had “the hands of an angel” making the procedure entirely painless.

Khadijah was very joyous strong and brilliant. She would love to watch Jeopardy and the wheel of fortune and figure out the answers before the contestant could even hit the buzzer.

She enjoyed watching scary movies and was also an avid animal lover growing up she and her siblings had a mini zoo inside their home.

Khadijah had a warrior spirit with a sweet heart. She fought hard in a battle with her health however that did not stop her from being happy and raising two children and being there for her family she never complained no matter what.

Her smile and laughter were enough to fill the room with love joy and excitement.

She remained to keep us all happy and refused to let us see her struggle.

She never forgot a birthday and always supported and loved her family and friends so now we celebrate 49 years of her life.

This kind sympathetic-natured young lady with natural goodwill to others will be greatly missed. The family would like to give special thanks to her caregivers during her time of need.

Defensive coordinator Patrick Graham said he has spent his entire career knowing his job is based solely on the performance of his unit or team.

""Every day I come in thinking ‘Hey you could be fired’ "" he said. ""That’s just part of it. I’ve always thought that way whether I was a [quality control coach or] a graduate assistant at Wagner. It’s just the nature of the business of coaching football especially at this level.""

Neither McGaughey nor Graham said Garrett’s departure changes their roles with the Giants. McGaughey clearly distanced himself from the collaborative effort that Joe Judge has instituted to run the offense and took his own name out of any conjecture (not that there has been much) over who the mystery play-caller will be on Sunday.

""I stay in my lane"" he said. ""I’ve got enough to deal with.""

He also pointed to the sign on the door of the team facility that says simply: Do your job.

""We talk about it all the time"" he said. ""That’s players and coaches not just the players.""

Sure the offense was not producing enough points to win and that’s the ultimate reason Garrett was fired. But it’s not as if the defense and special teams have been tearing it up and playing at a championship level either. The remaining coordinators know they easily could be next.

In fact they seem to embrace it.

""It’s higher stakes that’s just how it is"" Graham said. ""We sign up for that because there’s good and bad. If you like living on that edge a little bit you like it.""

""That’s the reality"" McGaughey added. ""We know that walking in the door.""

He wears his friend's name on a scuffed metal bracelet.

""When it's a nice day I look up at the bright blue sky and think of him"" said Swisher 71 who grew up in tight-knit East Taunton.

He looked up to LaPointe who was two years older and always good for a ride to the swimming hole past the airport. LaPointe would arrange to come back by in his 1961 Ford Galaxy.

""He'd pick us all up and bring us back"" Swisher recalled.

Lance Cpl. Raymond Roland LaPointe has been gone more than 54 years. He died on Sept. 10 1967. He was killed by North Vietnamese fire according to military records. LaPointe was one of 13 Tauntonians who died in the Vietnam War.

Memorial Mass and marker dedication

On Saturday Nov. 20 a memorial Mass was said for LaPointe at Holy Family Church in East Taunton. The Catholic service was followed by a dedication of an updated family gravestone at St. James Cemetery.

Ray LaPointe’s nephew Fred 60 drove in from Mississippi for the memorials. While he never met Ray Fred said he was talked about in the family as a great guy.

“He was a person that would try to make everybody happy. He was the type of person to do whatever needed doing” Fred LaPointe said.

Speakers at the service included Mayor Shaunna O’Connell City Councilor-elect Larry Quintal and Dave Levesque of the Taunton Area Vietnam Veterans Association. Taunton Community Access & Media filmed the ceremony and will be broadcasting it.

“To have this type of turnout 54 years later shows you how much he was loved” Swisher said.

It took an unlikely series of events and tenacity from family friends and local politicians to bring last Saturday’s memorial to fruition.

""We finally got it done"" Swisher said.

In May the city dedicated a plaque at Pine Hill Cemetery to LaPointe. Swisher began talking with LaPointe family members about possibly erecting a memorial marker at St. James Cemetery where other LaPointes are buried.

Jennifer Hammett Ray’s niece called Silva Funeral Home where Quintal is funeral director to make arrangements for the funeral of her father Roger LaPointe who was nearing the end of his life. As Swisher tells the story Quintal put two and two together asking her “Did he have a younger brother?”

In order to make the updates to the LaPointe family gravestone someone needed to sign off on the change. Roger LaPointe Ray’s brother and a Marine himself signed the paperwork in hospice before he died.

“Roger had a big big smile on his face” Swisher said.

Cemetery rules limit markers to one per family however. Working with Quintal a plan was worked out to use the blank back side of the LaPointe family stone to add Ray’s dates of birth death rank and place of death. Quintal also had the stone cleaned.

Swisher said the updated memorial wouldn’t have been possible without the work of Quintal O’Connell the Taunton Area Vietnam Veterans Association and others.

“He's a solid human being” Swisher said of Quintal. “If he says he's going to do something he'll do it.”

The memorial Mass and gravestone dedication brought together not only the LaPointe family but also friends from East Taunton.

""LaPointes were very active growing up very active in the community in Holy Family Church” said Fred LaPointe Ray’s nephew. “That was our way of living back then. Everybody knew everybody.”

The battle

According to the National Archives Ray LaPointe was killed Sept. 10 1967 by artillery rocket or mortar fire in Con Thien where the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Marines held a position just outside the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam.

Col. Harry L. Alderman called the battle during which LaPointe died ""The hardest fighting [the battalion] encountered since arriving in Vietnam"" according to the Marine Corp’s 1984 book “U.S. Marines in Vietnam: Fighting the North Vietnamese 1967.”

Swisher who graduated from Taunton High School two years after Ray LaPointe and served in the U.S. Navy said the memorials are for more than his friend’s valor.

“It isn't because he got killed in Vietnam” Swisher said. “He was one of the nicest young men who ever came out of East Taunton. Anyone that needed a favor Ray was there at a young age. I really loved him. He was a friend.”

Watch the ceremony

Taunton Community Access & Media filmed the dedication ceremony. It will be broadcast at a later date and available for viewing in the TCAM archives.

In his first year eligible to be a semifinalist Boldin was named just that after a 14-year career in the league. Joining Boldin as modern-era players to make the cut in their first year of eligibility were wide receivers Steve Smith Andre Johnson and Devin Hester as well as defensive lineman Robert Mathis DeMarcus Ware and Vince Wilfork.

Boldin made a name for himself playing in the Valley after the Cardinals selected him No. 54 overall in the 2003 NFL Draft. He would go on to play seven seasons in Arizona were he surpassed 1000 yards receiving in every year but two. Boldin would make the Pro Bowl three times during his career all with the Cardinals.

In 2003 as a rookie Boldin made an impact from the start with the Cardinals. He caught 101 receptions on the year for 1377 yards and eight scores which was good enough to earn him NFL AP Rookie of the Year honors.

Boldin was productive for the Cardinals well beyond his rookie year going for 1402 yards in 2005 his highest single-season total during his time in Arizona. In 2008 Boldin hauled in 11 touchdown receptions which was the most he had during a season in his career.

After his time in Arizona Boldin spent three seasons with the Baltimore Ravens from 2010-12. After that he returned to the NFC West division playing for the San Francisco 49ers from 2013-15 where he had two seasons of over 1000 yards receiving.

Boldin spent 2016 in Detroit with the Lions where he would then call it a career after that.

In off the field honors Boldin was named the 2015 Walter Payton Man of the Year.

Boldin finished his career with 202 games played 1076 receptions 13779 receiving yards and 82 touchdown receptions.

Previously the rumor mill has held that the only difference with the new RTX 2060 – providing it does exist and comes out on December 7 as predicted – will be that it doubles up the VRAM from 6GB to 12GB.

Now VideoCardz is saying – and claiming confirmation from three separate sources but we should remain skeptical of any rumor of course – that the incoming RTX 2060 will not just run with 12GB but will also up the CUDA core count to 2176. That would put it on a par with the RTX 2060 Super and clearly be a nice boost to its power level (remember that the original RTX 2060 ran with 1920 cores).

It’ll also have a TDP (power usage) of 184W which is actually a touch more than the 175W consumed by the RTX 2060 Super. The boost clock has been pegged at 1650MHz by default at least going by two sources.

The upshot is that the refreshed RTX 2060 should be equivalent to the old 2060 Super but with a touch more power consumption and a stingier memory bandwidth (192-bit rather than the 2060 Super’s 256-bit bus).

Analysis: A delicate GPU balancing act for Nvidia

This is an interesting one considering that rumors about the new RTX 2060 have been flying about for some time now all insisting that it will maintain the same spec as the original 2060 save for doubling the VRAM. And now with the launch supposedly imminent – as mentioned the refreshed card will theoretically arrive the week after next – we discover that it could be more in line with the 2060 Super or at least pretty close.

That seems a little odd considering it would bring performance quite close to the RTX 3060 which as VideoCardz points out is something in the order of only 8% faster than the RTX 2060 Super.

We’d imagine that there would have to be a more substantial difference between a new 2060 and the RTX 3060 particularly when you consider that Nvidia is reportedly planning a desktop RTX 3050 of some kind – and this has to fit into the overall range as well. We can’t rule anything out obviously and this fresh rumor does marry with the assertion from yesterday that the theoretical RTX 3050 would be slower than the revamped 2060 of course.

If these cards are all inbound as rumored it’s going to be something of a delicate balancing act regarding where they slot into Nvidia’s relative GPU power scale. Although at this point however fast these cards are gamers are likely to happily take whatever they’re given in terms of better stock levels of more wallet-friendly contemporary GPUs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDUwLXJ1bW9yZWQtZm9yLXEyLTIwMjItbGF1bmNoLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLWJlLWZhc3Rlci10aGFuLWd0eC0xNjYwLXN1cGVyL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDUwLXJ1bW9yZWQtZm9yLXEyLTIwMjItbGF1bmNoLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLWJlLWZhc3Rlci10aGFuLWd0eC0xNjYwLXN1cGVyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Rumored For Q2 2022 Launch Expected To Be Faster Than GTX 1660 SUPER,"It looks like NVIDIA's most entry-level Ampere graphics card the GeForce RTX 3050 isn't planned for launch until 2022. In new information revealed by Videocardz it is stated that the RTX 3050 is going to launch close to mid-2022 and will tackle AMD's entry-level Navi 24 and Intel's DG2-128 parts.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 To Launch In Q2 2022 & Rumored To Be Faster Than GTX 1660 SUPER But Will It Be Enough To Tackle AMD's Navi 24 & Intel's DG2-128 GPUs?

While the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 (Ti) for laptops rocks the Ampere GA107 GPU core the RTX 3050 for desktops is said to feature the Ampere GA106 GPU core. Previously there have been a series of reports that the RTX 3050 series would include two variants a Ti and a non-Ti part. The non-TI part was expected to feature the GA107 GPU while the Ti SKU was expected to feature a GA106 GPU configuration. However the latest report suggests that even the Non-Ti variant will feature a GA106 GPU which means it should end up with much higher performance than the Ti variant for laptops.

Coming to the specifications there are reports of an NVIDIA GA106-150 GPU for the 'PG190 SKU 70' board being cooked up. The GA106-150 GPU allegedly features 3072 CUDA cores in 24 SM units. It is also reported that the card might end up with 8 GB GDDR6 memory which gives it a big memory advantage over AMD and Intel entry-level parts. The card is expected to offer performance faster than the GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER but will be slower than the RTX 2060 12 GB variant which also launches in the coming weeks.

Based on these performance figures the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 is going to be competitive against AMD's Navi 24 (Radeon RX 6500 / Radeon RX 6400) and Intel's DG2-128 (ARC Alchemist) graphics cards which launch next year too. What will be interesting is to see whether prices can be maintained for these budget tier cards though we shouldn't keep our hopes high as supply issues aren't expected to be resolved till 2023.

One reason why NVIDIA could have delayed the RTX 3050 so much could be that they don't want to mess things up in the entry-level market with jacked up prices and to offer an intermediate solution they have refreshed the RTX 2060 with 12 GB till GPU prices and supply get slightly better than what they are now.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: was $2119 now $1595 with BFDEAL26 and HOLIDAYSURPRISE

Lenovo's Legion 5 Pro is a great gaming laptop with a bright 16-inch QHD display a fantastic keyboard and speedy performance. It's a steal for $525 off.

Seemingly inspired by its business-focused ThinkPad relatives the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro flaunts one of the best keyboards we've ever used. Paired with a comfortable typing experience is a bright and vivid 16-inch display a generous selection of ports and decent battery life (from the AMD version we tested).

From ThinkPads to Yogas Lenovo has earned a reputation for making quality laptops. It's why the company sells more notebooks than any other brand. However gaming is one segment where Lenovo lags behind some of its rivals. The Legion 5 Pro has convinced us that it could change that. Yes the design is bland but Lenovo's other wildly popular products are successful because they address function before form — much like the Legion 5 Pro.

What it lacks in flashy aesthetics it makes up for with a gorgeous 16-inch QHD display an exceptional keyboard and touchpad plenty of ports and outstanding performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MzAwNC9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMjA2MC0xMmdiLXJ1bW9yZWQtc3BlY3MtMjE3Ni1jdWRhLWNvcmVzLTE4NHctdGRwL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12GB rumored specs: 2176 CUDA cores 184W TDP,"NVIDIA's refreshed Turing-based GeForce RTX 2060 12GB will not just be a memory upgrade but it should be RTX 2060 SUPER fast.

We've been hearing more and more about NVIDIA's new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB graphics card a refreshed Turing-based RTX 2060 with 12GB of GDDR6 memory (up from the 6GB GDDR6 on the regular RTX 2060).

But it looks like it'll be more than just double the VRAM of a regular GeForce RTX 2060 as the new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB will reportedly have a higher TDP of 184W (with the RTX 2060 SUPER having a 175W TDP). This means that the RTX 2060 12GB will actually be around the same performance as the RTX 2060 SUPER.

The 12GB of GDDR6 memory on the new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB will be on a 192-bit memory bus while the RTX 2060 SUPER has its 12GB of GDDR6 on a wider 256-bit memory bus. Not only that but the overclocked AIB variants of the new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB could see GPU boost clocks at default 1650MHz and up to 1690MHz and beyond with OC.

NVIDIA is expected to unveil the new GeForce RTX 2060 12GB on December 7 and it will act as a cheaper alternative to the RTX 3060 12GB. The RTX 3060 cards have been sucked up by miners and I'm sure the RTX 2060 12GB won't be any different but priced competitively it could be an interesting refresh thrown into the mix at the end of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0yMDYwLTEyLWdiLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtdG8tZmVhdHVyZS1zdXBlci10dTEwNi1ncHUtMTg0dy10ZHAv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTIwNjAtMTItZ2ItZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZC10by1mZWF0dXJlLXN1cGVyLXR1MTA2LWdwdS0xODR3LXRkcC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB Graphics Card To Feature SUPER TU106 GPU & 184W TDP,"NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB graphics card is allegedly two weeks away from its official launch and its specifications have been detailed by Videocardz. According to the info the new RTX 2060 12 GB graphics card will carry the same core configuration as the RTX 2060 SUPER but with a different memory config.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB Graphics Card Rocks SUPER Turing TU106 GPU With 2176 Cores & 184W TDP

The RTX 2060 was released back in 2019 and the 12 GB variant will be launching two years later. The card did receive a SUPER variant and a few other variants specific to certain markets but it looks like the 12 GB variant is going to be available globally. The reason cited once again is that the RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 look to be pretty underwhelming against the AMD RDNA 2 GPU lineup & even so compared to the RTX 2060. It could be a similar story to where the GTX 1050 was too underpowered and had to wait till the Ti variant to fix the competitive positioning.

Specifications wise the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB will carry the TU106 GPU fabricated on the 12nm process node with 2176 CUDA cores 136 Tensor Cores and 64 RT cores. The same GPU was featured on the RTX 2060 SUPER however the main difference is the memory. The card will retain a 192-bit bus versus the full 256-bit bus featured on the SUPER variant. This will allow the card to hit 12 GB GDDR6 memory capacity running at 14 Gbps pin speeds for a total bandwidth of 336 GB/s. It will also come with a similar TDP of 184W the same as the RTX 2060 SUPER variant.

But in terms of pricing the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB graphics cards are said to end up at around $300 US. This isn't MSRP but the actual retail price. The AMD Radeon RX 6600 Non-XT is currently at an MSRP of $329 US but real prices end up close to $400-$500 US. The RTX 3060 12 GB has an MSRP of $ 329 US but also ends up over $500 US. So for $150-$200 US lower the GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB might make sense especially if it ends up offering performance in between the RX 5600 XT and RX 5700.

A possibility is that the new GeForce RTX 2060 will be positioned against what is likely to be an even more entry-level RDNA 2 lineup from AMD mainly their Navi 24 GPUs but that's all speculation for now.

But more than that you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) has fallen short of that second goal with a share price rise of 27% over five years which is below the market return. Looking at the last year alone the stock is up 13%.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.

See our latest analysis for Realty Income

To quote Buffett 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

Realty Income's earnings per share are down 5.4% per year despite strong share price performance over five years.

The strong decline in earnings per share suggests the market isn't using EPS to judge the company. The falling EPS doesn't correlate with the climbing share price so it's worth taking a look at other metrics.

In fact the dividend has increased over time which is a positive. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield. We'd posit that the revenue growth over the last five years of 10% per year would encourage people to invest.

Take a more thorough look at Realty Income's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Realty Income the TSR over the last 5 years was 62% which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

Realty Income shareholders have received returns of 21% over twelve months (even including dividends) which isn't far from the general market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 10% per year. Even if the share price growth slows down from here there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too.

There's a trade-off on Wall Street with which every dividend investor needs to come to terms: risk versus reward. When you see a giant yield it most likely means there's also giant risk involved in the investment. But that doesn't mean you can't find attractive though not giant yields from real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have increased their dividend for decades. Here are three of the best REITs for low-risk investors and each has a yield that's more than twice that of the S&P 500 Index.

1. The king

The undisputed Dividend King of REITs is Federal Realty (FRT) with a huge 54 consecutive annual dividend hikes under its belt. It is the longest streak of any REIT. The current dividend yield is roughly 3.3%. Compared to the S&P 500 Index's 1.3% yield that's pretty generous noting that despite the headwinds this retail landlord saw in pandemic-hit 2020 it still managed to increase its dividend.

The key is that Federal Realty focuses on quality over quantity when it buys strip malls. Indeed with only around 106 properties it's pretty small but the locations are so strong that even during the pandemic downturn it was fielding calls from retailers looking to upgrade from nearby locations. The REIT also puts a lot of effort into redeveloping its assets to maximize the rent they generate and grow its top and bottom lines.

This brings up the most exciting thing here: Federal Realty bought a handful of new properties during the downturn giving it additional growth levers in the years ahead. That includes adding a new region (Phoenix) to its opportunity set.

Federal Realty will never be a really exciting REIT and the yield will rarely be huge but if a slow and steady dividend payer is your speed you'll want to keep an eye on this one.

2. Bigger and better

Realty Income (O 0.70%) is the next REIT up here. The company owns single-tenant net lease properties which means the tenants are responsible for most of the costs of the properties they occupy. Spread over a large portfolio it's a pretty low-risk way to invest in real estate.

This helps explain why Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for more than 25 consecutive years making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The dividend yield is 3.98%. And the dividend is paid monthly which makes it easier to deal with budgeting for those looking to live off of their dividends.

However the most exciting thing right now is that Realty Income has just stepped up its game using its acquisition of VEREIT to increase its portfolio from around 6600 properties to over 10000. In the net lease sector scale provides a number of benefits.

For example the investment-grade rates REIT has access to cheap capital the heft to take on deals that its peers couldn't manage the ability to spread its costs over more properties and enough diversification in its portfolio that no tenant or sector niche should be too problematic even in a downturn.

On that note the REIT increased its dividend four times in 2020. If you want to own the biggest and the best Realty Income has to be on your list.

3. The all-in-one

W.P. Carey (WPC 0.93%) is the last name on this list with a generous yield of 5.4%. While it isn't a Dividend King or a Dividend Aristocrat it has increased its dividend every year since its initial public offering in 1998. And like Realty Income it hiked the payout every quarter in 2020.

The key here is that W.P. Carey which is also a net lease REIT has long been an opportunistic investor putting money to work where it sees the best opportunities. That investment approach has led to a uniquely diversified portfolio spread across the industrial warehouse office retail and self-storage sectors and across geographies with roughly 37% of rents coming from outside the United States (mostly Europe).

It is probably one of the most diversified REITs you can buy which makes it somewhat of a one-stop shop for investors looking to own a single REIT. It doesn't have the scale that Realty Income offers but that hasn't stopped it from achieving a pretty incredible dividend record. And given its generous yield compared to Realty Income and the broader market it looks relatively attractive today.

The ones to own

Federal Realty and Realty Income both tend to be afforded premium prices by investors most of the time. That includes today which means that value-conscious investors will probably find them less than appealing. However if your goal is reliable income from a relatively low-risk investment both are worth a deep dive.

Meanwhile W.P. Carey has been cheaper in the past but still looks pretty attractive given its above-peer dividend yield and strong dividend history. Most income investors will probably find it appealing right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9jb3JhbC1zcHJpbmdzL3NlY3Rpb25zL2J1c2luZXNzLWFuZC1maW5hbmNlL2FydGljbGVzL25ldy1idXNpbmVzcy1pbi1jb3JhbC1zcHJpbmdzLXJveWFsLWVtcGlyZS1yZWFsdHktZm9jdXNlZC1vbi1pbmNvbWUtcHJvZHVjaW5nLXByb3BlcnRpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Business in Coral Springs: Royal Empire Realty Focused On Income Producing Properties,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/coral-springs/sections/business-and-finance/articles/new-business-in-coral-springs-royal-empire-realty-focused-on-income-producing-properties on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9jb3JhbC1zcHJpbmdzL3NlY3Rpb25zL2J1c2luZXNzLWFuZC1maW5hbmNlL2FydGljbGVzL25ldy1idXNpbmVzcy1pbi1jb3JhbC1zcHJpbmdzLXJveWFsLWVtcGlyZS1yZWFsdHktZm9jdXNlZC1vbi1pbmNvbWUtcHJvZHVjaW5nLXByb3BlcnRpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZXh0ZXItYm9zcy1taWNoYWVsLWMtaGFsbC0wMzAwNDAxMDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dexter Boss and Michael C. Hall Talk Harrison's Emerging Darkness and Dexter's Reaction to That Big Reveal,"In Sunday’s episode of Dexter: New Blood Dexter’s greatest fear may have become reality.

While Harrison was being hailed as the savior of his high school for thwarting a potential shooting Dexter’s suspicions over his son’s story led him down an unsettling rabbit hole. With the help of police photos and crime-scene spatter Dexter deduced that Harrison was actually the instigator of the conflict and later found what he believed to be the real weapon used on the teen’s classmate Ethan: a straight razor — the same blade used by the Trinity Killer when he sliced up Rita and left her for dead. (Click here for a full Episode 4 recap.)

If Harrison does indeed have a dark passenger of his own does that mean Dexter will take on the role of Harry and teach his own son “the code”? It’s possible teases star Michael C. Hall.

“I think that possibility is a part of the fun and the richness of that relationship” Hall tells TVLine. “There are opposing things that are happening simultaneously for Dexter when it comes to Harrison and the dark passenger. On one hand it’s Dexter’s deepest fear that his son has the dark passenger and on the other hand it’s his deepest wish which makes parenting tricky.”

—

Considering that Dexter went into hiding to escape his dark death-filled past the emergence of Harrison “turns Dexter’s life upside down” says showrunner and executive producer Clyde Phillips. “Dexter’s been living this abstinent monastic lonely life by choice and suddenly here’s his son who’s a young man filled with anger and issues of abandonment and pain but yet somehow is able to socialize.”

Any parent might be on the lookout for abnormalities in his or her child but having both suffered bloody traumatic experiences Dexter’s “curious” (to say the least) as to what effect the past has had on the boy.

Dexter New Blood Episode 4 Debra

“There’s a phenomenon called inherited trauma and Dexter has it” says Phillips. “He wonders if Harrison has it too or if he was too young to remember. And we’ll learn the truth of what that is. Obviously it’s the more entertaining truth. If Harrison had nothing and no memory then we have no story” he teases.

When Dexter pieces together that Harrison might share some of his more violent traits the look on his face is… complicated. Is he frightened beyond belief? Relieved maybe?

“As is always the case with Dexter when presented with an either-or scenario — is it this or is it that? — it’s usually both” says Hall. “He’s experiencing a sense of horror and a sense of relief and a sense of a wish being fulfilled and a sense of the forbidden. It’s all of these things.”

Between Dexter’s return to his old ways and Iron Lake’s missing persons case (what is Kurt Caldwell up to at that cabin?) “Jim Lindsay” will certainly have his hands full for the remainder of the series. As for Harrison what he remembers exactly and what similarities he shares with his father will continue to be explored in upcoming episodes.

“We don’t know if it’s a dark passenger but there is a darkness in Harrison that will emerge” hints Phillips. “I’ll just leave it at that.”

This makes Health City the first private facility in the Caribbean to offer the ground-breaking treatment.

Ronapreve has been jointly developed by Switzerland-based pharmaceutical company Roche and American biotech firm Regeneron. It is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab and was designed to block infection of SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19.

Although vaccines provide the best protection from COVID-19 the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended this treatment for infected people who either have underlying health conditions or are suffering from severe symptoms.

It has also been found to reduce the risk of hospitalization in certain patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and reduced the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infections in people exposed to the virus.

“We are pleased to once again be at the forefront of the COVID-19 battle in the Cayman Islands” said Dr. Binoy Chattuparambil Clinical Director at Health City Cayman Islands.

“Just as we assisted with ensuring an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits providing PCR and being the first private facility to offer lateral flow tests to the public it was important for us to step up and provide this treatment which research shows reduces death for patients by around 70 percent compared to those who don’t take it.”

Adults considered at high risk for severe COVID-19 and high-risk youth aged 12-17 who weigh at least 88 pounds may be eligible for treatment. High-Risk factors can include older age obesity pregnancy chronic kidney disease heart disease including high blood pressure lung disease Sickle Cell Disease and cerebral palsy or other development conditions. The treatment is administered via infusion that takes anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete.

Individuals who have had COVID-19 symptoms for 10 days or less should talk to their health care provider immediately to see if monoclonal antibody treatment is right for them.

“It is our hope that no one in our community will need this treatment at Health City we are always prepared and willing to do our part to keep our population safe. This treatment has been approved for use in approximately 50 countries and we wanted to ensure that the Cayman Islands was not left behind” said Shomari Scott Chief Business Officer at Health City Cayman Islands.

The monoclonal antibody therapy treatment has been heavily promoted by the Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis.

Following a series of consultations1 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has implemented two new cross-border exemption frameworks which came into effect on 9 October 2021.

Together the new exemption frameworks exempt foreign related corporations head offices and branches of Singapore financial institutions from Singapore licensing representative registration and business conduct rules (as applicable) when such foreign institutions conduct activities regulated under the Securities and Futures Act Cap 289 (SFA) and the Financial Adviser Act Cap 110 (FAA) for clients in Singapore under an arrangement with their related Singapore financial institutions. To qualify under the new framework certain qualifying conditions and ongoing requirements will need to be met by new or existing arrangements.

Background

With effect from 9 October 2021 the MAS has implemented a new cross-border exemption framework for: (a) foreign related corporations of Singapore financial institutions (“FRC Framework“); and (b) foreign head offices or branches of Singapore financial institutions (“Branch Framework“).

The FRC Framework exempts foreign related corporations (FRCs) of Singapore financial institutions from licensing and representative registration requirements and business conduct rules under the SFA and FAA when the FRCs conduct activities regulated under the SFA and FAA with clients or prospects in Singapore under an arrangement with their Singapore related financial institutions. The FRC Framework replaces the previous exemptions promulgated under paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule to the SFA and paragraph 11 of the First Schedule to the FAA commonly known as the “Paragraph 9 Approval” and “Paragraph 11 Approval” respectively.

The Branch Framework is a new framework that seeks to close the gap under the previous Paragraph 9 Approval and Paragraph 11 Approval regimes which applied only to arrangements between Singapore financial institutions and their FRCs but not to foreign head offices or branches (collectively “Foreign Offices“) of Singapore financial institutions. The Branch Framework provides a level playing field by operating in a similar manner to the FRC Framework and exempts Foreign Offices from representative registration and business conduct rules when the Foreign Offices conduct SFA- and FAA-regulated activities with clients or prospects in Singapore under an arrangement with their related Singapore financial institution(s).

In the context of the frameworks “Singapore financial institutions” refers to entities branches or head offices in Singapore that are: (i) capital markets services licence holders under the SFA; (ii) financial advisers licence holders under the FAA; (iii) exempt capital markets intermediaries under Section 99(1)(a) (b) (c) or (d) of the SFA (e.g. licensed banks and merchant banks that are registered with the MAS to conduct SFA-regulated activities); (iv) exempt financial advisers under Section 23 of the FAA (e.g. licensed banks and merchant banks that are registered with the MAS to conduct FAA activities) other than pursuant to subsection 1(ea) and (f); and (v) exempt persons under paragraphs 3(1)(d) or 3A(1)(d) of the Second Schedule to the Securities and Futures (Licensing And Conduct Of Business) Regulations (i.e. exempt brokers).

FRCs and Foreign Offices may only rely on the FRC Framework or Branch Framework respectively if they meet certain qualifying conditions. The Singapore financial institution will need to file a notice of commencement of activities carried out under the FRC Framework or Branch Framework (as applicable) with details of the relevant FRCs or Foreign Offices contained in the prescribed Form FN and confirm compliance or commitment to comply with the qualifying conditions and ongoing requirements (“Initial Filing“). The Initial Filing must be filed within 14 days of commencement of the cross-border arrangements. Unlike the previous Paragraph 9 Approval and Paragraph 11 Approval regimes prior approval from the MAS is not required under the new FRC Framework and Branch Framework.

The Singapore financial institution is obliged to ensure that the qualifying conditions and other ongoing requirements are met on a continuing basis. We discuss some of the key aspects of each of the qualifying conditions and ongoing requirements further below.

How do we know? Because of hundreds of emails documenting the deal found on Hunter Biden’s laptop left in a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. In her new book “Laptop from Hell” New York Post columnist Miranda Devine tells the tale:

James Gilliar a wiry 56-year-old British ex-SAS officer got to know Ye Jianming the 40-year-old chairman of CEFC when they were both working in the Czech Republic.

CEFC was a Chinese conglomerate one of the largest energy companies in the world.

Ye’s task was to spend $1.5 billion as quickly as possible to ensure the Czech Republic would become China’s “Gateway to the European Union” a priority of President Xi Jinping.

To that end Ye bought everything from a football team and a brewery to an airline before being named “special economic adviser” to Czech President Milos Zeman.

Now he was looking for an influential partner to help with acquisitions in other locations around the world that had strategic significance for the Chinese state.

Gilliar had an idea who could help: the Biden family.

Gilliar connected with Hunter Biden through trusted Biden family friend Rob Walker a former Clinton administration official whose wife Betsy Massey Walker had been Jill Biden’s assistant when she was second lady.

8 Miranda Devine’s book “Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden Big Tech and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide.”

Gilliar emailed Walker in February 2015 to praise Hunter’s appearance in Beijing at a board meeting of the fledgling investment fund Hunter had founded BHR.

“Hunter was great” Gilliar wrote to Walker. “True sheikh of Washington.”

He emailed Hunter a few weeks later: “It has been made clear to me that CEFC wish to engage in further business relations with our group.”

Gilliar knew CEFC was the capitalist arm of President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative to spread China’s influence — and debt traps — across the world. No Chinese company executed its goals more ardently than CEFC and its young chairman who was dubbed the “Belt and Road billionaire” in the press.

Chairman Ye had built his provincial energy company into a Fortune 500 colossus virtually overnight an achievement described by Chinese news agency Caixin as “another great enigma in the miraculous world of Chinese business.” He enjoyed the support of President Xi and was former deputy secretary general of the government’s propaganda arm the China Association for International Friendly Contacts.

In a rare interview with Caixin at CEFC’s palatial marble headquarters in Shanghai’s upscale French Concession District Ye was portrayed as a “hermit king” sitting on a golden chair in “a room that resembles a miniature Great Hall of the People.”

Uniformed staff members wearing earpieces glided by. “Most of them were young women wearing smart clothes and bright faces.”

Ye’s face was “as expressionless as a stone statue. Amidst the gilded surroundings his canvas shoes had an eye-catching plainness. …

“In his public activities as a private entrepreneur Ye Jianming is always walking alongside important foreign political figures. He has been photographed with world leaders such as Israeli President Peres Turkish President Erdogan Chadian President Déby and European Commission President Juncker. He has met with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Prime Minister of Bulgaria held a feast to welcome him.”

In the winter of 2015 Chairman Ye and CEFC Executive Director Jianjun Zang a.k.a. “Director Zang” flew to Washington DC. A meeting with Ye was scheduled in Hunter’s diary for December 7 2015 in a week that was a swirl of back-to-back Christmas parties hosted by Joe and Jill at the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory.

One of his former associates who spoke on condition of anonymity believes that Hunter brought Chairman Ye to meet Joe at one of those parties. There is no indication of any such meeting on the laptop but Hunter had a pattern of introducing business associates to Joe when they came to DC.

After a frustrating experience in another Chinese deal as a minority partner in private equity firm BHR in which the payday would not come until the end of the fund’s life Hunter and his uncle Jim Biden wanted more control of the CEFC partnership and a regular income stream.

Enter Tony Bobulinski. The naval officer-turned-wealthy institutional investor came highly recommended by Gilliar to build what they planned would be a world-class investment firm called SinoHawk named after Hunter’s late brother Beau’s favorite animal the hawk.

In December 2015 Gilliar told Bobulinski he needed help structuring a Chinese joint venture for “one of the most prominent families in the United States.”

The plan was to “build an investment firm like Goldman Sachs” he wrote in a WhatsApp message transcripts of which were obtained separately from the laptop.

“The family is the Biden family” Gilliar would soon disclose. Joe who had announced that he would not run for president in 2016 would be actively involved once he left office and the Bidens expected billions of dollars of projects to flow through the company Gilliar said.

He let Bobulinski in on the last piece of the puzzle in March 2016: The Bidens’ Chinese partner is CEFC which has “more money than God” he wrote. “This is the capital arm of one belt one road.”

At about this time Bobulinski was introduced to Rob Walker who told him he was “a proxy for Hunter Biden Jim Biden and the Bidens around the world.”

Finally in February 2017 Gilliar sent Bobulinski a WhatsApp message saying he wanted to introduce him to his “partner.”

“Who is your partner?” asked Bobulinski.

“Hunter Biden” replied Gilliar.

Bobulinski was leery. “I understand you want me to … help drive things in the US but Hunter is [already] here.”

Gilliar: “Money there intent there … skill sets missing … We need to create the best deal platform in history and they haven’t got a clue.” Bobulinski didn’t like the fact Hunter “was kicked out of US Navy for cocaine use.”

“But he’s super smart” said Gilliar. “Just a lot of under achievers around them using their name. Has a few demons but u are used to those right?”

Bobulinski asked: “Is he the decision maker or the Chinese?”

Gilliar: “New platform. Best discuss face to face but I’m the driver.”

Later Bobulinski asked: “Ok who is putting up the $10MM [million]?”

Gilliar: “Joint vehicle — half us and then equally split — money is already in. Discuss more face to face.”

8 Ye Jianming chairman of Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC gave Hunter Biden a 3.16-carat diamond estimated to be worth $80000.

Three weeks after his father left office in 2017 Hunter flew to Miami with Gilliar and Walker to meet Chairman Ye who was there for the Miami International Boat Show.

They booked into the $700-a-night beachfront Nobu Hotel on Monday Feb. 13 2017 and scheduled lunch with the Chinese for Thursday in a private room set for 10 at the Bourbon Steak restaurant in the ritzy JW Marriott Turnberry Resort & Spa where Ye was staying with his entourage.

But Hunter flew home the day before the lunch. He already had met with Ye over a private dinner on Tuesday night at which the CEFC chairman made him an offer too good to refuse: $10 million a year for a minimum of three years for “introductions alone” as Hunter would later assert in an imperious email to CEFC executives.

Ye sealed the new alliance with a rich gift — a 3.16-carat diamond worth $80000. Photographs of the stunning stone appear on Hunter’s laptop along with a grading report that lists it as a “round brilliant” of Grade F with prime “VS2” clarity and “excellent” cut.

8 Photos of the 3.16-carat diamond were found on Hunter Biden’s laptop.

The gift could not have come at a better time. Hunter was in the middle of an ugly divorce from Kathleen and his office manager Joan Peugh had just sent him the latest in a series of overdue bills a tax collection notice from the District of Columbia for $47226.78.

Hunter would tell the New Yorker’s Adam Entous that he had flown to Miami to meet Chairman Ye purely for charitable purposes hoping to secure a donation to World Food Program USA the nonprofit on whose board he served and which he had used before as a cover for his foreign business activities.

Hunter said it was just chance that the altruistic encounter “turned to business opportunities” and claimed to be surprised when Ye gave him the diamond. He didn’t mention the happy coincidence that his business partners Gilliar and Walker were with him in Miami to clinch a business deal with CEFC.

But the diamond was just an appetizer.

Nine days after Hunter’s meeting in Miami with Ye $3 million was wired into an account for Rob Walker’s company Robinson Walker LLC from State Energy HK Limited a Shanghai-based company linked to CEFC according to an inquiry by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).

On March 1 another $3 million was wired to Robinson Walker by the same company. Both transactions were flagged by the Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement network in a “suspicious activity report” filed with the Senate committees as “Confidential Document 16.”

Using the document as a source the Grassley-Johnson report of Nov. 18 2020 says: “At the time of the transfers State Energy HK Limited was affiliated with CEFC China Energy which was under the leadership of Ye Jianming. In the past State Energy HK Limited transferred funds to at least one company associated with Hunter Biden’s business associate Gongwen Dong …

“These transactions are a direct link between Walker and the communist Chinese government and because of his close association with Hunter Biden yet another tie between Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements and the communist Chinese government.”

The Senate report concluded it was “unclear what the true purpose is behind these transactions [$6 million from CEFC] and who the ultimate beneficiary is.”

We know from the laptop that Hunter received regular payments from Robinson Walker. One document lists $56603.74 from Robinson Walker as income for Rosemont Seneca Advisors between June and December 2017.

Rob Walker paid at least $511000 to Hunter’s firm Owasco in 2017 according to an email from Hunter’s tax accountant Bill Morgan.

Walker told Bobulinski his role in CEFC was “being a surrogate for H [Hunter] or Jim when gauging opportunities i.e. digging around in Texas on high speed rail with some of my republican friends … or hitting new countries and contacts abroad where things are lukewarm but not hot enough for H to close or too odd for H to be present …”

8 An Aug. 3 2018 photo of Hunter Biden in bed at Palms Casino Resort Vegas was found on his laptop.

On March 5 2017 Page Six broke the news that Hunter and his brother’s widow Hallie were an item.

When Hunter didn’t show up for a scheduled meeting three days later in New York Gilliar told Bobulinski it didn’t matter: “In brand he’s imperative but right now he’s not essential for adding input to business.”

It was at this point that Gilliar explained to Bobulinski that the Chinese involved in CEFC were “intelligence so they understand the value added” of the Biden name.

Bobulinski remained troubled by Hunter’s scandals and Gilliar who was in Australia with Director Zang looking for acquisitions was worried he might pull out. So he arranged for him to meet Hunter the following month at the Chateau Marmont in Bobulinski’s hometown of LA.

They met by the hotel pool in April and spoke for two hours while Hunter chain-smoked. Bobulinski found him respectful and polite. Hunter boasted that he had his father’s ear and could bypass his advisers.

Hunter told Bobulinski how the joint venture vehicle should be structured and expressed caution about US laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) which prohibits businesses paying bribes to foreign officials. He appeared to conflate that law with the Foreign Agents Registration Act a 1938 anti-spying law that requires anyone acting as a lobbyist for a foreign power to register with the US government as a foreign agent.

“No matter what it will need to be a US company at some level in order for us to make bids on federal and state funded projects” Hunter wrote later.

“Also we don’t want to have to register as foreign agents under the FCPA which is much more expansive than people who should know choose not to know.

“Regardless we should have a … company called CEFC America and ownership should be 50 me 50 them. We then cut up our 50 [percent] in a separate entity between the 4 of us.”

Hunter seemed focused but Bobulinski was puzzled about Uncle Jim’s frequent meddling in CEFC business.

For instance in April 2017 Jim pulled strings at New York’s elite Horace Mann School to get Director Zang’s daughter Rouqi fast-tracked for entry although she ended up enrolling in another school.

Jim also wrote a letter on behalf of CEFC to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo requesting a meeting. “We intend to discuss potential projects and investments in New York.” He listed the other attendees as Hunter Chairman Ye Director Zang and an unnamed “Member of the Royal Family of Luxembourg.”

“What is the deal w Jim Biden as he wasn’t part of the discussion but now seems a focal point?” Bobulinski asked Gilliar. “What role does Jim see himself playing?”

“Consultant is what he’s offered as [far as] I know” Gilliar replied. “He [Hunter] brought in Jim simply to leverage getting more equity for himself and family in the final hour that is evident.”

In another WhatsApp message Gilliar told Bobulinski: “With H [Hunter’s] demons could be good to have a backup he [Jim] strengthens our USP [unique selling point] to Chinese as it looks like a truly family business and I like the dude.”

With the deal progressing Hunter told Bobulinski it’s time for the next step.

“I want Dad to meet you” he said.

The National waste prevention and management plan (2021-2027) includes food waste prevention measures:

- funding measures to support - food sharing or food donation initiatives short food supply chains development and implementation of innovative and environmentally friendly technologies;

- awareness raising campaigns;

- regulatory framework for obligatorily donation of food in accordance with good foreign practice.

The National energy and climate action plan of the Republic of Lithuania (2021–2030) includes policies and measures that focus on educating and informing the public about the problem of food waste and how to prevent it improving waste sorting skills creating information websites applications and interactive maps; in an effort to reduce the amounts of landfill waste and associated greenhouse gas emissions.

Since 2015 The Chancellery of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania organizes inter-institutional coordination meetings on food loss and food waste reduction in Lithuania. In 2017 it was decided to continue the activities of the Coordinating Working Group for the Determination of Food Waste Prevention and Management Measures (analogue of the Platform on Food Loss and Food Waste) which was approved by the Minister of Environment of the Republic of Lithuania in 2017.

The working group facilitates communications and cooperation between relevant authorities but also with stakeholders. The main food loss and waste prevention measures implemented by the members of the working group include updating the legal framework social responsibility actions as well as awareness raising initiatives.

Food Law states that food that does not comply with the requirements of food and other legal acts but is safe and fit for human consumption may be donated in accordance with the procedure established by the Director of the State Food and Veterinary Service .

In national legislation is allowed that surplus food from food industry can be donated to charity and by-products from the food and beverage industry can be used to feed animals. By order of the Director of the State Food and Veterinary Service 2 procedures were issued setting out the requirements for donating food to charity and for using non-animal foodstuffs for animal feed: Description of food management for charity and support and Description of procedures for the use of non - animal origin food for animals feed.

In 2021 an amendment to the Description of food management for charity and support was adopted which provides for the possibility of freezing and submitting to charities for processing various expired fresh meat packed in charity canteens marked with the indication ""Expiry date ...""

The Ministry of Agriculture have been prepared draft rules for the providing support for food donated to charity. The rules is currently in a draft state and soon will be adopted it will give the support to reduce food waste in the primary production.

Amended regulation related to imported exported and placed on the marked fresh fruit and vegetables:

The waste management hierarchy is applied to all waste streams including food waste. Waste management law states that as of 2024 the separate collection of household food waste will be mandatory. Separate collection of food waste from households is succsessfully implemented in Alytus region since the end of 2018. Other municipalities are carrying out pilot projects and are preparing for separate collection of household food waste.



In 2019 The Ministry of Health prepared the Guidelines for the implementation of the buffet principle and measures for the reduction of food waste. ‘Swedish buffet’ principles are implemented in kindergartens and schools canteens in order to minimize food waste and encourage healthy meal choices.

At the request of the Ministry of Agriculture the Lithuanian Institute of Agricultural Economics is preparing two researches: “Principal application of the circular economy (waste) in agriculture and food industry: waste recovery analysis recommendations” and ""Determining the level and causes of food loss and food waste throughout the food supply chain and developing recommendations"". Based on these the Ministry will take steps for prevention of food waste at primary production and food industry or the valorization of food waste into high value-added products.

Ministry of Agriculture prepared a leaflet for primary producers on how to donate products to charities.

The national food bank Maisto bankas created an informative booklet for food business operators who wish to donate food. According to Lithuanian legislation companies that donate surplus food for charity organisations benefit from income tax reliefs.

Several awareness-raising actions on food waste have been implemented in Lithuania. The Lithuanian Consumer Institute developed the campaign ‘Sincerely food’ as well as audio-visual tools (videos interactive quizzes infotainment games etc.) printed materials trainings (professional and community-based trainings) and workshops on food waste prevention. Special attention is given to the topic of date marking; the State Food and Veterinary Service published information about difference between ‘use by’ and ‘best before’ dates for consumers.

The project ‘Sustainable Home’ (Darnūs namai) encourages consumers to apply the main principles of a circular economy raising awareness about the importance of responsible consumption reducing waste (including food waste) and fighting climate change.

The education material for children on food waste ‘Do good: Save food!’ developed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation have been adopted and translated into Lithuanian and distributed to Lithuanian schools and kindergartens.",,,,,,,,,

The Vikings traveled East toward Stockton’s St. Mary’s High on Saturday afternoon to face Merced in the Division IV title game. Vanden also veered the championship contest in the direction of wide receiver/defensive back Jamai East.

East caught three touchdowns from quarterback Tre Dimes and had two back-breaking interceptions — including a 24-yard pick-six early in the fourth quarter. The rest of his teammates did the rest is a convincing 49-21 win.

When East emerged from the Vanden locker room he was greeted with chants of “MVP! MVP!” by the Vanden crowd.

“We just had to step it up” East said about what was talked about at halftime. “We had to play to our level.”

The game was 21-21 at halftime but the No. 2-seeded Vikings (11-2) dominated the No. 4 Bears (9-4) in the second half both offensively and defensively.

“(Merced) was making great plays in the first half so we told our guys to keep pressuring them keep playing hard” Vanden head coach Sean Murphy said. “We didn’t make a ton of major adjustments. We made a couple of tiny adjustments but we felt like if we kept playing hard things would go our way and they did.”

The win was especially satisfying for Murphy who was a junior offensive lineman on the 1995 team that beat Bear River in the 1995 championship.

“It was a lot more nerve-wracking than it was as a player” Murphy said. “It’s been a great journey for us since last spring facing all kinds of adversity. We’re very proud of our student-athletes.”

Long before East’s pick-six in the second half Vanden’s Robert Breed intercepted quarterback Seth Scheidt’s very first pass of the game and returned it 33 yards to the end zone for the early 7-0 lead.

After forcing a turnover on downs Vanden drove 94 yards on just seven yards culminating with a Sean Davis 8-yard touchdown and a 14-0 lead with 6:07 left in the first quarter. Dimes hooked up with wide receiver Brayden Chavez on hook-ups of 18 and 35 on the drive.

Chavez a sophomore receiver had five catches for 102 yards. Merced had some success stifling Vanden’s top receiver Michael Belk but the Bears could not take away all of the Vikings’ pass-catchers.

“I think (Merced) tried to put more people on Belk and that left receivers like Jamai and myself open and that helped a lot big time” Chavez said.

The Bears cut the lead in half on their ensuing drive as Enoch Evans ran it in from 34 yards out. A bad snap on a punt on Vanden’s next drive set up Merced for another touchdown — this one a Scheidt’-to-Jack Collins 31-yard touchdown strike that came on fourth-and-20 early in the second quarter.

The Vikings grabbed a 21-14 lead with 5:47 left in the half when Dimes found East for a 55-yard touchdown catch. East made a spectacular over-the-shoulder catch in front of his defender on the play.

Merced beat Vanden again on fourth down with 2:05 left in the half when Scheidt connected with Collins again for a 43-yard touchdown reception. The extra point tied it 21-21 and that’s the way it would head going into the locker room.

On Vanden’s second possession of the second half the Vikings went ahead for good on a Dimes-to-East 8-yard touchdown completing a 67-yard seven-play drive.

Meanwhile the Vikings’ defense locked down on Scheidt and the Bears’ passing game. Vanden forced a punt and then scored again with 11:55 left in the fourth quarter on a Dimes-to-East 13-yard touchdown catch. Merced’s Chase Smith interfered with East on the play but the wide receiver shook him off and made the catch in the end zone anyway.

It got worse for the Bears on the first play of their next possession when East jumped in front of a receiver and raced 24 yards to the end zone for the 42-21 lead. The Vikings tacked on their final touchdown with 9:07 left in the game on a Dimes-to-Davis 51-yard touchdown pass.

Dimes was 13-for-21 for 312 yards with four touchdowns and one interception.

Scheidt finished with 197 yards passing with two touchdowns and three interceptions. Vanden caught him behind the line of scrimmage seven times and put more pressure on him in the second half as the signal caller missed on eight of nine passes at one point.

The championship win was also special since the team dedicated the season to fallen teammate Daniel Hughes who was shot on April 4 and eventually succumbed to his injuries. The players talked about him when posing for the championship photo.

“We were playing for our brother Daniel” Chavez said. “That kept us going the whole time.”

Vanden is now eligible for a Northern California bowl game to be played Dec. 3 or 4. Brackets are expected to be released on Sunday.

To his fans he can do no wrong. Clearly he's got a great record store and he usually provides in his videos useful information. To his fans for daring to criticize him I am a ""con man"" (in the words of one of them) and I owe him ""an apology"". For what I'm not sure but for them he owes none to The Electric Recording Company though his seriously flawed video trashing of the company I think requires an apology.

Forget about the lacquer ""controversy"" which I believe the video I posted demonstrates that lacquers while more fragile than records can last decades and still sound incredible (and forget that his response video claims mine proves he's correct). If that ""Tommy"" transcription doesn't prove my point and refute his claims of near instant degradation I'm not sure what will but forget that. His video will not deter people interested in owning a Getz/Gilberto lacquer or a A Love Supreme lacquer cut from the copy of the flawed original master tape. Supersense will find satisfied buyers. I think there's a limited but dedicated audience for those like there is for those who want to buy costly reel to reel tapes that are unmastered and at best are 3rd generation copies instead of mastered records sourced from master tapes. Those tapes can sound great.

However Mr. Esposito ought to apologize for his trashing of The Electric Recording Company whether or not you agree with ERC's limited edition business model or its pricing. I have no problem with legitimate criticism of anyone or any company or any company's product. I'm not afraid to do it. I think it's part of the job which of course is why I criticized his ERC video and why I gave the recent All Things Must Pass box set a negative review.

""The In Groove"" video was made using a copy of Sonny Rollins' Way Out West meaning by that time ERC was well established and successful. Everything they release immediately sells out so what was the point of that video especially since the scenario is not legitimate? Mr. Esposito trashes ERC using a customer's repacked record taken in trade though I believe the customer claimed otherwise. How do I know it's a ""repack""? He removes it from a paper sleeve and complains about micro-abrasions he found on the record. ERC uses rice paper inners on all of its records. So clearly the customer who sent it in trade had opened it and neglected to replace the rice paper inner. The repack was poorly done so the record had a spine split. Esposito with a great deal of derision shook the record in the packing removed it and held up to the camera the spine split. Why would he believe ERC would pack its records shoddily in paper sleeves?

Anyone reading this could probably hold up a costly defective record with a split spine from Analogue Productions Mobile Fidelity or any other high quality label. I know I could. It happens.

ERC sent a replacement copy and that one had a bubble defect. I could hold up records pressed at QRP RTI Pallas Optimal MPO you name the pressing plant that has a defect or two or is pressed off-center or has a micro scratch. It's in the nature of record pressing and those of us who love records are usually forgiving of a minor blemish or two.

But a quite incensed Mike holds up the spine split shows the tiny bubble and then launches into a further attack by pointing to other versions costing less that you can buy including the box from Craft reviewed on this site which he recommends as a less costly alternative. He claims incorrectly that the Way Out West in that box was cut from tape. It wasn't. It was cut from a hi-res digital file. What's more based on how intensely bright is the top end on that set the producers of that box were most likely not aware of the ""Roy DuNann curve"" inscribed on the tape that requires attenuation during cutting or during the digital transfer to flatten the response. Nor obviously was Mike aware of it. He then holds up used copies—all of which he sells— that cost less including the double 45 from Analogue Productions. Fair enough! But used records are a different thing as are used records packed in newer style less attractive jackets like the ones AP formerly used as are records cut from more modern solid state-based cutting systems. Some people prefer Kevin Gray's cut over ERC's as some will prefer Bernie Grundman's upcoming one for Analogue Productions now that Concord and Kassem have..oh! perhaps I let the cat out of the bag...

Just to reiterate: ERC spent well into six figures restoring a Lyric/Ortofon mastering system uses original master tapes and packages in ""hot lead"" set typeset ""old school"" jackets (some of which do ""bow"") that adhere as closely as possible to the original's paper stock and color art. And it presses a very limited number and charges a lot of money for them. That's their business model and for many of the classical titles their $400 or so cost is still considerably less than the cost of original pressings. This is a company that should be applauded by record lovers for it's efforts not derided for them.

Mr. Esposito in a response to one of my comments about his ERC video claims that my free copies is the reason I defend ERC. Yes I get them as do other reviewers though I never asked for freebies (though he did ask ERC if he could sell them). I asked if it would be possible to get review copies at somewhat of discount. Pete Hutchison generously sends reviewer copies to me and other reviewers even knowing by the time we get them the record will be sold out so there's no point in reviewing them. Anyone who thinks my integrity and honestly can be bought for the price of a record even a costly one or many hasn't read some of the negative record reviews I've posted. My credibility is my ""working capital"" just as Esposito's record stock and store is his.

Mr. Esposito could have given Mo-Fi or AP the same treatment holding up a defective Mo-Fi pressing with a split spine but he didn't. So could have I. But like him I choose not to. What's the point? Everyone presses bad records and spines sometimes split in shipping. All of these responsible audiophile labels replace defectives.

So why single out The Electric Recording Company? Mr. Esposito should explain. And he should apologize to ERC's Pete Hutchison. And then like the rainbow that recently appeared across from my home we should all kiss and make up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyZXN0bGluZ2luYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExL3d3ZS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtZWRnZXMtcmV0dXJuLWFuZC10d28tYmlnLW1hdGNoZXMtZm9yLXJhdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Announces Edge's Return And Two Big Matches For RAW,"WWE Announces Edge’s Return And Two Big Matches For RAW

Small Business Saturday in Nampa features the Nampa Farmers Market Winter Wonderland all the brick and mortar stores and Santa even made an appearance.

""We want more of the hands-on where you can go and touch a book look at something not online"" said shopper Steven Hines. ""Local businesses that's how you do it.""

It was hard to find a parking spot in downtown Nampa and that is one of the reasons the owners of The King's Beagle rushed to open their unique dog boutique on Small Business Saturday.

""The idea behind the store is is to have gifts for the discriminating pet owner and the discriminating pet"" said owner Cindi Ross.

Ross told us that meant having hard-to-find items for dogs including specialty made treats while also focusing on purchasing merchandise that has social good from recycled materials to goods that give back to rescues or shelters.

We ran into Hines and his family after they emerged from Holy Cow a restaurant that features craft beer and burgers he recommended trying the Sam Elliott.

""Number one was Holy Cow they are a small business we support down here"" said Hines. ""They started making this little area popular again because for a lot of years it was dead.""

Small businesses have been hit hard from the effects of the pandemic and this is such an important time for these businesses to earn revenue.

The City of Nampa offered free parking in the garage but they also built events around the day including story time with Mrs. Claus at the Library free carriage rides and the lighting of their giant Christmas tree.

Ideally I prefer to have my last day onboard be a sea day but I will never complain about spending time at CocoCay because of how much fun it is spending time there.

While this may have been my fourth time visiting CocoCay in two weeks the weather last week was far from perfect so today looked to be a way to end on a high note.

We did not arrive to CocoCay until almost 10am which meant there would be a rush among guests to get off the ship at the same time. Moreover we were sharing the island with Independence of the Seas.

What does two ships mean? There are 4100 passengers on Harmony and 3000 passengers on Independence so while far from a full capacity day (CocoCay can handle 9-12000 guests) it certainly would be busier than earlier this summer.

We started off with breakfast at Park Cafe partially because I neglected to put a breakfast order in with my Genie the night before. I certainly don't mind a bagel and schmear to start my day.

By the time we finished eating the gangway was open and we were on our way downstairs.

Walking down the pier it certainly looked like a great day. Not oppressively hot and low humidity meant a comfortable outdoor experience.

We had nothing reserved so grabbed a chair near Oasis Lagoon and then hopped into the pool. The pool was indeed very cold. We all braved the temperature and shivered a bit before getting used to it.

Later in the afternoon the sun came out more and that helped make being in the water a bit warmer.

The kids went to Splashaway Bay for some kiddy slide time. While not the CocoCay water park by any means it got some energy out for the kids.

For lunch I had to go to Snack Shack for my favorite complimentary food: mozzarella sticks and the ""secret sandwich"".

To my surprise the line for Snack Shack was really long and moved slowly. I'm not sure if they were just overwhelmed with a lunch rush or something else but it was the longest line I've ever experienced there. Regardless they got the line moving and I had my food soon enough.

The afternoon was spent at the pool and it was an opportunity to hang out with friends from the group cruise one more time.

All aboard was 4:30 so we headed back to the ship in mid-afternoon.

Since it was a 7-night cruise unvaccinated kids needs to get a covid test done prior to disembarkation. Our genie escorted us in and got the tests complete quickly.

Back in the room we showered changed and snuck in a quick nap.

Chips and dips from Sabor were waiting for us in the room which was a nice pre-dinner snack.

We were not sure which restaurant to go to for dinner but decided on going back to 150 Central Park.

I was glad we went back because their entrees are really good. I really liked combining the halibut with cauliflower to combine flavor and texture.

After dinner we said our goodbyes to friends in the pub before calling it a night.

Overall it was a fantastic group cruise and it felt so good to see friends and make new ones along the way. After two other cancelled group cruises this was an especially important sailing that I am glad happened without any incident.

If you'd like to join us for a group cruise in 2022 we have two more scheduled.

Thanks for reading this live blog. Our next live blog begins in a month when we fly to California to sail on Navigator of the Seas!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2xpZmVndWFyZHMtb24tcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLXNhdmUtYS1ndWVzdC82MDQ2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lifeguards on Royal Caribbean Cruise Ship Save a Guest,"Anyone who has been onboard a large cruise ship knows just how busy the pool deck can be on a hot and sunny day in the Caribbean. For that reason Royal Caribbean and other cruise lines have a highly skilled and trained team of lifeguards on duty every day.

Just how important that team of lifeguards is was proven during a Liberty of the Seas seven-night sailing on October 23 when lifeguards saved the life of a guest who had lost consciousness in the pool.

Lifesavers Onboard Liberty of the Seas

While cruising the Western Caribbean on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship October 23 2021 all seemed to be going well. While guests were enjoying the ship and the pool deck one of the ships’ lifeguards on duty noticed something go very wrong. Iketut Giartana the lifeguard on duty observed that a guest lost consciousness in the pool.

Several lifeguards a bar staff nearby a concerned guest and a lifeguard manager helped pull the guest out of the pool and begin life-saving measures using CPR (chest compressions) and a heart defibrillator.

The doctors were able restart the heart and help the patient regain consciousness in a race against time. In a post shared on the Starguard Elite Facebook page the cruise line thanked and praised the team who saved the guest:

“We are so proud of what our team of lifeguards did and continue to do for our guests. Our promise to our guests is that we will do everything we can to keep them safe and protect their well-being. Our lifeguards – and the medics they work with – honor this promise every minute onboard. Guests who witnessed this incredible rescue thanked the team with a huge round of applause.”

“Dear team of lifeguards: know that every crew across our fleet the brands and shore side also applaud you for your professionalism and skill. THANK YOU!”

Safety Comes First for Royal Caribbean

All lifeguards onboard Royal Caribbean ships go through extensive training programs to ensure the safety of all guests. With hundreds or even thousands of kids running around the various pools across the fleet along with the odd intoxicated guests and possible medical emergencies such as the one that happened onboard Liberty of the Seas it’s good to see the cruise line taking a safety-first approach.

The lifeguards are trained by Starguard Elite an aquatic risk prevention agency that is internationally recognized for its elite training certification and consulting programs serving lifeguards management attraction attendants and more.

The incident onboard Liberty of the Seas also speaks volumes about the training of the other crew members on board. Before working onboard most crew members need to go through a training regime called STCW which stands for Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping.

This worldwide convention ensures a lateral standard of training is achieved across all countries in the world and includes basic medical first aid training CPR firefighting and what to do during emergencies onboard.

Cruise lines have come a long way from the old days when safety was secondary to financial gains. Nowadays passengers can be assured that each cruise line worldwide places training safety and security at the top of the priority list as shown by the fantastic crew of Liberty of the Seas.

Robo Bar in Amsterdam Leidseplein by Makr Shakr

Tech startup Makr Shakr debuts its robotic bartender in the Netherlands. The new venue offers a safe contact-free experience giving people a glimpse into the future of the hospitality industry.

Ed. – but what about important human contact? With loneliness on the rise our bars cafés and pubs are more improtant than ever!

Amsterdam 24 November 2021 – Makr Shakr the world’s leading manufacturer of robotic bartenders unveils the first robotic bar ever in the Netherlands. The new venue located in the city center of Amsterdam features the most advanced model of drink-mixing robot Toni. Its mechanical arms can precisely prepare and serve any drink in seconds.

Crafting cocktails in a quick contact-free fashion the robotic bar fully complies with all the rules of sanitization and social distancing. At a time in which restaurants and clubs still struggle to offer a safe solution for mixing drinks robotic bartending acts as a game changer allowing visitors to get a glimpse into the future of the hospitality industry.

The new venue called Robo Bar is open to the public in the popular neighborhood of Leidseplein in Amsterdam just around the corner from the famous Rijksmuseum. Toni shows how technology can empower people and create a new drinking experience. Users can either select premade recipes developed by international bartenders or create and name brand-new customized cocktails of their own. Shaking stirring and muddling a string of cocktails and mocktails from more than 150 different bottles hanging from the ceiling of the bar structure Makr Shakr promises to shake up Amsterdam’s nights.

Makr Shakr was founded in Turin Italy in 2014. After debuting at the Google I/O conference in San Francisco as a concept the firm today presents a product portfolio that includes Toni – the fixed unit available in multiple configurations – and Bruno the mobile unit rentable on request for events.

Makr Shakr’s innovations boast numerous international design awards including D&AD and Core 77. To date the company has a worldwide presence in numerous cities including Las Vegas Milan and Prague. Its robotic bars are also installed on board nine Royal Caribbean cruise ships.

Makr Shakr

Launched in 2014 Makr Shakr is the world’s leading producer of robotic bartending systems. Based in Turin Italy but operating worldwide the company aims to empower people with new robotic interactions. The Makr Shakr bar system combines future robotics with Italian design roots – having been developed in the Italian birthplace of Vermouth. Makr Shakr makes customers the mixologists allowing them to create their own cocktails while the robots perform each step of the mixing process according to their instructions.

After the production of the Bionic Bar which has been serving cocktails in the most prestigious Royal Caribbean cruise ships and in malls and hotels internationally the company launched Toni the first robotic bartender catered for the mass market. With this new product the company aims to further encourage people to think about the changes introduced by today’s “robotization” trend and the social implications of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Prince Charles will fly into a new race storm on Monday as protestors plan to hijack his visit to Barbados to demand compensation for slavery.

The future king will be confronted by up to 100 angry activists demanding an apology and reparations from the royals and the UK Government which could run into hundreds of millions of pounds.

At least one senior official backs the demonstration due to take place during a ceremony to mark the island becoming a republic removing the Queen as its head of state. And the protest will alarm Charles who has said slavery is an “indelible stain” on the world.

Tonight demo organiser David Denny told the Sunday Mirror: “Prince Charles’ visit is an insult.

“The Royal Family benefited from slavery in Barbados. I’m angry.”

Mr Denny general secretary of campaign group Caribbean Movement for Peace and Integration added: “It’s not just about money it’s about an apology and help.

“Reparations are needed to transform our society.”

The prominent Black Lives Matter activist went on: “Barbados should not honour a family who murdered and tortured our people during slavery. The profits created the financial conditions for the Royal Family to increase their power.

“Prince Charles is not deserving of any award from the people of Barbados. He should apologise.

“Our position is very clear: Barbados’ people and our ancestors have suffered under the hands of British exploitation which was organised at a very high level.”

Elizabeth I Queen of England from 1558 to 1603 was integral to establishing the British slave trade. And Barbados became the first British slave society. Britain’s ruling elite claimed control of the island in 1625. They made vast fortunes from cotton indigo tobacco and sugarcane plantations while the slaves forced to work on them were classified as “sub-human”.

Lalu Hanuman of the 13th June 1980 Movement said: “A lot of people don’t realise the linkages between the Royal Family and slavery. Their hands are mired in it. And a substantial amount of their wealth came from it.”

“Kensington Palace was directly built off of the slave trade by King William III. Before that Elizabeth I granted a royal charter to Sir John Hawkins and provided him with ships for the slave trade. She also gave him his own coat of arms which depicted a chained African person.”

The slave trade resulted in 12million African people being snatched from their countries. Five million were taken to the Caribbean including 600000 to Barbados. And their deaths ran into the millions.

After the vile trade was abolished in 1833 ex-slave owners including relatives of the royals were compensated. But the slaves got nothing.

Some UK firms have begun to examine the idea of reparations. Insurers Lloyd’s of London and brewer Greene King last year apologised for benefiting from slavery and offered financial support to charities promoting diversity and inclusion.

Mr Denny’s campaigning has led to Barbados becoming a republic without even holding a referendum.

He now hopes Charles will take notice of Monday's protest.

Trevor Prescod head of the Bajan Government’s National Task Force on Reparations and special envoy to Prime Minister Mia Mottley backed the demonstrators.

He said: “I wish them well and hope that what they are attempting to do brings some level of consciousness to the prince.”

Charles who met Ms Mottley at Cop26 branded Britain’s role in slavery an “atrocity” during a visit to Ghana in 2018. But he did not acknowledge his family’s part in it.

Graham Smith of UK campaign group Republic said: “The Royal Family were steeped in the slave trade. There’s no reason why they can’t make significant reparations.”

Tonight Barbados police source said: “Security will be at the highest level for Prince Charles’ visit.”

A spokesman for the prince said: “We have no comment to make.

Why Prince should say sorry – and pay up

A direct descendant of Barbadian slaves says the Royal family should pay up – and admit they were wrong.

Grandad Aidan Taylor 64 met Prince Charles during his last visit to the Caribbean island in 2019.

Standing in Bridgetown’s Independence Square which Charles will visit on Monday proud Aidan said: “Five generations of my family were enslaved at Ayshford plantation and Lion Castle plantation and died there.

Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror) Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)

“We should never be ashamed of our past because it has made us who we are. It is important to know our history and acknowledge it because that allows us to build our future.”

Appealing directly to the UK’s future monarch Aidan who was wearing a costume covered in the Barbadian flag said: “It doesn’t take nothing off of you to admit what happened in the past. We must hold hands and go forward together.

“Reparations would be good and should be used to educate and help the next generation. It isn’t about anyone trying to get rich.”",,,

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

Minnesota hasn't quite realized Herold's dream of one flag we can all rally behind.

She sold cameras — professional devices like Nikons and Kodaks as well as smaller models like Fujifilms which were more for everyday candid snaps. The store even had a machine where photo negatives could be processed in under an hour.

“We used to get really busy in there have a lot of rolls of film to print and this was one-hour photo” Pitnikoss said. “I always loved Nikon cameras so it was fun to sell those.”

When she finished work her boyfriend at the time Daryl Solodar would sometimes be waiting for her in the mall hallways with a bouquet of carnations. He would drive more than an hour from his home in Clearwater just to see her after work.

Eventually Daryl asked her to marry him. Iris Pitnikoss became Iris Solodar. At their wedding the manager of Ritz Camera was the photographer. Back then the whole staff at the store had a passion for taking pictures — including Iris who went on to a career in sports photography.

Malls like DeSoto Square were a focal point of daily life

Stories like Solodar’s are typical of people who came of age in the latter half of the 20th century. Malls like DeSoto Square were a focal point of daily life. More than just shopping places they were cultural touchstones pivotal to growing up economic mobility leisure and social interaction.

Sure you could go there to buy things. Stores like the Vogue Shop Lane Bryant Waldenbooks and Camelot Music at DeSoto Square always had the latest in fashion and entertainment. But it was more than that.

The mall had a movie theater an arcade places to eat and plenty of space for events like high school proms and science fairs home decor expos political discussions and celebrity visits. It was such a community focal point Ronald Reagan held a rally there when he campaigned for president in 1976.

As important as it was to Bradenton however the DeSoto Square Mall eventually struggled. From the day it opened in 1973 until the early 21st century when things started to really go downhill DeSoto Square Mall traced the arc of the rise and demise of malls as a center of U.S. commerce and culture.

It officially closed as a mall on April 30 2021.

Shifting dynamics

DeSoto Square Mall was built during an era that could be referred to as the great American shopping mall boom.

The widespread use of the car and the creation of the interstate highway system that followed the end of World War II resulted in population growth in newly formed suburban areas by mostly white families Tom Fisher director and Minnesota Design Chair at the University of Minnesota’s College of Design said.

Austrian architect Victor Gruen who had emigrated to the U.S. during the rise of Nazi Germany saw that this new suburban population would need shopping closer to where they lived.

“In the suburbs there were a few stores in the middle of seas of parking lots. (Gruen) felt that the suburbs deserved to have a type of pedestrian environment similar to a downtown” Fisher said. “He wanted to get people out of their cars and walking in the same way that he experienced when he was in Europe as a young man.”

The first mall in the U.S. Southdale Center in Edina Minnesota opened in 1956 designed by Gruen. Although it was an enclosed indoor center it also had touches that alluded to the outdoors like a bird aviary a fish pond and a cafe.

“He was basically trying to replicate being out on a real street but doing it in an enclosed air-conditioned place” Fisher said.

It was Gruen who came up with the idea of having competing department stores on either end of the shopping center. This was designed to attract more people give them choices and encourage them to walk down the mall’s hallways and see other smaller tenants along the way Fisher said.

Gruen’s mall design would go on to be replicated by other architects and developers throughout the next few decades.

Over the course of 30 years there was an enormous wave of mall construction across suburbia.

“What happened in many communities is a mall was built in close proximity to the exit of a U.S. highway or an intersection which was newly built or developed and it was wildly successful” said Mark A. Cohen director of retail studies at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business.

With malls also came the rise of the specialty store industry and of chain stores Cohen said. They were created to fill out the smaller spaces inside of malls between the anchor stores.

“Some of the specialty stores came from downtown but many of them were newly formed national chains like The Limited for example” he said.

As a result once-booming downtown areas started to hollow out. It didn’t happen all at once — like the suburban mall boom it occurred slowly and steadily over the course of about 30 years in the mid-to-late 20th century Cohen said. Many cities had more than one mall on different sides of town — and at the time they were all successful.

“The local department store saw their business decline because they were doing business in the mall or they actually closed their downtown stores. And the mom-and-pops or local stores that had typically done business downtown either found a way to move to the mall or they went out of business” Cohen said.

News of a mall coming to the Bradenton area spread in the early 1970s. In November 1971 an entity called Bradenton Mall Corporation purchased about 100 acres at U.S. 301 and Cortez Road for $1.6 million from 32 various landowners.

Bradenton city officials including Mayor A.K. Leach worried about how a mall outside of city limits would impact downtown merchants. But Leach said merchants had already been through a lot including the Great Depression a 1926 hurricane and “the onslaught of the Mediterranean fruit fly.”

“I think they’ll weather this storm too” Leach told the Herald-Tribune in 1972.

But gradually downtown Bradenton did become less of a retail center and more of a professional services district. And it wasn’t just Bradenton that experienced this change.

“It became logical for stores to locate new branches near where people were living and also which were easily accessible by car” Steve Kirn a retired lecturer from the University of Florida said. “So the fundamental design of the shopping mall with a cluster of stores in the middle surrounded by an ocean of parking places because people now had cars and they could drive there: ‘Woohoo this is exciting.’”

And if there was one person who knew how to capitalize on that excitement it was the builder of the DeSoto Square Mall.

DeSoto conquers Bradenton

His name was Edward J. DeBartolo. He was born in Youngstown Ohio in 1909 to an Italian family. He was known to work 15 hours per day during the week 10 to 12 hours on Saturdays and seven hours on Sundays according to the New York Times.

In 1972 the year before DeSoto Square opened the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation built 4231670 square feet of retail shopping center space in the U.S. That same year the company had an estimated $300 million in assets; projects in the pipeline at the time were expected to bump that total up to $450 million.

Like any good developer DeBartolo did his homework. And that homework gave him a particular affinity for Florida. He told the New York Times Magazine in 1973 that population and age studies his company did in the Sunshine State proved that it was a lot more than just a place for retirees.

“Boy this state is really something” he told the Times magazine. “It’s jumping right out of its skin. Land prices are high but I’ve got news for you: They’re going to get a hell of a lot higher. Honest to god in my opinion this crazy Florida is in its infancy. You hear me? In its INFANCY.”

Stan Rutstein a Manatee County-based commercial real estate broker with decades of experience in the retail industry said that DeBartolo was the kind of developer who would tell you what you were doing instead of ask.

“We would go in the conference room with Mr. DeBartolo. He would have in front of him — eight cities seven cities where he’s going to build a mall. And you would say ‘it’s great we love it we’ll take this city that city and this city.’ And he’d say ‘Oh no no no we don’t work that way’” Rutstein said. “‘Unless you take this you don’t get that.’”

The mall that would become DeSoto Square was not one of DeBartolo’s busiest most high-profile properties Rutstein said. It was more like the kind of place where you’d have to open a store if you also wanted a spot in one of his shinier developments.

As the corporation name indicates the shopping center’s original name was Bradenton Mall despite the fact that it wasn’t technically located in Bradenton. The idea to call it “DeSoto Square” came from Richard Turner the president of the Manatee County Conquistadore organization who thought giving the mall a name with historical significance would draw more attention to the area’s annual DeSoto Celebration.

Building suspense

As DeSoto Square’s opening approached the DeBartolo Corporation started to release the names of the retailers that would fill out its state-of-the-art concourses.

First on the west end of the property there would be a 99946-square-foot Sears store with a full-service cafeteria a 20000-square-foot 16-bay automotive service center and a covered drive-thru package pickup department according to a press release from the company in 1972 kept by the Manatee County Historical Records Library.

On the opposite end would be J.C. Penney Co. and in the middle anchor spot which was visible to customers when they walked through the front doors of the mall there would be a Maas Brothers.

At the center point of the mall in front of Maas Brothers there would be a huge colonnade courtyard with two circular fountains that “when shut off will be converted to a stage area for use in fashion shows and other activities” the DeBartolo Corporation said in its press release.

In a story published Aug. 14 a day before the mall’s doors opened to the public for the first time the Bradenton Herald didn’t hold back the accolades.

“Manatee County is proud of its new shopping center — every bit as much as the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation its builder and those who own the businesses which will operate within” the Herald wrote. “The pride is showing.”

The opening was grand

Half of the mall’s tenants including JCPenney were still under construction on opening day. But that didn’t stop 10000 people from wanting to be among the first to check out Manatee County’s hottest — and most anticipated — new attraction.

The mall’s hostesses who had been training for this day directed customers to the stores they were looking for. Local law enforcement ensured a steady flow of traffic through the mall’s 2469 parking spaces which were filled to capacity all day.

And greeting visitors at the main entrance in its six-foot tall bronze glory was a 200-pound statue of Hernando de Soto the Spanish conquistador. The statue designed by Miami artist Bob Stoetzer was flanked by six ships in full sail hanging from the ceiling above the conquistador’s head to further illustrate his conquest.

Aug. 15 may have been the mall’s first day but some tenants like the DeSoto Square branch of Manatee Federal Savings and Loan had opened a few days prior. The bank branch was two stories tall with a staircase on either side of the ground floor that connected in the middle Carolyn Keller the bank’s branch manager on opening day said.

Keller now retired and still living in Manatee County recalls the excitement.

“All of the stores were getting ready to open and making sure everything was perfect. There were free coffee and cookies and all kinds of things” Keller said.

Over the next few months more retailers continued to fill out the mall’s fleet of tenants Manatee County historical records show. There was Nello’s Men’s Store which started in Sarasota in the late 1940s as a shoe repair shop. There was the Ranch clothing store the World Bazaar and the mall’s McDonald’s.

And then in late November the Montgomery-Roberts department store opened to the public with company president Hurdis Chestnut on hand for the ribbon cutting.

JCPenney the last of the mall’s three pre-planned anchors officially opened in January 1974. Store manager John Mitk vice president and regional manager Stan Putman district manager Jim McCall and Miss Florida Ellen Meade were on hand to cut the ribbon.

One of the highlights of the early days of DeSoto Square was the Piccadilly Cafeteria. The cafeteria concept was popular around the time of the shopping mall boom before food courts took over as the norm.

A typical Piccadilly cafeteria in the 1970s and 1980s would be about 10000 square feet Rick Fuchs who was vice president of real estate for the company starting in 1982 said. The DeSoto Square Mall location was about 11000 square feet according to Herald-Tribune archives.

Customers would get a tray and walk along the cafeteria line where they could peek at the hot food and ask the employee standing behind the glass to please scoop some out for them.

New traditions

Piccadilly had more than 1500 of its own secret recipes Fuchs said – the cafeterias would have eight to 10 hot entrees up to ten different varieties of salad and tons of dessert options all at the same time.

The concept really took off in the south Fuchs said and it was sort of a Sunday tradition for people to go to church and then eat at the cafeteria for dinner. Their biggest day of the year sales wise was Mother’s Day.

“We had chicken entrees beef entrees seafood entrees and everything was cooked from scratch. We had our own recipes that we kept secret or tried to” he said.

Rutstein operated a Casual Corner store at DeSoto Square for about a decade. The mall was just like any other mall he said. It was nothing special — in fact his Casual Corner store there did not perform particularly well.

But it was still a mall and as malls were the most successful retail model of the time it attracted major department stores and tenants.

The mall’s fourth anchor a two-story 100000-square-foot Belk-Lindsey department store opened in 1979 historical records show. An expansion added room for eight new stores totaling 5534 square feet and two more movie theaters bumping the mall’s total up to six. By early 1979 there were rumors that Burdine’s would join as the mall’s fifth anchor.

But DeSoto Square was a lot more than department stores cafeterias movie theaters and even places to grab a quick bite.

In December 1973 its first holiday season DeSoto Square hosted a clown show to celebrate Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus’ 104th year world premiere according to historical records. In February 1974 the mall hosted an art show featuring works from 25 professional artists including landscapes seascapes florals oil on canvas and much much more.

The following month a petting zoo came to the mall and a goat named Charlie pulled kids around in a carriage.

DeSoto Square was so much the center of events that in 1977 mall general manager Brian Hennesey took on the role of director of promotions on top of his management duties.

“Did you ever really stop to think about the frequency and diversification of the promotional events at DeSoto Square Mall?” the Bradenton Herald asked on Aug. 18 1977. “Very few people realize the magnitude of some of these events and the efforts required to maintain these programs in a timely fashion.”

Hennesey told the Herald at the time that the mall Merchants Association coordinated an estimated 80 events per year.

Some like boat shows and art exhibits went off without a hitch. But others like Santa’s arrival in 1976 had to be rearranged. That year Santa was scheduled to parachute into the mall’s parking lot to make his grand arrival for the holiday season. But the sky was so overcast that the plane he was in had to return to the airport; Santa reached the mall with a police car escort.

Reagan’s big visit came in 1976 as part of a campaign swing through Florida. His visit was a big deal even though the sound system went out near the end of his speech according to Herald-Tribune archives.

Keller the branch manager of Manatee Federal Savings and Loan said that the bank inside the mall was used as a sort of Reagan team headquarters during the candidate’s visit. She said she exchanged pleasantries with him and found him to be very nice.

“He autographed a business card for me” she said. “There was a lot of excitement when things like that happened.”

At the mall’s 10th anniversary in October 1983 the Bradenton Herald reflected on its impact. Retail stores had been replaced by business offices and residential developments. Having a mall with a variety of stores in a centralized location made shopping easier for residents. And with the vast amount of entertainment options available the mall had become the modern version of the old town square.

“Ten years ago DeSoto Square like thousands of other shopping malls across the nation sprouted up because it boasted ‘one-stop shopping’ free parking and shelter from inclement weather” the Herald wrote. “But malls offered more than just convenience. They provided a common meeting place for communities and offered entertainment such as music craft shows car exhibits and consumer product demonstrations.”

Food holds court

Despite DeSoto Square’s popularity in Bradenton it was not one of DeBartolo’s high-profile properties Rutstein said.

“The income levels weren’t there the size of the community wasn’t there the anchors were not quite what we would like but we had no choice” Rutstein said. “That mall was built because the developer wanted to build the mall. That’s why today you hear the expression ‘There are so many A malls B malls and C malls’ because most of those malls were built on what was referred to as tertiary real estate – third-rate locations and you can’t make lemonade out of lemons.”

The biggest challenge malls faced since their inception came in the mid-1990s when Amazon.com was invented by Jeff Bezos in Seattle. Amazon started out as an online seller of books but quickly expanded to things like video games toys home improvement items and consumer electronics.

“A lot of the senior retail executives — some of whom I worked with and for village idiots one and all — sat in their cloistered boardrooms 25 years ago and said ‘well this internet thing is a fad. Anybody can sell books and music but nobody will buy anything consequential via the internet’” Cohen said.

Slowly but surely the internet started to chip away at the market share once dominated by shopping malls and department stores Cohen said. And as a result retailers had to look for ways to make cuts.

At first those cuts might have been subtle. Maybe the merchandise at a store would be a little off one week or the store would seem a little dustier than usual because of cuts to janitorial staff. But eventually those things started to add up.

“For decades the customer was more or less handcuffed to that location. Now the handcuffs are gone because the internet has become a portal for an enormous array of customers into anything and everything from anywhere” Cohen said.

DeBartolo died in 1994 at the age of 85. In 1996 his company was acquired for $1.5 billion by Simon Property Group. Simon founded in Indianapolis Indiana in 1993 was a competitor of the DeBartolo company.

The merger of its parent company didn’t seem to make much of an impact on the day-to-day operations or the shopper side of DeSoto Square. There was still lots of fun to be had at the mall in the 1990s.

Christmas was always a big deal at DeSoto Square several people interviewed said. In 1993 Christmas celebrations consisted of bells drums and Victorian bears who ice skated near JCPenney. Anyone who rode the mall’s express train received a free coloring book of the DeSoto Square Bear Cub Family during a Santa visit newspaper historical records show. Shoppers could also get their presents wrapped for free by presenting their receipts to the gift wrap booth near the mall’s Lerner store.

In 1994 a 15-foot high sandcastle was constructed in the concourse of the mall using 60 tons of sand.

By the mid-1990s however shoppers did notice something was missing. By then food courts where multiple restaurant tenants would operate on the perimeter of a giant cafeteria were becoming an expected part of the shopping mall experience. The Gulf Coast Factory Shops in Ellenton had one with a Chinese restaurant a soups sandwiches and salads spot a Taco Bell outlet and a Gloria Jean’s Gourmet Coffee.

But despite talk about adding a food court in the late 1980s DeSoto Square didn’t have one.

In July 1996 the Bradenton Herald reported that ownership would invest $2.7 million into building a 388-seat food court and a new entrance into the Sears wing of the mall. The food court called Port O’Call would have a tropical theme with several restaurant slots – including a spot for longstanding tenant McDonald’s.

By early 1997 the food court was open with two spots occupied – one for McDonald’s and one for Charley’s Steakery. Planned tenants were Barnie’s Coffee and Tea Company Bourbon Street Cajun food Nature’s Table Sbarro and Chick-fil-A. Arthur Treacher’s Seafood Grille also relocated from its existing restaurant near Dillards which had replaced Belk-Lindsey as an anchor in 1992.

Some existing mall restaurants opted not to move to the centralized eating spot including Mr. Dunderbak’s Bavarian Pantry near JCPenney. The mall also had a branch of legendary Sarasota ice cream maker Big Olaf Creamery.

Mall in transition

Business was good. DeSoto Square was at 91 percent occupancy and the movie theater then under the Cobb name was due to be expanded from six screens to 18 according to historical newspaper records. When Port O’Call held its official grand opening in April 1997 Dawn Wells who played Mary Ann on the television show Gilligan’s Island was there to judge a Gilligan’s Island castaway look-alike contest.

Even though the mall had been open for about 25 years the experience of going there for a kid in Bradenton was pretty similar to what it had been in 1973.

Dakota Duffina 24 went there a lot between 2003 to 2010 because of the skate park that was across the street. Before that her mom told her about taking her older siblings who were 10 and 13 years older than her to the mall during Halloween for trick-or-treating. She got her hair cut at Regis Hairstyles at DeSoto Square for about 11 years.

“They would have everything decked out for Christmas and it would be so so busy in there. That was the time period where they had the carousel in the food court so that was really cool” Duffina said.

But even during those good days the cracks were starting to show. DeSoto Square was going for more discount and service-oriented stores by 2005.

In May 2003 just a few months shy of its 30-year anniversary Piccadilly Cafeteria at DeSoto Square closed.

This was the beginning of the end for DeSoto Square Mall. But its death didn’t happen quietly slowly or subtly. In order to get to where it ended up on April 30 DeSoto Square Mall would have to be pummeled by several other unrelenting retail storms.

Jalen Ramsey is one of the NFL’s best outside cornerbacks. This year he’s one of the NFL’s best slot cornerbacks. He’s one of 28 players to have at least 100 coverage snaps lined up both outside and in the slot in 2021. Among that group he’s sixth in yards allowed per coverage snap on the outside and second from the slot per charting from Sports Info Solutions.

With Troy Hill gone and with a shift to Raheem Morris as defensive coordinator Ramsey has played more in the slot this season in the Rams’ “Star” position. In all but two games this season Ramsey has played more snaps in the slot than outside per PFF.

While most defenses use their best cornerback to shadow opposing No. 1 receivers the Rams have moved Ramsey around to give him more freedom to make plays across the field. Occasionally when even top corners are left to the outside they can be ignored by the opposing quarterback. Part of moving Ramsey around the defense has been in part to make him what Sean McVay has called as unavoidable for the QB as possible.

For Ramsey personally that’s been a massive success. Among 1117 cornerbacks with at least 100 coverage snaps on the season Ramsey ranks second in Adjusted Yards Allowed per coverage snap using the pro-football-reference formula that includes weights for touchdowns and interceptions. He’s also still not getting targeted all that much — he’s 17th in targets per coverage snap in that group. But even as quarterbacks are trying to avoid him the Rams are making that tougher and he’s consistently around the ball. His play should put him at the top of the Defensive Player of the Year conversation but per BetMGM he’s currently seventh in odds at +2500.

Top-15 Cornerbacks By Adjusted Yards Allowed per Coverage Snap (min. 100 coverage snaps)

Through 10 games in 2021 Ramsey already has more passes defensed (10) than he did last season (nine). He’s one interception shy (three) of his career-high (four). Putting him closer to the line of scrimmage has also helped him make plays elsewhere. He’s been used as a pass rusher more often — he has six pressures on 16 pass rushes in 2021 after he had one pressure on 11 rushes in 2020 per SIS.

His speed and balance have been assets playing downhill. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers he sidestepped an attempted block from Leonard Fournette which forced Tom Brady to throw the ball into the ground.

That’s also translated to the open field. Against the New York Giants Ramsey blew up a screen by juking an offensive lineman in a one-on-one situation.

With eight tackles for loss in 2021 Ramsey has matched his previous career total from 2016-2020.

Moving Ramsey around has also opened up possibilities on pre-snap looks even when the corner will stay in coverage. Against the San Fransico 49ers in Week 10 Ramsey was lined up in the slot across from Brandon Aiyuk. Before the snap he continually crept up toward the line. Typically that wouldn’t mean much for an opposing offense but with Ramsey doing a little more the thought of a rush is now a threat. Ramsey dropped back into coverage inside of Aiyuk and with a quick out from Aiyuk Jimmy Garoppolo thought there would be enough leverage to fit the ball in. Instead Ramsey was able to recover and jump in for a pass defensed.

The impact of Ramsey in the middle of the defense is pretty easy to see. Take a look at where wide receivers have been targeted across the NFL in 2021:

Now compare that to where wide receivers have been targeted and found success this season against the Rams:

It’s clear that Ramsey has excelled in this role especially for a defense that doesn’t use off-ball linebackers a whole lot (the Rams play 18% of their snaps in dime) but there are places where this hasn’t quite served the Rams’ defense as a whole. Without the top corner following the opposing top receivers the Rams have dropped to 22nd in DVOA against No. 1 receivers per Football Outsiders. Last year they still only ranked 13th but that was with fairly low volume — 7.6 passes per game and 55.3 yards allowed per game which ranked second. This year the Rams have allowed the most passes per game (9.8) and yards per game (84.8) to opposing No. 1’s.

Part of this stems from the shuffle the Rams have needed at outside corner around Ramsey. Ramsey has played 93% of the defensive snaps and the second corner Darious Williams has played 65% but also spent three weeks on injured reserve. Behind them has been a mix of David Long (52.1%) Robert Rochell (34.1%) and Donte Deayon (32.5%).

Long a 2019 third-round pick is holding his own on the outside but there have been struggles across the rest of the group on the outside in the non-Ramsey division. (The average Adjusted Yards per coverage snaps among corners this year is around 0.9.)

This leaves the Rams potentially balancing the thought of having a good overall pass defense (they’re still 10th in defensive DVOA against the pass) and being able to shut down an opposing top option. This matters with the Rams’ upcoming schedule out of their bye. The Rams will face the Green Bay Packers Arizona Cardinals Seattle Seahawks and Minnesota Vikings in four of their next five games. Those teams feature some decent No. 1 receivers.

We’ve already seen a glimpse of how the Rams treated these matchups earlier in the season. Los Angeles played Seattle in Week 5 one of the two games Ramsey played more outside than slot snaps. Per NFL Next Gen Stats Ramsey lined up across from DK Metcalf on 44% of the receiver’s routes. That resulted in just two targets but also two receptions 44 yards and a touchdown — the lone touchdown credited against Ramsey in coverage this season.

The week prior against the Cardinals Ramsey played over 70% of his snaps in the slot instead of against DeAndre Hopkins. Hopkins had three targets against Ramsey but that resulted in just one catch for 18 yards and one pass defensed.

Against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game last season Ramsey had started to play more of this Star position but lined up across from Davante Adams on 53% of the receiver’s routes. Those weren’t exclusive to the outside since the Packers also move Adams around.

Snaps against top opposing receivers also don’t always mean man-to-man coverage. Think of a slant Adams had when lined up against Ramsey in that Conference Championship Game. Ramsey backed into zone right off the snap and was never really responsible for Adams’s actual route once the receiver broke inside. The Rams play the second-highest rate of zone coverage in the NFL per SIS.

Still man-to-man or not that leaves them with a weakness on the outside. Darious Williams could be a key to allowing Ramsey to play more on the outside should the Rams want to go in that direction. Last season Williams had a breakout year as a great outside corner across from Ramsey but as the numbers above show that hasn’t been the case this season. Williams though is also one of those players with at least 100 coverage snaps both outside and in the slot. In the slot this season he’s allowed just 45 yards on 119 coverage snaps per SIS and that yards per coverage snap figure is the third-best from the slot — just behind Ramsey. That might not be where they go since Williams leads the team in outside coverage snaps in the two weeks since his return from IR.

Ramsey’s Star role has added another layer to the game of an already great defensive back. But for the Rams to be the best version of themselves on defense they’ll have to figure out if that will be the best role for Ramsey given the rest of the defensive backs on the roster or if they’ll need their star to return to one of the league’s best shutdown outside corners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZWFnbGVzd2lyZS51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vbGlzdHMvZWFnbGVzLWNhcnNvbi13ZW50ei1jb2x0cy1zbmFwLWNvdW50LWJ1Y2NhbmVlcnMtbmZsLWRyYWZ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carson Wentz played every snap in Colts Week 12 loss to Buccaneers,"While the Eagles were blowing the momentum of 2 straight wins all draft eyes were on Carson Wentz and the Colts (6-6) as lost a close matchup with the Buccaneers at Lucas Oil Stadium.

The AFC South matchup offered another opportunity to track the former Eagles quarterback as Philadelphia looks to snag three high first-round picks this spring.

When the Eagles traded Wentz in the offseason the team received a conditional second-round rounder in 2022 that would become a first-round pick if the quarterback takes 75% of the Colts’ regular-season offensive snaps or 70% if they make the playoffs.

The 44-year-old rapper posted the black-and-white snap of the pair smooching on his Instagram Story on Friday (26.11.21) along with a screengrab of a TMZ article with the headline: ""Kanye West Says God Will Bring Him and Kim Back Together Inspire Millions.""

The 'Jesus Walks' star also tagged the mother of his four kids - North eight Saint five Chicago three and two-year-old Psalm - in the post.

The bold move comes despite Kim 41 moving on with 28-year-old comedian Pete Davidson.

And during an appearance at the Los Angeles Mission’s Annual Thanksgiving event in Los Angeles earlier this week the Yeezy founder - who has legally changed his name to Ye - explained how God wants him to reunite with Kim and confessed to making ""mistakes"" in his seven-year marriage to the reality star.

Kanye said: “The narrative God wants is to see that we can be redeemed in all these relationships.

“We’ve made mistakes. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve publically done things that were not acceptable as a husband but right now today for whatever reason — I didn’t know I was going to be in front of this mic — but I’m here to change the narrative.”

The 'Stronger' hitmaker then pleaded: “I have to be next to my children as much as possible. So when I’m out the house I’ve got a house right next to the house. I’m doing everything to be right next to the situation … I’m trying to express this in the most sane way the most calm way possible but I need to be back home.”

The impassioned speech came after Kanye admitted he is trying to “keep [his] family together” earlier this month.

During an appearance on the ‘Drink Champs’ podcast he said he was trying to “save” his family by speaking about his ongoing divorce proceedings.

He said: “At the end of the day I ain't got the paperwork yet. So I'm going to come on this joint and try to save my family and keep my family together.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYnJvYmlibGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9hcnRpY2xlL3Zpa2luZ3MtcWIta2lyay1jb3VzaW5zLXJpZ2h0LWd1YXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vikings QB Kirk Cousins Embarrassingly Lines Up Behind Right Guard Instead Of Center Before Snap On 4th Down,"Vikings QB Kirk Cousins is one of the highest-paid QBs in the league but he nearly made an embarrassing rookie mistake on Sunday.

'i’m most thankful for you' captioned Jodie who went on to tag her husband of nearly two years in the post.

The post which did not feature their daughter's face has since garnered over 30000 likes and more than 200 comments from fans and friends of the couple.

Jodie and the Dawson's Creek alumnus started dating in 2018 before quietly marrying in December 2019.

Just four months later the newlyweds welcomed their daughter Janie who they've done their best to keep out of the public eye.

Earlier this year Jackson appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon where he revealed that Jodie had proposed to him.

'She asked me on New Year's Eve' he told the host. 'We were in Nicaragua - it was very beautiful incredibly romantic we were walking down the beach and she asked me to marry her.'

It was truly a whirlwind engagement being that it occurred just two months into their relationship.

Joshua gushed that his decision to accept Jodie's proposal was the 'best choice I ever made.'

The lovely engagement story was met with criticism which prompted the Little Fires Everywhere actor to fireback at 'racist and misogynist' critics in a Refinery29 interview.

'So I accidentally threw my wife under the bus because that story was told quickly and it didn't give the full context and holy Jesus the internet is racist and misogynist' began Jackson.

He clarified that although he'd accepted Turner-Smith's proposal he also wanted to perform a proposal of his own.

'What I didn't say in that interview was there was a caveat which is that I'm still old school enough that I said ""This is a yes but you have to give me the opportunity"" to propose as well.'

Last month the British-born model turned to social media to share a factoid about domestic life with Jackson.

'Every morning @vancityjax takes baby duty giving me the option of staying in bed for as long as I want! Though I rarely stay very long not having to spring out of bed in the mornings does wonders for my mental health' she wrote across a selfie.

Mary Hollis Huddleston is be best known these days as Mrs. Southern Social and one thing is clear: She’s found her niche. Supported by her extensive wedding planning background the Nashville native used Instagram to propel her already successful career to the next level focusing on the idea of easy entertaining for the modern Southern woman.

Also the founder of Please Be Seated event rental company her expertise has opened the door for other ventures such as her upcoming spring tabletop line in collaboration with Dillard’s and Southern Living. Not to mention the upcoming release of her first book Without a Hitch a fictional story that also chronicles some of the hilarious (and often extreme) adventures she endured during the course of her wedding planning career. Please welcome entertaining guru and Instagram favorite Mary Hollis Huddleston aka Mrs. Southern Social!

What led you to become Mrs. Southern Social?

I never thought in a million years that I would end up here! I have an extensive background in ‘eventing’ and so many unexpected doors have opened throughout my career. I definitely have a passion for wedding planning but that’s a very tough career to stay in long-term. It has taken me a while but I finally found my sweet spot. It started out with an Instagram that grew very organically and I really stayed true to the focus which was all about easy entertaining. I honed in on this niche in the marketplace which led to a lot of the success I’ve had.

You describe your style as “tradition with a twist.” What is the “twist?”

I joke that I’m the “modern Southern woman.” It all started because I realized there are a lot of us in the South that watched our mothers and grandmothers entertain. It looked effortless but it was really a lot of effort. That’s not how the modern woman entertains anymore in my opinion. Everyone is so busy. I still loved to entertain and I didn’t want to give up a lot of the special traditions and memories that I had growing up so I tried to help people find ways to cut corners — to make entertaining easy and effortless but still as memorable and layered as the events our moms and grandmothers used to host.

Given that you’re a Nashville native what are some of your favorite local spots that people often overlook?

Cheekwood. That’s really one of my favorite spots. I don’t know that people overlook it but it’s this treasure box in Nashville. And since Jane MacLeod (the current President) took over she has done so much for the museum and botanical gardens with the different exhibitions and programming she brings in. Also Epergne! I love Epergne. It’s one of my favorite home goods stores in Nashville and it’s a hidden gem. They have some of the best-curated finds for entertaining that exist in the city.

Tell us about your book Without a Hitch. How long has it been in the works?

I’m birthing my “third child” in December! I have been in labor with it for over five years. I never set out to write a book but I was a journalism major and my co-author has made a career of being a journalist. I spent over a decade planning these over-the-top ridiculous but fabulous events and I would tell my friends stories of the things that I experienced and lived through being an event planner in Dallas. They couldn’t believe the stories were true and they would ask to hear more. That kind of turned into the book; I have all of these amazing stories to tell. The book is a fictional account of my experience but it’s just too good not to share!

With the holidays quickly approaching what is one item or easy entertaining trick to make our celebrations more festive?

Greenery is your best friend — especially right now because there’s a flower shortage. It’s easy to decorate with even if you’re a novice floral designer (like most of us are). And it smells great too! I love going to our local nursery to get trees and greenery in the winter. You can wrap a beautiful garland around a porcelain bowl fill it with fruit and you’re good to go. I also love styling tables with fruit when I don’t want to mess with flowers. I think a bowl full of oranges at the holidays is beautiful and easy.

Are there any holiday trends to take note of this year?

I see a lot of metallics. Right now color is having a moment too. I think people are setting holiday tables with colors that aren’t the traditional red and green. You’re going to see a lot of gold purples and blues. At the holidays my dining room is always set in blue white and red — I always bring in my chinoiserie pieces and then throw in some greenery and red berries and call it a day.

What is your favorite holiday hostess gift to give or receive?

An orchid! Maybe it’s expected but I think a potted orchid is such a great gift. I love having fresh flowers in my home but they don’t last long. An orchid is pretty easy to keep alive and it’s really fun to use as decoration.

What is the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?

“Be quick to listen and slow to respond.” I’m type A and I’m very opinionated. I’ve found that if I wait to reply and really listen I never regret what I say like I do when I say something off the cuff and have an immediate reaction to something. It has helped me so much in business and relationships. Recently I was presented with something that I thought was very negative. I started to have a reaction to it but I paused and did more thinking. I sat on it a little bit longer and it has turned into something really fabulous. I’m glad I didn’t turn down the project just because my initial response wasn’t great.

Faith family and friends notwithstanding what are three things that you cannot live without?

Crime dramas Topo Chico and microblading. I always get so many comments on my eyebrows and it’s because of microblading — it has changed my face. When there was a rumor Topo Chico was going to be hard to get I went and bought it like people were buying toilet paper. If there’s an apocalypse I’m good on my stock of Topo Chico!

Not many people can draw a crowd on a cold night like Kris Kringle can and the Jolly Old Elf did just that at Coopersburg’s annual Tree-Lighting Ceremony Saturday arriving on a Coopersburg Volunteer Fire Company truck to a greet well-wishers of all ages.

Presented by the Southern Lehigh Chamber of Commerce and Coopersburg Volunteer Fire Company the ceremony attracted hundreds of people to the borough’s downtown where they were able to shop for Christmas gifts from local vendors along State Street buy food at the fire company’s snack stand as well as apple dumplings from Hausman’s Fruit Farm enjoy an old-fashioned hayride provided by Hausman’s watching an ice-sculpting demonstration have photos taken with Santa in Borough Hall and much more.

Also open for the first time was a new exhibit created by the Coopersburg Historical Society chronicling the businesses that have helped make the borough what it is today.

The exhibit is located on the first floor of Borough Hall and will be available for viewing by appointment for the next year volunteers said.

Back outside the fire company kept several fires going in several burn barrels as it was a frosty night on which to welcome Santa to town.

Even Wawa had a presence at the event with company representatives there to help promote a new store that will be opening on Rt. 309 early next year.

Remarks were given by local elected officials–including Coopersburg Mayor Gary Hovis Lehigh County Executive Phillips Armstrong and State Rep. Milou Mackenzie–shortly before the official tree-lighting took place around 7:45 p.m.

TRG’s stock dropped by as much as 3.9% in Karachi at 10:14 a.m. local time the biggest decliner on benchmark KSE-100 Index. The shares have dropped by 30% since the assault claims.

Earlier this month Chishti stepped down from his roles as CEO chairman and board director at Afiniti Ltd. a TRG-linked company. That departure came two days after a 23-year-old former employee testified before a U.S. Congressional committee that he sexually assaulted her during a business trip to Brazil.

Chishti who spent more than a decade building Afiniti a company he said would revolutionize the way call centers operate is also stepping down from his role as chairman of the Resource Group International Ltd. which owns a stake in Afiniti.

The Pakistani-American previously launched the Invisalign dental braces business which is now worth $47 billion. He founded the company that would become Afiniti in 2006 as a call-center operator.

The murder weapon told another story.

Twice Karl Hoerig had let true love slip through his fingers. He was determined not to let it happen a third time. Unfortunately the woman he married would murder him and escape justice for a decade.

How to Watch Watch Snapped on Oxygen Sundays 6/5c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Oxygen App.

Karl was born on Christmas Eve in 1963 and raised in Newton Falls in Ohio the second of three boys. It was an idyllic small town upbringing and following high school he enlisted in the military.

Karl met his first wife Rhonda at a military formal ball. They had two children together a daughter and son. They divorced in 1998 but remained on good terms and Karl was a devoted father.

After the completion of his service Hoerig worked as a pilot for Southwest Airlines and joined the Air Force Reserves. He rose to the rank of Major and saw active duty in the Persian Gulf.

“He flew logistical missions and rescue missions he flew in combat zones. This was a guy who dedicated his life to his community his country his family” U.S. Marshal Bill Boldin told “Snapped” airing Sundays at 6/5c on Oxygen.

Claudia Hoerig

While on a routine mission in Peru Karl met a young woman named Carla del Castillo whom he would refer to as “the love of his life” according to the weekly newspaper Cleveland Scene.

Carla moved in with Karl outside Youngstown Ohio but after two years their relationship hit a roadblock. She wanted marriage and kids. He did not. They broke up but six months later Karl realized the error of his ways. By then Carla had already moved on.

In April 2005 Karl met 40-year-old Claudia Sobral on a dating website. Claudia had escaped a rough upbringing in Brazil and moved to the United States in 1989 where she married a doctor. Claudia became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1998. A year later she and her husband divorced. When she met Hoerig Claudia was a successful accountant living in Queens New York.

“He told me all about this girl from New York City and that he really liked her but one of my first impressions when I met Claudia was that she reminded me so much of Carla” Hoerig’s friend Christopher Swegan told “Snapped.”

Six weeks after meeting Karl proposed to Claudia. They married in Las Vegas in June 2005 and Claudia moved to his hometown of Newton Falls where he had just bought a house near his parents.

On March 15 2007 Karl failed to report for duty at the Youngstown Air Force Reserve Station. His friend airman Gary Dodge immediately sensed something was wrong.

“It was not common for Karl to miss work so Gary Dodge placed a call to 911 to check the welfare of his friend” Trumbull County Sheriff’s Detective Mike Yannucci told “Snapped.”

Authorities went by Karl’s home but there was no answer at the door. Karl’s father Ed was called and let them into the home.

Inside authorities found the dead body of 44-year-old Karl Hoerig at the bottom of his stairs. He had been shot three times once in the head and twice in the back from a shooter standing at the top of the stairs according to court documents. Two more bullets were found lodged in the floor.

Karl’s body had been covered with a comforter and a construction tarp which investigators believed indicated the killer knew him. There were no signs of a break-in nor was anything taken from the home.

Investigators found the murder weapon a .357 Smith & Wesson Magnum Revolver in a closet upstairs. It was cocked and loaded and facing outward the barrel poking out of a 2-by-4 which went across the door frame. A string attached the trigger to the door but the gun didn’t fire.

Karl’s car was parked in the Hoerigs' driveway. Inside was a hastily packed suitcase and his cellphone indicating he was in the middle of leaving when he was murdered. There was no sign of Claudia at the home and her BMW was missing.

Jim Thomas a retiree who lived next door to the Hoerigs told investigators that on the morning of March 12 he saw Claudia leave and speed off down the street. ""Like a bat out of hell"" Thomas later told Cleveland Scene.

Investigators spoke with Karl’s friends and family who revealed the Hoerigs’ marriage was deeply troubled. As the relationship went south Claudia began acting erratically.

In early 2007 Claudia asked Karl’s family to come over for what she called ""an emergency meeting"" according to the CBS television series “48 Hours.” Karl was unaware of the get-together until he came downstairs for his morning coffee.

During the gathering Claudia accused Karl of being emotionally abusive while he complained about her unwillingness to help clean the house. When the subject of divorce came up Claudia fainted then locked herself in the bedroom.

Later that day Claudia swallowed a bottle of pills and went out in her car. She was later involved in a car crash and charged with driving under the influence according to Cleveland Scene.

While flying for Southwest Airlines on March 10 Karl had a layover in North Carolina and visited his ex-wife. He confided to Rhonda that he was leaving Claudia and moving into a house he had rented on March 12 according to “48 Hours.”

To Karl’s loved ones Claudia was the killer. ""The first thing I said to the police was 'You know who to go after'"" Karl’s mother Frannie Hoerig told Cleveland Scene.

Investigators also learned that on March 9 Claudia made arrangements to close her bank account and wire $9900 to her father in Brazil according to court documents.

A day later Claudia purchased the murder weapon on which she had a laser-sight-grip installed and hollow-point bullets from a local gun shop. Later that day she went to a firing range to practice using the gun.

A BOLO was placed for Claudia’s BMW. It was eventually located at Pittsburgh International Airport. Claudia had flown from there to New York City on March 12 before boarding a flight to Sao Paulo Brazil.

Having established motive and means authorities in Trumbull County filed aggravated murder charges against Claudia Hoerig and issued a warrant for her arrest on April 12 2007 according to Youngstown Ohio NBC-affiliate WFMJ-TV.

The Brazilian constitution expressly forbids the extradition of its citizens. However in becoming a U.S. citizen Claudia had taken an oath renouncing her Brazilian citizenship.

The Brazil government was initially uncooperative in U.S. efforts to bring Claudia Hoerig back to Ohio to face justice. In 2013 Brazil’s Supreme Court revoked Hoerig’s citizenship but her actual extradition remained up in the air.

“We were keeping an eye on her. We find out she bought a house she started her own business she actually got remarried. These were all things that were a smack in the face to the victim to the family and really really frustrating to the detectives involved in the case” Boldin said.

In the ensuing years the murder of Karl Hoerig would be covered by numerous true crime shows and Claudia would be put on the FBI’s Most Wanted Fugitives list.

Finally in April 2016 Brazilian officials allowed Claudia Hoerig’s extradition to move forward and she was taken into custody. She was extradited to the United States and arrived at the Trumbull County Jail on the night of January 17 2018 to face charges of aggravated murder according to Youngstown CBS-affiliate WKBN-TV.

Claudia immediately confessed to shooting her husband but claimed she did it under emotional duress. She said Karl was controlling and abusive and that she became suicidal after suffering two miscarriages.

According to Claudia she had bought the murder weapon to die by suicide. On the morning of May 12 2007 she told Karl she was going to kill herself. She claimed he asked her to wait until he left and to do it in the basement so she didn’t splatter any blood on the walls.

“I got very angry. If he hadn’t said that I would be dead and he would be alive” Claudia told detectives in her videotaped interview obtained by “Snapped.”

At her murder trial in January 2019 Claudia took the stand in her own defense repeating her claims of emotional abuse allegations Karl’s family adamantly refuted.

Claudia claimed that after killing Karl she turned the gun on herself only to find it was out of bullets. Intending to reload the gun and finish the deed she called her family in Brazil who she said convinced her to flee to Brazil according to WKBN.

The murder weapon itself however contradicted her own story. “Obviously if you’re going to kill yourself you don’t need a laser sight to accomplish that goal” Yannucci said.

On January 25 2019 after a 12-year quest for justice it took just three hours of deliberations for the jury to find Claudia Hoerig guilty of aggravated murder according to local newspaper the Tribune Chronicle.

Claudia Hoerig was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 28 years. Now 57 she will first be eligible for parole in 2044.

Airport police arrested a 42-year old female for public intoxication after the flight crew contacted officers on the ground at Nashville International Airport around 7 p.m. an arrest affidavit said.

The flight took off from Fort Lauderdale at about 6 p.m. according to Spirit Airlines spokesperson Nicole Aguiar and FlightAware a flight tracking website.

When the plane arrived members of the crew told officers that she attacked two flight attendants punching one and pulling the other's hair.

Aguiar did not comment on details in the affidavit but said law enforcement officers removed ""a passenger for unruly behavior.""

""We do not tolerate aggressive behavior of any kind and this passenger is no longer welcome on any of our flights"" Aguiar said in an email.

When the passenger deplaned another passenger was restraining her feet with zip ties the affidavit said. She smelled of alcohol spoke in a slurred manner and her eyes were bloodshot. She told officers she drank ""a lot"" the affidavit said.

After police arrested her she yelled at the officers on several occasions using expletives and saying ""I didn't do anything wrong"" and ""shoot me"" according to the affidavit. The passenger also resisted getting into the police cruiser including by stiffening her legs to prevent officers from closing the door.

Davidson County Sheriff's Office jail logs show that she was admitted into jail on Saturday night at 8:40 p.m. but that she was released 6 a.m. Sunday.

""Thank you to our guests who assisted our crew and local law enforcement for their assistance"" Aguiar said in her email. ""We will work with the relevant authorities to ensure this individual is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

The affidavit said that the flight crew did not want to press charges against the passenger.

An email from Nashville International Airport spokesperson Kym Gerlock did not offer additional details beyond the information in the affidavit but Gerlock said ""the matter is under investigation.""

She starts Monday at the Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC working alongside retiring CEO Dirk Draper for about two weeks before taking over the top job Jan. 1. She has spent the past 2½ years as a management and leadership consultant after spending more than 20 years in economic development corporate communications and government affairs in her native Tennessee and Ohio mostly in Cincinnati a metro area more than twice the size of Colorado Springs.

""I wanted this job because of the opportunity. I like to be part of a winner and Colorado Springs is a growing region. I have worked in rural communities and major metro areas. All of these brought me to Colorado Springs at just the right time"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""I have built my career on regionalism and seeing El Paso County and Colorado Springs work so closely together is intriguing to me. I want to be part of a team that helps solve our growing pains.""

Julie Calvert CEO of the Cincinnati Convention and Visitors Bureau called Reeder Kleymeyer ""a transformative leader who is passionate about the community where she lives and works. She is a leader who gets involved and cares. When she is involved she gets things done. She also has the gift to grow people to make them their best selves but isn't the kind of person who tells you what you want to hear. She encourages people to lean in and hear more.""

Reeder Kleymeyer said she took the job ""looking for a greater quality of life in addition to a quality of career. I grew up in a much smaller area than Greater Cincinnati and welcome the challenge to grow the Colorado Springs (area). I sought the opportunity to be in a mid-size fast-growing region where I could greater influence change and make a difference in the community. I am an avid outdoors person and gain peace from nature so the West was calling and I answered. I have loved my time in Cincinnati. But it just cannot compete with the Colorado Springs mountain views.""

Brian Hodgett vice president of government and community affairs for Proctor & Gamble who worked with Reeder-Kleymeyer to spin off the economic development arm of the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber into a separate organization she later headed described her as ""a force of nature with a strong personality — when she walks into a room you know it. She is someone who leaders of both large and small companies see as someone they respect and could talk to.""

Reeder Kleymeyer described the chamber's application and interview process — a field of 170 candidates — as one of the most thorough of which she had been a part. She plans to spend her first year as CEO listening and learning about the chamber's legislative agenda and what local businesses need to continue recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Economic prosperity is the cornerstone for any chamber or economic development organization and I have no plans to alter that vision and mission — to be the No. 1 region to do business"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""Colorado Springs is not unique in its challenges. If you are going to have problems these are good ones to have. Any thriving region will face housing affordability traffic congestion and labor shortage issues. I've worked in communities that would love the national attention Colorado Springs enjoys for its outdoor lifestyle and strong military presence.""

Candace McGraw CEO of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport describes Reeder Kleymeyer as a ""strong leader and consensus builder who brings others along with her but makes sure they make it to the destination. She is a natural collaborator and connector who is one of those people who understand the power of working together using their people skills to drive to a positive result.""

Reeder Kleymeyer grew up in rural northwestern Tennessee before getting her degree in communications from University of Memphis. She returned to her hometown Union City to work for the Obion County Chamber of Commerce hoping to make a difference in the 30000-person county before heading the downtown development organization in Jackson Tenn. about 85 miles northeast of Memphis and several times the size of Obion County.

After six years in those two areas Reeder Kleymeyer moved with her family to Cincinnati where finding a job in her 20s proved difficult because she had no network of business contacts or friends. She was eventually hired to head government affairs for Kentucky at the United Way of Greater Cincinnati.

""United Way gave me a chance and allowed me to cut my teeth in government affairs designing legislation on early childhood education and other issues. I fell in love with the work"" she said.

However love doesn't pay the bills so Reeder Kleymeyer took a second job selling makeup at Dillard's. After nearly three years she was ready to move into a higher-paying job in the corporate world handling community affairs charitable giving and government affairs for Citibank in Ohio and Kentucky.

Citibank was a major donor to United Way and had more than 3000 employees in the Cincinnati area and the job taught her the importance of corporate citizenship. She also learned that nonprofits needed to be operated ""like a business to show a return on investment for those who were investing"" in the organization — in her case the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber.

""Having sat on that side of the table helped me to understand the value we need to bring to our members"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. An early mentor also told her she had more to learn — she needed to understand the business side of the company if she was going to advance to the C suite so she headed off to graduate school for two years while still working full-time to get a master's degree in business administration.

She stayed at Citibank for nearly five years before moving to grocery giant Kroger to head its national communications operations for labor contracts. She stayed there about a year before taking a communications post with Duke Energy for Kentucky and Ohio where she wrote press releases speeches and presentations for the company's president. After 1½ years she was promoted to vice president of community relations government affairs and economic development for the same two states.

""I got a better understanding of customer relations such as having the utility bill correct and the lights on. It helped me to understand what the customer needs"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""If I hadn't had the previous experience (in government affairs) I never would have gotten that opportunity to make the company's case about reliability and cost. It also allowed me to go deeper into the technical side of economic development.""

While at Duke Energy she served on the board of the chamber at the same time some business leaders wanted to split the group's economic development arm into a separate organization. She played a pivotal role in that effort and was hired to be the first president and CEO of the newly formed nonprofit the Regional Economic Development Initiative (REDI) Cincinnati helping attract keep and foster expansion of businesses with a staff of 25 and a $6 million annual budget. The Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC has a $4.1 million annual budget.

""We had a lot of success — we were the No. 1 performing area in Ohio for four consecutive years and were chosen by Site Selection magazine as one of the top five regions to do business. We created more than 2500 jobs"" in the nearly five years she spent with the group Reeder Kleymeyer said. During that time she helped the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport land service from Southwest Airlines the North American hub for Amazon's Prime Air unit and more than 175 other projects that produced billions of dollars of investment.

""Everybody likes to cut a ribbon for a new company but our most important client is the one that is already here"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""Most of your (economic development) wins come from expansions by existing businesses rather than from attracting new companies. Helping existing companies generally makes up 80% of your project wins so helping existing companies with their work force infrastructure and location needs is the first priority.""

Reeder Kelyemeyer left REDI after five years having accomplished all her goals and seeking more flexibility in her schedule. During the past three years she served as interim dean of the business school at Northern Kentucky University was executive vice president of Cincinnati-based health care software company AssureCare and was a member of the board of directors of Delta Dental of Kentucky while also operating her consulting business.

""When I left my first job I wanted to move to a bigger place. I have worked for Fortune 500 companies nonprofits and economic development organizations. Every opportunity has given me the skills I needed for the next opportunity all culminating in this opportunity in Colorado Springs"" Reeder Kleymeyer said. ""The mountains are what intrigued me (about the job) but once I met the people and felt (their) hospitality I was sold.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbXlub3J0aHdlc3QuY29tLzMyNTQ1NzcvZmFtZWQtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1pbmRpZ2Vub3VzLWFjdG9yLWRhdmlkLWd1bHBpbGlsLWRpZXMtYXQtNjgtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Famed Australian Indigenous actor David Gulpilil dies at 68,"CANBERRA Australia (AP) — Australia’s most acclaimed Indigenous actor David Gulpilil has died of lung cancer a government leader said on Monday. He was 68 years old.

Gulpilil found his widest audiences with his roles in the 1986 hit film “Crocodile Dundee” and in director Baz Luhrmann’s 2008 epic “Australia” in a career that spanned five decades. He was often described as a bridge between Indigenous Australia and the outside world who never fit comfortably in either place.

“It is with deep sadness that I share with the people of South Australia the passing of an iconic once-in-a-generation artist who shaped the history of Australian film and Aboriginal representation on screen” South Australia state Premier Steven Marshall said.

An accomplished didgeridoo player Gulpilil mixed with Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley. He was feted in New York and Paris. He also spent periods of his life as an itinerant drinking and sleeping in parks in the northern Australian city of Darwin and stints in prison for alcohol-fueled offenses.

Gulpilil was born on tribal land in the sparsely populated wilds of the Australian northern frontier in the early 1950s his friend and caregiver Mary Hood said. His date of birth was recorded as July 1 1953 a guesswork date set by local missionaries.

First contacts between Indigenous Australians and the outside world were becoming rare but continued in the remote Outback for another 30 years from the time of Gulpilil’s birth. Family groups followed in nomadic traditions unaware their land had been colonized by Britain two centuries earlier.

Gulpilil said he never saw a European Australian until he was 8 years old and considered English his sixth language his biographer Derek Rielly wrote. The other 13 were Indigenous dialects. Gulpilil’s Christian name was foisted upon him at school.

Gulpilil was a 16-year-old ceremonial dancer performing in the Indigenous mission of Maningrida in 1969 when he met British director Nicolas Roeg who was scouting for filming locations. Gulpilil starred in Roeg’s acclaimed 1971 movie “Walkabout” as a lone youth wandering the Outback as part of a tribal rite of passage who comes across and rescues two lost British children. The British siblings were played by a teenage Jenny Agutter who later found fame in Hollywood and the director’s 7-year-old son Lucien.

Roles followed in popular movies “Storm Boy” in 1976 and “The Last Wave” in 1977.

His final role was the remake of “Storm Boy” in 2019 in which he played the father of the central character in the original Fingerbone Bill.

Gulpilil recalled learning to binge on alcohol and drugs from counter-culture icon Dennis Hopper who played the starring role in the 1976 movie about a nineteenth-century Australian outlaw “Mad Dog Morgan.” The 22-year-old Indigenous actor had third billing on the film after Hopper and Jack Thompson a stalwart in Australian cinema.

Gulpilil won multiple best-actor awards for the 2002 Rolf de Herr-directed movie “The Tracker” in which he played one of the many Indigenous men that Australian police routinely used as trackers of fugitives in the Outback.

Weeks before the movie was released journalists visited him in the small Indigenous community of Ramingining on his crocodile-infested tropical tribal land. He was living in a hut with his then-partner Indigenous painter Robyn Djunginy without power or running water.

They cooked kangaroo meat and fish over an open fire beneath a scrap iron roof. Hunting spears were slung from a rafter and Gulpilil kept a wooden Indigenous fighting club known as a nulla nulla for self-protection.

“I was brought up in a tin shed. I wandered all over the world — Paris New York — now I’m back in a tin shed” Gulpilil said.

He presented himself as a victim of his own celebrity and his own people’s misunderstanding of his position in the wider world.

“People say to me: You’re a big name. You have money. Why don’t you buy yourself a house; get out of Ramingining?” he said.

“This is my country. I belong here and I’m broke” he added.

Exactly why he was broke was not clear. He was vague about how much he earned over the years and wealth in Australian Indigenous society is communal tending to permeate through relatives and friends.

Back then Gulpilil liked to drink beer smoke marijuana and take kava. But because all three were banned in Ramingining he avoided some of the temptations of city life excesses.

Gulpilil’s friend and caregiver Hood first met him in 2006 at the Darwin premiere of “Ten Canoes” the first feature-length movie in an Australian Indigenous language.

Gulpilil narrated the movie and his son Jamie Gulpilil was part of the cast that was mostly drawn from Ramingining.

“When I first met him I saw a real kindness” Hood said. She acknowledged there was also a “dark” side.

A Darwin judge sentenced Gulpilil in 2011 to a year in prison for breaking the arm of his then-partner indigenous artist Miriam Ashley during a drunken argument in a Darwin home. He used his time in prison to turn his life away from alcohol and cannabis.

Hood regularly visited Gulpilil in prison. He was released to live with her and for a time Ashley at Hood’s Darwin home while on parole. He eventually followed Hood to Murray Bridge in South Australia state 3500 kilometers (2200 miles) from Ramingining and his traditional country.

Hood became his caregiver after he was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer in 2017.

He is survived by his sisters Mary and Evonne daughters Makia and Phoebe and sons Jamie and Jida. Director Peter Weir said during an interview in New York in 1977 while promoting his supernatural thriller “The Last Wave” that Gulpilil had created untold personal tensions by straddling two disparate cultures.

“He’s enigmatic. He’s an actor a dancer a musician. He’s a tribal man initiated in the tribal ways” Weir said. “He has a foot in both cultures. It’s an enormous strain on the man.”

Starbuck Island connects Green Island to downtown Troy and is now home to nearly 270 residential units a salon a restaurant and parking.

“The transformation of Starbuck Island into a new engaging waterfront neighborhood is a testament to the state’s brownfield cleanup program and economic development incentives” Hochul said. “With the project now complete residents and visitors to the newest community on the Hudson River can enjoy the many amenities spectacular views and local businesses spurring additional investments to the region.”

“In my almost 20 years as Mayor of the Village of Green Island I have to say that the development of Starbuck Island has been the most transformative change to our community” Green Island governor Ellen McNulty-Ryan added. “Peter Luizzi made a very brave move two years ago to purchase and remediate this property and turn it into the premier waterfront location in the Capital District. I am grateful for his vision and commitment to this project. I am also grateful to everyone who helped make this a reality from those in New York State and County government to our local government. It just goes to show you what can be accomplished when we all work together.”

Construction began in November 2018 upon approval of plans to clean up the site under the Department of Environmental Conservation’s Brownfield Cleanup Program. A comprehensive cleanup under DEC oversight included soil removal and groundwater treatment conducted on a parallel track with the redevelopment to help transform this former petroleum storage and distribution terminal into a riverfront economic asset. In Round VII of the Regional Council initiative Starbuck Island was designated a priority project for the Capital Region Economic Development Council and was awarded a nearly $1.8 million Empire State Development grant.

“Creating access to our waterfronts and breathing new life to blighted former brownfields are transformational steps in revitalizing communities around New York State. Strategic investments in mixed-use projects like Starbuck Island reflects our commitment to placemaking as a pillar of long-term and sustainable economic growth” said ESD Acting Commissioner and President and CEO-designate Hope Knight.

In addition to the apartments commercial space and parking Starbuck Island has a 31-boat slip marina that includes rental slips an amphitheater and promenade open to the community and pedestrian connections that encompass the entire island. These public-use elements plus the construction of a stone seawall for protection were supported by the ESD grant. Located just over the Green Island Bridge Starbuck Island is a short walk to downtown Troy’s many restaurants shops and entertainment; minutes away from Sage College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and an easy commute to neighboring hub cities and towns.

The Starbuck Island project complements the region’s economic development strategies by promoting the adaptive reuse of a once-blighted and abandoned property and creating a vibrant engaging communities that catalyze new investments and welcome new residents.

“Starbuck Island is a great example of how New York State is helping revitalize communities by transforming former industrial sites into productive economic engines. DEC’s Brownfield Cleanup Program and the State’s Regional Economic Development Council are working together in Green Island and other communities along the Hudson River and across the state to create jobs and opportunities while protecting the environment and public health” DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos said.

The Starbuck name dates back to the 19th century when Nathaniel and George Starbuck opened an iron foundry on the island in 1821. Initially Starbuck Brothers Foundry manufactured cast iron stoves before expanding production and services. In the early 20th century the site was cleared and served as an oil terminal until 2008. With plans to further develop the area Luizzi Companies purchased the abandoned and contaminated land in 2017 with a vision to tackle 200 years of industrial pollution and to develop a resort-style community with easy access to Green Island’s thriving town center and downtown Troy.

“The Starbuck Island redevelopment project is truly the beautiful centerpiece of the collaborative effort between Luizzi Companies and New York State to revitalize this waterfront property. This connective project has breathed new life into a once-blighted area island transforming it into a place where people are excited to live and work. I am grateful to Governor Hochul for her dedication to creating economic opportunity and for the investments by Empire State Development and the Department of Environmental Conservation to support the future of the Capital Region” State Sen. Neil Breslin said

“Congratulations to Mayor Ellen McNulty-Ryan and the Green Island team for the great work to transform this once long-forgotten oil storage facility laden with brownfield contamination into a whole new residential and commercial community now known as Starbuck Island. I am pleased to join Governor Hochul as once again state resources were strategically invested to address shoreline issues but more importantly to clean up this forgotten wasteland for a better use – not only for Green Island but also the Capital Region. Starbuck Island is a shining example of how Brownfield Tax credits along with a private developer such as Peter Luizzi can work with the community for the benefit of all” State Assemblyman John McDonald III added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjgvYm9va3MtYWRhbS1icm90bWFucy10b3AtcmVhZHMtaW5jbHVkZS1ob3dhcmQtc2NodWx0ei1hbmQtcGhpbC1rbmlnaHQuaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzExLzI4L2Jvb2tzLWFkYW0tYnJvdG1hbnMtdG9wLXJlYWRzLWluY2x1ZGUtaG93YXJkLXNjaHVsdHotYW5kLXBoaWwta25pZ2h0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 4 business books everyone should read according to this former Starbucks executive,"Catch Adam Brotman during a rare moment of downtime and he will almost always have a book in his hand. ""I love reading and try to do it as often as I can"" the former chief digital officer and EVP of global retail operations at Starbucks tells CNBC Make It. Brotman spent nearly a decade building Starbucks's rewards program and digital platforms including its mobile payment and mobile order features. After leaving Starbucks in 2018 the Seattle native served a short stint as J.Crew's president and co-CEO before joining the Seattle-based (and Starbucks-backed) startup Brightloom as its CEO. At Brightloom Brotman and his team are building software to help smaller businesses use tools like digital ordering and personalized marketing a mission Brotman refers to as his ""life's work."" Starbucks licensed its mobile and loyalty program technology to Brightloom — the same technology Brotman helped develop during his tenure at the coffee giant — so its customers can use it for their own businesses. Throughout his career Brotman says he's always sought guidance and inspiration from books to challenge his worldview and guide his decision-making. ""But I almost exclusively read non-fiction business books"" he adds. Here are some of his favorite reads:

'The Antisocial Network'

By Ben Mezrich Mezrich is one of Brotman's favorite authors. He's written 20 books exploring the intersections between technology finance and risk-taking. 'Antisocial Network' is no different. It tells a gripping account of the January 2021 GameStop short squeeze where a group of private investors and users on Reddit took down a Wall Street hedge fund. ""Mezrich's books often tackle the theme of taking on the system modern versions of David and Goliath"" Brotman says. ""The reason I love 'Antisocial Network' is because I learned a ton and it's not just educational it also has a cinematic page-turning appeal to it.""

'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People'

By Stephen Covey This 1989 classic is one of the most popular leadership books in the United States and can be found on the bookshelves of presidents and CEOs. Covey outlines a step-by-step approach to improving both your personal and professional life with tips on time management positive thinking and more. After his death in 2012 Covey's sons Sean and Stephen have continued to share his teachings on the author's social media channels and through FranklinCovey a global consulting organization. Sean once shared his best leadership advice with CNBC Make It: learn all the requirements of your job then figure out how to go beyond those responsibilities. ""What you can do today is to understand what's expected of you in your role in the organization and how your values skills and abilities line up with those expectations"" he said. ""Then see how you could make the biggest difference in your current role."" ""I've carried Covey's guiding principles with me and used them my entire life"" Brotman says adding that his favorite lesson from the book is ""first seek to understand then to be understood.""

By Phil Knight Nike's billionaire co-founder Phil Knight details how he turned Nike into a brand worth over $30 billion in this memoir. ""This is the book you need to pick up if you're looking to be inspired"" Brotman says. ""It really is this incredible story of entrepreneurial determination and vision."" Knight co-founded Nike with his former University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman in 1963 under the name Blue Ribbon Sports. In those early days he would travel to track meets and sell shoes from the trunk of his car. In 2016 Knight told CNBC's Jim Cramer that building Nike was the most fun he ever had even if people doubted his ability to succeed. ""We knew we could fail we just didn't think we would"" he said. ""We loved doing what we were doing and we loved each other.""

DeKALB – The last time Wheaton North won a state title in football was 35 years ago.

Some of those players now fathers themselves were in the stands to see the next entry in Falcons lore cemented.

The Falcons behind a dominant overall team performance rolled to a 35-6 victory over St. Rita in the Class 7A state title game Saturday at Northern Illinois University’s Huskie Stadium.

“[Those dads] had our backs the whole way” Falcons coach Joe Wardynski said. “We’ve talked about trying to do something like this. We’ve had the same three state titles on our press box for all these years...now we can add 2021 to it.”

The Falcons’ journey to the finish line can be traced back to the shortened spring season where they defeated Batavia to close it out on that same Huskie Stadium turf.

Months later in September the Falcons lost to the Bulldogs in overtime the third week of the season.

They didn’t lose another game marching through Larkin Hoffman Estates Willowbrook and Brother Rice in the postseason to vie for the title.

“...From that point on we kind of re-focused ourselves I felt like and started playing better team football” Wardynski said. “[Saturday] was sort of a microcosm of the season in the fact that we were backed up a few times early on and instead of giving up a score we forced [two] field goal [attempts] and fortunately they didn’t convert on those. Offensively we started putting things together.”

The Falcons took a 21-0 lead into the half which was capped by a 28-yard fumble return for a touchdown by senior Trent Gabriele at the buzzer.

St. Rita opened the game with two missed field goals from 36 and 39 yards respectively. Falcons quarterback Mark Forcucci (14 for 22 302 yards 2 touchdowns) later found Seth Kortenhoeven for a 38-yard touchdown for the initial 7-0 advantage to open the second quarter.

Wheaton North later forced a turnover-on-downs with 5:37 left in the half and turned it into a Forcucci touchdown to Casey Morrison who was wide open down the sideline roughly one minute later for the 14-0 lead.

Kortenhoeven finished with a team-high seven catches for 158 yards and a touchdown.

The Falcons defense led by Rex Kroger Ross Dansdill Chuck Neidballa and others handled their end of the bargain too.

St. Rita (11-3) runner-ups in a title game for the second consecutive season with a state series was limited to 261 yards of total offense.

“That ‘bend-but-don’t-break’ thing is something we pride ourselves in” said Dansdill who finished with eight tackles. “...We like to call it ‘swarm to the football’. All that [means] is busting butts to the ball and just no matter what happens get there.”

“We pick each other up” Kroger added. “When one person misses we’ve got four more guys there to make the play. That’s what we’ve done all year and that’s how we’ve been successful.”

In the second half after Forcucci was intercepted the Mustangs eventually cashed in on the rare mistake with an 11-yard rushing score from quarterback Tommy Ulatowski. The extra point ricocheted off the upright preserving the 21-6 Wheaton North lead with 3:38 left in the third quarter.

Ulatowski went 17 for 36 with 189 yards and one interception.

St. Rita would get no closer as Luke Beedle’s two rushing scores helped clinch the Wheaton North win.

Beedle earned significant reps in the regular season after three-year starter Brayton Maske injured his knee in Week 6. Maske returned in the semifinal victory vs. Brother Rice but suffered another injury and didn’t appear in the state final.

Beedle and Walker Owens picked up their workhorse regardless.

“Maske teaches me everything I know” Beedle said following his 65-yard performance. “He’s been a great leader; great friend and having him by my side the whole game he’s always treating me [well]. Great person. Great player and he makes me better every day.”

Mustangs coach Todd Kuska credited the Falcons for taking advantage of their opportunities but was “just so proud” of his team for “fighting through everything for the last few years they’ve been here.”

“For these seniors this is back-to-back state championship trips. I know it didn’t end the way we wanted to but [there’s] a lot to be proud of for these guys” Kuska said. “Hats off to Wheaton North on a great football game but I just couldn’t be prouder of our guys.”

Ohio State recruit Kaleb Brown who returned for the postseason after missing virtually the entire nine-game regular season was overall grounded for 128 receiving yards on eight catches and only 20 rushing yards.

“...Just excited the way my team as a whole fought back after me going down” Brown said. “It’s not that easy to bare as a team...Kudos to them. I mean I wouldn’t be where I’m at if it wasn’t for them. It just means a lot to me [for my return]. I soaked it up on the field as much as I could. I kind of just tried to leave it all on the field as best as I could.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF1Z3VzdGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9oaXN0b3J5LzIwMjEvMTEvMjgvbW91bHRyaWUtY3JlZWstaG9sZHMta2V5cy1zdC1hdWd1c3RpbmUtZmxvcmlkYS1oaXN0b3J5LXNlbWlub2xlLXdhci10cmVhdHktcGFyay84NzM2Mjk4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Augustine's history: Moultrie Creek holds key to city's past,"Every day thousands of people cross a nondescript bridge on U.S. 1 south of St. Augustine over Moultrie Creek. But not many know the rich history of the creek that runs west into the Intracoastal Waterway.

The creek named after Gen. John Moultrie the English governor of Florida in 1777 is the site of statewide historical events and was once a thriving community.

Treaty of Moultrie Creek

On Sept. 18 1823 two years after Florida was transferred from Spain to the United States territorial Gov. William Duval and government representative James Gadsden met with the Seminole tribe leaders on the banks of the creek to sign a peace treaty ending the First Seminole War.

The document called the Treaty of Moultrie Creek relocated the Seminole to a 4 million-acre reservation in central Florida in exchange for them giving up claims to all other lands in the state.

St. Johns County's Treaty Park on Wildwood Drive commemorates the signing and is near the event's location.

In 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act to force all Native Americans including the Seminoles to move west of the Mississippi River.

The Seminoles resisted the move so Jackson authorized the use of force resulting in the Second Seminole War in 1835. Seminoles and U.S. soldiers clashed throughout the state and lost around 4600 men between the two.

Susan Parker:St. Augustine Historical Society marked key sites as first projects in 1890s

In October 1837 Gen. Thomas Jesup who was in charge of the U.S. forces in the state proposed a truce and invited a Seminole leader called Osceola to negotiate terms. Osceola and 81 other Seminoles traveled to the St. Augustine area for peace talks.

Meeting with a U.S. general under a white flag on Oct. 21 Osceola and his followers were captured south of an outpost called Fort Payton near the banks of Moultrie Creek. The site of the capture is marked by a plaque in the Fort Payton community on Wildwood Drive.

After their capture the Seminoles were taken to St. Augustine and imprisoned in the Castillo de San Marcos then called Fort Marion before being moved to South Carolina where Osceola died.

'Moultrie is not just a body of water'

For local historian and author Beth Rogero Bowen Moultrie Creek is a fascinating place. Bowen Flagler College history graduate and former president of the St. Augustine Historical Society has been researching the creek's history for a long time.

""Moultrie is not just a body of water"" Bowen said ""it was a community connected but separate from St. Augustine. Hundred years ago it was not as easy to get to town as it is now so these little communities had their own identity.

""Starting from after the Civil War but it really came active from the 1910s through the 1920s. There was a big poultry farm here turpentine camps a winery called the Ponce de Leon Winery that made wine for Henry Flagler's hotels"" she said. ""There were two grammar schools here a school for Black people and one for white people and a post office.""

Where history lives:St. Augustine Saints the city's minor league baseball team played its own World Series

The community also had its own Chamber of Commerce and telephone exchange.

When St. Augustine's Bridge of Lions opened in 1927 people from the community entered a float advertising ""Moultrie for Better Poultry."" The float won first place.

The area was also known for its moonshine.

""There was a lot of moonshine and some rough people that lived out here"" Bowen said. ""At the time this was the county.""

According to Bowen the Moultrie area was a getaway destination for people from St Augustine. People would drive or boat out from town for a day trip. Her collection features postcards from the 1910s showing little palm-thatched cottages for picnics.

A popular location for picnickers today is Lewis Point in the St. Augustine South community on the north side of Moultrie Creek. The point is named for Albert Lewis a wealthy businessman from Pennsylvania who lived in St. Augustine in the winter and owned a large amount of land in the area. Lewis Point road still connects Old Moultrie Road to the South.

One important building from the community in the 1900s is still very visible today. On the southwest corner of the bridge crossing the creek on U.S. 1 is the former office of Dr. Frank Genung a local dentist. The building now a furniture store was once at the center of Moultrie life.

""His dentist office was upstairs and downstairs was a small store gas station and post office"" Bowen said. ""That's where you voted; it is where you got your news.

""What was life for someone living on Moultrie Creek in the 1920s? I think they had a lot of fun. They swam in the creek. They fished they had dances they all knew each other. The people in the community were very social in the 1910s '20s and '30s"" she said.

As roads improved and St. Augustine expanded outward Moultrie gradually became less distinct but it is still important for Bowen to remember the community.

""The people of Moultrie are part of what made the county what it is today"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9saXZlLXZpZGVvLWF1ZGlvLW5vb24tc3Qtam9obi1zLWJlbWlkamktc3RhdGUtbmNhYS1mb290YmFsbC1wbGF5b2Zmcy82MDAxMjA5ODcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Live at noon and 1 p.m.: St. John's Bemidji State in NCAA football playoffs,"Watch or listen to today's game between St. John's and Linfield in the second round of the NCAA Division III playoffs.

NCAA Division II playoff bracket

A lot has changed for St. John's quarterback Chris Backes in the past month.

The senior from St. Cloud has gone from having never started a game during his four seasons with the Johnnies to being elevated to the starter after a season-ending injury to Aaron Syverson.

One thing that hasn't changed is Backes' approach.

""As a backup you prepare every week for the possibility that you might play"" Backes said. ""So not much has changed. Everyone around me has stepped up their performance to help me. We do a great job in practice during the week to get ready.""

In four starts Backes has directed the Johnnies to four victories — one over Bethel in the MIAC championship game and another over Lake Forest last Saturday in the first round of the Division III playoffs.

Backes who appeared in all 27 of the Johnnies' games during the 2018 and 2019 seasons completed 14 of 16 passes and threw four touchdown passes in his first career start — against St. Scholastica on Oct. 30.

In the 41-14 playoff victory over Lake Forest he also threw four touchdown passes. In his four starts he has completed 60.7% of his passes and thrown 11 touchdown passes.

""We have a lot of great receivers on the outside ... Ravi Alston is great"" Backes said ""and we have great running backs like Devin Vouk and Henry Trost for me to be able to hand the ball off to.""

On Saturday the Johnnies (11-0) will play host to Linfield (10-0) in the second round of the D-III playoffs. St. John's announced Friday that defensive coordinator Jerry Haugen will be the acting head coach for the Johnnies in that game. A school news release on Monday said that coach Gary Fasching had tested positive for COVID-19 and entered protocols.

The Johnnies and Linfield are meeting for the first time since 2003. The Johnnies have won all three meetings — all in the postseason — between the two.

Linfield defeated Redlands 44-10 last Saturday at home in McMinnville Ore. to advance.

Linfield quarterback Wyatt Smith the two-time Northwest Conference Offensive Player of the Year has completed 69.8% of his passes for 3002 yards and 37 touchdowns this season. He has thrown just four interceptions in 351 attempts.

The Wildcats are averaging 51.9 points per game — third in D-III.

""It's challenging to prepare for a team that you haven't seen"" said Backes. ""You have to study a lot of film to look for tendencies and trust what you see.""

The winner of Saturday's game will advance to the D-III quarterfinals where it'll play the winner of the game between Mary Hardin-Baylor and Birmingham Southern.

St. James won their second consecutive state title by beating Andover Central 28-21.

Central finishes the season 11-2.

""These are a great group of young men who fought their hearts out today"" Andover Central head coach Derek Tuttle said. ""It just didn't work out today. Credit to St. James.""

It appeared the game was going to go in Central's favor as Mason White intercepted a pass on the game's opening drive to set up the Jaguars in fantastic field position. The Jaguars only needed six played to punch it into the end zone on a 3-yard run by senior Ashton Barkdull.

After Kai Kunz threw an interception the Jaguars blocked a 35-yard field goal attempt by St. James. They would then march down the field in 10 plays churning up 4½ minutes of the clock. Barkdull punched in his second touchdown on the afternoon with another 2-yard run giving Central a 14-0 lead with 7:40 remaining in the half.

The Thunder (9-4) never wavered. They kept their cool and eventually things broke in their direction. They responded on the ensuing drive when they faked a punt from Blake Boydson to Tyler Claiborne for the new set of downs. Then House found Tiave Watts on a 51-yard strike that saw Watts bob and wave through the Central secondary for the score and to cut the Jag's lead in half.

St. James then blocked the punt of Central on the next drive. A holding penalty killed the drive after a big run by Kunz. The holding call was for only 10 yards but in high school football the foul is from the spot of the infraction making it essentially a 16-yard penalty. The Jaguars could never recover and the punt was blocked on the net play.

""We shot ourselves in the foot at times and those make it hard to overcome"" Tuttle said. ""Just in the fourth you know second half we just didn't respond as many times we need to.""

Central finished with eight penalties for 82 yards. Four of the penalties were unsportsmanlike infractions.

The Thunder converted two third downs and a fourth down and Watts punched it in for the tie right before halftime at 14-all.

Barkdull had himself a game finishing with 123 yards on 21 carries and scoring three touchdowns. Any time they needed a down it was his hard running that kept the Jaguars in it.

He was rewarded once again in the third quarter. After Kunz scrambled on a fourth down to pick up the first down by a hair it was Barkdull that would barrel his way into the end zone for the 21-14 Central lead with 4:39 remaining in the third.

From then on it would be a Thunder difference.

House found Claiborne on a 25-yard strike for the game-tying score and then he would run in a touchdown on the next drive for the go-ahead score.

""The way our kids came out and just fought so hard"" Tuttle said. ""They've been doing that the whole time in the playoffs and so that's what we need to do to stay in it and we're close.""

Central was able to stop St. James with 4:40 remaining but they eventually would turn it over on downs.

For Central this run ends for those seniors who have won 30 games over the last three seasons. They've been to two state title games (2019) and many of them have been starting for the last three seasons. Some like Drew Daniels have been starting since his freshman season.

""We've known since about seventh grade we had a chance to be really special"" senior defensive end Isaac Sheeran said. ""I couldn't ask for a better team couldn't ask for a better group of brothers to play for. They're the reason we come out here every day in practice every day it's for them it's for each other. It's not any one individual person.""

Central had unfinished business this season after being upset by eventual state runner-up Arkansas City last season. They were locked in and with transfer quarterback Kunz Central rushed through their schedule and set up this state title bout.

""We're looking like we had an empty hole quarterback spot and he [Kai Kunz] filled that perfectly"" Sheeran said. ""It took a couple games for him to get used to the way we run things. That fit perfectly.""

It's more than just the quarterback. This close-knit senior team has pushed everyone to be better and you've seen it in their productions int he playoffs. They rolled through the playoffs.

""It's all team work"" Barkdull said. ""A lot of us and doing track and we hate to lose. We are always pushing each other and making sure we are pushing each other.""

Over the last three years the Jaguars didn't lose much only four losses since 2019.

While there will be holes to fill next season the Jaguars are appreciating where they reached and as a public school what they they were able to accomplish.

""We're proud of what we did"" Barkdull said. ""We were one of the closest teams from our side of the state in years.""

It's the closest 4A state title game since Buhler won in 2013.

""I couldn't ask for a better team and community"" Sheeran said. ""It has been a blessing ever since we came here from Washington state.""

SPRINGFIELD NJ — T-Mobile Northeast put forth an application to upgrade its facility and provide improved service at Springfield’s Planning Board meeting on Monday Nov. 15.

In the application T-Mobile Northeast’s attorney Frank Ferraro of Ferraro & Stamos explained during the virtual meeting that the site plan waiver would be for the T-Mobile Northeast cell phone tower on Tooker Avenue in Springfield.

“T-Mobile has 10 antennas up on the tower right now at a height of 150 feet. The tower is existing at 158 1/2 feet” Ferraro said during the meeting. “In this application T-Mobile is looking to swap out three existing antennas on existing mounts with three new antennas. Those three new antennas will actually be shorter than the ones they replace and there’s an existing equipment cabinet on the ground. T-Mobile is looking to add two additional equipment cabinets next to it within their existing lease area for a total of three in order to upgrade their facility and provide improved service to this area of the township.”

Engineer Anthony Cristiano from French & Parrello Associates also attended the virtual meeting to confirm that none of the proposed upgrades would have a substantial change to the existing facility and that they meet the necessary requirements to be carried out.

“We did submit a structural analysis indicating that the tower can support the upgrade and we also have a signed and sealed letter from French & Parrello Associates the project engineer” said Ferraro. “It’s their opinion that the board could comfortably grant the requested site plan waiver.”

Board engineer Mike Disko agreed that the application met the state statute and is within their code.

“Everything that Mr. Ferraro just talked about is very common. As technology increases they swap them out. That’s what we’re doing here” said Disko at the meeting. “Allocation standards are very clear. He’s working within his confines of the equipment field. It’s located behind the firehouse so this is not private and it’s really our property. This is very standard and we get about one or two of these a year.”

Ferraro requested a waiver of resolution for this application. The board had no issues with the application and all members approved the application. The motion was passed by all members.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcGVjb2R0aW1lcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExLzI3L3dlbGxmbGVldC1saWJyYXJ5LWdldHMtZ3JhbnQtaG90c3BvdHMtYW5kLWNocm9tZWJvb2tzLzg3MjgwMDgwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keeping connected: Wellfleet Library gets grant for hotspots and Chromebooks,"WELLFLEET — Library patrons will soon have access to four Chromebook laptops and portable hotspots on a two-week circulating basis according to library director Jennifer Wertkin.

Wertkin was successful in getting a grant approved through the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Emergency Connectivity Fund a $7.17 billion program designed to help libraries and schools provide tools and services needed for remote learning and working during the pandemic.

The Emergency Connectivity Fund is part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

Wertkin said she received word two weeks ago that her grant application had been approved. It will cover the cost of four Chromebooks and the roughly $800 per month service charge for 20 Verizon hotspots for one year. The grant is renewable for three years.

The hotspots are puck-size round plastic discs that can be charged and used to provide portable Wi-Fi. Library patrons can use them anywhere as long as they are charged up.

“During this time where it's been hard to get to places where you could use Wi-Fi or where you’ve had to work from home or go to school from home or if you’ve been unwell and had to quarantine you could still connect with the hot spot” Wertkin said.

The Wellfleet Library Board of Trustees had decided to pay for the monthly service charge for the hotspots when the pandemic first caused schools libraries and businesses to close down. But the service fee would have been unsustainable Wertkin said. Now the library and its patrons can count on the Connectivity Fund grant to continue the coverage.

Opinion:When it comes to high-speed internet Cape Codders are people too

The library also has 20 T-Mobile hot spots courtesy of the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners. Those hotspots aren’t as reliable as the Verizon hotspots according to Wertkin.

“If you have T-Mobile and your cellphone doesn’t get good reception the hotspot won’t work well either” she said.

There are coverage gaps in any town that lies within the National Seashore Wertkin said. “There are places where even Verizon hotspots won’t work” she said.

Wertkin believes that broadband and the ability to connect to the internet is 100% necessary in this day and age. “This pandemic has shown us that more than ever” she said. ""Programs like these are trying to remedy that. This is something vital to the everyday functioning of everyday society.”

Wertkin expects to receive the Chromebooks before the end of the year. They will be available for two-weeks at a time. So will the hotspots. The hotspots are already flying off the shelves. Wertkin said she will look for funding opportunities to get more if that’s what people want.

A patron left a note thanking the library staff for providing the hotspots. Wertkin said the woman wrote that the service saved her life and saved her job.

“Connectivity is a basic right” Wertkin said.

Legions of fans come to Vegas Golden Knights games to T-Mobile Arena to cheer for their team — the Golden Knights. Sometimes the Knights’ foes have their own fans too inside the venue on the Strip. For example you will see some fans at the hockey arena wearing Edmonton Oilers sweaters at today’s VGK vs Oilers game at the arena.

But during this VGK season a small fraction of people attend Golden Knights games to root for their own team and think National Hockey League games at a sports arena are a good place for political chants.

At Golden Knights games the “Let’s go Brandon” chant has been heard at VGK home contests at T-Mobile Arena. It’s a euphemistic chant that’s code for “Fuck you Joe Biden.”

But there’s more than just chants.

People have chosen Golden Knights games to apply “Let’s go Brandon” stickers on towel dispensers inside bathrooms at Golden Knights games.

Steve McInelly of Las Vegas who attends many Golden Knights games with his wife said “The Brandon chant is best just to be ignored but now I’ve seen stickers that’s stuck on paper towel dispensers in the men’s rooms. The chant as stupid as it is is one thing. But the vandalism with the stickers in the arena is worse than the chant.”

On Saturday night at a college basketball game LVSportsBiz.com found these stickers inside two bathrooms in the arena’s upper bowl. The stickers have been there at least a week since the VGK vs Columbus game Nov. 20.

And another person at Golden Knights games was so upset about a Let’s go Brandon reference at the “NHL Fights Cancer” night on Nov. 20 when the Knights hosted the Columbus Blue Jackets that he made this post on Twitter.

Golden Knights fan Leo Garcia who attends VGK games at T-Mobile Arena said “Somebody writing ‘let go brandon’ on . . . on the cancer card shows zero compassion or human decency for those who are fighting or who have lost their battle with cancer.”

The Vegas Golden Knights play at T-Mobile Arena where signs are allowed at events only if the sign’s content is relevant to the particular event.

But arena ushers and security failed to take immediate action when two people displayed a Trump flag at a Golden Knights game at T-Mobile Arena earlier this season.

VGK fan Garcia who snapped this photo of the Trump sign display told LVSportsBiz.com “I did not see anybody approach them and they had the flag up at least a few minutes.”

McInelly also vented his frustration on a Facebook fan site about some fans who chanted “USA USA USA” during the Canadian national anthem that was performed before a Vancouver Canucks vs Golden Knights game Nov. 13.

“It’s extremely disrespectful. Canada is our neighbor. Why be disrespectful?” McInelly told LVSportsBiz.com. “At the end of the day I just want the Golden Knights to win and get home safe.” McInelly noted that many of the Golden Knights players are from Canada.

LVSportsBiz.com presented these issues to the Vegas Golden Knights and requested the team’s response.

We have not received any response. But if we get one we will share it.

It should be noted that Golden Knights owner Bill Foley supported former President Donald Trump. According to ESPN Foley contributed nearly $1 million to Trump and Republican Party candidates and causes from 2018-2020.

LVSportsBiz.com covers sports events at Las Vegas Raiders and UNLV football games at Allegiant Stadium UNLV basketball games at Thomas & Mack Center and boxing matches at various arenas in Las Vegas and have not heard the Brandon slogan chanted by people at venues. Why at Vegas Golden Knights home games?

McInelly spoke for many when he said he would like the Golden Knights games to be free of political statements.

“Maybe one day we can actually get along in life without all the political horse shit that we are all fed daily” he said."

Simply sign up to the Private equity myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Historically low interest rates and high stock valuations are driving return-hungry investors to rush into private markets with non-publicly listed assets under management expected to rise 60 per cent between 2020 and 2025.

Alternatives — a category of unlisted assets that include private equity private debt hedge funds real estate infrastructure and natural resources — are set to surpass $17tn in AUM within the next four years. Private equity and private debt will be the main drivers of this growth according to data provider Preqin.

“Because of lower rates clients are ready to give up some liquidity to get a higher return” said Cyril Marie chief financial officer and head of strategy at Natixis Investment Managers.

This boom in demand has spurred consolidation in the sector including the recent purchase of Oak Hill Advisors by Baltimore-based asset manager T Rowe Price.

The private capital industry has grown to exceed $7tn in the past few years. Projected growth is expected to be strongest in Asia with Preqin citing low penetration rates and fast GDP growth as attractive factors.

Preqin’s forecasting model draws on historical AUM data across asset classes and regions along with fundraising and deals and various macroeconomic data. The data provider said its 2025 estimate was supported by questionnaires asking for the expectations and intentions of investors and fund managers.

Lesser volatility and opacity in private markets can also be attractive for investors. “With a listed asset the day after lockdown you’ve lost 40 per cent whereas with a non-listed asset there is less volatility so the perception of risk is smaller” said Natixis’ Marie who added that “in reality it is the same risk fundamentally”.

Bruce Hamilton an analyst at Morgan Stanley said that even wealthy investors with traditionally low allocation to private assets are planning on adding to their positions in part due to “product innovation and new distribution platforms”.

Private equity and private debt are expected to grow 15.6 per cent and 11.4 per cent a year respectively up to 2025. Other alternatives are projected to grow 5 per cent or less annually. Private equity has been the strongest performing and least volatile alternative asset class since 2008 according to the consultancy McKinsey.

Private debt has evolved “from a niche product” at the turn of the century to the “mainstream” according to JPMorgan. Two-thirds of its assets are invested in North America and one-third in Europe.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou analyst at JPMorgan said one of the reasons private debt has grown in Europe is that banks “stepped back from loan creation” after the euro debt crisis allowing room for private debt markets such as direct lending funds to flourish.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's well-known that the Grand Theft Auto series is a satire of America and thus humor and being edgy is part of the DNA of the franchise. However Rockstar Games co-founder Jamie King thinks this could change going forward starting with GTA 6.

Now it's unclear who King remains in contact with at the company but there's no word of this prediction being based on any type of inside knowledge. Whatever the case King thinks the company could be different going forward due to more than one contributing factor including the massive success of GTA 5 and GTA Online and the notable departures the company has suffered the last few years. That said King has a hard time imagining things changing so much that it would result in Rockstar messing up the machine it has created.

""I wouldn't be surprised if the tone starts changing and if it's maybe not quite as edgy or quite as funny"" said King. ""I just think maybe there's more opportunity for them to do something cheesy cause they never do. Maybe not right? Again there's a beautiful machine there that you'd have to try really hard to f**k up to screw up. I just look at the success of [GTA] 5 and [GTA] Online and [Red Dead] Redemption 2 and I think that there just going to be fine. But I think culturally internally both at [Rockstar] North and [Rockstar] New York they are missing Leslie [Benzies] and Dan [Houser]. Yeah there's a difference for sure.""

Again how much of this is pure and utter speculation versus a take based on some level of insight we don't know but it's an interesting tidbit from an even more interesting interview that dives into other topics like why King left the company and Take-Two Interactive's influence on Rockstar.

The developer also answered many interesting questions and addressed his departure from the company.

IN A NUTSHELL: Jamie King Rockstar's co-founder said in an interview that the studio's future games will likely change tone; The developer also said that the recent departures of important people to the company will definitely take a toll on its games; Jamie King left the studio in 2006 and would not like to return to it.

Jamie King is the co-founder of Rockstar Games who left the company in 2006. Youtuber Killaz decided to interview him asking a series of questions about working at the studio and the reasons for his departure. Among the topics raised was also GTA 6. The developer believes that the next installment of the series may not be as funny as its predecessors.

Despite the fact that the sixth installment of the GTA series has not even been announced yet it does not stop fans from wondering how it will look like. Jamie King spoke on this issue. The developer has worked on many games - including Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. He was asked by Killaz about how the recent departures from the company might affect Rockstar's future. According to King we shouldn't expect a revolution in mechanics however the tone of new games could change.

It's possible that the next installment of GTA will lose some of the specific humor and atmosphere. The developer also doesn't exclude the possibility that the studio may create something ""cheesy"". He stresses however that it will be very difficult to break such a ""well-working machine"" and looking at the success of Grand Theft Auto Online probably everything will turn out well for the company. He also notes that Rockstar feels no pressure to announce GTA 6.

Please note that the developers are still silent regarding GTA 6. Because of this some fans are already starting to lose patience. Here is the opinion of one of our editorial colleagues: Can't Wait For GTA 6 - So Give Me Saints Row Already!.

Of course YouTuber Killaz asked the interviewee about his opinion on the recent departures of prominent Rockstar employees. Relatively recently Leslie Benzies (head of Rockstar North) and Dan Houser (another co-founder of Rockstar Games) said goodbye to the company. Jamie King was sparing with words. He said that he was not surprised by the content of the lawsuit regarding Leslie Benzies who allegedly was not paid royalties for his work. He also thinks Dan Houser can finally relax and should write a book.

Longtime Rockstar North division head Leslie Benzies said goodbye to Rockstar in 2016. It wasn't a peaceful breakup however as the finale was a lawsuit; Last year another studio founder - Dan Houser - said goodbye to the company. You can read more about it here.

Jamie King also commented on his own departure from the company. The developer decided that the path he was supposed to follow with video games was not his path. Additionally he was exhausted by working seven days a week and decided that ""life is too short"" for that. He made it clear in the interview that while he fondly remembers the old days he would not want to work at Rockstar ever again.

The developer shared various interesting facts from his time working for Rockstar. For example he claims Take-Two (the publisher) did not interfere in the internal affairs of the studio and offered quite a lot of freedom in game development. However he emphasizes that this may have changed since then. Additionally he mentioned how while working on Midnight Club illegal races were organized on the streets of New York.

The GTA franchise recently suffered a huge blow to its image due to the poor quality of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. The company will certainly want to somehow make amends to the players.",,,,,,

But this year’s Small Business Saturday promotion is unlikely to change the fortunes of independent shops in America which have diverged dramatically from their larger rivals.

Small retailers have been squeezed out throughout the pandemic and are at a significant disadvantage navigating the current supply chain crisis rising inflation and the shortage of workers said retail analysts and supply chain experts.

First as Covid-19 spread last year many small shops did not meet the criteria of “essential” businesses and had to close down. Their larger competitors such as Walmart (WMT) Target (TGT) Costco (COST) Home Depot (HD) and others were able to stay open.

With smaller retailers closed and spending on travel and leisure at a standstill these major chains boomed as Americans stocked up on groceries household basics office supplies and furniture during stay-at-home mandates.

Meanwhile the pandemic caused roughly 200000 more small businesses to close in the first year of the pandemic than in a typical year the Federal Reserve estimated.

As independent shops began reopening in the second half of 2020 and early 2021 they met a new set of challenges: manufacturing shutdowns and material shortages that made it harder to get products and keep them in stock higher costs for shipping and transportation as well as difficulties hiring and retaining workers.

All retailers have grappled with these problems this year. But the challenges have hit independent stores harder experts say. Mom-and-pop owners are typically lowest on the priority list for manufacturers and shipping companies when shortages or delays pop up.

Home Depot for example said last week that some vendors with limited supplies told the chain that they’re giving the company priority over others: “‘We can’t service the industry so we’d rather focus on the best partner” the suppliers said Home Depot chief operating officer Edward Decker recalled on a call with analysts last week.

Small stores also usually lack the financial flexibility to manage higher costs and hold prices down for customers unlike large competitors that can use their scale and extensive resources to absorb cost increases.

“Bigger retailers should be more able to navigate supply chain issues and have better in stocks than smaller retailers without the muscle” said Michael Baker a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson in a note to clients last week.

The gap between big and small retailers

Sales are expected to boom this holiday but small stores may miss out as shoppers head to cheaper chains with more goods on their shelves.

Retail sales in November and December will grow between 8.5% and 10.5% this year compared with the 2020 holiday season to a record of up to $859 billion projects the National Retail Federation an industry trade group.

Large chains’ inventories have ballooned ahead of the holidays thanks in part to tactics that are way too costly for most shop owners — chartering ships and airfreighting products to the United States from overseas for example. Big retailers have also been relying on their broad supplier networks to mitigate shortages of raw materials and factory shutdowns. Small stores typically only have a handful of suppliers so if something goes wrong with one of them they’re stuck.

Target is “well positioned” on key holiday products such as toys and gifts the retail giant’s chief operating officer John Mulligan said on an earnings call last week. This will help Target “continue to take market share as we go through the holiday season.”

Retail giants are pulling out all the stops this holiday stretch to stockpile goods hold prices down for customers and staff stores and warehouses. But independent stores are struggling to to keep up.

According to a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business a lobbying group for small businesses 39% of small business owners reported in October that supply chain disruptions have had a significant impact on their business. Another 29% reported a moderate impact. Only 10% reported no impact from supply chain disruptions.

“Small business owners are attempting to take advantage of current economic growth but remain pessimistic about business conditions in the near future” said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg in a statement.

The lack of workers for unfilled jobs and inventory shortages are some of the top challenges for small businesses he said and will “continue to be a problem during the holiday season.”

It all means that by the end of the holidays it’s likely that the gap between America’s largest stores and its smallest will have stretched even further.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXh0LWdlbi13YXJmYXJlLTQtcmVhc29ucy13aHktY29tYmF0LWRyb25lcy1hcmUtYmVjb21pbmctdGhlLWZhc3Rlc3QtZ3Jvd2luZy13ZWFwb25yeS1pbi1tb2Rlcm4tbWlsaXRhcnlzLWFyc2VuYWwv0gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL25leHQtZ2VuLXdhcmZhcmUtNC1yZWFzb25zLXdoeS1jb21iYXQtZHJvbmVzLWFyZS1iZWNvbWluZy10aGUtZmFzdGVzdC1ncm93aW5nLXdlYXBvbnJ5LWluLW1vZGVybi1taWxpdGFyeXMtYXJzZW5hbC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Next-Gen Warfare: 4 Reasons Why Combat Drones Are Becoming The Fastest Growing Weaponry In Modern Military’s Arsenal,"Around this time last year (2020) Azerbaijan had conquered almost the entire Armenian exclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. If the war had attracted global attention it was mainly because of one feature. And that was the widespread use of armed drones of Turkish production which decimated and demoralized the unprepared Armenians from the air. In fact the importance of armed drones nowadays is such that almost all the major countries are acquiring more and more armed drone systems. A side effect of this proliferation is an increase in their exports a fact that was conclusively proved last week with the release of two reports.

On November 25 Reportlinker.com announced the release of ‘Aircraft Insulation Market by Platform Type Material Application and Region – Forecast to 2026’. According to the report the global aircraft insulation market size is projected to grow from $5.5 billion in 2021 to $8.2 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 8.3% from 2021 to 2026. It says that the market is driven by various factors such as an increase in demand for lightweight materials the introduction of advanced acoustic and fire-resistant materials resulting in safer operations of aircraft declining cost of composite materials and increasing demand for military helicopters. What is the linkage between this and drones? Well drones like other platforms in the aerospace market use composite materials in their manufacture. These include concrete fiber-reinforced polymer metal composites and ceramic composites such as Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs) Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) and Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs). These composites have heat absorption capacity less weight noise cancellation capability vibration absorbance etc.

These materials are combined to make composite materials that have high strength flexibility and are lightweight as compared to aluminum or steel. Furthermore these materials are corrosion-resistant which keeps the covers of an aerostructure tight under any weather condition. The number of drones in the sky above Nagorno-Karabakh is apparently so large that an Azerbaijani Orbiter UAV can be seen flying right through the target footage of a Bayraktar TB2 UAV striking a D-30 howitzer (one of four probably struck this morning) https://t.co/gOwit7XZLe pic.twitter.com/XvdN1kou6H — Oryx (@oryxspioenkop) October 1 2020 Huge Demand For Drone-Making Materials

Given this if the market for these materials has grown up it means that more aerostructures are being built. Based on this the report says that the UAV platforms happen to be the fastest segment of the aircraft insulation market. It is not much affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. And major players of this market are DuPont (US) Triumph Group Inc. (US) Transdigm Group Inc. (US) Zotefoams (UK) BASF SE (Germany) Rogers Corporation (US) Safran Group (France) and Evonik Industries (Germany).

The other report coming on November 23 estimates that the Global Defense Drone Market will generate $16902.0 million and exhibit a CAGR of 7.9% from 2021 to 2028 owing to increasing defense expenditure in many countries around the world. The Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to observe the fastest growth by 2028 the report which incidentally is prepared by “Research Dive” a market research firm based in Pune India says.

The report has segmented the global defense drone market into product type payload application range and region:

Based on product type the multirotor systems sub-segment is estimated to surpass $6869.4 million by 2028 and witness lucrative growth during the forecast period. This sub-segment growth of the global defense drone market is mainly due to the surge in the development of unmanned rotorcrafts and quadcopters.

Based on payload the small drones sub-segment is estimated to generate a revenue of $7901.2 million by 2028 and hold dominating market share over the forecast period. This is majorly owing to the effectiveness of small drones to lift a payload up to 25 kg and perform computerized command communication control and information functions.

Based on application the combat operations sub-segment is expected to generate a revenue of $6556.2 million by 2028 and is predicted to witness the fastest growth during the analysis period. This is mainly due to the rising need for upgrading the existing unmanned aerial attack systems for threat elimination missions and target identification in military aviation.

Based on range the short-range sub-segment accounted for $3652.9 million in 2020 and is anticipated to hold the majority of the market share during the forecast period. This is mainly due to low noises generated by short-range drones owing to which the adversaries are less likely to detect their presence. Besides short-range drones can hover over an area that is longer than manned aircraft which is another factor predicted to boost the sub-segment growth in the defense drone market by 2028.

Based on region the Asia-Pacific market for defense drones is expected to surpass $4071.7 million by 2028 and witness the fastest growth in the global industry over the forecast period. The increasing military expenditure of major countries in the region such as China India Japan Australia and others is the major factor predicted to boost the regional market growth by 2028.

America Leading The Race The Research Drive report has identified the following as the 10 most important players in the UAV market:

1. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc.

2. Northrop Grumman Corporation

3. Lockheed Martin Corporation

4. Elbit Systems Ltd.

5. Textron Systems

6. AeroVironment Inc.

7. Thales Group

8. Boeing

9. Israel aerospace industries ltd

10. SAAB Group.

However it is also known that Chinese Iranian and Turkish drones have found their way into the market. Turkish Bayraktar TB2 is now export-hit and Ankara has ensured that the development and production of the drone can run as autonomously as possible. Among TB2’s customers are now Ukraine and Poland. The US of course is the leader in the market as it has used drones in conflicts for long particularly in asymmetric conflicts with low intensity – both to cover ground groups from the air and to target suspected terrorist targets. In Afghanistan Pakistan Iraq and Yemen the US MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper systems have been used extensively.

For Russia drones have fulfilled a supportive role to its Army namely that of visual and electronic target reconnaissance and detection. Moscow is also developing stealth drones such as the Okhotnik which would be used in high-intensity scenarios. In fact analysts say that Russia has jumped almost directly from reconnaissance to stealth drones.

Proliferation Of Military Drones All told if military drones are becoming increasingly indispensable for the armed forces all over the world there are essentially four reasons behind this trend.

One they are less costly but pretty effective as operational intelligence platforms for proper data flow and they provide real-time surveillance to detect ballistic missile threats.

Two they can be used in remote locations where the communication systems are poor. They are thus able to provide vital data irrespective of location. As a result the control center of the user is able to plan and prepare for uncertain attacks. They thus help in making well-informed decisions. Three and this is a corollary of the above in heavy fighting zones drones help in providing information to the command center to identify the targets better improve safety and protect infrastructures from any kind of external threats or risks. In this sense they greatly reduce putting military personnel in harm’s way or in combat. They save lives.

Four drones are proving also lethal to enemy combats as regular airplanes. This means that it is easier to neutralize enemy power using a drone with minimal human casualties.

However the biggest criticism against military drones is that they often cause collateral damages to civilian lives and property. This is because they do not have the capacity to make judgments on whether to deploy or not. No wonder why US MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper are such dirty words in Pakistan Afghanistan Iraq and Syria.

But then modern warfare is increasingly becoming insensitive to civilian opinions. National interests weigh over notions of rights and wrong in fighting wars particularly when the enemies happen to be those who have the scantiest respect for these very notions of rights and wrongs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZW9ubGluZW5nLmNvbS9hbC1qYXplZXJhLWFyZXdhMjQtdGFyZ2V0LTQwbS12aWV3ZXJzLXdpdGgtZG9jdW1lbnRhcmllcy1zZXJpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Al Jazeera Arewa24 target 40m viewers with documentaries series,"AlJazeera and AREWA 24 have announced a new distribution agreement that will soon see Al Jazeera English documentaries and series dubbed into the Hausa language and made available to AREWA24’s over 40 million viewers in Northern Nigeria Niger Chad and Cameroon.

This year Tesla has struggled to deliver new cars to customers in the U.S. in line with originally promised date ranges. As CNBC previously reported some Tesla customers here experienced delivery delays of months leaving them paying out of pocket for rentals and ride-hailing apps and needing to re-apply for loans due to slipped deadlines.

Tesla is not alone in leaving customers waiting longer than they had hoped for their new fully electric cars. Last week for example newly public competitor Rivian Automotive notified people who had reserved their R1S a sport utility vehicle of delivery delays.

Still sales have grown this year for Tesla seemingly unbowed by unpredictable delivery dates.

Vehicle deliveries which are the closest approximation to sales reported by Elon Musk's electric vehicle and renewable energy business amounted to about 500000 total in 2020. During the first three quarters of 2021 Tesla had already reported deliveries of 627350 vehicles.

Since the start of 2021 the company has not provided a clear target for 2021 vehicle deliveries.

Whether you're an industry watcher or a casual investor it's been hard to ignore the coverage of up-and-coming electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive (RIVN -2.25%). From shattering initial public offering (IPO) records to fetching an over-$150 billion valuation at its peak (which is more than General Motors Ford or even Starbucks) Rivian embodies a spirit of optimism and imagination.

However hope and wishful thinking don't go far in the investing world. For a growth story to truly play out a company must demonstrate an ability to capture market share chart a path toward profitability and prove its mettle during tough times. Love it or hate it Tesla (TSLA -2.04%) has these attributes in spades.

Let's see if Rivian has what it takes to become the next Tesla.

Tesla's recipe for success

Tesla is now a $1 trillion company and by far the most valuable automaker in the world. But just a few years ago Tesla was struggling to achieve consistent profitability and running out of cash as it found itself in the clutches of what CEO Elon Musk once called ""production hell.""

Today Tesla sports one of the highest gross profit margins in the auto industry thanks to highly profitable vehicles vertically integrated manufacturing and control over its distribution.

To sum it up Tesla's success boils down to:

International brand recognition that limits the need for advertising.

Its own fast-charging network which has more than 30000 Superchargers and growing.

Technologically superior vehicles at attractive price points for both the consumer and Tesla.

Direct-to-consumer marketing that cuts out third-party franchises and boosts margins.

Stable and growing demand that justifies Gigafactory expansion in China Germany and Texas.

Undisputed leadership in the transition from the internal combustion engine to the electric motor.

Low debt and healthy free cash flow.

Rivian's strategic approach

When looking at the ingredients of Tesla's success it quickly becomes apparent that mimicking or even coming close to the electric car company will be a tall order. But Rivian does have a lot going for it.

For starters it's getting a ton of brand recognition without having to spend advertising dollars. Since its IPO Rivian's Twitter account hasn't released a single post. It's press room has been quiet. And yet internet forums and mainstream media are spreading its story like wildfire.

In terms of manufacturing the company's S-1 filing with the SEC states that its Normal Factory in Illinois has an annual production capacity of 150000 units. It began production of the R1T pickup truck in September and it plans to begin production of the R1S SUV in December. As of Sept. 30 it had 48390 reservations for the R1T and R1S but has since grown that number to over 55000. It also has 100000 orders for its RCV delivery van from Amazon -- which owns a 20% stake in Rivian.

Like Tesla Rivian builds its battery cells in-house to control as much of its manufacturing as possible. However the company did say that it relies on several parts and components suppliers which is the main reason why it is behind on customer deliveries.

In terms of product differentiation Rivian's R1T and R1S are attractively priced starting at $70000 or less. A fully electric outdoorsy pickup truck and a fully electric seven-seating SUV are rare feats in the EV market. In this area Rivian certainly has a leg up on the competition.

To meet the needs of its adventurous clientele Rivian is building the Rivian Adventure Network to provide charging capabilities from parks to remote locations that otherwise would lack access. Like Tesla it's bypassing the dealership network in favor of direct-to-consumer sales.

And finally Rivian is flush with cash. Before its IPO Rivian had $3.56 billion in cash on its balance sheet from previous funding rounds. It's now estimated the company has somewhere in the ballpark of $12 billion in cash. Even if Rivian takes years to become profitable it should have no problem raising more cash. Unlike the days when most of Wall Street thought Tesla would fail EV companies now have access to low interest rates and a widening pool of eager investors. As long as Rivian shows production progress and keeps it competitive edge finding cash should be the least of its worries.

Does Rivian have what it takes?

On the surface Tesla and Rivian are surprisingly similar. Rivian is closely following Tesla's playbook and laying the groundwork to build the same pillars of success that Tesla currently has.

If Rivian proves its production prowess and is able to meet customer demand in 2022 then it would reach a similar milestone that propelled its peer Lucid Group (LCID -1.48%) to new heights. In many ways it is the ability to deliver on promises that will ultimately gain investor trust and bridge the gap between newcomers and a seasoned veteran like Tesla.

Like a college prospect looking to become the next LeBron James Rivian has what it takes to become the next Tesla. But it must first get to the NBA (deliver cars) before we seriously have that conversation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMTEvMjcvYXVzdGluLWFkanVzdHMtdG8tbGlmZS13aXRoLXRlc2xhLWFuZC1pdHMtZWNjZW50cmljLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWJvc3MtZWxvbi1tdXNrL9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzExLzI3L2F1c3Rpbi1hZGp1c3RzLXRvLWxpZmUtd2l0aC10ZXNsYS1hbmQtaXRzLWVjY2VudHJpYy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1ib3NzLWVsb24tbXVzay8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Austin adjusts to life with Tesla and its eccentric billionaire boss Elon Musk,"Welcome to life in Musklandia.

As Elon Musk’s sphere of influence in Austin and across Texas seems to expand by the day the eccentric Texas-based billionaire is taking the region and the state along on the wild and often weird roller coaster ride that is his life.

It’s been a little more than a month since Musk announced Oct. 7 that Tesla is moving its headquarters to Austin but even before that Musk was already spending an increasing amount of time in Austin. He has been moving more of his companies into the region since at least 2020 most notably with Tesla’s $1.1 billion manufacturing facility currently being built in southeastern Travis County.

As Austin becomes ground zero for all things Musk that leaves the rest of us figuring out how to navigate the new landscape — good bad and odd.

“Musk is a modern-day Albert Einstein in the eyes of many and the richest person in the world by a wide margin. He’s going to bring a lot more limelight and focus on Austin” said Dan Ives an analyst with Wedbush Securities.

Musk and Austin are likely to become inextricably linked in the coming years Ives said.

“When the average person in the world thinks Austin Texas they’re not going to the music festival or Dell or for the great city it is. Tesla and Elon Musk are going to become synonymous with Austin” Ives said.

Roger Kay an analyst with Endpoint Technologies said Musk’s status and personality are sure to have an impact on Central Texas.

“He’s the richest guy in the world which is interesting. So what he’ll do immediately is upstage (Dell Technologies founder and CEO) Michael Dell at least on that” Kay said. “Michael has been the kind of king of Austin I would say all up until this point.”

While the $1.1 billion Tesla manufacturing facility and Tesla’s planned headquarters move to Austin have drawn the most attention Musk’s ventures have been quietly expanding in Central Texas for some time now. They include Musk’s tunneling and infrastructure company the Boring Co. which has facilities in Pflugerville and Bastrop; a potential SpaceX expansion somewhere in Austin; a potential Neuralink office; and the headquarters of his private foundation the Musk Foundation.

Also a Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy was recently licensed to operate as an energy provider in Texas according to documents filed with the Texas Public Utility Commission. The company is already building the first Tesla solar neighborhood in Austin called SunHouse at Easton Park with solar- and alternative-powered energy.

Meanwhile SpaceX — Musk’s aerospace and rocket company — has multiple facilities around Texas including a launch site near Boca Chica in far South Texas.

What’s not clear is whether Musk has a residence in Austin. Although various media outlets have listed Austin as his home he has never publicly confirmed that. Musk announced last year that he had moved to Texas but said his main residence is a small home near Boca Chica on the SpaceX campus.

Whether Musk actually lives in Austin or not his influence in and impact on Central Texas can’t be denied.

Kay said the influx of Tesla and other Musk-related companies will lead to higher salaries in the local tech industry as well as add to the region’s already booming housing market and send real estate prices even higher.

“For some people there will be good opportunities. Other people” Kay said “are going to be irritated.”

‘Most powerful voice in the world’

One of the places where Musk has drawn the most attention — and perhaps created the most irritation — has been on social media. Musk is active on Twitter where he has more than 63 million followers.

With his immense wealth and such a huge audience the influence of what Musk posts on social media shouldn’t be downplayed Ives said.

“He is one of if not the most powerful voice in the world in terms of social media and a following” Ives said. “If Musk talks everyone’s listening. When you’re on the right side of that it’s great. When you’re on the wrong side of that it’s a lot of downsides.”

Few days go by without Musk making some sort of headline on social media whether it be for company news cryptic personal statements political commentary or just posting a meme.

One example was earlier this month when after polling his Twitter followers on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock Musk sold about 900000 shares netting over $1.1 billion. His trust also sold more than 3.5 million shares worth $3.88 billion. The stock options that were sold would expire next year and still leave Musk with about 170 million Tesla shares.

More sales later in the week from both Musk and his trust have brought the total stock sold to 6.4 million shares worth a total of $6.9 billion. The sales so far amount to less than 4% of the shares he holds.

Ives said that while a sale of some stock has been expected to pay upcoming taxes holding a Twitter poll to sell the stock is “another soap opera that can only happen to one company and one CEO in the world Musk.”

Here are a few more highlights and lowlights from Musk on social media in the past month:

He clashed with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Twitter after the former presidential candidate from Vermont said the extremely wealthy should pay their fair share. Musk tweeted: “I keep forgetting that you’re still alive” and later added “Want me to sell more stock Bernie? Just say the word .”

He criticized Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard with whom he has feuded for years on Twitter. He claimed to “wish he never met” the co-founder whom he considers the “worst person I’ve ever worked with in my entire career” and said that Eberhard “came damn close to killing Tesla.”

He tweeted a crass comment at Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden after the politician tweeted in support of a billionaires income tax and said Musk paying taxes shouldn’t be dependent on a Twitter poll.

He temporarily changed his Twitter name to Lord Edge likely a reference to the phrase “edge lord.”

He tweeted a joke that he was considering starting a new university in Texas whose name could be used to form a rude acronym.

He acknowledged on Twitter that Tesla’s self-driving program was having software issues and announced that an update would be rolled back after Tesla owners reported cars behaving erratically.

He pushed back on President Joe Biden’s proposed tax plan dubbed the Billionaires Income Tax which would add a tax on the assets not income of billionaires. “Eventually they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you” Musk tweeted on the same day he gained $36 billion in personal wealth from the Tesla stock surge.

He called Biden a “puppet” for the United Auto Workers union and pushed back on his plan for electric-vehicle purchase tax credits proposed in the president’s infrastructure bill. The plan would exclude nonunion automakers such as Tesla.

He exchanged tweets with David Beasley director of the U.N.’s World Food Program who urged Musk to donate 2% of his estimated net worth or about $6 billion to help fight world hunger. Musk said if the program laid out a detailed plan for how exactly the $6 billion would be used and the donation went through open source accounting he would donate. Beasley said that was possible and he would meet him anywhere “earth or space” to discuss further. No donation has been made.

While most of that social media activity hasn’t focused directly on Austin or Texas there are signs Musk is starting to take more of an interest in what’s going on in the Lone Star State.

Ruffled feathers

When Musk announced he was moving Tesla’s headquarters to Austin he didn’t mention previous clashes he’d had with California officials. But industry analysts say that while Austin is more affordable than Silicon Valley and still has the tech and engineering talent Musk needs for his companies it seems clear he decided he preferred Texas’ more business-friendly environment over California’s more regulation-heavy approach.

“I think Musk selected Texas in particular because of its kind of frontier style. He’s always thought that California’s heavy regulatory environment was not particularly conducive to his style” Kay said. “He’s made it really clear that he doesn’t think public authorities have any business telling him what to do.”

All of which means officials in Texas — and in Austin — could eventually find themselves getting the same pushback California did from Musk if regulatory conditions rub him the wrong way.

Musk tends to do what he wants and is clever and aggressive in how he goes about disputes Kay said. At the same time he will bring a lot of jobs and tax revenue to the region which gives him cards to play.

“He’ll say ‘Well listen you want me to just pick up stakes and go to Mississippi?’ ” Kay said. “There’s probably going to be some ruffled feathers there when he says ‘It’s my way or the highway and now I own your highway. You can’t say anything about it. You do — well then I’ll bring all my resources to bear upon you.’ ”

It remains to be seen how Musk might aim to influence state or local policymaking.

In September Gov. Greg Abbott said that Musk supported Texas’ social policies. In response Musk tweeted: “In general I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people and when doing so should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said I would prefer to stay out of politics.”

However Musk has weighed in on some Austin political issues already.

“Austin should be its city not a San Francisco copycat” Musk said in a Halloween tweet replying to a tweet about Proposition A which didn’t pass earlier this month. The proposition would have required the city of Austin to hire hundreds more police officers.

Whatever positions Musk takes they are sure to have influence in Austin across the state and globally Ives said — in large part because of Musk’s immense wealth and the power that affords him.

Musk recently became the first person in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to have an estimated net worth of more than $300 billion making him not only the wealthiest person in the country but also the richest person in history. Musk’s current estimated net worth is somewhere between $280 billion and $300 billion.

Having Musk and Tesla in the city comes with “exponentially more positives than negatives for Austin” Ives said. “But Austin has to embrace Tesla and Elon and not just treat him like any other business person. There are 300 billion reasons he’s not.”

The SSCs advance the technical curve in a number of key respects as they include emerging computer technology able to decrease the crew size and introduce new levels of autonomy. They are also built with lighter weight composite materials and can therefore carry more payload from ship-to-shore including an ability to transport a 74-ton M1 Abrams tank. The Textron-built SSCs also incorporate automated flight controls and modernized engines company officials explain. The Navy’s 72 existing LCACs in service since the 80s can only transport up to 60-tons reach speeds of 36-knots and travel ranges up to 200 nautical miles from amphibious vehicles Navy officials explained.

The new SSC Rolls Royce engines are the same that now power the MV-22 Osprey aircraft and bring more horsepower.

Computer automation built into the SSC includes digital flight controls intended to replace the traditional yoke and pedals. Textron developers say onboard computers will quickly calculate relevant details such as wind speed and navigational information.

The new SSCs have also moved to a lower frequency for ship electronics moving from four hundred Hertz down to sixty Hertz in order to better synchronize ship systems with Navy common standards Textron developers explained. Along with these properties the new craft reduces the number of gearboxes from eight to two.

The innovations built into the SSC are in large measure intended to adapt to a new threat environment in which heavier vehicles might be needed to deploy more quickly from ship-to-shore to reinforce an amphibious landing. Armored combat vehicles like M1Abrams tanks typically take a long time to deploy and need to be forward stationed. However if a heavily armored combat asset such as an Abrams tank can quickly transport from an amphibious ship to support a shore attack it opens up possibilities for a deeper longer incursion or amphibious assault upon landing. This enables a faster more varied heavy assault wherein M1 Abrams tanks can support armed amphibious assault vehicles. It also creates a circumstance wherein heavier armor can be more dispersed and therefore less concentrated. The more heavy assets are aggregated together the more vulnerable they may be to enemy fire and longer-range sensors and weapons are increasingly enabling more dispersed amphibious attack options.

As the first clean-sheet turboprop engine design in 30 years the GE Catalyst incorporates 98 patented technologies and benefits from its lead in additive manufacturing technologies and its extensive experience in manufacturing turbofan engines for civilian jetliners.

The engine’s launch customer Textron Aviation completed the first flight of its all-new single-engine Beechcraft Denali aircraft earlier this week. The Catalyst engine powers the Denali to a cruise speed of 285 knots with four passengers and a pilot on board. The aircraft can attain a range of nearly 3000 km while carrying 500 kg of fuel.

Advanced Powerplant

The GE Catalyst is the first turboprop engine to make extensive use of 3D printed components which have reduced engine weight by 5% and improved Specific Fuel Consumption by 1%. GE used additive manufacturing to make 12 parts replacing what would have earlier amounted to over 800 separate components made using conventional methods. These 3D printed parts are lighter and have tighter tolerances delivering enhanced reliability and longer engine life with lower maintenance. It has also disrupted the whole production cycle for engine development. Previously a similar engine class would have taken approximately ten years but Catalyst was developed in half that time.

Despite its American roots GE Aviation’s supply chain and assembly facilities for the new engine are based in Europe with the involvement of GE Aviation Czech Avio Aero of Italy and Poland GE Aviation Advanced Technology of Munich (Germany) and GE Engineering Design Center of Warsaw (Poland). The engine was developed entirely in Europe apart from some testing in Canada.

Change Agent

The GE Catalyst is the company’s first modern Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) controlled turboprop representing a significant advance for commercial turboprop engines. However the technology is commonplace on jet engines used in aircraft and turboshaft engines used in helicopters. This is the first instance of FADEC use in a commercial turboprop engine.

Paul Corkery GM Turboprop Engines GE Aviation said “The FADEC knows the conditions my plane is in and it then optimises the pitch of the propeller and the fuel flow around those conditions. The pilot will no longer need to consult a chart to optimise the flight around the correct parameters with four separate levers. It will all be digitised. The pilot will just have a single lever. It will be like flying a jet.”

The Catalyst features an Integrated Propulsion Control (IPC) system with a single electronic engine and propeller control lever. Other digitally-enabled features include engine auto start with automated exceedance protection and integrated propeller control. The FADEC system uses two fully redundant computers to control the engine and the propeller. The computers obtain their data on speed air temperature and density altitude and several other parameters from sensors placed on the aircraft. As a result of FADEC the pilots no longer need to keep fine-tuning engine and propellor settings thereby reducing their workload.

New Era

GE Aviation officially launched its Advanced Turboprop (ATP) engine programme in 2015 and named the engine ‘Catalyst’ in March 2018. Engine ground tests started in December 2020 with the new engine taking to the air for the first time this September. GE Aviation has already completed over 2600 hours of engine operation in ground tests. The first flightworthy engine was delivered to Textron Aviation in 2020.

The engine features an industry-leading overall pressure ratio of 16:1 allowing increased pressure and temperature enabling the fuel to burn more efficiently and delivering more power and speed at altitude. It reduced CO2 emission by 20% against current turboprop engines in the same class. The new engine also offers 4000 hours between overhauls which is 33% better than its leading competitor.

Predictive maintenance will be another first for the engine class. Sensors in the engine will capture part-level performance characteristics for OEM needs while Catalyst’s fully integrated digital control system will collect performance data during each flight. This data will be used to determine the aircraft’s flying environment along with the health of the engine controls and accessories. Operators will also be able to receive alerts specific to engine serial numbers sent by GE Aviation.

The aircraft data collected will be used to create a virtual simulation – or a “digital twin” – of every Catalyst engine that enters service. To compare the actual versus expected performance of the machine operators will be able to add additional data such as weather flight and fleet details. According to GE Aviation a digital twin is currently not available on any other civilian turboprop for preventative health maintenance.

The Catalyst will provide GE with opportunities in the business and general aviation market and for military applications like drones and trainers.

“As the first turboprop ever fully designed developed and built in Europe in the last half-century the Catalyst engine is an ITAR-free product also available for military applications” said Pierfederico Scarpa VP Marketing & Sales of Avio Aero a GE Aviation company which helped design the engine and critical parts like its gearbox the FADEC and high-pressure turbine components. The Catalyst engine will meet power requirements for aircraft classes in the 850 -1600 SHP range. Catalyst’s super-efficient core could also pave the way for a future hybrid powerplant. The engine will run on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and could also go on to power new types of unmanned aerial vehicles and hybrid aircraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMzQ1NzQ0L21vcm9jY29zLXJveWFsLWFpci1mb3JjZS10by1wdXJjaGFzZS0yNC1iZWxsLTQxMi1lcGktaGVsaWNvcHRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morocco's Royal Air Force to Purchase 24 Bell-412 EPI Helicopters,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.,,,,,,

Even as the company expands some of its existing facilities in the state now it is planning to build a 375000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Mebane that will create 150 to 200 jobs in manufacturing engineering and business operations.

The plant is part of a new co-investment with the U.S. government to produce a domestic supply of critically needed laboratory pipette tips which are used in disease research and in high volumes for processing of diagnostic tests including COVID-19 tests. Fisher Scientific has signed a $192.5 million contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to establish the site but the company has declined to say how much it will co-invest.

Construction will be fully completed by the third quarter of 2024 with manufacturing starting as early as the third quarter of 2023. The site located at 6086 West Ten Road in the new Buckhorn Industrial Park about half a mile south of I-40/85 also has the potential for future expansion across a variety of high-demand product lines the company said in a news release.

“The new manufacturing facility will help the U.S. meet future demand surges for vital laboratory products while bringing more high-quality jobs to North Carolina” said Mark Stevenson executive vice president and chief operating officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific. “With its strategic geographic location and proximity to a diverse talent base Mebane is an ideal location for this new facility.”

Thermo Fisher currently employs about 4000 people across seven sites in North Carolina including a center of excellence for laboratory equipment in Asheville three life sciences and chemical manufacturing sites in Durham pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in Greenville and High Point and a Raleigh distribution center.

“Thermo Fisher continues to expand its footprint in North Carolina reinforcing our state’s global reputation as a prime location for life sciences companies” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. “This new investment in Mebane and Orange County proves once again that North Carolina’s biotechnology sector is thriving in every corner of our state.”

Thermo Fisher’s investment in Mebane is part of a larger strategy to build flexible and redundant production capacity in the U.S. and across key regions globally. Increased output from recent site expansions is helping meet ongoing demand for COVID-19-related consumables including plastics used to collect samples and transport them to labs as well as for vital equipment used to accelerate production and allow flexibility for both COVID and non-COVID vaccines and therapies.

“Thermo Fisher Scientific is a keystone partner in our life sciences infrastructure” said Bill Bullock senior vice president of Economic Development and Statewide Operations at the North Carolina Biotechnology Center. “This company exemplifies the broad range of opportunities available to North Carolinians in life sciences manufacturing from pharmaceutical production to the precision parts used in delivery systems. And every facet contributes to the wellbeing of our communities and to improving health care around the world.”

Laboratory consumables — from sample collection vials for diagnostic test kits to lab plastics and materials for vaccine production and biobanking — have been vital to the global effort to combat COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic Thermo Fisher has invested more than $180 million to expand its laboratory plastics consumables production and another $600 million to increase global bioprocessing capacity for vaccines and medicines.

In addition the company opened new sites dedicated to manufacturing viral transport media used in COVID-19 sample collection and plasmid DNA used in mRNA-based vaccines. The company’s contract pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Greenville where major expansions and upgrades are under way involving several hundred new jobs began producing Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine this year.

“North Carolina offers companies like Thermo Fisher a diverse life science workforce and world-class universities and community colleges that keep building that workforce day after day” said Machelle Baker Sanders secretary of the N.C. Department of Commerce. “In North Carolina we understand that to attract and help companies compete in today’s global economy our state must be first in talent and we’re strongly committed to meeting that goal.”

Thermo Fisher Scientific headquartered in Waltham Mass. has annual revenue of about $35 billion and employs more than 90000 people worldwide. The company supports life sciences research by helping customers solve complex analytical challenges improve patient diagnostics and therapies or increase productivity in their laboratories. Its brands include Thermo Scientific Applied Biosystems Invitrogen Fisher Scientific Unity Lab Services and Patheon.

“The presence of a company of this magnitude is greatly appreciated and adds another world-class organization to a significant industrial lineup in our area” said Mebane Mayor Ed Hooks. “The investment in our economy and the job opportunities for highly skilled employees will undoubtedly have a major impact and provide great opportunities for our citizens.”

Renee Price chair of the Orange County Board of Commissioners said “Orange County strives to encourage and support economic development in our county and we particularly welcome businesses that offer 21st-century jobs with good salaries and career opportunities for our residents.”

The 54 awardees include Irish Dogs for the Disabled and Holy Well School in Carrigaline

Global life sciences company Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced the recipients of its €500000 Community Partnership Grant with 54 charities and community groups in Cork’s Lower Harbour and beyond sharing the fund. Among the deserving local groups are Irish Dogs for the Disabled and Holy Well National School.

This is the second consecutive year that Thermo Fisher Scientific at Currabinny Carrigaline has offered a €50000 fund to local groups who make their communities healthier cleaner and safer. Part of the company’s Making a Difference initiative it follows a recent donation of €56000 of IT equipment to four local groups.

Speaking on the announcement Liam Flavin Capital Projects Manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific in Cork and a member of the site’s Volunteer Committee said: “We are grateful to live and work in an area where so much passion is given to building a strong community. The Lower Harbour is full of people and groups committed to each other and we are honoured to play our part in helping them.

“The 54 recipients for our €50000 Community Partnership Grant share Thermo Fisher Scientific’s mission to make the world healthier cleaner and safer. Each of them is making a difference from sports teams creating opportunities for healthy socialising; to Tidy Towns groups keeping their villages green. Employees also nominated charities outside of the Lower Harbour close to their hearts and aligned to Thermo Fisher Scientific’s purpose. We are proud to support each of these important causes and excited to see the €50000 Grant put to good use.”

Deirdre Hurley Building Co-ordinator in the Senior Academy and Ann Herlihy Special Class Teacher of Holy Well Senior Academy explained that their allocated grant will support the development of a Sensory Garden. “Full of textures smells and sounds this will be hugely beneficial for all children in our Senior Academy of Holy Well NS and for the children with autism spectrum disorder in our Special Class” they said. “The garden will be a safe place where they can learn explore and develop sensory experiences. It will have a hugely positive impact on their sense of well-being and ability to regulate their emotions. We are very grateful to Thermo Fisher for the generous grant we have received and we look forward to seeing its positive impact on the children in Holy Well in the coming years.”

Paula Murphy whose seven-year-old daughter Raya has an assistance dog Mowana from Irish Dogs for the Disabled added: “Mowana has made an incredible impact on our family allowing Raya to live life to her fullest by breaking down barriers for her to the outside world and helping to improve her confidence. We were delighted that a good friend of ours who is an employee at Thermo Fisher Scientific put forward Irish Dogs for the Disabled as a deserving cause for the Community Partnership Grant.

If the war had attracted global attention it was mainly because of one feature. And that was the widespread use of armed drones of Turkish production which decimated and demoralized the unprepared Armenians from the air. In fact the importance of armed drones nowadays is such that almost all the major countries are acquiring more and more armed drone systems. A side effect of this proliferation is an increase in their exports a fact that was conclusively proved last week with the release of two reports.

On November 25 Reportlinker.com announced the release of ‘Aircraft Insulation Market by Platform Type Material Application and Region – Forecast to 2026’. According to the report the global aircraft insulation market size is projected to grow from $5.5 billion in 2021 to $8.2 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 8.3% from 2021 to 2026. It says that the market is driven by various factors such as an increase in demand for lightweight materials the introduction of advanced acoustic and fire-resistant materials resulting in safer operations of aircraft declining cost of composite materials and increasing demand for military helicopters. What is the linkage between this and drones? Well drones like other platforms in the aerospace market use composite materials in their manufacture. These include concrete fiber-reinforced polymer metal composites and ceramic composites such as Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs) Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) and Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs). These composites have heat absorption capacity less weight noise cancellation capability vibration absorbance etc.

These materials are combined to make composite materials that have high strength flexibility and are lightweight as compared to aluminum or steel. Furthermore these materials are corrosion-resistant which keeps the covers of an aerostructure tight under any weather condition. The number of drones in the sky above Nagorno-Karabakh is apparently so large that an Azerbaijani Orbiter UAV can be seen flying right through the target footage of a Bayraktar TB2 UAV striking a D-30 howitzer (one of four probably struck this morning) https://t.co/gOwit7XZLe pic.twitter.com/XvdN1kou6H — Oryx (@oryxspioenkop) October 1 2020 Huge Demand For Drone-Making Materials

Given this if the market for these materials has grown up it means that more aerostructures are being built. Based on this the report says that the UAV platforms happen to be the fastest segment of the aircraft insulation market. It is not much affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. And major players of this market are DuPont (US) Triumph Group Inc. (US) Transdigm Group Inc. (US) Zotefoams (UK) BASF SE (Germany) Rogers Corporation (US) Safran Group (France) and Evonik Industries (Germany).

The other report coming on November 23 estimates that the Global Defense Drone Market will generate $16902.0 million and exhibit a CAGR of 7.9% from 2021 to 2028 owing to increasing defense expenditure in many countries around the world. The Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to observe the fastest growth by 2028 the report which incidentally is prepared by “Research Dive” a market research firm based in Pune India says.

The report has segmented the global defense drone market into product type payload application range and region:

Based on product type the multirotor systems sub-segment is estimated to surpass $6869.4 million by 2028 and witness lucrative growth during the forecast period. This sub-segment growth of the global defense drone market is mainly due to the surge in the development of unmanned rotorcrafts and quadcopters.

Based on payload the small drones sub-segment is estimated to generate a revenue of $7901.2 million by 2028 and hold dominating market share over the forecast period. This is majorly owing to the effectiveness of small drones to lift a payload up to 25 kg and perform computerized command communication control and information functions.

Based on application the combat operations sub-segment is expected to generate a revenue of $6556.2 million by 2028 and is predicted to witness the fastest growth during the analysis period. This is mainly due to the rising need for upgrading the existing unmanned aerial attack systems for threat elimination missions and target identification in military aviation.

Based on range the short-range sub-segment accounted for $3652.9 million in 2020 and is anticipated to hold the majority of the market share during the forecast period. This is mainly due to low noises generated by short-range drones owing to which the adversaries are less likely to detect their presence. Besides short-range drones can hover over an area that is longer than manned aircraft which is another factor predicted to boost the sub-segment growth in the defense drone market by 2028.

Based on region the Asia-Pacific market for defense drones is expected to surpass $4071.7 million by 2028 and witness the fastest growth in the global industry over the forecast period. The increasing military expenditure of major countries in the region such as China India Japan Australia and others is the major factor predicted to boost the regional market growth by 2028.

America Leading The Race The Research Drive report has identified the following as the 10 most important players in the UAV market:

1. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc.

2. Northrop Grumman Corporation

3. Lockheed Martin Corporation

4. Elbit Systems Ltd.

5. Textron Systems

6. AeroVironment Inc.

7. Thales Group

8. Boeing

9. Israel aerospace industries ltd

10. SAAB Group.

However it is also known that Chinese Iranian and Turkish drones have found their way into the market. Turkish Bayraktar TB2 is now export-hit and Ankara has ensured that the development and production of the drone can run as autonomously as possible. Among TB2’s customers are now Ukraine and Poland. The US of course is the leader in the market as it has used drones in conflicts for long particularly in asymmetric conflicts with low intensity – both to cover ground groups from the air and to target suspected terrorist targets. In Afghanistan Pakistan Iraq and Yemen the US MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper systems have been used extensively.

For Russia drones have fulfilled a supportive role to its Army namely that of visual and electronic target reconnaissance and detection. Moscow is also developing stealth drones such as the Okhotnik which would be used in high-intensity scenarios. In fact analysts say that Russia has jumped almost directly from reconnaissance to stealth drones.

Proliferation Of Military Drones All told if military drones are becoming increasingly indispensable for the armed forces all over the world there are essentially four reasons behind this trend.

One they are less costly but pretty effective as operational intelligence platforms for proper data flow and they provide real-time surveillance to detect ballistic missile threats.

Two they can be used in remote locations where the communication systems are poor. They are thus able to provide vital data irrespective of location. As a result the control center of the user is able to plan and prepare for uncertain attacks. They thus help in making well-informed decisions. Three and this is a corollary of the above in heavy fighting zones drones help in providing information to the command center to identify the targets better improve safety and protect infrastructures from any kind of external threats or risks. In this sense they greatly reduce putting military personnel in harm’s way or in combat. They save lives.

Four drones are proving also lethal to enemy combats as regular airplanes. This means that it is easier to neutralize enemy power using a drone with minimal human casualties.

However the biggest criticism against military drones is that they often cause collateral damages to civilian lives and property. This is because they do not have the capacity to make judgments on whether to deploy or not.

The Regional Transportation Commission Southern Nevada said in a tweet Sunday morning that cars were backed up for 20 miles on I-15 southbound. Heavy traffic on the Sunday after Thanksgiving at the state line near Primm 45 miles southwest of Las Vegas is as traditional as the holiday.

Officials say the delay is partly attributed to the interstate dropping from three lanes in Nevada to two in California.

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman recently called for California transportation officials to widen I-15 to help with the backup that happens around major holidays.

Djily Mbacke cut his visit with his family in Senegal short because of Omicron.

The newest COVID-19 variant popped up 6000 miles away from Senegal in South Africa but Mbacke 57 was convinced it was time to go.

“I think it’s bad” the North Carolina resident said of the new variant as he passed through John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday. “Man I was scared of that — that’s why I came back.”

“I cut my vacation because of it” he added though he said there were only two or three cases in Senegal.

The Omicron variant has been found among travelers in the UK Germany and the Czech Republic and Dr. Anthony Fauci on Saturday said it may have already reached the US though the CDC said no cases were reported so far.

While no direct flights from South Africa were arriving at JFK Saturday other travelers who visited the continent said they were aware of the latest mutation of the virus.

“This is what it’s going to be” said Ebenizer a Maryland resident returning from Nairobi Kenya who asked that his last name not be used. “There’s going to be more variants just like the flu. I’m not scared at all.”

Maine residents Shaina and Neville Gregory were returning from their honeymoon in Tanzania.

“The problem is from the beginning people let their guards downs once the vaccine came out” said Shaina Gregory 25. “People from the start of the virus weren’t using caution which is why it exacerbated to where it is now.”

She noticed masks are rarely worn in Tanzania about 2500 miles northeast of South Africa.

That’s also a problem in the US according to Epifana Qintana a New Jersey landscape business owner who was on her way to Paraguay. “So many people don’t have the vaccine and there are so many people who don’t use the mask” she lamented.

Petra Heilmann 57 flew into NYC from Frankfurt Germany to do some holiday shopping. “We just have to live with it” she said lamenting the possibility that travel restrictions will return on a wide scale.

The White House ordered new restrictions for flights from South Africa and seven neighboring countries starting Monday including suspending or restricting entry of non-citizens who have been in those locales within 14 days. United and Delta airlines have said they will continue to operate flights between the two countries.

Flights that originate in South Africa land at all three New York area airports daily. Most have two or more stops along the way including some that stop in Toronto before arriving at LaGuardia. United and Delta airlines operate direct flights between the two countries. United had a flight from Cape Town arriving at Newark around 7 a.m. Saturday and the same flight is scheduled to land shortly before 7 a.m. Sunday.

Iceland has been a focal point of my wanderlust for the better part of two years. The country is a dreamscape of natural beauty: the black sands of Reynisfjara towering icebergs of the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon and the steep jagged peaks of Vestrahorn. I was forced to shelve a meticulously planned trip there in 2020 like so many other globetrotters who set aside excursions during the Covid pandemic. Since then I've wondered: When will an adventure overseas be feasible again? Perhaps soon. The 2022 outlook for travel abroad is rosier than ever especially for Americans booking trips in the summer or later according to travel experts. But they should expect to do more advance planning and remain flexible. ""Since March 2020 there hasn't been a time as promising as it is now"" Sebastian Modak editor-at-large of Lonely Planet and the New York Times 52 Places Traveler in 2019 said of travel overseas. ""It really comes down to the traveler's own threshold for risk and comfort for things maybe going a little bit awry"" he added.

The year to 'go big'

A large share —about 37% — of U.S. travelers are planning both international and domestic trips next year according to an upcoming Expedia report on 2022 travel trends. After almost two years of pent-up wanderlust more than two-thirds of American travelers plan to ""go big"" on their next getaway — whether that be taking a once-in-a-lifetime trip abroad or upgrading to a luxury hotel according to the report. Though domestic-only travel plans remain most popular appealing to 59% of U.S. travelers interest in overseas destinations is climbing. G Adventures which offers guided group trips around the world has seen overseas bookings jump nearly 35% so far in November versus the same period in 2019. The company is seeing ""big demand"" for trips to Peru Costa Rica and Morocco according to Benjamin Perlo the company's U.S. managing director.

Flight searches to major European cities have also grown significantly in a short time span — by 65% from Los Angeles to London and 110% from New York to Paris for example between September and October according to Expedia data. Warm-weather hotspots close to the U.S. like the Riviera Maya Cancun Isla Mujeres and Punta Cana have been most popular overall for American tourists traveling in early 2022 according to Expedia. ""I think 2022 will be the year of going big and having some of those bucket-list moments"" Christie Hudson a travel expert at Expedia said.

There are many reasons for consumer optimism. For one Covid vaccination rates are climbing meaning Americans can travel with a relative degree of safety. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which recommends vaccination before traveling internationally authorized shots for children ages 5 to 11 in early November making family trips more feasible. Further travel restrictions are easing. Many countries have re-opened their borders to Americans and dropped policies like mandatory quarantine periods. New Zealand which has had one of the longest Covid-era bans on tourism said Wednesday it would open its borders to vaccinated non-citizens starting April 30. (Testing requirements are still widespread even for vaccinated tourists. Travelers can find country-specific requirements at the U.S. State Department website.)

Some countries have remain closed to American tourists or have yet to drop strict health policies. That's especially true for Asian countries travel experts said. China for example requires Americans to quarantine for at least 14 days at a government-selected facility. Japan isn't allowing any tourism travel. Some travel companies are still erring on the side of U.S. travel. Fodor's Travel for example limited its annual Go List to domestic locations in 2022 due to uncertainties around travel abroad though it added a measure of optimism. ""Like many of you we're still jonesing for international travel"" Fodor's wrote. ""And traveling abroad may still be in the cards for the intrepid. ""If you can travel there safely and responsibly do it — go anywhere in the world"" it added.

Safeguards and flexibility

Anton Petrus | Moment | Getty Images

Travelers should take certain precautions largely in the interest of safeguarding against financial losses. Experts recommend travel insurance which refunds trip costs in the event of a trip cancellation or other unforeseen circumstance. There are different types of policies however. A ""cancel for any reason"" policy is generally the only one that lets travelers recoup funds if they cancel a trip for a Covid-related reason experts said. (Most basic policies don't cover that eventuality.) Even ""cancel for any reason"" options may not offer a full refund though and insurers may require travelers to cancel a day or two ahead of one's trip. It's important to understand a policy's specific conditions before buying. Travelers should also weigh airfare and hotel options that allow for refunds travel credits or changes even if those options cost a little more experts said. ""I think you can feel comfortable booking that October trip to Egypt if you have the insurance in place and maybe booked a flexible flight with airlines"" Modak said. ""Make sure you have the contingency where if things get tough in Egypt you can book the flight for May 2023 without suffering any financial cost."" Many companies have retained extra flexibility relative to their pre-pandemic policies.

He was 78. Trimble's career spanned 48 years starting at the Texarkana Gazette and followed by jobs at the Arkansas Gazette Arkansas Times Pine Bluff Commercial Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and Denton Record-Chronicle. His remarkable observational skills and down-to-earth writing lent humanity and humor to his writing—whether news features or columns. He was beloved by fans in Arkansas and admired and respected by other journalists and writers nationwide. While an editorial writer for the Denton Record-Chronicle in 2006 Trimble received the award from the American Society of Newspaper Editors for the best editorials in the nation that year. His Arkansas Times article ""Memoirs of a Miner"" recounting his days on the Bauxite AR High School football team won a national sports writing award in 1985 and the story appeared in that year's anthology of the Sporting News best sports stories of the year. Other articles recalling his young days at Bauxite were among his most popular. His sister keeps copies on her computer to send in response to a regular stream of requests. Travis Mac Trimble was born November 3 1943 to Edgar Mac Trimble and Frances Trim Trimble schoolteachers who had moved to Arkansas from Louisiana and had settled at Bauxite. His father taught before working for Alcoa and his mother taught English to generations of students – including Trimble and his sister. After attending the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville Trimble went to work as a reporter for the Texarkana Gazette then moved to Little Rock and the Arkansas Gazette where he was as a reporter and columnist. Trimble later worked for the Arkansas Times and the Pine Bluff Commercial. His boss at Pine Bluff was Jane Ramos and they later married. Jane and Mike moved to Texas when she was named publisher of the daily Weatherford Democrat and Mike became a copy editor and reporter city editor and finally editorial writer for the Denton Record-Chronicle. He remained there until the end of his journalistic career. Trimble's writing though cherished by legions of readers wasn't always popular with the patriciate. He ruffled feathers in several episodes of reporting. At a dinner at the Little Rock Country Club for a visiting Black leader he wrote that the only people of color other than the honoree were wearing white coats the attire of Club waiters. His described the new Dillard Department Stores building in Little Rock as looking like ""the ugliest church in Tulsa"" angering a major advertiser. Trimble was always modest about his achievements. His daughter and grandchildren knew him more as a loving dad and grandpa than as a famous writer. He was his daughter's helper and chief supporter as she faced the challenges of single motherhood his granddaughter's faithful escort at years of father-daughter dances a loyal fan of his grandson's sports teams and a combatant in numberless Uno games with both grandchildren. Trimble is survived by daughter Erin Trimble Gray of Little Rock; his grandchildren Camryn and Turner; his sister Pat Patterson and her husband Carrick of Little Rock his niece Julia Taylor of Little Rock her husband Mallory and their daughter Mary Ruth; his nephew John Patterson of Atlanta John's daughter Josephine and Meranda Barks of Denton his friend and helper.

Twenty-three years ago along with John Hume we finalised what became known as the Good Friday (or Belfast) Agreement.

It was intended to end the 35 years of terrorist violence that had cost thousands of lives in Northern Ireland and beyond and to deal with the sectarian community divisions that had allowed terrorism to fester.

For the Ulster Unionist Party of which I was then the leader there were unpalatable compromises to swallow.

Terrorists were released from prison under a very generous release scheme. Those who had taken part in terrorist activities were encouraged to participate in democracy and indeed some leaders of such terrorist groups became members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and even ministers in the Executive.

Political structures were set up for North/South cooperation — a development of which many unionists were suspicious believing with some merit that they could be used to lever Northern Ireland away from the United Kingdom.

Such structures had led to the collapse of the Sunningdale agreement in 1973 between the British and Irish governments. But this time we got the wholly transparent bottom-up structures including all the major Northern Ireland parties right.

Massive changes were embedded into the police which had borne the brunt of the terrorist campaign – changes which have proved difficult to absorb. Despite all these compromises the majority of people in Northern Ireland endorsed the agreement.

They did so on the basis that Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the UK could not be changed – a commitment I had secured at great political and personal cost from the British government the Irish government nationalist leader John Hume and the leadership of Sinn Féin.

All the parties agreed that any such change would require the consent of the people of NI in a referendum. The declaration at the very top of the agreement stated clearly that it would “be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of the majority of its people”.

• Scroll down for book review of ‘The Idea of the Union’

Despite strong opposition within my own community who resented the concessions to those engaged in indiscriminate killing I campaigned for a Yes vote in the referendum on the agreement arguing that it made the Union safe and that the future of Northern Ireland was totally in the hands of its people through the ballot box.

They put their trust in my assurances and gave me and the agreement their backing.

That is why I feel betrayed personally by the Northern Ireland Protocol and it is also why the unionist population is so incensed at its imposition.

The protocol rips the very heart out of the agreement which I and they believed safeguarded Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and ensured that democracy not violence threat of violence or outside interference would or could ever change that.

Make no mistake about it the protocol does not safeguard the Good Friday Agreement. It demolishes its central premise by removing the assurance that democratic consent is needed to make any change to the status of Northern Ireland. It embodies a number of constitutional changes that relate to Northern Ireland.

Firstly every EU law regulation and directive made in respect of agriculture manufacturing environment work practices and other matters will continue to apply to NI even though the rest of the UK is now free of them. The list of EU laws with which NI will have to comply runs to 70 pages and contains hundreds of thousands of regulations.

Secondly any future laws made by the EU in respect of these areas (covering nearly 70% of our economic activity) will also apply to NI. No Northern Ireland input into these laws will be allowed so even if the content of EU laws is damaging to us we will not be able to make representations or to have them changed.

Thirdly regardless of how damaging future EU enforced laws might be they will have to be obeyed – otherwise the European Court of Justice will be able to enforce sanctions on the United Kingdom.

In other words a court based in a foreign jurisdiction will supersede courts in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Fourthly as the UK decides how it wishes to exercise its new freedom from the EU in order to make its economy more competitive in global trade any new laws it makes to achieve that competitiveness will not apply to Northern Ireland because of the requirement to abide by EU law.

This massive change in the constitutional position of NI is already manifesting itself in economic disruption through physical checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland extensive bureaucratic requirements a serious escalation in the cost of doing business between GB and NI and time delays in receiving goods to the point where many GB firms have simply stopped supplying goods to NI.

This political betrayal and these economic costs have already raised tensions in Northern Ireland. So far from keeping the peace the protocol risks a return to violence despite claims from its supporters that it is all about protecting the Agreement.

To those who make such claims I respectfully say ‘Read the agreement and then tell me what part of the agreement is protected by the protocol’.

The sad fact is that the threat to peace and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland as a result of the protocol is totally unnecessary. The EU has nothing to fear from the minuscule level of trade that crosses into its territory from NI and even that trade could be regulated without any need for checks on the border between NI and the Republic.

Through the Centre for Brexit Policy I have already put forward an arrangement that would require the UK and the EU to put in place a system for the mutual enforcement of each other’s regulations that would apply to the small number of firms currently involved in cross-border trade.

This would mean that firms selling into the Republic from Northern Ireland or vice versa would have to declare on their export documentation that they had adhered to the regulations in the other jurisdiction. If spot checks when the goods arrive or subsequent inspections at the point of sale discovered that the declaration was false the business would be pursued by the authorities in the country in which it was based and stiff mandatory penalties would deter any incentive to act unlawfully.

There are these and other mechanisms for dealing with cross-border trade.

The question is does the political will exist to introduce them or is the European Union intent on playing fast and loose with peace in Northern Ireland damaging its economy and undermining the very basis of democratic decision-making in order to punish the United Kingdom for voting for its independence from the European Union?

For those familiar with the fight over these 213 acres a couple more years might not seem long at all. Since the Archdiocese began marketing the Don Guanella site in 2014 it has caught the attention of prospective buyers seeking to clear the prime location along Sproul Road to develop it.

Though the Marple Township Board of Commissioners stood in opposition to all development plans it could hold off proposals for only so long. So the county jumped into the fight to preserve the property’s forested area as open space.

As it moves closer to pulling that off the County Council also will be weighing its options.

“The county will be undertaking a planning process for its long-term use of the property as a county park and there’ll be a process to incorporate the views of stakeholders both individuals who live near the new park and also other individuals from throughout the county. And that’ll be something that county leadership will be publicizing again probably at the beginning of the new year” Martin said.

County Council members have said that the property likely would remain largely forested but that they would be open to ideas from constituents.

WHYY News asked its Delco audience on Facebook to offer some thoughts on how the land might be used if the county secures it. More than 500 responses were received. Though there were a few whispers about “super” Wawa and Wegmans stores the responses were overwhelmingly in favor of the property remaining green and free of commercial interests. Some pointed to Concord Township Community Park and the Haverford Reserve as examples the county could follow in its green space endeavors.

Ken Hemphill communications coordinator for Save Marple Greenspace said he is glad to see the community opposed to development because that’s the last thing he wants to see there. As a founder of the group he has been fighting development of the property since 2015.

From going door to door and building an email list to attending council meetings and starting a social media campaign Hemphill said Save Marple Greenspace has made it clear that the people want the forest protected.

“We would like those just completely left alone. There is no other wooded park in Delaware County like it” Hemphill said.

While noting that he is not opposed to development at the front of the property Hemphill said the wooded area could become an environmental justice issue because runoff flows into the Darby Creek and excess stormwater could cause floods.

“So we don’t want to see anything that increases stormwater outflow from that site because Darby Eastwick and Upper Darby suffer downstream” he said.

Among the more popular responses to WHYY’s informal Facebook survey called for multi-use trails and parks on the property that everyone could use but that idea is not a new one.

John Serbeniuk of Springfield Township. who has been hiking the Don Guanella property since 2001 said he would like to see some of the trails enhanced and the existing facilities on the property used for sports. He said he places great value in the trees there for cleaning the air in the county especially for those living near the Covanta incinerator in Chester.

Jeremy Grantham legendary investor and pioneer of index fund investing expects today’s sky-scraping stock market to come crashing back to earth.

Grantham recently told Bloomberg that investors who enthusiastically drove the stock market to new heights during a global recession are in for a shock.

“When the decline comes it will perhaps be bigger and better than anything previously in U.S. history” he warned.

Grantham predicted the dotcom collapse and the 2008 meltdown of the real estate market — he’s also in charge of about $60 billion as the investment chief at asset management firm Grantham Mayo & Otterloo — so he’s worth listening to.

Before Grantham’s predictions have a chance to come true let’s look at a few safe haven stocks in GMO’s portfolio. One of them might be worth buying with some of your extra pennies.

United Health (UNH)

UnitedHealth’s quarterly dividend payout currently $1.45 per share and the performance of its stock which is roughly 30% this year suggest that the company is currently in strong financial shape.

But the insurance and healthcare leader is well positioned to weather any long-term financial tumult as well.

Regardless of what happens to the economy Americans will still need healthcare. Millions of them are already UnitedHealth customers.

UnitedHealth is a diversified company. In addition to its thriving insurance business it also provides software and information technology to a number of clinics and hospitals.

As the medical tech space continues to grow so should UnitedHealth’s profits.

U.S. Bancorp (USB)

U.S. Bancorp is the parent company of U.S. Bank one of the country’s largest banking institutions.

Betting on bank stock might seem counterintuitive when a stock market correction is expected to hammer investors’ finances but banks tend to do well in rising interest rate environments: As rates increase the profit margin or spread earned by banks widens.

Rather than turning itself into a casino through the kinds of risky derivative plays that tanked some of its competitors in 2007-2008 U.S. Bancorp has instead been focused on innovating and providing digital service for its customers.

The increased efficiency and lower operating costs that result should be music to investors’ ears.

Since the beginning of 2021 U.S. Bancorp stock has risen by about 31%. Of course if you’re on the fence about jumping in at the current price some apps might give you a free share of U.S. Bancorp just for signing up.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Despite the push for more healthy food and beverage consumption Coca-Cola’s dominance of the soft drink market remains unmatched.

Story continues

But the company’s offerings extend far beyond liquid sugar.

Coke also sells popular bottled water brands Dasani and Smartwater big-name juices like Minute Maid and Simply and international coffee products Costa and Georgia.

What makes Coca-Cola an interesting defensive play is the company’s consistently impressive profit margin which has averaged 23.6% over the last decade. That’s largely the result of Coke’s ability to tinker with portion sizes and prices and having the capital to invest in greater productivity.

A faltering stock market shouldn’t change any of those dynamics.

This year Coke’s quarterly dividend payout hit $0.42 almost double what it was a decade ago. The company’s stock is up roughly 4% since the beginning of the year.

Don’t forget inflation

Grantham says portfolios also need protection from inflation which hit a 31-year high in October.

""This is the first time that inflation the number one predictor of a market downturn since 1925 is being ignored” he said.

At times of high inflation investors often turn to real assets which tend to hold their value. That’s why collectibles — diamonds wine fine art — are taking up an increasing amount of room in modern portfolios.

Investing in fine art no longer requires you to outbid a gaggle of millionaires at some stuffy auction house.

A new platform allows you to purchase shares of modern masterpieces by artists like Andy Warhol Banksy and even Claude Monet — without breaking the bank.

If you’ve traveled in a foreign country such as Costa Rica Portugal or Thailand you may have dreamed about turning your vacation location into a permanent home.

Retiring abroad is an increasingly popular choice for Americans. The U.S. Social Security Administration sent more that 613000 retirement-benefit payments outside the U.S. in June 2014 a more than 150-percent increase from 2002 reported International Living magazine. Those statistics don’t include the thousands of retirees who keep a domestic bank account while living overseas.

No matter your situation retiring abroad successfully requires a lot of research and careful planning. That includes some important considerations such as lifestyle health and finances.

“If you’re optimistic and want an opportunity to reinvent yourself and adapt to a new culture then you’re more likely to enjoy retiring overseas” says Chuck Bolotin vice president for business development for Best Places in the World to Retire in Tucson.

Where to go?

Finding the right location for retirement can be daunting especially if you have the whole world to choose from. There are a variety of “best places to retire” lists generated every year based on research and anecdotes from expats around the world. They not only evaluate how pleasant and peaceful a place is but consider issues such as the cost of living access to healthcare ease of travel weather conditions and a range of other amenities.

Pick as style

There are many different ways to retire in a foreign country: Some people chose to live away from the U.S. full time while others travel back and forth. Most maintain a portion of their assets in the U.S. Bolotin says.

Joe DeVito a financial advisor with RBC Wealth Management in Phoenix has a client who retired in his mid-50s and moved to Thailand. He bought a small hotel there and lives off the income from the property. “He kept about one-fourth of his investment account in the U.S. which I continue to manage with him but he hasn’t touched that money yet” DeVito says.

James Covell a financial advisor and managing director of RBC Wealth Management in New York has several clients who have retired to places such as Israel and the Caribbean. Each has kept a residence in the U.S. to use for visits home and as an investment.

“All of their assets have stayed in the U.S. other than the real estate they have bought overseas” says Covell. “They each have a small account for cash in the country where they live.”

Know before you go

If you’re planning to retire abroad here are three important factors to consider before you go:

Healthcare:

Retirees moving overseas should keep in mind that they won’t be able to use Medicare in that other country but they can find insurance policies to cover them internationally. The cost of healthcare in other countries is often lower than in the U.S. so in many places you can pay out of pocket rather than relying on health insurance. “It’s wise to check if the local hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission International which indicates that it meets high standards” advises Bolotin.

Every country is different so do your research. Find out if there are doctors available who speak English and how easy it will be to see specialist if you have a medical condition. You’ll also need to check on the availability of your prescription medications. Covell says his clients in Israel have access to excellent healthcare but those in Aruba return to the U.S. for their medical needs.

Economic and political stability:

It’s a good idea to get in touch with the foreign consulate and find out more about day-to-day life in your chosen destination. Safety is an important consideration particularly because wealthy Americans can become targets for criminals. “I have clients who spend part of the year in Mexico and they opted to buy property within a Four Seasons resort for security” says Covell. DeVito recommends consulting a lawyer in your home country to explain how to protect your assets while overseas. “It’s important to know about your financial security and safety when you’re living abroad” says DeVito. “We take these things for granted in the U.S.”

Financial implications:

Moving to some foreign countries can lower your cost of living but you should be aware of the legal and tax implications of becoming an expat. For example your Social Security benefits can be direct deposited into a U.S. account and withdrawn at your local ATM. Bolotin says it’s increasingly difficult to open a foreign account because of U.S. federal regulations so many expats keep a U.S. account for larger amounts and a small local bank account if there isn’t a branch of their U.S. bank where they live. He also notes Americans must file a U.S. tax return even if they live in another country.

Exchange rates are a further consideration. DeVito says splitting your assets between American and foreign currency can help mitigate the risk of drastic adjustments. DeVito has a U.S. client who retired in Canada and has been careful to keep an eye on currency rates before moving any money. His client in Thailand benefited from a favorable currency rate when he moved there and immediately converted a substantial portion of his assets into Thai bahts. “I warned him though that rates change all the time and he needs to be careful to keep an eye on it if he wants to return to the states” says DeVito.

Coming home

Retirees moving abroad should also think about how easy it is to travel back and forth to visit friends and family back home. Many retirees choose a destination with decent access to an airport making it easier to stay connected.

Before you seriously consider moving overseas to retire experts agree that it’s always best to spend some time visiting that country before taking the plunge to becoming a regular resident.

International Living encourages you to ask the following questions: “Are you an urbanite or do you prefer the wide-open spaces? Would you prefer a tropical climate with year-round sun or more temperate weather that reminds you of home? Would you rather live by the sea or on a mountainside? Sample the exotic delights of Asia or explore the rich cultural heritage of Latin America?”

Only you can know where you’ll be happiest in your Golden Years."

Ramanathan: I'm going to talk about my experiences with building Piranha and deploying it at Uber to reduce stale feature flag debt. I will provide an introduction to feature flags explain how they can introduce technical debt and the challenges associated with handling the debt. Then I'll discuss our efforts in building Piranha to address this problem and the results that we have observed over 3-plus years. I will conclude with the learnings from this process and provide an overview of potential future directions to this effort.

What Are Feature Flags?

Let us understand what are feature flags using a simple code example. Here we have a code fragment which contains a feature implementation a flag API named isEnabled and a feature flag named SHOW_CUSTOM_IMAGE. If this code is part of an app the value of the flag is obtained at app startup from the server. Depending upon the value of the flag the app behavior can change to exhibit the feature or not. Observe that the same version of the application can exhibit distinct behaviors by simply toggling the flag value. This powerful aspect of feature flags explains their enhanced use in software development.

Why Feature Flags?

Feature flags are quite useful. For example we can have two different customers sitting in opposite corners of the world using the same version of a food delivery app. The user in San Francisco may be rendered an image of granola berries whereas a user in Malaysia and Bangalore may be shown an image of Idli Sambar. The ability to customize user experience can be seamlessly achieved using feature flags. This customization may be due to geography the OS on which the app is used the maturity of the build feature. Further using feature flags optimizes software development costs. These features can be reused and custom features can be modulated according to requirements. Without any additional effort it is possible to provide numerous perspectives of the application to the user and iterate quickly towards an optimal solution.

Benefits of Feature Flags

Apart from being beneficial to provide customized user experience feature flags play a critical role in doing A/B testing. Software development organizations may want to evaluate the value proposition between two features and can potentially roll out an experiment using flags to get real world data.

Feature flags can also be used for gradually rolling out features and can be used as yet another step in the software release process. This ensures that issues that are undetected with static analysis and internal automated testing can be detected before the feature is widely available to our users. Finally they can also serve as kill switches where globally available features can be turned off by simply turning on the kill switch. Given these benefits with feature flags it is not surprising to observe the increased popularity among software developers and organizations.

Using Feature Flags

Using a feature flag in code assuming the presence of a feature flag management system is straightforward. It is done in three steps define the flag. Here a new flag RIDES_NEW_FEATURE is defined. Use the flag by invoking the flag API with the appropriate flag. Here isTreated on the previously defined flag is used to modulate the behavior of the application. Test the flag by decorating the tests appropriately. Here a unit test has an annotation that tests the code with respect to the newly defined flag.

Code Base Evolution

Let us now understand the evolution of code with feature flags. Here we have our example corresponding to a feature flag SHOW_CUSTOM_IMAGE. The if branch contains code related to when custom image is enabled and the else branch corresponds to when the custom image feature is disabled. Subsequently more code and additional features may be added. Here a new feature flag SHOW_CUSTOM_VIDEO is added to differentiate between the presence and absence of custom video features. A code modification may restrict the custom image feature to only premium users and a flag PREMIUM_USER to handle the scenario may be added as shown in the code here.

Stale Feature Flags

With addition of more features and flags it is only a matter of time before feature flags become stale. A flag is considered stale when the same branch executes across all executions. This can happen when the purpose of the flag is accomplished. For example when A/B testing is complete then one feature may be rolled out globally for all users and executions. Good software engineering practice demands that we delete code from the stale branch the code region that will never be executed. Further any other code artifact that is only reachable from this region needs to be deleted. Beyond production code deletions related tests for stale feature flags need to be deleted too. Not deleting the code due to stale feature flags creates technical debt.

In our running example assume after a period of time the team decides to move SHOW_CUSTOM_IMAGE and SHOW_CUSTOM_VIDEO to 100% enabled and disabled respectively. Then on each execution of the application the appropriate conditions will be evaluated to true and false respectively as shown in the slide. The source code continues to carry references to these stale flags and the related debt code. The presence of this code makes it unnecessarily complex for developers to reason about the application logic. Consider the code region at the end of two if statements a developer now has to reason about eight different paths reaching that region when in reality they may just be two paths with the stale codes deleted.

Technical Debt

This additional complexity and technical debt can be reduced by cleaning up the code as shown here. Here when the code is deleted we observe that the custom image feature is only available for premium users and the custom video feature is disabled for all users vastly simplifying the code here. To further emphasize the problem due to stale flags beyond coding complexity here is a real world example of a bug due to a stale feature flag causing financial damage. The bug manifested due to repurposing a flag triggering automated stock market trades resulting in half a billion dollar losses in 2012. In general technical debt due to stale feature flags causes multiple problems. This graph abstracts a control flow graph with nodes corresponding to the flag API and locations. In the presence of a stale branch we see the presence of unnecessary code files which affects application reliability due to reduced effectiveness of testing and analysis tools. Binary sizes are larger as they contain dead code which cannot be removed by compiler optimizations as the value of the flag is known only at runtime. There is additional costs associated with compiling and testing code due to stale feature flags. The payload or flags from server is unnecessarily high carrying flag values that are either globally true or false. Finally it increases overall coding complexity. By deleting code due to stale feature flags we can reduce the technical debt and the corresponding disadvantages. The elephant in the room is the manual effort required to address this technical debt.

Challenges with Stale Flag Cleanup

When we deep dived into this problem further at Uber there were a number of challenges both technical and process oriented. There was ambiguity pertaining to the liveness of the flag as there was no easy way to denote the expiry date for a given feature flag. This raised questions pertaining to when the flag becomes stale. One possibility is that if a flag is rolled out 100% one way and its configuration has not been updated in a while then it can be considered stale. That only serves as a heuristic because kill switches may satisfy this criterion but can never be stale by definition. Second because stale flags accumulated over time and there was churn in the organization cleaning up flags owned by former employees or teams was non-trivial as knowledge pertaining to the current state of the flag and its usefulness in the code was unclear. Even in scenarios where there are about two problems that are not blockers we observed that prioritizing code cleanup over feature development was always an ongoing discussion. Finally the variation in coding style raised questions on how to build an automated refactoring solution to address this problem effectively.

Piranha: Automated Refactoring

At Uber we try to address these challenges due to stale feature flags by building an automated code refactoring bot named Piranha. Piranha can be configured to accept feature flag APIs to support SDKs of various feature flag management systems. It accepts as input the source code that needs to be refactored along with information pertaining to the stale flag and the expected behavior. It automatically refactors the code using static analysis and generates a modified source code. Under the hood it analyzes abstract syntax trees and performs partial program evaluation based on the input stale flag and expected behavior. Using this it rewrites the source by deleting unnecessary code due to stale feature flags and then subsequently deletes any other additional code.

Piranha Pipelines

In our initial iterations we noticed that building a standalone refactoring tool while useful was not the easiest way to gain traction among users. Therefore we built a workflow surrounding refactoring to ensure that the effort required by the end user is minimal. For this purpose we set up a weekly job that queries the flag management system for potential stale feature flags and trigger Piranha accordingly. Piranha performs that refactoring on the latest version of the source to generate stale flag cleanup diffs and assigns it to the appropriate engineers for review. Diffs are equivalent to GitHub PRs and are used internally for reviewing code as part of the CI workflow. If the reviewing engineer considers the flag to be stale and the code changes to be precise and complete they stamp the diffs so that the changes are landed. If more changes are needed beyond the automated cleanup they make more changes on top of this diff get it reviewed and land the changes. If the flag is not stale then they can provide this information so that the diff generation for this flag is snoozed.

Example of a Generated Diff

This slide shows a snapshot of a real Piranha diff that was landed in the main branch sometime back where the red colored regions on the left correspond to deletion of code you still do. I would like to emphasize here that the problem of stale flag deletion is peculiar because the stale code is interspersed with useful code. This is in contrast to dead code in the traditional sense which is usually associated with the specific functions files are published.

Demo

I will now present a brief demo of triggering Piranha diff generation to clean up a stale flag. Here is a Jenkins job to run Piranha Swift for one flag. We want to clean up the flag named demo_stale_feature flag for this demo. The expected behavior is treated. The generated diff needs to be reviewed and for demo purposes I will provide my LDAP. Building this will generate a diff. For this demo I already created a diff as shown here. This diff is authored by piranha-bot and the reviewer is my LDAP. There is a brief description on the purpose of this diff and then the inputs used to generate the diff are listed the flag name the expected behavior who the reviewer is. Then specific processing instructions are provided to the reviewer to validate various aspects: flag is stale cleanup is complete it's correct. If the diff should not be landed then there are instructions pertaining to that also here. To handle merge conflicts there is a link within the diff that can be used to refresh the diff.

This is followed by code changes which shows deletion of unnecessary code. The unit test code removes references to the flag. There is a code change that deletes the else branch as shown here. Then there is deletion of the definition of the flag along with the accompanying comments. Then there is a deletion of field declaration because it was assigned the return of a flag API that invoked it on the stale feature flag. Then related code deletion associated to that. The reviewer can review this diff and if they are happy with it they can simply accept the solution. There is a linked Jira task that contains a description pertaining to what the appropriate flag owner needs to do with the reference to the generated diff. While in this case I have shown the demo by triggering a cleanup diff manually the most common workflow is the automated workflow that generates diffs periodically.

Piranha Timeline for Cleanup

At Uber Piranha has been used for more than three years to clean up code due to stale flags. This graph shows the number of cleaned-up stale flags versus time in months. The initial prototype was available from December 2017 and we enhanced the availability of Piranha to multiple languages over the course of a year and set up the automated workflow. General availability was announced in October 2018. Seeing the positive results we decided to document our experiences as a technical report and open sourced all variants in January 2020. Since open sourcing Piranha we have seen increased usage to clean up stale flags. More recently it has increased even further following an engineering-wide effort to clean up stale flags and improve overall code quality of our mobile apps. As can be observed from this graph we have observed increased stickiness with time.

Code Deletion Using Piranha

We have now deleted more than a quarter million lines of code using the Piranha workflow. This roughly corresponds to approximately 5000 stale flags being deleted from our mobile code bases. This graph shows the distribution of diff counts on y-axis versus deleted lines per diff on the x-axis. A majority of the diffs contain code deletions between 11 to 30 lines followed by code deletions with less than 10 lines. We also noticed a non-trivial fraction of diffs where we see more than 500 lines deleted per diff.

What Piranha Users Think

Beyond quantitative statistics we wanted to get the pulse of what Piranha users think about it and potential pain points that we can help address. For this purpose we conducted an internal survey. We received responses from engineers developing feature flag based code across different languages: Java Kotlin Swift and Objective-C. At least 70% of them have processed more than 5 Piranha diffs. Processing a Piranha diff involves a few things checking whether the flag is really stale and can be cleaned up. Whether the generated code changes are precise and complete any additional changes on top of that generated diff. We also received responses from an almost equal number of engineers who write code for Android and iOS apps respectively. We wanted to understand the average time taken to process a Piranha diff. We found approximately 75% of the respondents consider the processing of Piranha diff takes less than 30 minutes. In fact 35% of the respondents thought that on average a Piranha diff takes less than 10 minutes to process. We also wanted to understand whether our approach to assign this to users was accurate. I'm sure that approximately 85% of users think that we get it right mostly or always. The response to the state of staleness of the flag shows that 90% of the diffs generated are to clean up stale flags. An automated workflow helps to reduce technical debt with reduced manual effort. The metadata corresponding to the stale state of flag and its owner also plays an important role in this process.

The Top 3 Pain Points

We also wanted to understand the top 3 pain points that users face while processing Piranha diffs. The top pain point according to our survey showed that processing diffs are affected when more manual cleanup is needed because it requires context switching. This suggests refining the Piranha implementation to help reduce the manual effort. The required changes here range from handling simple patterns of coding to more challenging problems pertaining to determining unreachability of code regions. The second pain point corresponds to prioritizing the work related to cleanup which can be addressed by setting up organizational initiatives. The third pain point was due to merge conflicts where cleanup diffs conflicted with each other due to changes in code regions. This was because of the time lag between diff generation and diff processing. We were able to resolve this by providing a refresh option within the diff which updates the diff with a code cleanup on top of the latest version of the source circumventing the problem. The remaining pain points were due to more info pertaining to the feature flag and are being blocked by additional reviews due to operating on a mono repo code base. We also received free text feedback from a few users as seen here.

Learnings 1: Benefits of Automation

There have been many learnings with the usage of Piranha. We have noticed benefits due to automation as it helped improve overall code quality and was able to reduce technical debt with minimal manual effort. Interestingly we also noticed that the automation was able to detect many instances where flags were rolled out incorrectly or not rolled out at all. These issues would not have been discovered in the absence of this workflow. Further the automated cleanup handled complex refactorings seamlessly where manual changes could potentially introduce errors. Finally a surprising side effect of the Piranha workflow with regular usage was that it steered engineers into writing code in a specific manner so that it becomes amenable to automated code cleanup. This ensured simplicity of feature flag related code along with enabling better testing strategies.

Learnings 2: Automation vs. Motivation

The second set of learnings were on automation as compared to motivation. Initially I found it quite surprising that even in instances where code cleanup was not complete developers were happy to make changes on top of the diff to clean up code. The only downside was the slowing down of process due to additional manual effort. The second surprising aspect was that even when the code cleanup was complete there were instances where the changes were not landed to the main branch. In these cases organizational prioritization becomes important. It goes without saying that there are no replacements for a motivated engineer.

Learnings 3: Process Enablers

Finally there are various aspects that ensured that technical debt due to feature flags is kept under control. Automated refactoring is one part and there are other critical pieces. These include management of the ownership and the flag lifecycle prioritizing source code quality supporting infrastructure to validate the correctness of the changes and review policies associated with automatically generated diffs. Integrating these aspects enables a better software developer experience with feature flags.

Open Questions in the Domain

While we had looked at reducing technical debt due to stale feature flags there are still many open questions in this domain. What is the cost of adding a feature flag to code given the complexities it introduces in the software development process? What are the costs incurred due to an incorrect rollout? There is additional developer complexity with the presence of feature flags. A more detailed investigation needs to be done to understand the software engineering cost of developing in code bases with many feature flags. Enabling 100% automated cleanup has many interesting technical challenges at the crossroads of static analysis and dynamic analysis which merits further exploration. Then there is the question of performance. What are the runtime costs associated with widespread use of feature flags? Are there compiler optimizations that are disabled due to the presence of feature flags? Will they affect binary sizes and app execution times? Finally how do we prioritize handling the software development costs related to feature flags and incentivize developers to address the technical debt associated with it collectively?

Future Directions

Beyond the fundamental questions associated with flag based software development there are many future directions of engineering work related to Piranha. Improving the automation by handling various coding patterns. Implementing deep cleaning of code extending to other languages. Building code rewriting for applications beyond stale flag cleanup using this framework correspond to one dimension of work. The second dimension is extending and applying Piranha workflows to various feature flag management systems code review systems and task management systems which can help engineers tackle this problem in other software development organizations. The third dimension is the work on improving the flag tooling to simplify the software development process with feature flags. Working on the future directions requires more engineering work. Piranha is available as open source at this link github.com/uber/piranha. We welcome engineering contributions to our efforts. In fact Piranha variants for JavaScript and Go are completely external contributions.

Summary: Story of Piranha

In 2017 there were questions on designing solutions for handling stale flag debt. In 2019 Piranha was being used by users to clean up stale flags and was gaining popularity. In 2021 Piranha is now part of regular developer workflow. There are questions being asked on how we can improve automation rates with Piranha. This change in narrative from 2017 to 2021 summarizes the story of Piranha.

Questions and Answers

Losio: I'm really impressed by the numbers you mentioned a quarter of a million lines already removed 5000 stale flags. That's quite an impressive number. I know that is a big company but they're huge numbers.

Have you explored using Piranha to basically clean up dead code not just related to feature flags? Basically outdated library any other code? I noticed that your already partial addressing is mainly targeted to stale feature flags but I was wondering what's the direction there? What are the options?

Ramanathan: We actually target Piranha for stale feature flags. Also it's a natural question and we explored that problem of deleting dead code because that's another major pain point for most organizations but one of the benefits of automating stale flag cleanup versus dead code is for stale flags there are clear anchor points. There is a clear logical association for what constitutes dead code with respect to a feature flag. Whereas dead code in generality can be spread across the entire code base and now splitting it into multiple chunks and then assigning it and making it compilable and having it run tests successfully is non-trivial. That's one challenge. Then the second challenge is with stale feature flags there are usually a specific owner associated with that single point of contact but with general dead code it's not that trivial to find a specific point of contact because that code could have been iterated upon by different folks. It probably falls within the purview of a team and then trying to drive the cleanup with working with the team as opposed to working with the POC is slightly harder and more challenging. We explored that. We have that in our roadmap as you've seen but haven't fully solved that.

Losio: Actually you already partially addressed my next question ""How do you define the owner of a feature?"" That's really major. How we interact with them in the sense that there are many scenarios where how do you define if it's really stale or if something maybe would be rolled back or something will be used again? Of course yes it's a good point that there's an owner. It's the full engineering team it's not just the developer. Do you have any case where you really need to involve the product owner or to a further discussion if something can be removed?

Ramanathan: In fact this entire workflow wherein we actually post diffs to the appropriate owner and let them review it falls under them. Because we have a heuristic of what probably is likely stale and therefore we say ""This is a likely stale flag. We are going to do a cleanup."" Then the eventual cleanup decision has to be made by the engineer who actually implemented it or in consultation with the team or in consultation with the PPM associated with the product. The final decision to actually land the changes are with the appropriate teams. We don't make that decision further. We just simplify the process of actually bubbling up saying ""This flag has not been changed in configuration for some time now. It's 100% rolled out one way or the other therefore this may be a candidate for cleanup. Here's a change which you can just do a click of a button and then you are done."" Whether you want to do it or not that's a decision that the team has to make.

Losio: Has Piranha made you rethink how you define a stale flag?

Ramanathan: It has in some sense. One of our recommendations is that when we create a flag there needs to be an expiry date associated with the flag that needs to be defined by the owner so that way for kill switches the expiry date can sometime be in the future. Whereas for gradual rollout features it can be time bound. This will also help workflow surrounding Piranha because we don't need to make any heuristics associated with what could be considered stale but rather use the information or the intent that the owner has specified as part of the management system to say ""This is a stale flag based on what you have recorded and now let's clean this up.""

Losio: You just mentioned about coding styles and automation. How critical are specific coding styles at this point to enabling high automation rates in the way Piranha works.

Ramanathan: At Uber we have actually noticed cleanup is happening across Android and iOS apps across multiple teams and multiple apps. It's very interesting like there are certain teams that follow a specific coding style. The style itself makes the cleanup much easier and more automatable. There are teams that may not necessarily follow such strategies. In those cases we will have to over-engineer Piranha to handle those cases. What we have observed based on our users is that initially certain code regions may not necessarily be cleaned up automatically completely. Then the engineers who are actually working on that they quickly see what automation is doable by this bot. When they build new features and add new flags they follow the guidelines that we have placed for creating the feature flag so that when it comes to deleting a test it becomes much more easier by adding annotations as opposed to not having a clear specification on what constitutes a stale code or not. Initially there will be some amount of friction but then eventually with time the coding style changes so that it makes it easy to integrate with the bot.

Losio: You're basically saying that the code that has been written after Piranha was introduced is somehow much easier to handle because the developer already knows that he wants to use that so he's already writing the code in a way that is going to be easier to clean up later. That's really a self-fulfillment process that is really helping out there.

Ramanathan: Particularly this happens after three or four diffs of processing it. Then engineers are also like reviewers on other Piranha diffs for other teams because they may have some reviewing responsibilities for those. Then they also notice that there are certain diffs for Piranha which are just landing access. Therefore they actually invite those practices. In an earlier version of the Piranha workflow we also had a link for the coding events associated with Piranha and that actually had some traction which influenced the coding style that we took.

Losio: What was the most common way to deal with those problems before Piranha? I understand what you're addressing I was wondering if someone never had Piranha before how were you basically working before that?

Ramanathan: There are multiple ways that tech debt due to feature flags was being handled earlier. One was the fix-it weeks. Yearly there would be two or three fix-it weeks. The entire week the team sits and tries to get rid of the tech debt which is essentially a lot of work during that period of time and not much getting done. That was one problem. Then tech debt keeps on accruing for every fix-it week and it becomes much harder to reach completion. That's one thing. Second was there was some automated tooling that was built upon just textual processing like considering code as text as opposed to ASTs. Then trying to rewrite code using Python scripts. This would work for very specific teams. It would be very brittle because you have some additional spaces or maybe assignments and reassignments maybe additional comments and suddenly the entire script will fail and you will not be able to even get the code to compile. It was not a foolproof point. What Piranha was able to do was use ASTs and partial program evaluation to actually ensure that we are able to do as much cleanup as feasible and then provide the opportunity to actually add more engineering effort so that we can eventually reach 100% automation rate at some point in time in the future.

Losio: I understand as well that probably had a very positive impact as well on the morale of the team because if I have to have an iteration where I'm just basically working with technical debts with cleaning up code. It's probably not as exciting as maybe I have to merge some code or I have to fix something at the end but where most of the job has already been addressed in a semi-automatic or automatic way. That's right?

Ramanathan: That's right. In fact the initial variant of Piranha for Objective-C was compiled by the team reaching out to us saying we have to stop all development work for the next two three weeks because we have a lot of nested feature flags and just developing on this code base is becoming much more complex and they wanted a tooling for that. We quickly whipped up a prototype. That's how it took off also in some sense.

Losio: What's the process of integrating Piranha with other third-party flag management systems?

Ramanathan: I think Piranha is configurable as I mentioned. There are JSON files like configuration files present in the code base itself. If you look at the GitHub code base for each variant we actually make it configurable so that for each of the feature flag API you can specify whether it is treated. What behavior is expected? Whether it's a testing API or whether it's an enabling API or a disabling API. Then once that API is configured you will be able to run Piranha with this tool. Typically it could involve maybe 50 to 60 lines of JSON file updates to support 5 to 6 different APIs. This can be done for pretty much any feature flag management system. We only support something that's available within Uber.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2UtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1ob3NwaXRhbGl0eS1xdWl0LXdhZ2VzLXViZXItZWF0cy1kcml2ZXItcmVzaWduYXRpb24tMjAyMS0xMdIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2UtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1ob3NwaXRhbGl0eS1xdWl0LXdhZ2VzLXViZXItZWF0cy1kcml2ZXItcmVzaWduYXRpb24tMjAyMS0xMT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Restaurant manager quit to make same wages as Uber Eats driver,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

Leaving out treats for Santa is a holiday tradition but what about snacks for Santa's helpers?

Not the elves at the North Pole but delivery drivers from places like Amazon FedEx and UberEats who make our holidays run smoothly by working hard to deliver the things we need to make holiday magic happen.

Each holiday season we see Pinterest-worthy pictures of overflowing snack baskets set out for delivery drivers and catch headlines showing viral doorbell videos of drivers' reactions to treats left along their delivery routes. When I first saw these sweet ideas I knew I wanted to leave out snacks for the drivers making rounds in my neighborhood.

I started my own version of the act — a basket of snacks and a cooler of drinks along with a thank you note — last Christmas when delivery drivers were working overtime to ensure holiday gifts got delivered.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic stores were closed or only filling pick-up orders and delivery drivers were inundated with packages and racing from house to house. I was sure that most of the time these hard-working people never heard a thank you from anyone so leaving out a basket of snacks and a cooler of drinks seemed like a simple way to show my gratitude even if I didn't come to the door for every delivery.

And the idea has stuck. As a commerce writer and travel journalist I get deliveries almost every day so I've started leaving snacks out year-round. Over the past year I've become more familiar with my neighborhood drivers and they now know they can stop at my house for a drink or a snack even if they aren't delivering something.

But what does it really mean to delivery drivers when people leave out snacks drinks and other goodies during the holidays or at any time of year?

Jenny Rosado a delivery driver for United Parcel Service (UPS) in Stratford Conn. has worked for the company for 30 years.

""You feel appreciated and loved"" Rosado tells Yahoo Life of customers' kind gestures. ""You know that they appreciate what you do for them.""

Marcellus Chafford a FedEx driver from Madison Ala. says some days these small acts of kindness make all the difference.

""I know it makes a lot of our days because the days are long and the weather's bad and cold"" says Chafford. ""Once we see the snack boxes on the on the porches or outside of the garage it brightens our day.""

But it's not just delivery trucks and postal workers that make the holidays happen: In recent years companies like Shipt and Instacart and food delivery services like Grubhub and UberEats have brought delivery drivers to our doors carrying everything from ingredients for our dinner parties to champagne for our holiday toasts.

Charles B. who chose not to share his last name for privacy reasons makes deliveries in Jacksonville Fla. for UberEats.

""When I see snacks I rarely take them because I drive after dinnertime"" he says ""but I'll always accept a bottle of water or a soda.""

If maintaining a snack stash isn't your thing Rosado mentions she's seen customers leave out other types of meaningful gifts.

""I have a customer who leaves out gift cards for the coffee shop or fast food"" she says. ""When I have my driver helper with me at Christmastime they can have it and use it for a meal.""

""Those are really thoughtful"" she adds ""but it's all really thoughtful. Anything given with love is the best.""

The colder months also mean drivers are out in snow and sleet with shorter daylight hours conditions that make deliveries a bit more challenging. When Jack Frost starts nipping at their noses drivers often seek ways to stay warm.

""During cold weather months I have one customer who makes the best hot chocolate complete with marshmallows"" says Rosado adding that another leaves out disposable hand warmers.

""Those are great"" she says. ""I stuff them into my gloves.""

For those looking to build the best snack basket on the block Yahoo Life asked drivers what they most like to see while making their deliveries.

""Bottled drinks like water and Gatorade are the easiest along with chips and granola bars"" says Chafford. ""Really anything that's not sticky and doesn't require more than one hand to eat is the best thing to leave out.""

The things drivers say they'd be happiest to see along their routes this holiday season are simple: bottled water and sports drinks and pre-packaged cookies potato chips mixed nuts trail mix gummy snacks and beef jerky. And for those who live in colder states a few hand warmers go a long way.

What snacks and drinks are harder to take with you on the road? Drivers say anything sticky or gooey is more likely to get left behind.

""The hardest snacks to eat are the sticky ones – if they stick to the wrapper it makes it tough to eat on the run"" Rosado explains. ""My hands usually get too sticky and then it gets on my handheld computer.""

Chafford mentions canned drinks are hard to drink in big delivery trucks too: They don't have a lid and don't stay cold very long especially since he drives in the South where winters aren't as harsh in northern cities.

And while homemade treats are always heartwarming to see things like cupcakes gooey cookies and caramels can be hard to eat while delivering boxes.

UberEats driver Charles B. says leaving a note near your snack basket is a simple way to let delivery drivers know the treats are for them to take. (Photo: Charles B.)

""Besides snacks the best thing someone can do for delivery drivers is to leave their front porch light on"" adds Charles B. ""You wouldn't imagine how many houses don't leave a light on for drivers so I bring a large flashlight with me on evening deliveries.""

He also says leaving a note near the snack boxes saying drivers can take what they want is helpful.

""As a food delivery driver I never know when items are for me or the person who ordered"" he explains. ""Having a sign directly above or next to the snack baskets is helpful to know what I'm allowed to take with me.""

At the end of the route ... or day ... drivers say it's just nice to feel appreciated.

""They are giving us something because they care about us and appreciate what we do for them"" says Rosado. ""That's really what leaving these snack boxes out is all about showing someone that you appreciate them and what they do.""

Postal workers who recall packages and letters piled up in distribution hubs are better prepared this time as they gear up for another pandemic crunch. But low product inventories and port and supply chain disruptions are creating new uncertainty about getting gifts delivered.

Already workers are seeing a surge in holiday packages that began several weeks ago.

“A lot of the workers are saying ‘Oh no. Here we go again’” said Scott Adams local president of the American Postal Workers Union in Portland.

The U.S. Postal Service and private shippers UPS and FedEx are bolstering their hiring — bringing in about 230000 temporary workers — and taking other steps to ensure they don’t become overwhelmed by packages.

Nearly 3.4 billion parcels are expected to crisscross the country this holiday season representing an estimated increase of about 400 million compared to last year said Satish Jindel from Pennsylvania-based ShipMatrix which analyzes shipping package data.

When cards and letters are included the U.S. Postal Service said it’ll be delivering more than 12 billion items.

“The pandemic is still here. The supply chain is a challenge that’s going to impact how people shop and how products move” said Mark Dimondstein president of the American Postal Workers Union which represents more than 200000 postal workers.

Despite the precarious situation the Postal Service UPS and FedEx are in better shape to handle the peak volume and several trends could work in their favor Jindel said.

More people are shopping in stores compared to last year and people have been placing online orders earlier because they’re keenly aware of supply chain problems Jindel said. Also with workers returning to offices there are fewer office supply shipments being made to homes he said.

Most importantly the shippers are adapting after their rough-and-tumble experience last year he said.

U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy who faced withering criticism last year but reported on-time improvements and reduced operating losses this month says the service is ready for the crunch.

“We are ready so send us your packages and your mail” he said.

A year ago more than a third of Postal Service first-class mail was late by the time Christmas arrived.

Tractor-trailers stuffed with mail were left idling outside some postal-sorting facilities. Packages and letters piled up in distribution hubs. Delays grew by days and then weeks in many instances.

Two things were painfully obvious. More workers and more space were needed — and both are being addressed.

To get a handle of the volume the Postal Service is transitioning more than 30000 non-career employees to the ranks of career employees by peak season hiring 40000 seasonal employees and leasing extra space at more than 100 locations to ensure there’s room for parcels.

The Postal Service installed more than 100 new package sorting machines as of early November part of $40 billion of planned investment over 10 years. Also more than 50 package systems capable of sorting large packages are expected to be deployed before December. Combined these expand capacity by an additional 4.5 million packages per day officials said.

UPS for its part is hiring more than 100000 seasonal employees across the country and continues to add aircraft and automation. It expects nearly 90% of its packages to flow through automated facilities by year’s end.

FedEx meanwhile is in the process of boosting its nationwide workforce by 90000 across its operating companies. Most of those new workers are expected to remain after the holidays the company said.

Well there may be a way to achieve what you’re thinking.

But before we go any further please know that the way isn’t to become a singer. One you may lack the prerequisite talent for that. Sorry. And two you may not have the time to stomp shout and sweat your way into wide popularity.

This is why your best option is to do the next and more logical thing: become an investor in the arts.

By “investor” we mean anyone who starts a business that supports the production and performance of entertainment; and by “the arts” we’re referring to pop music and Nollywood.

This if you’re wondering I have extrapolated from my discussions with actor model and film entrepreneur Kevwe Ogunje. “If you go into equipment rentals you can never be broke” Kevwe said.

This is so because the famously prolific $6.4 billion Nigerian film industry is constantly shooting a movie TV series Web series skits documentaries and commercials. This relentless buzz of activity requires a ton of production tools so much so that more often than not “demand beats supply.”

And it’s uncanny to hear Kevwe use the words he used because Cyril Ogoro voice over artiste actor and producer had earlier uttered them in his conversation with me about the same subject.

In describing the openings that one might find in this rental venture he’d said straightaway that it was pretty common to not find the rigs one might need even if one was lugging around a pocketful of cash. “There are times you’ll be looking for lights but you’ll not find any” Cyril said.

If you’re familiar with Nollywood royalty you may easily guess that Cyril is connected to Kingsley Ogoro revered producer and director of the Nollywood classic film series Osuofia in London.

Cyril and Kingsley are cousins — and Cyril confirms that he’s not only learnt film production from his older relative but has also picked up the skills needed to run the supply of filming equipment from Kinglsey whose Klink Studios currently rules the market with an inventory said to be worth $10 million.

Should you suddenly feel like visualising the implication of Nollywood’s prolificacy you must start by visiting the Klink warehouse in Lagos. It should be worth it even if your eyes end up being overwhelmed by the monumental assembly of industrial-grade gadgets — from electric generators to trucks to dollies grips cranes lights and some of the most advanced Alexa and RED cameras.

However while Klink’s grand status may intimidate the film industry novice it remains quite easy to break into the business even if your start-up fund is only in the tens of millions. As Kevwe and Cyril said you can comfortably say you are in business if you do have N50 million but if you can only start small you should be okay with N10 million.

“Just avoid the cameras though” Cyril said. “Cameras are costly. And apart from that the technology is fast developing. What you bought for millions in 2021 may be seen as obsolete in a couple of years. Unless you’re buying cameras for personal use I’d advise that you invest instead in lights and outside broadcasting [OB] instruments.”

Yes while that’s a good idea Kevwe thinks with some street smarts you may still choose to go for a certain type of camera. He said “If you’re looking at budget cameras like the Black Magic which should still be in demand for at least two years with 10 million you’ll be able to buy three cameras with good lenses. And trust me those cameras never sit idle. You will make very good ROI in good time.”

The keyword in this case however is “budget.” Kevwe’s own company Rave Rentals targets “budget productions — people who spend two to three million naira to produce a film.” After listening to him for just five minutes I knew he was pleased with the trajectory of his enterprise. Then I asked him as I also did Cyril if one might need to first intern somewhere before plunking down millions of naira.

“It’s just a street business.” I totally got what he meant. To operate a film equipment rental business in Nigeria you would need native Nigerian insights a connection to the market and abundant common sense.

One of such things to know is that the biggest market for what you’re doing is obviously Lagos. Aside from Lagos “Port Harcourt is good” Kevwe said. “Abuja also is good.”

All considered it is tempting isn’t it? What a brilliant even passive angle into the ever more exciting Nollywood game. As a UN study published in October 2021found film industries in Africa could quadruple their current combined $5 billion revenue and create 20 million additional jobs. Well we do know that the lion share of that money and the jobs will be coming to Nollywood the world’s second largest movie industry by volume.

If we drill down just a little bit we can compare Nollywood to Hollywood and imagine the slice of this pie that equipment rental might grab right now and in the not-so-distant future.

In Hollywood according to research by IBIS World the “motion picture and theatrical equipment rental sector” is valued at $ 2.2 billion. Yes that’s in USD and Hollywood is at present much more valuable in money terms than Nollywood. But still do you not feel the lightbulbs as they flick on in your head right now? Do you now see what’s possible?

Jeremy Grantham legendary investor and pioneer of index fund investing expects today’s sky-scraping stock market to come crashing back to earth.

Grantham recently told Bloomberg that investors who enthusiastically drove the stock market to new heights during a global recession are in for a shock.

“When the decline comes it will perhaps be bigger and better than anything previously in U.S. history” he warned.

Grantham predicted the dotcom collapse and the 2008 meltdown of the real estate market — he’s also in charge of about $60 billion as the investment chief at asset management firm Grantham Mayo & Otterloo — so he’s worth listening to.

Before Grantham’s predictions have a chance to come true let’s look at a few safe haven stocks in GMO’s portfolio. One of them might be worth buying with some of your extra pennies.

United Health (UNH)

UnitedHealth’s quarterly dividend payout currently $1.45 per share and the performance of its stock which is roughly 30% this year suggest that the company is currently in strong financial shape.

But the insurance and healthcare leader is well positioned to weather any long-term financial tumult as well.

Regardless of what happens to the economy Americans will still need healthcare. Millions of them are already UnitedHealth customers.

UnitedHealth is a diversified company. In addition to its thriving insurance business it also provides software and information technology to a number of clinics and hospitals.

As the medical tech space continues to grow so should UnitedHealth’s profits.

U.S. Bancorp (USB)

U.S. Bancorp is the parent company of U.S. Bank one of the country’s largest banking institutions.

Betting on bank stock might seem counterintuitive when a stock market correction is expected to hammer investors’ finances but banks tend to do well in rising interest rate environments: As rates increase the profit margin or spread earned by banks widens.

Rather than turning itself into a casino through the kinds of risky derivative plays that tanked some of its competitors in 2007-2008 U.S. Bancorp has instead been focused on innovating and providing digital service for its customers.

The increased efficiency and lower operating costs that result should be music to investors’ ears.

Since the beginning of 2021 U.S. Bancorp stock has risen by about 31%. Of course if you’re on the fence about jumping in at the current price some apps might give you a free share of U.S. Bancorp just for signing up.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Despite the push for more healthy food and beverage consumption Coca-Cola’s dominance of the soft drink market remains unmatched.

Story continues

But the company’s offerings extend far beyond liquid sugar.

Coke also sells popular bottled water brands Dasani and Smartwater big-name juices like Minute Maid and Simply and international coffee products Costa and Georgia.

What makes Coca-Cola an interesting defensive play is the company’s consistently impressive profit margin which has averaged 23.6% over the last decade. That’s largely the result of Coke’s ability to tinker with portion sizes and prices and having the capital to invest in greater productivity.

A faltering stock market shouldn’t change any of those dynamics.

This year Coke’s quarterly dividend payout hit $0.42 almost double what it was a decade ago. The company’s stock is up roughly 4% since the beginning of the year.

Don’t forget inflation

Comaniciu Dan/Shutterstock

Grantham says portfolios also need protection from inflation which hit a 31-year high in October.

""This is the first time that inflation the number one predictor of a market downturn since 1925 is being ignored” he said.

At times of high inflation investors often turn to real assets which tend to hold their value. That’s why collectibles — diamonds wine fine art — are taking up an increasing amount of room in modern portfolios.

Investing in fine art no longer requires you to outbid a gaggle of millionaires at some stuffy auction house.

A new platform allows you to purchase shares of modern masterpieces by artists like Andy Warhol Banksy and even Claude Monet — without breaking the bank.

The American health care system is a notorious disaster. On the one hand even “good” private employer-based insurance is often a nightmare to actually use while tens of millions of people have much worse coverage or none at all. At the same time our system is also incredibly expensive—eating up 17 percent of the US gross domestic product or nearly twice what peer rich nations spend on average. Books in Review The Ten Year War: Obamacare and the Unfinished Crusade for Universal Coverage By Jonathan Cohn Buy this book

Our Rube Goldberg mishmash of public and private programs is simultaneously miserly when it comes to people getting the care they need and a colossal pain in the neck to use and somehow it still costs an arm and a leg. If we count insurance premiums as taxes—which makes sense since they are basically mandatory—American workers are the second most highly taxed among all rich nations (behind only the Netherlands). Just our existing tax revenues would be more than enough to fund a universal Medicare-style system as it exists in similar countries. If we could somehow transplant Canada’s system into the United States taxes would actually go down.

Why are we stuck with this expensive broken system? One good answer can be found in Ten Year War: Obamacare and the Unfinished Crusade for Universal Coverage an excellent new book by veteran health care reporter Jonathan Cohn about the political history of health care reform in this country. Cohn shows how repeated failures by both Democrats and Republicans to get a decent policy through our rickety 18th-century constitutional structure led to the strategy that produced Obamacare formally known as the Affordable Care Act—a policy that improved our system in many ways but also entrenched some of its worst elements. For advocates of universal health care of any political stripe Cohn’s book is essential reading.

The story starts in the early 20th century when medicine was being rapidlyrevolutionized to provide treatments that actually worked (as opposed to quackery like bloodletting) and a number of countries were setting up national health care systems. Mutual aid societies proliferated in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries including for the purpose of providing health insurance but their scope and resources were necessarily limited. In the 1930s Franklin Roosevelt considered creating a universal national health insurance system as part of the New Deal but he eventually decided against it for fear that it would “jeopardize Social Security or other proposals” Cohn writes. Harry Truman promoted legislation for such a system in 1945 but opposition from the American Medical Association the insurance lobby and Southern segregationists who worried it would mean integrated hospitals blocked it. Even in the best of times it was very difficult to get anything through the House and Senate and signed by the president let alone sweeping reforms.

Lyndon Johnson took those failures into account when his administration was working up Medicare and Medicaid which apply to the elderly and the poor respectively. Johnson was an unparalleled master of legislative procedure and had enormous Democratic majorities in 1965 but he still aimed his Great Society programs at only those groups—two increasingly difficult-to-insure populations—and did not attempt a more robust and expansive health care policy. By 1970 Medicare and Medicaid covered 21 million and 14 million Americans respectively who were previously uninsured but the programs also provided some handy benefits to medical providers and insurance companies by allowing doctors to make money treating old people and by allowing private insurers to focus on the more profitable employer-based market.

Health care remained off the table for the rest of the Johnson administration; in fact only with a Republican in office did it return to the political front burner. In 1974 Richard Nixon got behind a quite ambitious reform effort but it stalled out when Democrats and the unions thought they could get something better with a Democrat in the White House after Watergate. They were sorely mistaken—Jimmy Carter would prove to be the most conservative Democratic presidential nominee since John W. Davis in 1924 and one reason Ted Kennedy ran against him in the Democratic primary in 1980 was Carter’s refusal to support an ambitious national plan.

Health care remained a dead issue in both parties until 1993 when Bill Clinton tried once again but this time with a more conservative plan one that represented the newly enshrined neoliberal consensus that private markets should be the cornerstone of a universal healthcare program. It too died for a number of reasons including a dishonest propaganda campaign against it and quarrels with members of Congress—especially Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan then chair of the Senate Finance Committee who allowed Republicans to filibuster the bill and who personally detested the Clintons in part because they would not cut welfare benefits for poor mothers before attempting health care reform. Current Issue View our current issue

Ten Year War offers a concise history of these five efforts to provide health care to some or all of the American people but its main focus as its title and subtitle suggest is the political negotiations around the passage of Obamacare in 2009-10 and the ensuing conservative attempts to destroy the program. When it comes to Obamacare Cohn details how congressional Democrats designed their effort around the lessons they had learned from all the previous failures and partial successes. Private insurance would be left mostly untouched so vested medical interests would not do to Obama what they had done to Truman. Congress would take the lead rather than the president imposing his own plan to avoid the backlash seen in the Clinton years. The design for Obamacare was not Democratic in origin; in fact it was based on a plan that Mitt Romney implemented as the Republican governor of Massachusetts which was centered around protecting private insurance and market competition while also insuring those who had fallen through the cracks. As Cohn notes the Obama administration picked this Republican model partly because it hoped to coax some support from the GOP which both Obama and anxious Democratic moderates badly wanted as cover. Republican votes were also desired because Senate Democrats were unwilling to kill the filibuster meaning they would need 60 votes for Obamacare to pass. Moderate Democratic Senator Max Baucus of Montana the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee started the outreach to Republicans by bringing his old friend Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa into the design process.

Despite all the careful planning the political strategy almost didn’t work. All of the efforts by Democrats to get Republicans on board by cadging from Romney and doing whatever they could to appease Grassley achieved nothing. On the contrary the GOP screamed that the plan was rank socialism and after months of stringing Baucus along Grassley (under heavy pressure from fanatics in the Republican base) openly opposed the bill and even repeated the smear that it would lead to the creation of “death panels” implying that under Obamacare health care bureaucrats could decide to euthanize Grandma. To make matters worse when Ted Kennedy died in August 2009 the special election to fill his seat was whiffed by the Democratic candidate Martha Coakley thereby erasing the 60-vote Senate majority that Democrats had had for a few months. White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel with his typical brand of cringe-making timidity masquerading as foul-mouthed bluster kept shouting that the Democrats should just give up.

To Obama’s credit he didn’t. With Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Harry Reid he helped rally the party to get the Affordable Care Act through. They abandoned any attempt at bipartisanship and passed a plan using the budget reconciliation process in the Senate which allowed them to bypass the filibuster. The House then passed the Senate plan even though it was markedly worse than the House’s own version—especially given that it lacked a public insurance option—and Obama signed it into law on March 23 2010. “Looking back it’s remarkable they passed anything at all” Cohn writes.

Cohn is refreshingly open about his biases. He is unabashedly in favor of universal health care and is also firmly in the camp that believes Obamacare was a solid improvement over the status quo. Yet he is also clear-eyed about the policy’s substantial shortcomings. At bottom it was a moderate half-hearted reform—and unlike Romney’s plan in Massachusetts it was passed without bipartisan buy-in and so hastily that many large problems were overlooked. “The Affordable Care Act like the Clinton plan before it was an attempt to achieve the liberal end of universal coverage through a more conservative scheme that relied heavily on competition among private insurers. But the intellectual foundation for that calculation seems increasingly shaky” Cohn writes.

The rollout of the Obamacare exchanges was delayed for years simply to game the 10-year budget window and make the policy seem less expensive than it really was. The opening of Healthcare.gov proved to be a humiliating tech disaster and even when the website was working the exchanges quickly developed a deserved reputation for narrow coverage networks high deductibles and—for people outside the quite small subsidy zone—very high premiums. That was particularly painful for those who made just over 400 percent of the poverty line (about $51000 for an individual) where the subsidies suddenly vanished and especially for those just short of Medicare eligibility. A 60-year-old man who accidentally fell off that subsidy cliff for instance would see his monthly premiums for a silver plan jump from $417 to $870.

The expansion of Medicaid under the act was comparatively successful with far more enrollees than anticipated. But even that improvement was dented when conservative Supreme Court justices rewrote the law to make it optional for states—just one of dozens of attempts to destroy Obamacare through judicial rule by decree—which left out more than 2 million people in the conservative states that refused to participate (though efforts to get the expansion through at the state level in some of these places have seen some success).

Most critically in terms of overall policy Obamacare ended up covering less than half of the uninsured population and its labyrinthine regulations failed to stem the ongoing rise in health care costs which despite a modest slowdown in the years immediately after its passage have continued to shoot into the stratosphere.

Ultimately Cohn concludes correctly that the Obamacare political strategy could not help but lead to a policy cul-de-sac that would never produce genuine universal health care at a reasonable cost. On the merits it is just not very good policy and on the politics buying off all interested parties created a policy that was so complicated and penny-pinching that relatively few people experienced an obvious concrete benefit. Democrats worked themselves to the bone trying to get something passed that would help people without infuriating any of the vested interests that the party had taught itself to fear over the preceding decades and they ended up losing anyway—on net passing the law probably worsened the 2010 midterms defeat the Democrats’ strategy was designed to avoid.

The shortcomings of Obamacare however also taught some valuable lessons. The only realistic way forward I see is ripping off the political band-aid—rather than standing on their hands and trying to please everyone at once the Democrats ought to pass a very aggressive policy that ignores vested interests but provides a really good benefit that voters will appreciate. As Cohn observes the American health care system is still so broken that there is basically no other choice whether the policy framework is single-payer or something else: “The reality is that any system that covers everybody with low out-of-pocket costs and some kind of government control over spending is going to look a lot more like Medicare for All than what the U.S. has now.”

Conversely even a heavily compromised policy like Obamacare has proved to be quite popular with voters. In the House of Representatives Republicans passed dozens of bills repealing the law after they took control of that chamber in 2011. But as Cohn points out when Trump took office six years later with the GOP in control of both the House and the Senate their attempt to finish the job failed thanks to the defection of three Republican senators—no doubt largely because the repeal bill was hideously unpopular with its favorability polling about 25 points underwater. The GOP never even attempted to touch Medicare; surely a policy that was even more generous would be that much more untouchable.

Biden and congressional Democrats did follow something like this suggested strategy in the passage of the pandemic rescue package. The $1.9 trillion bill contains a sweeping overhaul of Obamacare that is almost as ambitious as the original policy. The subsidy cliff was eliminated (though only temporarily at least for the present) and for the first time the exchange premiums should be affordable to everyone costing no more than 8.5 percent of a person’s income. The government will also cover the entire cost of COBRA coverage (again temporarily) so people who lose their jobs can stay on their current private plans for free. And all this was passed on a party-line vote again through reconciliation with much smaller majorities than the party enjoyed in 2010. Burned by Grassley’s duplicity the Democrats barely bothered to even pretend they cared about trying to get Republican votes and just rammed it through.

Unfortunately most of those choices are still designed to prop up the broken private system. The COBRA expansion in particular is staggeringly wasteful—$35 billion to cover perhaps 2 million people which is about three times as costly as putting the same number of people on Medicaid. So far Biden’s campaign promise to put a public option on the exchanges is nowhere to be seen.

Throwing trainloads of money at the extant hideous semi-private health care mess might someday get almost everyone in the United States technically insured. But the coverage will probably not be very good and it will not stop the cost bloat that is devouring the American economy from the inside. If we want true universal health care where anyone who is sick can go to the doctor without the terror of being slammed with an unpayable bill and we want the price of that care not to eat up nearly a fifth of the economy a lot of powerful corporate interests are going to have to take a major hit. Time is short: Democrats may not keep their current razor-thin congressional majorities for long so it’s up to them to take the initiative—and for the rest of us to keep up the pressure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYm9yZ2VucHJvamVjdC5vcmcvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1pbi1ndWF0ZW1hbGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mental Health in Guatemala,"

Between 1960 and 1996 Guatemala faced a civil war between the government of Guatemala and several leftist rebel groups resulting in many deaths due to the destructive violence. This caused many mental health conditions to arise among the people residing in the country. Unfortunately violence and public security continue to be a concern in Guatemala which is deteriorating Guatemalan mental health.

The Importance of Mental Health

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines mental health as one’s emotional psychological and social well-being which affects how one experiences and performs in daily life. To add mental health can help determine how people cope with stress and make choices. Mental health has significant links to physical health because poor mental health can lead to diseases such as diabetes heart disease and stroke.

Guatemalans Facing Mental Health Disorders

More than 3250000 people in Guatemala could experience a mental health illness in their lifetime. However unfortunately many of them do not seek the help they require. In fact one in four people between the ages of 18 and 65 have suffered or continue to suffer from a mental health disorder but only 2.3% took the initiative to consult a psychiatrist to address their mental health issues.

Many people are reluctant to talk about their mental health due to a lack of knowledge on mental health in general and the stigma surrounding mental health in Guatemala. Furthermore Guatemala’s poverty rate increased from 45.6% to 47% in 2020. As a result Guatemalans are at greater risk of developing mental health disorders because they endure more poverty-related stress and face many economic difficulties in their daily lives. The limited mental health sources available to them are insufficient to help alleviate the stress that socioeconomic disadvantages cause.

In the United States most health care providers do not cover expenses for mental health care. Interestingly Guatemala does not have a universal health care system let alone dedicated mental health legislation. As a result Guatemalans have difficulty seeking help because the nation has “0.54 psychiatrists available per 100000 inhabitants” according to the American Psychological Association and only five of these mental health specialists are located outside of the main cities. Guatemala is a low-income country that does not have the resources to make mental health data available to the public which is why there are few studies and limited public data regarding this issue.

Poor Mental Health Among Guatemalan Children

A study conducted by Rosalba Company-Cordoba and Diego Gomez-Baya analyzes the mental health of children in Guatemala. Interestingly 50% of Guatemala’s total population is younger than 18 years old meaning Guatemala is home to a significantly large portion of young people. A child’s mental health is valuable because mental health can have positive or negative long-lasting effects on development.

Unfortunately Guatemala’s high poverty rate has led to increased levels of violence because of desperation and dire living conditions. Exposure to violence showed significant effects on a child’s mental health such as depression and anxiety. Although childhood poverty is prevalent in many areas of Guatemala the quality of life showed little significance in the study. These symptoms were more common in adolescents than in children because adolescents are more aware of their surroundings and environment. On the other hand children exposed to low violence from urban areas with educated parents described higher qualities of life.

Violence rates have continued to increase with assaults shootings threats and robberies causing many children to fear going to school. Almost 60% of Guatemalan students would prefer not to go to school due to fears of violence. Many students and teachers have received threats and experienced robberies or know victims of violence. Guatemala remains one of the most impoverished countries with high rates of violence which poses a higher risk of a child developing mental health disorders.

Living in these socioeconomic disadvantaged areas can sway children to join gangs because there are few other options. The previously mentioned study showed the association between greater parental education level and higher income with lower food insecurity. However many children do not attend higher education schooling because they have to work to help their families afford household essentials. The number of children living in urban areas is increasing which leads to more children in unsanitary conditions and a high cost of living. Almost all children attend primary school however the completion rate is 15% which leads to low enrollment rates for secondary school.

Solutions for Mental Health in Guatemala

Many people have taken action to improve the state of mental health in Guatemala especially for children. First many citizens are taking to the streets to protest against the continuation of violence. The implementation of the International Commission Against Impunity (CICIG) resulted in reductions in homicide rates. For example there were fewer homicides per 100000 people each year. The CICIG provided Guatemala with $150 million in international support to help reform its justice system but President Jimmy Morales thought this violated Guatemalan authority. As a result he removed the CICIG mandate in 2019 causing setbacks in progress.

Next people are beginning to seek support for their mental health in Guatemala due to more specialized centers offering psycho-emotional support services to the public such as Federico Mora National Hospital for Mental Health for a low cost. According to the American Psychological Association Guatemala has about seven psychologists for every 100000 people which is a number that continues to increase.

Lastly schools are playing roles in fighting against gang violence to ensure the safety of children in Guatemala and other countries. With support from UNICEF and the Ministry of Education schools created a Peace and Coexistence Committee. The idea is to promote an environment where schools do not tolerate violence as Theirworld reported. The schools are trying to lead by example and show their students that violence is not the answer noting fewer disputes among students.

Guatemala is working toward a better future by spreading awareness about mental health and fighting violent trends.

Proponents will argue that no organization can proactively protect against threats and manage vulnerabilities and accelerate incident response if it lacks unobstructed visibility into the exact number of applications and devices connected to or trying to connect to the corporate network(s) at any given point in time. Those less bullish on asset management as a silver bullet point to its inherent complexities and the immense challenges brought on by the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT).

Despite the differing perspectives there is almost universal agreement that asset management is a net positive to a company’s overall security posture. Perhaps that’s why so many government agencies — from the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) in the US to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSE) and the European Banking Authority abroad — rank asset management atop their cybersecurity preparedness recommendations.

“Being aware of the assets in an environment how vulnerable they are to threats and how to protect them is an important part of any cybersecurity program” wrote SAP’s Anne Marie Columbo in a recent Forbes article. But just how useful is awareness in itself if organizations aren’t prepared to act on information on a moment’s notice?

Traditional asset management challenges

Asset management has always presented a unique set of challenges for large organizations leaving some to deemphasize the initiative in favor of greater investments into detection and response technologies.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

From a device standpoint simply aggregating the total number of in use and unmanaged applications and machines with connectivity capability can be a years-long headache requiring extensive IT and security resources. This is further complicated by the proliferation of hybrid and remote work due to Covid-19 as well as popular Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies that open corporate networks to devices outside of corporate control.

Even in instances when businesses believe they have complete or near complete visibility into their assets they traditionally haven’t had an easy way to interpret data. Like asset discovery asset inventory analysis has also increased in complexity in recent years primarily due to the acceleration of cloud migration and Internet of Things (IoT) deployments within corporate environments and the shift to edge data centers among other digital transformation and future of work initiatives straining network usage.

All these obstructions have hindered hospitals and health systems from reaching their asset management goals.

Unique complications hinder healthcare asset management ubiquity

For the past decade nation state hackers and cyber-criminals have prioritized attacks on hospitals and healthcare systems because of the treasure trove of lucrative data available for exploitation and due to the inferior cybersecurity defenses inherent to many of their enterprise counterparts. According to the Wall Street Journal “almost every month last year more than 1 million people were affected by data breaches at health-care organizations.”

Even before Covid-19 hospitals and healthcare systems began to flex stronger cybersecurity muscle by increasing budgets and resources. Still it is estimated by Cybersecurity Ventures that the industry in total will only spend $125 billion annually on cybersecurity by 2025. Putting this into perspective Bank of America alone spends more than $1 billion per year on cyber.

While overall spending may not yet correspond to the totality of the cybersecurity threat landscape asset management has emerged as a primary area of opportunity for hospitals and healthcare systems to invest in as they ‘up’ their cybersecurity game and put greater emphasis on risk reduction. But unlike the general enterprise cybersecurity asset management presents three specific challenges that make the undertaking substantially more complicated. These include:

Physician Budgets – While in hospitals and healthcare systems IT purchasing decisions are increasingly being made by committees composed of clinicians C-suite executives compliance and others in many cases physicians maintain their own budgets with which to procure new software and hardware. According to a survey by MGMA in 2017 hospital-owned physician practices were spending $8000 per physician per year on IT; Covid-19 has impacted IT purchasing decisions since then with larger IT implementations being delayed but physicians placing an emphasis on purchases of technologies like telehealth and RPM. Historically physician budgets came without a corporate mandate to inform IT or security teams about purchases no less to help with setup. While this is evolving in parallel with greater security concerns physician technology adoption without IT notification can leave security stakeholders blind to certain assets until such a time when a threat or vulnerability is detected which is often too late to significantly mitigate disruption or damages from occurring.

Massive Influx in Connectivity – Millions of healthcare IoT devices are now being used to care for patients to streamline critical workflows and to communicate with patients. Moreover many of these devices can’t be disconnected because of their critical roles in patient care and IT network infrastructure complexity making it difficult to patch and protect against new threats and vulnerabilities. Further mapping and taking inventory of thousands (and often tens of thousands) of connected assets manually which is how asset management was traditionally done is impossible. Further many of the legacy asset management tools on the market are not built to visualize the communications protocols specific to the healthcare environment.

Network Architecture – Many critical infrastructure sectors utilize layered networks. This means although many OT devices are coming online for the first time that the network infrastructure already exists to transmit communications across the seven network protocols. In contrast healthcare networks are primarily flat and lack segmentation making it more difficult to track inventory and easier for adversaries to compromise and traverse the network.

While traditional and healthcare industry specific challenges to asset management remain problematic the pros of complete network visibility undoubtedly outweigh the cons except for organizations who mistakenly believe that asset management alone is sufficient to measurably reduce risk.

In the next article of this three-part series we’ll explore practical and efficient steps to reduce the burden of asset management in hospital and healthcare systems.

Our findings illustrate a range of practices where healthcare workers establish a relationship with themselves when taking care of undocumented migrants. These healthcare workers identify their own conduct in relation to the accessibility of healthcare services as an object of moral work. The relationship with oneself comprises techniques to guide one’s attention away from the undocumented status and to master one’s affective responses; it comprises practical mental exercises to remind oneself of one’s role/position in the wider healthcare system and one’s commitment to treat all patients equally; it also comprises practices where one transforms one’s bodily attitude towards undocumented patients; and it compromises transformations in one’s clinical practice towards undocumented migrants. Our respondents describe acquiring these practices as a learning process inspired by colleagues who function as role models. These practices enable healthcare workers to relate in an ethical way to the existing limitations to healthcare access of undocumented migrants in ways that sometimes reproduce sometimes transforms these limitations.

Many of our respondents questioned the use of the concept ‘undocumented migrant’. They express awareness of prejudicial practices. In order to avoid that processes of labelling categorization or stigmatization influence their clinical judgement towards undocumented migrants they develop techniques to keep their perceptions and affective responses under control. Such practices of self-mastery have ambiguous effects. First such a politics of ignorance [42] about residence status avoids recognition of the many barriers in access to healthcare due to undocumented status. As a result the healthcare worker does not take responsibility to overcome the impact of undocumented status on the availability of treatments; it becomes the patient’s responsibility to addresses this issue himself. Moreover our findings illustrate that avoiding certain processes of labelling does not protect undocumented migrants from other processes of social categorization. Strategically ignoring patients’ undocumented status goes along with labelling them as so-called precarious patients but also with a racializing gaze [43] as Luc’s quote illustrates and also with processes of othering where migrant patients are portrayed as more fascinating patients or patients with more severe or exotic pathologies as is illustrated by the quote of Francine.

Other practices of the self consist of exercises to remind themselves to reorient their way of relating to undocumented migrants to direct their attention away from discriminatory government procedures and to suppress their own affective responses. Respondents also reported transforming their body language to embody distance from authorities and approximation towards undocumented migrants. These practices are cognitive exercises although they clearly also contains aesthetic elements. In this way respondents showed to be reflexive about the strategic importance of care practices. These practices of the self function as a way of avoiding that care practices support the scrutiny of undocumented migrants or the exclusion of undocumented from the public healthcare system. Moreover earlier research shows that these hardly visible forms of resistance went beyond mere practices of the self and also consisted in challenging healthcare workers that formed an immediate barrier to healthcare access as expressed through Foucault’s notion of counterconduct [30 37].

However some healthcare workers also express a sense of meaning in the limitation of the available healthcare services or in limiting them for themselves. They focus on training themselves by developing or rediscovering clinical skills that allow them to take care of undocumented migrants within these limitations. They express an aesthetic experience of excellence or feeling useful together with feelings of excitement and fascination. Interpreted this way these care practices (as practices of the self) rather take the form of finding pleasure freedom or feelings of virtuousness in one’s capability of self-limitation or one’s ability to comply with a norm imposing limitations [13]. By undertaking conscious effort to practice a different more minimalistic kind of medicine these healthcare workers cultivate an ideal of good medicine that is associated with parsimony moderation and professional excellence. In other words these self-practices transform their care work into a profession that carries certain aesthetic qualities without subverting the structural constraints imposed on them.

Questioning the biopolitical subject

Our findings show that practices of the self not necessarily always should be interpreted as resources for resistance or counter-conduct in response to restrictions in healthcare access. These findings resonate with Mahmood’s [22] interpretation of Foucault’s work questioning the tendency in poststructuralist scholarship to read practices of the self only in terms of resisting the dominating powers. The stress some respondents put on the pleasure they found in coping with the experienced limitations in healthcare access shows that these practices can also be focused on the individual satisfaction; putting particular emphasis on self-cultivation [45]. Nevertheless we argue that our findings challenge the current views on care of the self in biopolitical analyses of humanitarianism. Scholars in the field of humanitarianism have understood “care of the self” mainly as a practice of healthcare workers procuring their own needs [37] and a way in which healthcare workers can fashion themselves as more enlightened persons [38]. In this view (humanitarian) care work produces subjectivities that sustain conform and align with practices of government [38]. Contrarily our study illustrates how healthcare workers can (trans)form themselves as an active ethical subject in a context of humanitarian government of migrants. In the context of our study self-cultivation also generates a new subjectivity notably one of healthcare workers aspiring to practice (as) excellent medicine with less means. In line with Foucault’s views the subject can be free within the constraints of the government and create new forms of subjectivity [13 17 46]. This contrasts with the passive and docile subject set forth in biopolitical analyses of humanitarianism.

As useful as biopolitical analyses are for understanding how power works through humanitarianism and care the concept (and the way it is applied) also has important analytical constraints. A biopolitical analysis obscures how those working in the health care sector actively relate to efforts to control migrants. It obscures how healthcare professionals function as subjects in the context of these power relations and how they can acquire a certain independence towards processes of normalization and surveillance. Within the wider society those providing care do not always hold a powerful position [47].The majority of the jobs in migrant care services are filled by women and “‘feminized’ others” with relatively low wages and substantial voluntary work [48 49]. These jobs are often valued in feminized qualities such as empathy serving… Their activities are often devalued or marginalized [49]. Biopolitical analyses of healthcare to migrants somehow reproduce this marginalization by framing healthcare workers as merely being obedient instruments of humanitarian government merely interested in “caring for their disconcerted selves” [38].

Moreover such analysis also has normative constraints. In a biopolitical analysis of humanitarianism nobody seems to be doing what they say; or what they do never has the intended effect. As a result moral sentiments associated with care for a “distant other” are often regarded with reluctance mistrust or sheer cynicism [50]. This can nourish apathy distance and cynicism among healthcare workers. A range of uncertainty and/or ugly feelings become associated with the (humanitarian or deontological) imperative to care in ways that benefit distant others [50 51]. Biopolitical analyses of humanitarianism take a largely negative and critical orientation towards care practices harboring moral aspirations without taking responsibility for what should replace them.

The (ir)relevance of counterconduct

Many respondents described their practices as a way of challenging institutional practices. Some tried to eliminate individual subjective prejudices by avoiding the use of state-imposed categorizations. Others challenged the restricted healthcare for undocumented migrants by adopting specific practices of the self in interactions with this particular group. In other words the practices present a mixture of universalizing and categorical approaches [36]. In both cases these practices of the self can be understood in terms of activist practices of healthcare workers who are self-aware of the power relations in which they are involved. However several critics of Foucault question whether practices of the self are well fit as instruments for challenging the biopolitical effects of care even when intended as such [52]. They argue that practices of the self do not lead to engagement in collaborative political projects with others nor in strategies to counter the depoliticizing effects of biopower [45 53]. Respondents did indeed describe these practices of the self as very personal. Similarly to what our respondents described about more visible practices of dissent they describe practices of the self as an individual ethical choice. They generally expressed tolerance or even indifference towards colleagues who make other choices. In this regard practices of the self bear an individualist connotation. The responsibility for ethical clinical practice towards undocumented migrants is transferred to the individual healthcare worker.

In addition to this practices of the self were mainly described by respondents in clinical settings. They were described by healthcare workers working both in humanitarian organizations and the public healthcare sector. They were mentioned far less by receptionists and social workers in social welfare services where the primary focus is on administrative procedures and where clinical considerations are less present. Healthcare workers trying to behave ethically in clinical contexts do not just rely on the application of abstract principles codified ethical standards or laws [31]. Foucault argued that practices of the self are mainly an important element in systems of codes that are rather rudimentary. He described it as an ethics that was somehow disconnected from strict prescriptive systems defining stringently what is permitted and forbidden [13]. Professional codes such as modern medical ethics for example do not attempt to provide ready-made answers in the context of clinical practice [54]. This provides more room to individual healthcare workers to develop ethical practices in relationship to oneself.

However earlier research showed that undocumented patients negotiating healthcare access mainly interact with receptionists who operate in a much more prescriptive and regulated work environment [44 55]. In other words these practices of the self described by clinicians might take place in a clinical setting that is already foreclosed. Foucault also pointed to these complexities of an ethics relying on practices of the self: he mentioned that practices of the self can become integrated into wider structures of domination resulting in a versatile equilibrium between practices that assure domination and practices through which the self modifies itself to become a different kind of subject [56].

Care of the self … or care?

Our findings show that practices of care of the self also impact on the care relationship. One respondent for example mentioned attaching in a different more tempered way to ensure that undocumented patients can access the public system. Critics of Foucault have argued that the individualist character in Foucault’s account of the care of the self is not only in contrast with political collaborative projects but with collective practices in general [45]. Meyers argues that care of the self detaches a person from their relations with others and furthers the segmentation of individuals. The care relationship is a social relation that involves interaction dialogue mutuality and reciprocity. Allen [57] finds that the relations with others in Foucault’s account of care of the self are unsatisfactory as a basis for ethical practices as they do not establish responsiveness mutuality and reciprocity. In line with feminist views she states that ethical practice should take particular relations with concrete others as a starting point.

Foucault [12] described practices of the self as a communal activity proposed by one’s society or social group and requiring the support of friends and family. He also stressed the role of lessons of a mentor in acquiring practices of the self. Similarly Mayes [58] showed that practices of the self resisting against the body norms in all kind of lifestyle-advices are a form of collective resistance involving relations with others and guidance by a ‘master’ figure. Papadimos et al. [59] argue that practices of the self in mentoring and medical teaching also implies care of the political life requiring engagements in hospital committees and support of colleagues. In the interviews several of our respondents refer to the importance of senior colleagues as role models in developing these practices of the self. The quote form Marie also illustrated that such practices can be worked out together with colleagues and can be part of a wider professional culture. Although this implies a relation with others these others largely seem to involve members of the same social group in our case notably fellow healthcare workers.

Moreover practices of the self aimed at providing equal quality of healthcare for undocumented migrants are not easily reconcilable with realities of competing demands and requirements of priority-setting in healthcare settings. Day-to-day care practices are characterized by many relationships with individuals with varying degrees and kinds of dependence [60]. Furthermore biomedical science (and socialization of junior healthcare workers within medical institutions) relies heavily on categorical thinking allowing healthcare workers to differentiate between subgroups of patients in order to standardize the management on the level of subgroups and provide care in an efficient way [14]. The ethical conduct described by our respondents is focused on avoiding or modifying the use of one specific category. This conduct is disconnected from the wider context that is characterized by processes of categorization and inherent limitations in the possibilities for responsiveness. Therefore the ethical relevance of these practices of the self remains ambivalent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC1ldXJvcGUtaXNsZS1vZi1tYW4tNTk0MzIzMzbSAT5odHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtZXVyb3BlLWlzbGUtb2YtbWFuLTU5NDMyMzM2LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fair model for social care funding on Isle of Man sought,

The projects are controversial netting roughly 750 comments to the Iowa Utilities Board through February. Many have been objections with Iowans questioning whether the pipelines are needed are safe and should be allowed to cross valuable farmland that's been passed down through generations.

Here's what we know so far about the projects.

What's been proposed?

Three companies — Summit Carbon Solutions Navigator CO2 Ventures and Archer Daniel Midlands Co. partnering with Wolf Carbon Solutions — want to build pipelines that will be used to move carbon dioxide captured from ethanol fertilizer and other agricultural industrial plants.

The companies plan to use pressure to liquify the carbon dioxide transport it and then inject it deep underground where it will be permanently sequestered. Summit Carbon plans to sequester carbon in North Dakota; Navigator CO2 and ADM in Illinois.

Summit and Navigator have started the process to get hazardous liquid pipeline permits from the Iowa Utilities Board. Summit says the project which the company calls the world's largest will cost $4.5 billion; Navigator $3 billion.

No details are available on the cost of ADM's project.

Summit has filed a petition with state regulators requesting a pipeline permit and the utilities board has started reviewing the request.

Where would the pipelines be built?

Summit an Ames company that calls its project Midwest Carbon Express proposes building about 680 miles of pipeline across 29 of the state's 99 counties. Altogether it would travel 2000 miles across and into four other states: Minnesota North Dakota South Dakota and Nebraska.

Texas-based Navigator CO2 which calls its project Heartland Greenway System wants to build roughly 900 miles of pipeline across 36 counties. Altogether it would cross 1300 miles and also reach into Illinois Nebraska Minnesota and South Dakota.

Summit says it would sequester carbon from 31 biofuels plants; Navigator has reached agreements with about 20 ethanol and fertilizer plants.

ADM a Chicago-based agricultural company and Denver-based Wolf Carbon have proposed capturing carbon dioxide from ADM's ethanol plants in Cedar Rapids and Clinton and moving it through a 350-mile pipeline to Illinois where it would be permanently sequestered.

Why are the projects proposed?

The companies say the projects would help ethanol and other energy-intensive ag industries remain viable as the nation seeks to cut net greenhouse emissions in half by 2030 to address climate change.

Summit says carbon sequestration would help lower ethanol's carbon footprint to net zero by 2030 and allow it to be competitive in California and other states with low carbon fuel standards.

Ethanol is important in Iowa the nation's largest producer of the renewable fuel and its largest corn grower. About half the crop is used each year to make ethanol. But the industry faces a rocky future given President Joe Biden's push toward electric vehicles to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. Most U.S. gasoline is blended with 10% ethanol.

More:Will Biden's push for electric vehicles kill ethanol? Not if he wants to cut carbon emissions now its supporters say

Summit says it has the capacity to capture up to 12 million metric tons of carbon annually an amount equal to removing 2.6 million vehicles from the road each year.

Navigator says its pipeline has the capacity to capture about 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually the equivalent of removing 3.2 million vehicles from the road.

ADM and Wolf expect to transport 12 million tons a year.

Are the pipelines a good environmental solution?

The White House says carbon sequestration projects likely will be needed needed to meet President Joe Biden's climate goal of net-zero emissions economywide by 2050.

But Mark Jacobson a Stanford University civil and environmental engineering professor said that carbon capture systems so far have failed to meet the promises of significantly reduced emissions.

For example a carbon capture system at a Texas coal power plant cut emissions 55% the first year and 70% after three years. But the company which used the carbon to extract oil claimed it would capture 90% or more of the emissions Jacobson said.

The picture worsened when the emissions from coal mining and other activities were taken into account said Jacobson who calculated there would have been a 12% reduction in carbon emissions over 20 years had the plant not closed.

Instead of trying to extend ethanol's viability Carolyn Raffensperger an Iowa environmental lawyer said Iowa should focus on transitioning the state's farming economy away from producing renewable fuel and the corn and soybean crops needed to make it.

Iowa also is the nation's largest biodiesel producer in the nation and taps soybean oil along with used cooking oil grease and animal fats to make it. The state is the second-largest U.S. soybean grower.

The drive toward electric vehicles raises questions ""about the long-term future of Iowa corn production"" Raffensperger said.

Are there other carbon sequestration pipelines in the U.S.?

The nation has about 5000 miles of existing carbon sequestration pipelines with the carbon dioxide mostly used to squeeze more oil out of existing wells a process called enhanced oil recovery.

Iowa has no carbon capture pipelines.

How will the pipelines affect land?

Summit and Navigator will seek right-of-way easements both permanent and temporary from landowners. Permanent easements would be 50 feet.

The companies promise to restore the land — and the underground drainage tiles — to the same conditions that existed before construction.

Both companies say they'll reimburse landowners for rights-of-way access based on market values. And they plan to pay farmers the same percentages for crop damage: 100% of the crop damage the first year; 80% the second year; and 60% the third year.

At meetings with Summit and Navigator and in IUB comments Iowans have expressed doubt the companies would fully restore underground drainage or restore farmland to its existing productivity.

ADM and Wolf haven't released details about their project yet.

Iowa has about 30 million acres of cropland pastures and other ag land. And drainage tiles lie under an estimated 9 million acres to shed excess water an investment that improves crop yields.

Kevin Lambert who farms near Dayton said land that Dakota Access trenched through to bury its pipeline continues to produce fewer bushels of corn and soybeans than before the pipeline. Now his land could be in the path of Summit's carbon capture pipeline.

""I never imagined another pipeline would come through"" so soon after Dakota Access Lambert said. ""It's kind of sad. … We'll see the repercussions for years to come.""

Can Iowans in the proposed pathway of the pipeline refuse?

Yes. But Summit Navigator and ADM-Wolf can ask the three-person utilities board to grant eminent domain powers if they're determined to serve a public purpose. That would force unwilling landowners to grant easements at fair market values.

Iowa landowners fought the use of eminent domain in the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The battle reached the Iowa Supreme Court which decided the state was justified in allowing the use of eminent domain.

Are the pipelines safe?

Iowans who oppose the projects point to a carbon dioxide pipeline leak a year ago in Mississippi that sickened dozens of nearby residents. A recent Huffington Post story said Satartia residents were engulfed inside a greenish cloud and within minutes were ""gasping for air nauseated and dazed.""

Cars shut off since they need oxygen to burn fuel. Drivers scrambled out of their paralyzed vehicles but were so disoriented that they just wandered around in the dark the article said.

“It was almost like something you’d see in a zombie movie. They were just walking in circles” Terry Gann a Yazoo County sheriff officer told the publication.

Ted Schettler science director of the Science and Environmental Health Network told the Register that concentrated levels of carbon dioxide are dangerous. ""It's an asphyxiant"" he said often used to euthanize livestock before the animals are slaughtered.

""CO2 is heavier than air and settles to the ground and displaces oxygen"" Schettler said. ""People who are caught in a pure CO2 cloud that might be released from a pipeline"" face ""a real threat to safety and survivability"" he said.

What does Summit say about safety?

Jimmy Powell Summit's chief operating officer said at a public meeting this fall that the Mississippi carbon dioxide pipeline also contained hydrogen sulfide gas which made the leak much more dangerous.

Summit's pipeline will capture ""the purest form of CO2 that's available"" he said. ""It's not analogous to the situation in Mississippi.""

Powell said Summit plans to take extra precautions to ensure the pipeline is safe such as X-raying every weld in the pipeline even though the federal government requires that only 10% be tested.

In a board filing Summit said it will ""exceed the number of valves"" that can close to limit CO2 releases than required by federal regulations.

""Note that CO2 is neither explosive nor flammable (it is used as a fire suppressant)"" Summit said in the filing. ""If released CO2 will disperse as a gas and no overland flow will occur.""

The company noted ""there has never been a death caused by a CO2 pipeline.""

Summit said it also would ensure that first responders along the pipeline have the training and equipment needed to respond to a leak.

Would the pipeline help farmland values?

Many Iowans questioned the impact the pipelines would have on their farmland values in filings with the Iowa Utilities Board in addition to raising concern about safety for the farmers and families who live near them.

""This pipeline will not add one dollar to the real estate value"" wrote C.J. Schelling of Hull who called the pipeline a ""permanent scar"" on his land that will last generations.

""Farmland has traditionally been a sound investment but who would want to buy a farm that has a hazardous material pipeline on it?"" said Don Johannsen who owns a farm in Cherokee County. ""No one unless they can buy it at a bargain.""

Justin Kirchhoff president of Summit Ag Investors said capturing carbon makes ethanol ""more profitable and viable"" as the nation reduces carbon dioxide from its transportation fuel supply.

Ethanol demand helps support prices for corn. And Iowa farmland values are calculated in part by their ability to produce the crop called the Corn Suitability Rating. Depending on the county Summit anticipates paying between $100 and $160 per corn suitability rating point for easements it said in a filing.

For example Summit said it would pay $45000 for a five-acre easement on a farm with a rating of 75 in Floyd County.

Do the projects improve Iowa's economy?

Proponents say the projects would help support thousand of jobs at Iowa ethanol plants some of the best-paying in rural Iowa as well as beef poultry and other livestock producers who use a high-protein livestock feed that's an ethanol byproduct.

An economic study completed for the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association found that the ethanol and biodiesel industry supports about 37000 Iowa jobs when farming trucking livestock production and other indirect positions are factored in.

Summit says the pipeline project would create up to 17000 construction jobs for the entire project and up to 460 permanent positions. Navigator says its project would create 8000 construction positions and 80 permanent jobs.

Why are some Iowans asking Summit to release its landowner mailing lists?

Opponents to the project are pushing Summit to release its mailing lists of landowners in the pipeline's proposed pathway so they can more easily organize efforts to stop the project.

Summit asked the Iowa Utilities Board in August to keep its mailing lists of landowners confidential to protect landowners' privacy. It also said the release would serve no public purpose but it would help its competitors.

In a December order the board agreed to keep the names of thousands of individual landowners secret saying property owners' rights to privacy outweighed the public interest. It did however order Summit to release the names of businesses cities counties and other government entities that own land in the proposed pathway.

The board said Summit's 31 mailing lists contain 15000 names.

The board was split over the decision: Richard Lozier and Josh Byrnes ordered that individual landowners' names and addresses be kept confidential. Geri Huser dissented saying she would release the property owners' mailing addresses but not their names.

Jennifer Easler the Iowa Attorney General's consumer advocate asked in a filing for the mailing lists to be released saying they would enable landowners who oppose the project to mount a joint defense.

She said the mailing lists were culled from public records and unlikely to provide a competitor an advantage since proposed maps of the pipeline pathways have been released.

All of the board members rejected Summit's concerns about competition.

How will the projects be financed?

Kirchhoff said Summit would look to loans both private and potentially government-backed and investors to build the pipeline.

Summit announced in July that Deere & Co. the giant Moline Illinois farm equipment manufacturer was a ""strategic investor"" in its carbon capture project and about 30 state and regional ethanol plants have agreed to participate in the project.

Also billionaire oil tycoon Harold Hamm’s Continental Resources said in March that the company will invest $250 million in the project.

Kirchhoff said the company would share the added income that ethanol plants get from selling their low carbon fuel for higher prices. California for example provides about $200 in credits for every metric ton of carbon that's sequestered he said. And producers of dirtier fuels that don’t meet California’s standards have to buy those credits to comply.

Kirchhoff said part of the company's revenue would come from federal tax credits which provide about $50 for each metric ton of carbon that's sequestered.

Navigator's Elizabeth Burns-Thompson said ethanol fertilizer and other companies will pay Navigator to move their carbon dioxide through its pipeline like buying a ticket on a bus. The low-carbon fuel premiums and tax credits will remain with local companies Burns-Thompson said and they will use some of the revenue to pay for Navigator's pipeline services.

BlackRock a New York investment company is providing some of the project's financial backing and Valero Energy a large Texas oil company with a dozen Midwest ethanol plants including five in Iowa is among the commercial participants.

Are there conflicts of interest?

Critics of Summit's project say two state utilities board members appointed by former Gov. Terry Branstad have a conflict of interest and should recuse themselves from decisions about the project which has hired Branstad as an adviser.

Summit hired Branstad who was the U.S. ambassador to China under President Donald Trump in March to provide ""oversight leadership and guidance on public policy matters affecting stakeholders.""

Branstad who left the state's top job in May 2017 to assume his ambassadorship appointed Huser in 2015 as a board member and chair and Gov. Kim Reynolds reappointed her in January. Huser is serving a two-year term as chair and a six-year term as a board member.

Branstad appointed Lozier to the board in 2017. Lozier will serve through April 2023. Reynolds who served as Branstad's lieutenant governor appointed Joshua Byrnes the third board member in November.

The utilities board said board members ""are subject to judicial ethics requirements similar to those required for district court judges"" and ""will make their decision whether there is a conflict of interest that prevents them from participating in the hearing that considers the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline at the appropriate time.""

El pintor madrileño César Palacios uno de los personajes más populares y habituales de la plaza de toros de Las Ventas bien tomando apuntes desde el tendido o ejerciendo como arenero ha fallecido en Madrid a los 84 años tras una larga enfermedad.

Palacios nacido el 1 de septiembre de 1937 en pleno acoso de las tropas nacionales a la capital durante la Guerra Civil comenzó a frecuentar los tendidos de la recién inaugurada plaza monumental desde muy niño por la amistad de su padre con Paco Parejo mayoral del coso y a la sazón cuñado de Antoñete el famoso diestro del mechón blanco.

Con 25 años Palacios entró a formar parte de la nómina de Las Ventas como portero y acomodador hasta que en la temporada de 1974 pasó a ejercer como arenero adecuando el ruedo tras cada lidia función en la que permaneció hasta 1999 y en la que se hizo inconfundible entre los aficionados por sus pobladas patillas goyescas.

Apasionado de la pintura cursó diversos estudios en la Real Academia de San Fernando y en el Círculo de Bellas Artes de Madrid iniciando desde muy joven una ingente obra que incidía siempre en el expresionismo de óleos y acuarelas basados casi siempre en escenas del toro bravo en el campo y en la plaza y con las que protagonizó más de sesenta exposiciones.

También fueron muy conocidos los miles de apuntes a carboncillo rotulador y bolígrafo que tomaba desde el mismo burladero de areneros de Las Ventas y con los que colaboró en varios medios de comunicación como la famosa revista ""El Ruedo"" e ilustró una larga lista de libros y hasta barajas de cartas en una labor en conjunto que le valió varios premios incluso internacionales.

Tras ver reflejada su última gran obra en el cartel de la corrida goyesca celebrada en Madrid el 2 de mayo de 2018 la Comunidad de Madrid en homenaje a su trayectoria este mismo año y en la misma fecha descubrió una placa en el patio de caballos de las Ventas con el siguiente lema:

""La Comunidad de Madrid a César Palacios Romera por una vida dedicada a tu plaza monumental de Las Ventas"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvZGlnb3Nhbmx1aXMuY29tL3ZlbnRhcy1wb3ItaW50ZXJuZXQtZGluZXJvLWV4dHJhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ventas por internet la opción para ganar un dinero extra,"Las ventas por internet es algo muy común en la actualidad y aunque no lo creas las cosas de segunda mano son las más compradas incluso se volvió tendencia llamarles nenis a aquellas personas que vendían productos por medio de las redes sociales. En este tipo de tiendas online puedes encontrar desde cosas usadas hasta productos nuevos por ello el vender por Inter es una buena opción si quieres deshacerte de los objetos que solo ocupan un espacio en tu hogar. Si está planeando experimentar con las ventas por Internet es mejor que conozcas algunos datos de este mundo antes de adentrarte en el.

Según investigadores que estudian los hábitos de consumo en las personas en la actualidad lo que es más práctico y utilizado son los mercados de segunda mano. El motivo por el cuál es una de las áreas más demandadas es por sus precios tan accesibles así que si quieres ofrecer tus productos y planeas hacer tus ventas por internet debes de tener que estarás compitiendo contra un gran número de empresas o establecimientos que ofrecen lo mismos y los clientes se irán donde esté el mejor precio.

La ventaja de las compras por internet es que es más sencillo encontrar un cliente para tus productos incluso algo que funciona muy bien en este mercado son los llamados “productos basura” como frascos vacíos portavelas e incluso tubos de papel higiénico. Según la empresa Ebay durante el primer semestre del año se vendieron 4.000 frascos de perfume vacíos con un precio de 4 euros de media. En total este producto basura movió casi 20.000 euros a través de la aplicación conectando a vendedores y compradores.

Así que intenta ubicar cuales cosas ya no utilizas y puede que ganes un dinero extra que a nadie le cae mal al mismo tiempo también se crea conciencia sobre la importancia del reciclado que es fundamental para dejar de contaminar al planeta.

Parece haber cierto mal sabor de boca en ciertos foros porque el disco no ha igualado los récords de ’25’ pero hay que tener en cuenta varios factores:

1) el mercado ha cambiado mucho en 6 años las ventas han decaído incluso más.

2) ’25’ no se publicó en las plataformas de streaming a su lanzamiento en noviembre de 2015 sino en junio de 2016 esto es varios meses después.

3) el vinilo de ’25’ es doble y su precio es por tanto mucho mayor hasta 34 euros en Amazon. Ahí habrá que hablar de beneficios en lugar de ventas puras.

- Publicidad -

En cualquier caso mientras ‘Easy On Me‘ continúa en el número 1 a nivel global de Spotify posición que parece que ya va a mantener hasta la llegada de la Navidad el disco ha entrado en la primera posición en casi todos los mercados que publican sus listas los viernes: Alemania Australia Irlanda Noruega Holanda Suecia… se le ha escapado eso sí el top 1 en Italia y Francia en favor de talentos locales. En ambos casos es top 2.

Las cifras que se conocen son buenas aunque no espectaculares. En Reino Unido Adele ha vendido 261.000 unidades en 7 días. Es verdad que las 800.307 semanales de la semana de debut de ’25’ han quedado muy lejos pero también lo es que son las ventas más altas de todo 2021 superando los récords previos de ABBA Ed Sheeran y Coldplay. ¿En qué medida puede ser una decepción continuar siendo quien más vende? ¿Es que ya nadie recuerda qué pasó con Alanis Morissette James Blunt o Dido?

- Publicidad -

En Estados Unidos los datos son excelentes también. A mediados de semana Adele llevaba el equivalente a 660.000 copias vendidas siendo 560.000 ventas puras por lo que al final serán unas 800.000 unidades las despachadas en EE UU. Se rondarán 2 millones a nivel global para la primera semana triplicando o casi lo que Ed Sheeran lleva en 3 semanas e igualando lo que lleva Drake en 11 semanas para ‘Certified Lover Boy’. ¿De verdad con este panorama hay quien prefiere ver el vaso medio vacío?

Parece difícil además que el disco pierda fuelle en Black Friday y Navidad: el disco al completo continúa en el top 100 de Spotify como si Adele fuera una trapera o el disco tuviera featurings y a poco que Sony juegue sus cartas con la buena aceptación comercial de ‘Can I Get It’ y sobre todo ‘Oh My God’ otro nuevo macroéxito está ya cocinado. ¿Se venderán 20 millones de unidades? No… pero avisadnos cuando alguien lo repita.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbG9jY2lkZW50YWwuY29tLm14L2N1bHR1cmEvY29uLW1lbm9zLWdlbnRlLWVuLWxhLWZpbC1oYXktbWFzLXZlbnRhcy1kZS1saWJyb3MtcXVlLWVuLWVsLTIwMTktcGFkaWxsYS1sb3Blei03NTM2MjA5Lmh0bWzSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxvY2NpZGVudGFsLmNvbS5teC9jdWx0dXJhL2Nvbi1tZW5vcy1nZW50ZS1lbi1sYS1maWwtaGF5LW1hcy12ZW50YXMtZGUtbGlicm9zLXF1ZS1lbi1lbC0yMDE5LXBhZGlsbGEtbG9wZXotNzUzNjIwOS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Con menos gente en la FIL hay más ventas de libros que en el 2019: Padilla López,"La asistencia a las actividades de la Feria Internacional del Libro (FIL) está al máximo permitido por la Mesa de Salud y aunque son menos personas que en la edición del 2019 las ventas de libros están un 20% arriba que todo el primer día de hace dos años señaló el presidente de la feria Raúl Padilla López.

Charif Hammoud presidente del Centro de Importadores y Comerciantes del Alto Paraná indicó que ahora comenzaron a mejorar las ventas y que estamos en la mejor época para los negocios.

Hammoud es propietario de un emblemático comercio de artículos refinados y dijo que los productos más comprados son para regalos como perfumes ropas electrónicos juguetes y bebidas importadas.

La bonanza también beneficia a los pequeños comerciantes esparcidos en los diferentes puntos del microcentro.

Aníbal Ojeda tiene un puesto de ventas de ropas sobre la avenida Monseñor Rodríguez y comentó que el volumen de compras aumentó en los últimos días; aunque aún por debajo del flujo comercial antes de la pandemia.

El comerciante sostuvo que la alta cotización del dólar frente al real es un obstáculo para recuperar las ventas de años anteriores; además de la falta de mantenimiento de las calles deficiencia en la iluminación y de agentes de seguridad principalmente en las horas de la actividad comercial."

Wertkin was successful in getting a grant approved through the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Emergency Connectivity Fund a $7.17 billion program designed to help libraries and schools provide tools and services needed for remote learning and working during the pandemic.

The Emergency Connectivity Fund is part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

Wertkin said she received word two weeks ago that her grant application had been approved. It will cover the cost of four Chromebooks and the roughly $800 per month service charge for 20 Verizon hotspots for one year. The grant is renewable for three years.

The hotspots are puck-size round plastic discs that can be charged and used to provide portable Wi-Fi. Library patrons can use them anywhere as long as they are charged up.

“During this time where it's been hard to get to places where you could use Wi-Fi or where you’ve had to work from home or go to school from home or if you’ve been unwell and had to quarantine you could still connect with the hot spot” Wertkin said.

The Wellfleet Library Board of Trustees had decided to pay for the monthly service charge for the hotspots when the pandemic first caused schools libraries and businesses to close down. But the service fee would have been unsustainable Wertkin said. Now the library and its patrons can count on the Connectivity Fund grant to continue the coverage.

Opinion:When it comes to high-speed internet Cape Codders are people too

The library also has 20 T-Mobile hot spots courtesy of the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners. Those hotspots aren’t as reliable as the Verizon hotspots according to Wertkin.

“If you have T-Mobile and your cellphone doesn’t get good reception the hotspot won’t work well either” she said.

There are coverage gaps in any town that lies within the National Seashore Wertkin said. “There are places where even Verizon hotspots won’t work” she said.

Wertkin believes that broadband and the ability to connect to the internet is 100% necessary in this day and age. “This pandemic has shown us that more than ever” she said. ""Programs like these are trying to remedy that. This is something vital to the everyday functioning of everyday society.”

Wertkin expects to receive the Chromebooks before the end of the year. They will be available for two-weeks at a time. So will the hotspots. The hotspots are already flying off the shelves. Wertkin said she will look for funding opportunities to get more if that’s what people want.

A patron left a note thanking the library staff for providing the hotspots. Wertkin said the woman wrote that the service saved her life and saved her job.

“Connectivity is a basic right” Wertkin said.

Shelton was the first patient. On June 29 he got an infusion of cells grown from stem cells but just like the insulin-producing pancreas cells his body lacked. Now his body automatically controls its insulin and blood sugar levels. Shelton now 64 may be the first person cured of the disease with a new treatment that has experts daring to hope that help may be coming for many of the 1.5 million Americans suffering from Type 1 diabetes . “It’s a whole new life” Shelton said.Diabetes experts were astonished but urged caution. The study is continuing and will take five years involving 17 people with Type 1 diabetes. It is not intended as a treatment for the more common Type 2 diabetes. “We’ve been looking for something like this to happen for decades” said Dr Irl Hirsch a diabetes expert at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study. He wants to see the result not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal replicated in more people. He also wants to know if there’ll be adverse effects and if the cells will last for a lifetime or if the treatment would have to be repeated. But he said “bottom line it’s an amazing result”.It all started with the quest of a Harvard University biologist Doug Melton. He had never thought about diabetes until 1991 when his 6-month-old son Sam got sick and was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. . Type 1 is lethal unless patients get injections of insulin.Patients are at risk of going blind. People with Type 1 diabetes are at risk of having their legs amputated and of death in the night because their blood sugar plummets during sleep. In time his daughter Emma four years older than Sam also developed the disease when she was 14.The only cure is a pancreas transplant or a transplant of the insulin-producing cell clusters of the pancreas known as islet cells from an organ donor’s pancreas. But a shortage of organs makes this approach an impossibility. Melton started studying diabetes determined to find a cure. He turned to embryonic stem cells which have the potential to become any cell in the body. His goal was to turn them into islet cells to treat patients.The challenge was to figure out what sequence of chemical messages would turn stem cells into insulin-secreting islet cells. The work involved figuring out how islets are made in the pancreas and conducting experiments to steer embryonic stem cells to becoming islets. After years when nothing worked a small team of researchers achieved a breakthrough in 2014. They put a dye into the liquid where the stem cells were growing. The liquid would turn blue if the cells made insulin. After hours of waiting one researcher saw a faint blue tinge that got darker and darker. The team was ecstatic. For the first time they had made functioning pancreatic islet cells from embryonic stem cells.,,,,,,,,,

By Aditya Kalra

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Visa Inc has complained to the U.S. government that India's ""informal and formal"" promotion of domestic payments rival RuPay hurts the U.S. giant in a key market memos seen by Reuters show.

In public Visa has downplayed concerns about the rise of RuPay which has been supported by public lobbying from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that has included likening the use of local cards to national service.

But U.S. government memos show Visa raised concerns about a ""level playing field"" in India during an Aug. 9 meeting between U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai and company executives including CEO Alfred Kelly.

Mastercard Inc has raised similar concerns privately with the USTR. Reuters reported in 2018 that the company had lodged a protest https://reut.rs/3cQA2La with the USTR that Modi was using nationalism to promote the local network.

""Visa remains concerned about India's informal and formal policies that appear to favour the business of National Payments Corporation of India"" (NPCI) the non-profit that runs RuPay ""over other domestic and foreign electronic payments companies"" said a USTR memo prepared for Tai ahead of the meeting.

Visa USTR Modi's office and the NPCI did not respond to requests for comment.

Modi has promoted homegrown RuPay for years posing a challenge to Visa and Mastercard in the fast-growing payments market. RuPay accounted for 63% of India's 952 million debit and credit cards as of November 2020 according to the most recent regulatory data on the company up from just 15% in 2017.

Publicly Kelly said in May that for years there was ""a lot of concern"" that the likes of RuPay could be ""potentially problematic"" for Visa but he stressed that his company remained India's market leader.

""That's going to be something we're going to continually deal with and have dealt with for years. So there's nothing new there"" he told an industry event.

'NOT SO SUBTLE PRESSURE'

Modi in a 2018 speech portrayed the use of RuPay as patriotic saying that since ""everyone cannot go to the border to protect the country we can use RuPay card to serve the nation.""

When Visa raised its concerns during the USTR gathering on Aug. 9 it cited the Indian leader's ""speech where he basically called on India to use RuPay as a show of service to the country"" according to an email U.S. officials exchanged on the meeting's readout.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last year that ""RuPay is the only card"" banks should promote. The government has also promoted a RuPay-based card for public transportation payments.

While RuPay dominates the number of cards in India most transactions still go through Visa and Mastercard as most RuPay cards were simply issued by banks under Modi's financial inclusion programme industry sources say.

Visa told the U.S. government it was concerned India's ""push to use transit cards linked to RuPay"" and ""the not so subtle pressure on banks to issue"" RuPay cards the USTR email showed.

Mastercard and Visa count India as a key growth market but have been jolted by a 2018 central bank directive for them to store payments data ""only in India"" for ""unfettered supervisory access"".

Mastercard faces an indefinite ban on issuing new cards in India after the central bank said it was not complying with the 2018 rules. A USTR official privately called the Mastercard ban ""draconian"" Reuters reported in September.

German-Australian lithium developer Vulcan Energy Resources has signed a second supply deal with Renault Group. The carmaker keen to electrify its fleet plans to buy 26000 to 32000 metric tonnes of battery-grade lithium chemicals from Vulcan’s German project for an initial six-year period with deliveries set to begin in 2026.

Lithium a critical component for manufacturing electrically-chargeable vehicle (EV) batteries is in high demand across Europe as electric-car sales continue to boom. With its European project Vulcan Energy wants to decarbonise the battery materials sector hoping to make an impact in the supply network and lower dependence on lithium imports from outside the EU.

Carbon-free EVs

The collaboration between the two companies fits well with Renault’s electrification strategy. The manufacturer aims to operate the largest EV production hub in Europe as it strives for carbon neutrality. Earlier this year Renault said it expected 65% of sales to come from EV models by 2025 with this figure anticipated to climb to a 90% stake by 2030.

‘The completion of this definitive offtake agreement means Vulcan’s zero-carbon lithium business will be directly enabling Renault to meet its commitment of producing carbon-free EV batteries and becoming carbon neutral as part of its “carbon neutrality – green as a business” strategy’ said Vulcan managing director Francis Wedin.

‘For Vulcan the agreement is consistent with our strategy to enter into long-term stable supply agreements with companies that share our ethos on sustainability and decarbonisation ambitions’ he added.

The listed company said it will fast-track the development towards supplying the EU’s battery and EV industry. Lithium has become a critical raw material as the world transitions towards cleaner energy. As an energy-metals exploration company Vulcan intends to produce the world’s first battery-quality lithium chemicals with a zero-carbon footprint.

To realise its ambitious lithium production plans the startup focuses on harnessing renewable geothermal energy without using evaporation ponds mining or fossil fuels. The process for extracting lithium will therefore emit no CO 2  while also producing renewable power.

Sustainable vehicles

Carmakers in Europe are increasingly looking at ways to source lithium from the continent to lower costs of global lithium-chemicals transport and thereby cut carbon emissions. The EU is promoting the creation of a European lithium supply chain aiming to become self-sufficient by 2025.

‘Partnership with a European lithium producer such as Vulcan is an important milestone in realising our commitment to reach 30% emissions reduction for our supply chain by 2030’ said Gianluca De Ficchy alliance EVP purchasing and managing director of the Alliance Purchasing Organisation at Renault Group. ‘Low-carbon footprint of battery chemicals is key for us as our ambition is to offer the most sustainable vehicles in the market.’

In August Vulcan previously signed a five-year deal to supply lithium to Renault while it also struck supply deals with Stellantis. Renault recently invested €550 million in its French factory in Douai with the carmaker aiming to produce more than 400000 EVs at several French sites from 2025. Part of Renault’s electromobility strategy is focused on the future on-site battery production at Douai where it plans to set up a gigafactory.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Set during a Bayside career fair “Wrestling With the Future” sees members of the new class attempting either desperately or apathetically to map out their future and find their calling. Meanwhile every living member of the original class reflects on where their journeys have taken them and the space between dreams and reality.

The episode is a comedic rumination on defining success — something too frequently based on others’ expectations or unhealthy comparisons — that eventually settles on how the detours of perfectly laid plans ultimately shape not just the person you become but one’s personal vision of success and happiness.

Of course this message is tucked within one of Saved by the Bell‘s signature meta jokes: an homage to the 1995 cult classic Showgirls. As Berkley Lauren’s segue into adult dramatic roles the part — its own kind of meta-conversation on “making it” — pulled the beloved Baysider from those California high school halls and dropped her right in front of uncompromising critics who notably derided her performance at the time of the film’s release.

“It’s all funny because there is a whole new wave of creatives who embrace this film in new ways” Berkley Lauren tells THR. “I hear from people often writers or directors that just honor its place in pop culture now.”

For that reason Berkley Lauren says it was “fun that we got to celebrate what it means in the present too” in the season’s sixth episode. The tribute then was at least partly an opportunity to show Berkley Lauren could have a little fun making fun of herself. But for the episode’s all-female team it was also an opportunity to help the actress reclaim the narrative around her early career.

“Comedy is a tool and comedy is a weapon. It can be all those things based on the hands of whoever’s yielding it” says director Katie Locke O’Brien who describes the episode as “equal parts homage and rebirth.”

For showrunner Tracey Wigfield the “meta moment” was a chance to directly comment on how a 21-year-old actress was treated after Showgirls was released.

“That [Mario Lopez’s A.C.] Slater could kind of say to her ‘You know what you took the swing it didn’t come out great. But the directions you were given were crazy’ was a way to put in context for Jessie the character and Elizabeth the person a thing that needed to be said.”

“It felt like a moment for that burden. She carried so much of that burden unfairly. It never should have happened that way” says writer Yamara Taylor. “There was just such compassion in this scene. I was losing my shit because it was like Slater saying the thing that little Jessie needed to hear but really this thing that little Elizabeth needed.”

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Saved by the Bell‘s Berkley Lauren Wigfield Taylor and O’Brien detail where the idea for the homage came from explain why women telling writing and directing this joke was so important and reflect on their own winding journeys as women in Hollywood.

When was the idea for a Showgirls tribute initially broached who broached it and why did season two feel like a good time to do it?

Tracey Wigfield: Initially when we first started season one of the show I didn’t know Elizabeth or Mario or any of them and I certainly didn’t know Elizabeth’s comfort level with making fun of not just Saved by the Bell but other things in her career. I remember the first time Elizabeth came into the writer’s room she made a joke about Showgirls.

Elizabeth Berkley Lauren: Was someone wearing a T-shirt or something?

Wigfield: I think so. I think Dana [Sayles] was wearing a T-shirt.

Berkley Lauren: I just did a little goddess hands for her. (Laughs.)

Wigfield: Then everyone was like “Oh cool. She’s gonna be game for stuff.” Into the second season we had always talked about how that would be funny to do some sort of inside thing about Showgirls but there hadn’t been an organic moment to do it. Then Yamara [Taylor] I and the rest of the room were breaking this episode about a career fair and Jessie is in this vulnerable place where she’s just gotten divorced and is thinking about getting back out there but she’s feeling sort of embarrassed about it [and] there was a fireman with a fire pole there (laughs) it sort of seemed like this opportunity and that it would be wrong not to use it. The universe wanted it to exist.

I remember writer Chris Schleicher saying “A pole is right there” and all of us at the same point got very giddy about the idea. But of course I knew I would have to talk to Elizabeth about it. It being season two I knew her very well and I was pretty sure she would be game. I also knew she had the comedy chops to do a funny send-up because she’s a great comedian and great with physical comedy. I knew she would knock it out of the park if she was cool with doing it.

Berkley Lauren: Let me just say first for the record that Tracey is not only a genius writer. She’s an incredible leader in a way that I’ve never experienced on a set. I’ve observed her take a temperature check with other people about other storylines and while [Saved by the Bell] is a comedy there’s so much heart embedded in Tracey’s work. So though we had a whole season under our belt we hadn’t really talked about other aspects of my career. We jumped right into this show and of course there was the pandemic. So she said “We have this idea we want to have some fun with it. Are you willing?” I think she knew I’m willing to be playful and goofy or self-deprecating. For me comedy is the ultimate way to heal in certain areas. But in this specific case I knew it all depended on the how and I wasn’t concerned with the how because I had had this great work relationship.

I remember saying “I’m totally open. Can I see a few pages? Can I just see what you guys are thinking?” And the minute I saw the pages I was like “I’m so in.” This is before me even knowing the full journey of where our amazing writers we’re going to have Jessie go this season. That she was going to be a little more broken a little more than a type-A personality. It’s like the rug has been pulled out from under her; her marriage is in shambles and there’s this 20 years of her thinking her life was going to look a certain way. It was just a genius meta moment. For Jessie to be calling upon the strength of Nomi to get her through this moment was brilliant to me.

There were quite a few references from the film incorporated into the episode. What was your favorite to execute?

Taylor: I like when Kelly’s like “What did you do in Vegas?” Obviously Jessie didn’t tell any of her friends. But she confessed to Slater about that girl and the stairs. It speaks so much to yeah there’s a bunch of shit sometimes you don’t know about your friends on their journey. And then they say casually it and you’re like “What?” “Oh I didn’t tell you that?” “No bitch you didn’t tell me that!” (Laughs.) Jessie’s finally going through this divorce and is like “So anyway I was in Vegas.”

Berkley Lauren: True. (Laughs.) I didn’t think about that. But we couldn’t keep a straight face during that. I swear we had to do quite a few takes. I also love that you ladies let me incorporate some lines that I know people come up to me with. Like “I’m a dancer.” Any of those lines that we ended up using Tracey and Yamara were just like “Throw them in. You know what they love.” I was really grateful too that I got to bring in an incredible choreographer even though we didn’t do a full-on routine. Jen[nifer] Hamilton another amazing woman — she choreographed the Oscars and is doing the show Physical right now — is an old friend and a teacher of mine and the choreographer I worked with. So I also felt safe with her to discuss movement and to see how far we should go.

Wigfield: We had a whole dance we’ll take on the road.

Berkley Lauren: Yes. It was like are we going up the pole or are we just kind of hanging out? There was finding how far to go with it even with the costumes. Is it just a suggestion of Nomi with the cowboy hat or are we all in — glitter rhinestones corset fringe and all. I loved the creative process of getting to try that on. To really check in to see how far do we want to go with this. Because Tracey remember we did those two versions of full-on costume or a little suggestion? I think that was really fun finding that together.

In ’90s sitcoms and comedies it frequently felt like women were the joke but now women are writing or directing the joke and they’re doing it for other women who are acting or watching and in on the joke. This Showgirls tribute is a perfect example. How important was that to delivering this?

Berkley Lauren: It almost makes me cry because it is something that is so new as far as my experience. We were standing at video village when we were shooting this and I looked at the faces that we’re seeing right here and I was so moved to realize that this moment with the way we all wanted to tell it and share it and create it was happening. We have this incredible female director who also happens to be an actress Katie [Locke O’Brien]. There’s Tracey’s incredible voice leadership and vision to even reimagine this show in this tone. Then there’s Yamara who comes in with her brilliant writing and its depth humanity and humor. Each piece of it could not happen without each one of these ladies. I personally felt so grateful because only because of this incredible combination of women did I feel something like this could happen in the specific tone that it did. For that I’m really grateful to see and know a different way. I’ve worked with a lot of men who I really love working with as well but what you’re asking about in this moment on this show in this particular way it couldn’t have happened with anyone else and I’m really grateful that we got to create this together.

Yamara Taylor: It felt to me like what it was: a bunch of moms taking care of each other. We all had a really strong understanding of how important of a moment this could be especially for Elizabeth and that we were all holding space for her. It felt like a nurturing environment. I’ve never had a female showrunner before Tracey and so that’s what Tracey brings to everything. It’s this feeling of “I’m taking care of you” that Katie also brought as a director. I feel like everyone on set that day felt taken care of. I would get little looks from Elizabeth and she would wink at me. It was like “Hey guys we’re doing something.” Tracey and I cried.

Berkley Lauren: Me too!

Katie Locke O’Brien: I think we all knew going into the week of shooting that there was the potential for something really incredible here. Then the beautiful surprise that came out of it was because of all of those side conversations we had. With each new scene we started to do we would start sharing our own stories amongst ourselves about our time in the business about our own experiences about Elizabeth’s life. All of that — getting closer and putting that into it — made it something where the experience of making it was actually as empowering as the thing we were trying to create.

Berkley Lauren: Even the sensitivity Katie that you brought as a director. We had the big fun moment of course where Jessie/Nomi is approaching the fireman. But what really struck me too was how in tune we all were with each other. Even your decision to do the scene where Mario-slash-Slater — because that’s its own kind of meta moment — is talking to Jessie as Nomi as Elizabeth with so much humanity and heart. The fact that you were like “You know what? We’re just going to go behind this little wall right here.” The most subtle choices were really powerful to me. It was all with a lot of thought and care and that you can with all that still have a really funny moment.

Locke O’Brien: That scene with you and Mario is a total riot. But what I loved about the script was that it was doing both things at once. Obviously my first time through I’m like “Oh my god oh my god. It’s not just the original cast. I got the Showgirls episode!” So my first read is of course for the goddess hands and all of that but then as you dig in there were just so many beautifully written moments for Elizabeth as Jessie as Nomi just talking about the journey and what she’s been through. It was so much fun to make sure that those moments got to sing as much as the flashier moments that are really the physical comedy of the episode. It was such a testament to how confident and vulnerable [Elizabeth] was willing to be and that she is at this point in her life as an actress. It got to be all that it really could be from page to execution.

Berkley Lauren: This is such a reflection of this different time and the moment we find ourselves in. We’ve all had this in us all along. There is just this incredible permission to step into it. There was a different energy among women on sets many years ago back in the ’90s. It was very competitive. I think there was a lack of or a fear mentality and now so many avenues have opened up since then that the storytelling is different and can be different because we’re different. To have this is just as the greatest example of what is possible when women come together and have each other’s backs.

Taylor: Adding to that just having women understand what might need to be said. Being able to check in with Elizabeth and just make sure like “We get it. So hey is this going the way you need it to go? How do you feel about this?” It felt like Tracey and Katie and I were mindful of it too. We just wanted to make sure that whatever the moment was going to be [Elizabeth] felt like she was in control of it. I even think what it did for the series — this is such a testament to how Tracey’s brilliant mind works — now you have Jessie Spano with this really dope backstory. Right? She got her life in Vegas.

Jessie Spano was a young woman who was super smart had everything planned out — the vision of success and ambition for girls in the ’90s. Now she has this Vegas storyline expanding her beyond that informing who she ultimately became. Like Jessie it seems fair to say women in Hollywood often have ideas of what they want and then sometimes life happens and they don’t end up on the path they planned. Reality and expectation are not the same. How has that played out in your lives and careers and did you reflect on that at all while doing this?

Taylor: I’ve been divorced twice. I’m a single mom. And I was a Jessie Spano. I used to have a lot of anxiety that I wasn’t doing everything right all the time. Then you get into writers’ rooms or you get on set and you look at everyone else and you assume nine times out of ten incorrectly that they all are exactly where they want to be and they made all the right moves to get there. So I personally didn’t have a lot of room a while back for error. Now I’m fine making a mistake. I love being like” Oh I was wrong.” It’s liberating and I love talking — especially to other women especially women of color — about what do we think is gonna happen realistically.

We have these conversations in the writers’ room all the time. Especially on this show because this show is so much about how the world set up for us. Is that realistic for the world to be set up that way? And what do we do when the world doesn’t reflect back for us what we think it should or what we were told it was going to? For me I got to a place where I’m constantly having a conversation. I say what I think. I’m not afraid of someone thinking that I’m a mouthy angry black woman because maybe I am one day and maybe I’m not but the important thing to me is having the conversation even if it’s uncomfortable. I respect people that are willing to be uncomfortable to have the conversation because that’s where the growth happens.

Wigfield: My experience coming up was pretty lucky and unusual in that I have only ever worked for women. My first job was on 30 Rock. I had a head writer who was a man but Tina Fey was in charge. Then I went to The Mindy Project where Mindy [Kaling] was at the helm. I feel I was very lucky in that way that I always got to see a woman in charge and making the ultimate decision. I think that was huge for me now as a leader but I’ll say even like 15 years ago — even at these female-run shows — still there were more men than women in the room. The rooms were still not as diverse. Even me when I had my first show on NBC. You want to be able to be confident and bold and hire people and give people chances. But it’s scary when it’s your thing. I will say on my first show versus right now I am so much more proud of how diverse my room looks. How many women are there. How diverse my directing slots are.

I still think even now I struggle with making sure that I’m doing it right and like Yamara was saying getting it perfect. Not messing up. I think sometimes that can lead to making managerial decisions out of fear as opposed to following your instinct and your voice. I feel like as I’ve progressed in my career and come to this moment I am only listening to that voice more and more. It’s made the experience of working so much better the experience of hiring people so much better and it leads you to give people shots who maybe don’t have as much experience or who are telling stories that are a little weirder or doing things that I maybe wouldn’t have done years earlier in my career. It’s nice. I hope that only continues for me.

Locke O’Brien: I was the ultimate Jessie Spano growing up for sure. Class president valedictorian — did everything right. So it was so weird and difficult to begin a creative career and realize that effort doesn’t have anything to do with what you get back. A lot of the reason that I hit a point where being an actress wasn’t feeling like enough is because a lot of those parts that were coming my way were like “Girl in bar. She’s cute but she can hang with the guys.” I’m like “Really? This is what I went to college for?” It was hard at that point not to want to be behind the storytelling more. The trick of it was that I did not see many women in front of me when I was showing up on various comedy sets. Maybe one in ten times a woman was directing. Or as a little girl growing up Penny Marshall was the only female director I could probably think of but she’s Laverne and so how do you become that? It was so out of my realm of possibility until about three years ago. And as soon as I began doing it I was like “Oops this is what I should have been doing all along.” But without that representation in my face it didn’t occur to me that that was a real job I could have.

There are days when I wake up and I think “Oh my god can you imagine if I knew at 21 that this is what I should have been pursuing?” Then I think to myself “No I wouldn’t have been ready then. All of the life journey all the things in the meantime like becoming a mom all the projects I’ve worked on as a writer as an actor — all of that life is what made this the right moment. I show up on set with complete imposter syndrome and that will be my fate until the day I die but you have these moments like this episode was where you’re like “This is where I’m supposed to be. I couldn’t have been beneficial to this process and this creation 10 years ago. This is the right moment for all of this to be happening.”

Berkley Lauren: I grew up in Michigan as far from all this as possible and without connections. I did the hard work as far as I could go in Michigan until [my family] came out here. But I knew I wanted to do this. It was just a matter of how do I get there. And I always thought and I think it’s part of our culture of being a woman that if you work hard enough and if you are dedicated enough — whether it be the 17 dance lessons a week I took the singing or acting classes or even just working hard through however many hours you’re on set — if you did all of this right you would get there. This takes us even to Showgirls to getting that part and how it was hard-earned.

I think my vision of being a professional was very defined by what I saw but also just a concept in my head. And being a professional as a young actress then in the ’90s did not mean bringing your voice to the table. It meant “Be a good girl put your head down and get to work. Don’t make a wave and deliver.” So I got very good at that. I was a pro at that. No one was better at “What do you want me to be? I will deliver that.” I brought my whole heart and soul and all of my hard work to it. So I think one of the benefits to having my head handed to me on a national level when Showgirls came out is that this kind of childlike idea of what the business was— the illusion the fantasy — it did get shattered. I don’t mean this in a negative soul-crushing way. It was sad and it was disappointing and it was hard. It was hard to be humiliated as a young woman. It was hard that no one stood up and had my back or helped me including the people who made the project. It was hard that doors were shut and I could not open them no matter how hard I knocked on them for quite some time to even be able to do what I love again.

My heart really wanted to know why. Because it didn’t make sense with this path and vision of “If you do the right thing as a professional things like that don’t happen.” Now a lot of it makes sense some still doesn’t make sense but I don’t spend a lot of time still trying to figure all that out. You move on. I’m not a victim and I have a strength that I found at 21. But oh my god I have female friends who are in their 40s right now finding out some of the things that I was forced to find out so young. What a gift to take that through my life. When the illusion was shattered something replaced it that was far more fantastic. That was this rite of passage this initiation. Truly reality at the time allowed me to persevere and move forward with a sense of self as a young woman and now as a woman that is very different in terms of how it has informed my choices creatively who I want to collaborate with. There’s a clarity there. It’s not just that childhood “I want to make it.”

I think as we go through our different paths as women — I was a young girl back then and I’m a woman now; I’m a mom now; I’m of service to young women globally with the program I created in 2006 — you bring more of that strength and knowing yourself and sense of self to everything you do whether it’s in a role or behind the scenes as a producer or director. We keep growing we keep changing and my relationship to the industry to different roles I choose to play it keeps evolving as I do. There’s no separation.

Leading the way was an unusual item: a Letter to the Editor! Not that it's unusual to get a Letter to the Editor. No this is only unusual in the sense that these letters do not often lead our most-read stories of the week.

This past week Gazette readers also turned to memories of Raynham Park; Mayor Shaunna O'Connell withdrew her pick for Taunton's first chief financial officer; and an anti-vax protest on the Berkley-Dighton bridge got some attention.

These were the Top 5 stories of the week according to Gazette readers:

Letter to the Editor: Rittenhouse verdict sends a frightening message

This week's most-read piece was a Letter to the Editor we received from Kathryn N. Cunningham about the Rittenhouse verdict.

Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty of intentional homicide and reckless endangerment after being put on trial for fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber with an AR-15 style rifle during a 2020 protest in Kenosha Wisconsin. He also wounded Gaige Grosskreutz. Rittenhouse's mother brought him across state lines to the protest which followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake a Black man in Kenosha. Blake was left paralyzed and the white police officer who shot him was cleared of any federal or state charges.

""We're going to continue to fight"" Justin Blake the uncle of Jacob Blake told news cameras posted outside the courthouse after the verdict. ""Somehow some way those 12 jurors who had the evidence found he was innocent of the charges yet we have two young men that will never be walking through the door to their families again.""

From the trial:Kyle Rittenhouse found not guilty on all counts of homicide reckless endangerment

Memories of Raynham Park

The grandstand at Raynham Park was demolished in early November as part of a massive makeover of the park which hosted live greyhound racing until it was banned statewide in 2011. The demolition brought back memories for both Raynham Park regulars and the people who used to work there.

""It was the place to go"" said Stephen Smith who remembers pulling down $14 a night as a lead out back when Raynham Park ruled the local entertainment scene.

Smith worked the track from 1968 when he was 14 until he graduated from Taunton High School in 1972.

Like it does for countless others the mostly demolished park holds a special place in his memories.

O'Connell withdraws pick for Taunton's first CFO

Mayor Shaunna O'Connell has withdrawn her pick for the city's first chief financial officer Patrick Dello Russo pending further review of potential red flags that include a personal bankruptcy in 2016.

O'Connell had planned to ask the City Council to confirm her choice of Dello Russo at Tuesday's council meeting. Dello Russo had recently gone on paid administrative leave from his post as treasurer-collector for Marshfield. The Board of Selectmen in that town said the move was for ""personal reasons.""

At press time the Gazette had been unable to reach Dello Russo.

An anti-vax protest was held recently on the Berkley-Dighton bridge prompting one Dighton resident to mask up and engage in respectful dialogue with the protesters. Gazette Reporter Chris Helms was there and has the story here.

Each of the three coronavirus vaccines has been authorized for emergency use and have undergone clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people in addition to peer-reviewed studies.

The Pfizer vaccine is fully FDA-approved for people 16 and older and authorized for emergency use for children 5-15. Both the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are authorized for emergency use for people 18 and older.

Officials said someone opened fire in the parking lot of a Walmart Supercenter on Ferguson Road around 3:30 p.m. Jamontea Brown 24 was killed in the shooting.

Community activist Rodney Christian said Brown was shot in the head while walking out of the store during the busy holiday weekend.

""That means you have no conscious that means your level of doing what you do is at a high level"" Christian said. ""You didn't care. That's what we get out here — people who do not care. And they have guns.""

Michael Wilkinson showed up to the store Saturday to shop for the holidays. He was not expecting to see a crime scene; nor did he think he would know the victim. Wilkinson said he is friends with one of Brown's loved ones.

""They said very good things about him said he was very family oriented"" Wilkinson said. ""They said he always had a smile on his face. They had no negative thing to say about him.""

Brown's family had a vigil at the Walmart Sunday saying they want privacy as they continue to mourn the 24-year-old father.

""The fact that he had a child him being taken away from his children that's one of the things that makes it an even sadder story"" Wilkinson said.

His family questioned how something so horrible could happen just feet away from CPD's District 3 headquarters. A witness at the scene of the shooting said there are cameras in the parking lot that could help with the police investigation.

The scene was the second shooting Christian went to Saturday which had him calling for change.

""When is enough enough? And when is everybody gonna get on board and start making change?"" Christian said.

The Homicide Unit is investigating the shooting. Anyone with information is asked to call 513-352-3542.

The shooting is the second at a Cincinnati retail center in as many days. Crews responded to a shooting at an IHOP in the Oakley neighborhood Friday night. One man was injured. He is expected to be OK.

A Walmart in Colerain Township was one of many shooting scenes earlier this month. Police responded to four locations within several blocks of each other in Colerain Township and Mt. Healthy; however no one was hurt.

In Columbus one man was shot outside a Target store in broad daylight Nov. 8.

If you like many other gamers have Sony‘s PlayStation 5 on your wish list then you’ll want to get in the virtual line at Walmart. The discount retailer is releasing both in-demand consoles on Cyber Monday — but you’ll have to be a Walmart+ member to get early access. (Other stores including Amazon gave Prime members access to shop until Nov. 23.)

Walmart is restocking the PS5 ($499) and the digital edition ($399) which will both be available to Walmart+ members Nov. 29 starting at 9 a.m. PT / 12 p.m. ET. The PS5 along with Nintendo’s Switch OLED and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X gaming console (three of this season’s most popular gifting items) have all been sold out as a result of COVID-19 shipping delays and chip shortages.

Getting behind the velvet retail rope requires membership to Walmart+ which lets you shop the retailer’s special releases and shopping events (such as Black Friday) up to four hours earlier than everyone else. It costs $13 monthly or $98 annually and includes free delivery from your local store on orders over $35 free shipping with no purchase minimums discounts on prescription medicines and gas contact-free checkout at Walmart stores and more. If you’re a new member you can take advantage of the 15-day free trial.

The difference between Sony’s PS5 and the digital edition is that the former comes with a 4K Blu-Ray player (a great option for cinephiles) while the latter doesn’t include a disc drive (which knocks $100 off the price). Other than that they have identical specs: they’re both equipped with AMD’s Ryzen Zen 2 CPU with eight cores 16 threads and up to 3.5 GHz speeds; and Radeon RDNA 2 architecture (which delivers realistic ray tracing) 825 GB SSD and 16 GB GDDR RAM.

All of that means that the PS5 delivers fluid gameplay at 120 fps supports 4K and 8K output (so you can play on 4230p displays) and includes immersive Tempest 3D AudioTech on headphones or speakers. The console comes with a DualSense wireless controller with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

Bookmark Walmart’s early access product pages below and set your alarm for 9 a.m. PT / 12 p.m. ET on Cyber Monday if you’re hoping to get your hands on the hot commodity.

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvcmV2aWV3LWVuY2FudG8tYS12aXN1YWwtbWFzdGVycGllY2UtYnV0LW5vdC1hLWRpc25leS1jbGFzc2ljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,REVIEW: “Encanto” - A Visual Masterpiece Just Short of a Disney Classic,"Encanto is the latest film from Walt Disney Animated Studios telling the tale of a young Colombian girl and her desire to find her place. Each member of the Madrigal family has been blessed with enchanted powers and abilities. Unfortunately for Mirabel she is the only member of her family that does not exhibit such powers. At times she feels that she has been cursed and wonders why she is the only family member who is not special. Throughout her journey she comes to learn that there are more important things than magical powers that make one special.

Encanto was led by the directors of Tangled and Zootopia which in my opinion are two modern Disney animated classics. Going into the movie I had really high hopes that this would be the case for Encanto but this movie was a slight disappointment for me. It just seemed to lack the fun and interesting stories of their previous features.

I think one of the big problems similar to Eternals is that there are too many characters. There just isn’t enough time for much character development other than Mirabel. There are maybe a dozen family members and I think it would have been best to cut that number in half. I understand that they were probably going for the idea of showcasing a large diverse number of family members but the only names I really could remember were Mirabel Bruno Luisa and Abuela. In a case where there are too many characters some will stand out while others will not. I will say that this movie is really fast paced and it does not drag at all.

Maybe it would have been too similar to Frozen but I think the story would have worked better if it focused more on Mirabel and her sister. Mirabel and her sister are two polar opposites and they do not get along. Seeing the both of them work together to find out that maybe they have more in common than they originally thought could have led to a more interesting story.

On the positive side this movie is a visual work of art. Walt Disney Animation Studios has become a powerhouse when it comes to their animation style. They really have no competition. I think it would be fair to say that they even surpass Pixar now. The colors in this movie just pop with such detail and there are so many of them. Even when a scene has its dark moments you can’t help but notice the beauty and fine detail in those scenes. I do favor the design of the characters in Disney Animation to Pixar. When I look at Tangled and even the recent Raya And The Last Dragon I’m still amazed at what Disney can accomplish with their characters.

I also think its great that this movie helps showcase Columbian culture. The diversity of each family member the architecture the lush landscapes the food the music and the importance of family are all represented in Encanto. There is such a big world out there that could be used as a backdrop to modern fairy tales and it’s nice that the audience gets to see it. It makes you leave the theater and wish that maybe we could see some of Encanto represented in EPCOT’s World Showcase.

The voice actors in Encanto are all very good. Everyone seems to match their characters voice perfectly and for me there was only one recognizable voice. I appreciate that because I would rather identify the voice with the character than with a well known actor.

The one thing that I have noticed is that in the last few years Disney has been making movies without villains. You look at Moana Ralph Breaks The Internet Frozen II Raya And The Last Dragon Onward Soul and Luca. Like Encanto the one thing they have in common is there is no main villain. A great villain makes a movie. Where would the Lion King be without Scar or The Little Mermaid without Ursula? The hero always needs a great antagonist so that their victory is that much sweeter. And from the list of movies that I just mentioned above are any of those movies really considered Disney classics? I think Disney has gotten too soft and that they might feel that kids don’t want to see bad guys anymore in their movies. Bring back the villain!

As far as the music goes I’m just not a big fan of Lin Manuel Miranda’s music. I know that there are millions who are and that I am in the minority but to me his music doesn’t work well with Disney animated features. There are a few standouts but I also think there are some duds too. Waiting On A Miracle is by far my favorite but the music that I enjoyed the most were those that were sung in their native language. I’m glad that they included some songs that were sung in Spanish and it makes me look forward to re-watching Encanto with the Spanish language option. I love watching Coco in Spanish and Luca only improved for me once I was able to watch it in Italian. I have a feeling that will be the case for me with Encanto.

I’m not sure what children are going to think of Encanto. The movie is beautiful to look at and there are some amusing characters for them to see but I think the story will go over their head. There are a lot of things that just are not explained properly. I think the message of Mirabel not having powers will probably be very relatable to children that may not excel in sports or don’t feel they have a special talent but I also think they would rather watch Frozen for the hundredth time instead of seeing this movie over and over again.

Before I end this I needed to talk about the animated short that appears before the start of the Encanto. It’s called Far From The Tree and I loved it. It is about a young raccoon who learns from their parent how to survive in the wilderness. For the first minute I was asking myself why does this look so different? Then I realized that it was done in the hand drawn animation style. This put a big smile on my face and made me realize that Disney has to go back to doing some animated features in the hand drawn animated style. It’s not very long at all but I got more enjoyment out of Far From The Tree than I did with all of Encanto. And the raccoons were raccoons! They didn’t sing they didn’t have human voices but they expressed every emotion perfectly. I have a lot of respect for director Natalie Nourigat and I hope we see a lot more of her work in the near future.

Encanto is one of Disney’s most visually stunning animated features. Some of the music is very well done that highlights the spirit of family within Columbian culture. In no way does this film drag but at times it’s just not as interesting as previous Disney entries and lacks the charm of previous animated features.

I give Encanto a 6/10.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS93b25kZXJmdWwtd29ybGQtZGlzbmV5LW1hZ2ljYWwtaG9saWRheS1jZWxlYnJhdGlvbi1jZWxlYnJpdHktbGluZS0xNjUzNTI20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Wonderful World of Disney Line-Up: Everyone Starring in 'Magical Holiday Celebration',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/wonderful-world-disney-magical-holiday-celebration-celebrity-line-1653526 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS93b25kZXJmdWwtd29ybGQtZGlzbmV5LW1hZ2ljYWwtaG9saWRheS1jZWxlYnJhdGlvbi1jZWxlYnJpdHktbGluZS0xNjUzNTI20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjEvMTEvZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWhpZGRlbi1jYW1lcmFzLWtjMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walt Disney World Watches Guests Through Hidden Surveillance Cameras - Inside the Magic,"Walt Disney World is filled with one-of-a-kind entertainment unique restaurants magic and more. But did you know that while visiting the Most Magical Place on Earth Cast Members are always watching you… thanks to several hidden cameras spread throughout the theme parks?

In a video posted to TikTok by The Mouselets they uncover one of Disney’s biggest secrets — hidden cameras. All around the theme parks Disney has placed hidden cameras so that they can keep an eye on Guests ensuring everyone is following the Park rules.

Within the video (below) we can see hidden cameras at various locations including inside the Mexico pavilion at EPCOT and on top of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom.

We also know that many Walt Disney World attractions have cameras located inside of them so that Cast Members can keep an eye on Guests and ensure they are following the rules. For example one time a Cast Member came over the loud speaker on Carousel of Progress to tell the Guests to keep their face coverings on during the entire show. Cast Members were able to see Guests remove their face coverings thanks to hidden security cameras placed throughout the rotating theater.

We also know the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover has security cameras throughout the ride track so that Cast Members can make sure Guests remain seated with their hands arms feet and legs inside the vehicles at all times.

Did you know that Walt Disney World is filled with hidden cameras? Let us know in the comments below.

Time and time again we see a young female protagonist distraught with her life looking for something more. She might find it through a search for her true identity reconciling with loved ones or going on a magical journey. In Encanto’s case it’s all of the above — and it works.

Despite its predictability Encanto released exclusively in theaters Nov. 24 stands on its own as one of the best to come out of Walt Disney Animation Studios in recent years. Its themes of belonging self identity and family are extremely relatable.

It tells the story of Mirabel Madrigal the only ‘normal’ child born to a miraculous family who are all endowed with magical superhuman abilities. While dealing with her own insecurities Mirabel finds that the family’s sentient house is beginning to lose its magic and that she is the only one who can save her family and their special gifts. She must find her place without any magical powers and learn to accept herself along the way.

Mirabel is a protagonist that is easy to like and her imperfect relationships with family members are realistic — something that Disney seems to be taking notes on from Pixar. It would not be surprising if she ascended to the rank of Disney princess although that will ultimately depend on Encanto’s box office success.

Encanto doesn’t quite contend with the songwriting genius of Moana or the witty writing of Tangled but the film is an example of what Disney can accomplish if they devote their talents (and their massive animation budget — Encanto had a budget of $120 million) to a story people will care about. Especially as the company’s reputation grows for churning out remakes or heartless sequels Encanto is proof that there is still hope for the money-driven conglomerate.

The film’s most alluring trait has got to be its colorful textured eye-catching animation. Set in a small village in the mountains of Colombia the film has a wonderfully designed cast of characters and equally wonderful animated choreography. The musical numbers within Encanto feel as though they have been plucked directly from a Broadway stage and imbued with the very same rejuvenating magic within the Madrigal family.

It is no surprise that Encanto has a distinctly theatrical quality as each of its songs were written by Lin Manuel Miranda best known for writing the hit musicals Hamilton and In the Heights. He also wrote the lyrics for the soundtrack of Moana and was approached in 2016 by John Lasseter the then-chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studioswith an idea for Encanto.

It is also expected that the film would carry a very similar tune to Moana as one of its directors Jared Bush wrote the 2016 film. Bush co-directed alongside Bryon Howard who also directed Tangled and Zootopia.

Even with the talent behind it Encanto is not a perfect film. It could have used a bit more humor and energy in its first half which felt exposition-heavy and a bit bland aside from the soundtrack. If you have seen any number of Disney movies focusing on a single protagonist the plot becomes predictable very quickly. Mirabel has a strained relationship with her family members and the Madrigals start losing their magic abilities when she feels the most isolated; the solution isn’t hard to imagine.

Encanto separates itself from the rest of Disney’s recent films with its representation of Colombian culture as well as in its theatrical soundtrack and stunning correlating visuals. Although it has a formulaic storyline it asserts itself as one of Disney’s best and ultimately proves the studio is still capable of producing a good original movie.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc25leXRvdXJpc3RibG9nLmNvbS9jcm93ZHMtYWZ0ZXItdGhhbmtzZ2l2aW5nLWRpc25leS13b3JsZC1ob2xpZGF5LXNlYXNvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Post-Thanksgiving Crowds at Disney World: Holiday Hangover?,

WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL25vdi8yNy9hcmthbnNhcy1yZWN5Y2xlcnMtZXhwZWN0LWluY3JlYXNlLWluLXBhY2thZ2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arkansas recyclers expect increase in packaging material from '20 holiday shopping season,"As Arkansans shop for Black Friday and cyber Monday deals recycling facilities are preparing for a projected 10% increase in packaging material over last year's online holiday shopping.

""The forecast for this holiday season includes increases in online shopping and shipping"" said Craig Douglass executive director of the Regional Recycling District in Pulaski County. ""That means more cardboard boxes will be showing up on the doorsteps of area residences. It also means an increased opportunity to recycle cardboard.""

December has long been a predictably busy time for online retailers and customer service but the covid-19 pandemic has increased demand further.

""Each person generates 36 more pounds of waste in December than in other month of the year. That's the equivalent of throwing away 58 teddy bears"" Plastic Free Little Rock posted last month from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity.

With even more cardboard boxes being shipped to area residences than ever before Adobe Analytics an online retail research company predicted the significant bump in online shopping this year.

Regional Recycling will conduct a cardboard recycling education program from Dec. 1-26 to help address how to dispose of the extra materials predicted to arrive on the doorsteps of Arkansans. The program will use television radio print and social media to connect with consumers according to a Nov. 22 news release.

""It's important to understand that cardboard in a landfill releases methane which is 25 times more harmful to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide"" Douglass said.

District leaders hope to inform residential customers about how to prepare cardboard for waste management to pick up. It must be flat meaning cardboard boxes must be broken down and fit inside the curbside recycling cart for pick up according to the release.

Douglass added ""please don't overstuff the cart and put all plastic wraps and Styrofoam in the garbage not the recycling cart.""

Cardboard and other recyclables -- aluminum steel and tin cans; number-one and number-two plastics; paper cardboard newspapers and other materials -- are not the only items that show up at Central Arkansas' materials recovery facility known as ""MRF"" plant manager Rusty Miller said. The holiday season is an especially interesting time at the Little Rock Recycling Facility.

""It's like Christmas every morning here"" Miller said.

He showed off some of the latest finds Wednesday including a battered violin in its case and a wooden training missile shell from World War II.

""One of the catchphrases now is 'wish recycling' – when you put it in there wishing it will make it through the system and be recycled"" but for a lot of reasons including cost it can't be recycled with the current system Miller said.

This time of year recycling workers start to see old Christmas lights organic food and yard waste (that can be composted but not recycled) as well as liquid contaminants he said.

These as well as other common ""non-recyclable"" items like metal from large tires plastic bags and garden hoses can all damage the facility's machines. Recycling contamination can also lead buyers to either reject the recycled sorted materials or buy them at a lower price.

""Those are the kinds of contaminants that we see here that cause a lot of issues"" Miller said. ""While we don't want to discourage people from recycling -- be telling them we have to keep it clean -- it's necessary to do that to make the system work. And for the most part the people of Central Arkansas who we get our material from do a very very good job.""

Brittany Nichols sustainability educator with the city of Little Rock said residents can also try to avoid packaging waste – recyclable and non-recyclable – by buying local or used products this holiday season.

She said contamination in the area has been up since the summer based on what's been recovered during cleanups.

""It's good to just think about the life span of that object"" she said referring to the packaging and the actual purchased good. People can also look for ways to reuse items like plastic containers or cardboard boxes.

Nichols who is also an organizer with the Little Rock resident-led group Plastic Free said the group will be talking more about buying and living in an eco-friendly way at a meeting on Dec. 9 at 5:30 p.m.

The Regional Recycling District in Pulaski County works directly with the public works and sanitation departments of Pulaski County and the cities of Little Rock North Little Rock Sherwood Jacksonville Maumelle and Wrightsville to accomplish integrated waste disposal reduction and recycling services according to the district.

The National waste prevention and management plan (2021-2027) includes food waste prevention measures:

- funding measures to support - food sharing or food donation initiatives short food supply chains development and implementation of innovative and environmentally friendly technologies;

- awareness raising campaigns;

- regulatory framework for obligatorily donation of food in accordance with good foreign practice.

The National energy and climate action plan of the Republic of Lithuania (2021–2030) includes policies and measures that focus on educating and informing the public about the problem of food waste and how to prevent it improving waste sorting skills creating information websites applications and interactive maps; in an effort to reduce the amounts of landfill waste and associated greenhouse gas emissions.

Since 2015 The Chancellery of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania organizes inter-institutional coordination meetings on food loss and food waste reduction in Lithuania. In 2017 it was decided to continue the activities of the Coordinating Working Group for the Determination of Food Waste Prevention and Management Measures (analogue of the Platform on Food Loss and Food Waste) which was approved by the Minister of Environment of the Republic of Lithuania in 2017.

The working group facilitates communications and cooperation between relevant authorities but also with stakeholders. The main food loss and waste prevention measures implemented by the members of the working group include updating the legal framework social responsibility actions as well as awareness raising initiatives.

Food Law states that food that does not comply with the requirements of food and other legal acts but is safe and fit for human consumption may be donated in accordance with the procedure established by the Director of the State Food and Veterinary Service .

In national legislation is allowed that surplus food from food industry can be donated to charity and by-products from the food and beverage industry can be used to feed animals. By order of the Director of the State Food and Veterinary Service 2 procedures were issued setting out the requirements for donating food to charity and for using non-animal foodstuffs for animal feed: Description of food management for charity and support and Description of procedures for the use of non - animal origin food for animals feed.

In 2021 an amendment to the Description of food management for charity and support was adopted which provides for the possibility of freezing and submitting to charities for processing various expired fresh meat packed in charity canteens marked with the indication ""Expiry date ...""

The Ministry of Agriculture have been prepared draft rules for the providing support for food donated to charity. The rules is currently in a draft state and soon will be adopted it will give the support to reduce food waste in the primary production.

Amended regulation related to imported exported and placed on the marked fresh fruit and vegetables:

The waste management hierarchy is applied to all waste streams including food waste. Waste management law states that as of 2024 the separate collection of household food waste will be mandatory. Separate collection of food waste from households is succsessfully implemented in Alytus region since the end of 2018. Other municipalities are carrying out pilot projects and are preparing for separate collection of household food waste.



In 2019 The Ministry of Health prepared the Guidelines for the implementation of the buffet principle and measures for the reduction of food waste. ‘Swedish buffet’ principles are implemented in kindergartens and schools canteens in order to minimize food waste and encourage healthy meal choices.

At the request of the Ministry of Agriculture the Lithuanian Institute of Agricultural Economics is preparing two researches: “Principal application of the circular economy (waste) in agriculture and food industry: waste recovery analysis recommendations” and ""Determining the level and causes of food loss and food waste throughout the food supply chain and developing recommendations"". Based on these the Ministry will take steps for prevention of food waste at primary production and food industry or the valorization of food waste into high value-added products.

Ministry of Agriculture prepared a leaflet for primary producers on how to donate products to charities.

The national food bank Maisto bankas created an informative booklet for food business operators who wish to donate food. According to Lithuanian legislation companies that donate surplus food for charity organisations benefit from income tax reliefs.

Several awareness-raising actions on food waste have been implemented in Lithuania. The Lithuanian Consumer Institute developed the campaign ‘Sincerely food’ as well as audio-visual tools (videos interactive quizzes infotainment games etc.) printed materials trainings (professional and community-based trainings) and workshops on food waste prevention. Special attention is given to the topic of date marking; the State Food and Veterinary Service published information about difference between ‘use by’ and ‘best before’ dates for consumers.

The project ‘Sustainable Home’ (Darnūs namai) encourages consumers to apply the main principles of a circular economy raising awareness about the importance of responsible consumption reducing waste (including food waste) and fighting climate change.

The education material for children on food waste ‘Do good: Save food!’ developed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation have been adopted and translated into Lithuanian and distributed to Lithuanian schools and kindergartens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkva29jaGkvd29tZW4tc2NyaXB0LXN1Y2Nlc3MtaW4td2FzdGUtbWdtdC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NzkzNzc4Ny5jbXPSAW5odHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2tvY2hpL3dvbWVuLXNjcmlwdC1zdWNjZXNzLWluLXdhc3RlLW1nbXQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg3OTM3Nzg3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women script success in waste management,TRIPUNITHURA: At a time when many local bodies are finding it difficult to deal with tonnes of daily domestic waste a Kudumbashree unit has been successfully running a waste management unit here and recycling both food and plastic waste for the past two years.“With the repeated request from a section of residents of ward number 41 in Tripunithura municipality ward councillor Jaya Parameswaran had put forward this idea of a waste management unit” says Ramani who is part of the three-member unit headed by Ramlath.With technical assistance of the health department of the municipality the unit started functioning on February 11 2019.“Fortunately we could find a puramboke land of the municipality for installing the waste processing unit. In the beginning the waste collection process was segregated as food waste and plastic waste. We charge Rs 100 from each house in the ward for food waste collection and Rs 50 per month for plastic waste” she said.Rathi another member of the unit said that as the municipality has started collecting plastic waste directly they have started focusing on managing food waste.“Four brick chambers are used for converting food waste into compost. Food waste collected from houses is kept in a separate cabin which covers a layer of chemical stimulant to convert it into compost. We got a short-term training in Palakkad for processing compost from food and other biodegradable waste” Rathi said.Later they started to do the same process by replacing chemical stimulants with leaves. After crushing these layers for two or three days it would be transferred to the second cabin.At first residents had feared of foul smell from the unit.“However they were later convinced that no foul smell or worms would come out from the unit’’ Rathi said.Moreover the three women are very keen to keep the unit clean. Of the total five hundred families in this ward around 180 families are giving food waste to this unit.“Residents from other wards are asking us to collect waste from their compound too. But as per the present system we are bound to work only in ward number 41” said Ramani.The three women were honoured during the last Gandhi Jayanthi day for their efforts. .,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZWF0dGxldGltZXMuY29tL3NlYXR0bGUtbmV3cy9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC93YXNoaW5ndG9uLXN0YXRlLXNlZWtzLXRpZ2h0ZXItcmVndWxhdGlvbnMtb2Ytd2FzdGV3YXRlci1pbi1wdWdldC1zb3VuZC1idXQtc2V3YWdlLXBsYW50LW9wZXJhdG9ycy1wdXNoLWJhY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Washington seeks tighter regulations of wastewater in Puget Sound but sewage plant operators push back,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Stalin there exists a gap that the civic body is yet to fill.

Of the 1100 to 1200 tonnes waste the city generates a day the waste management contractor Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Company Pvt. Ltd. handled 600 tonnes and the Corporation another 100 to 150 tonnes by turning them into compost.

This left the Corporation with around 400 tonnes waste which it was not processing but dumping in the open in Vellalore said the Corporation sources adding it had been the gap that the Corporation had not addressed as yet.

The problem started within a year or so of the Corporation implementing the solid waste management project in 2009-10 under the then Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission at around ₹ 100 crore.

At the time of implementing the project the Corporation had estimated the waste to be processed at around 600 tonnes a day. But soon thereafter the city limits expanded as 11 local bodies merged with the Corporation increasing the waste to be processed every day to around 900 tonnes.

Over the years the quantity of waste generated increased to around 1100 to 1200 tonnes a day. In the last 10 years the Corporation had been dumping in Vellalore the waste generated over and above the quantity processed at the contractor’s processing plant.

This dumped waste had piled up so much that the Corporation had to recently spend ₹ 60 crore to process around nine lakh cubic metre spread over 60 acre in Vellalore. The Corporation using the Smart Cities Mission fund had started bio-mining the accumulated waste. However it continued to dump the additional waste the sources said and added it was to process this additional quantity that the civic body needed to plan a project.

And if the Corporation were to plan such a project it should do so for not just the current additional waste but twice or thrice the quantity keeping in mind the future needs and the possibility that the city area could once again increase the sources added."

Cornish Lithium said that securing long-term investment from TechMet is a significant step forward that allows it to accelerate its activities towards creating a domestic supply of lithium and other battery metals for the UK.

The investment is the first that Cornish Lithium has secured from a financial institution. Cornish Lithium expects to benefit from TechMet’s deep knowledge of the battery metals supply chain and extensive commercial and strategic relationships.

The investment will occur in two tranches: The first tranche of £9 million (US$12 million) to be invested upon receipt of shareholder approval and the second tranche of £9 million will be invested at the option of TechMet following the delivery of the Scoping Study for the Trelavour Hard Rock Project which is on track for completion in Q2 2022.

The company will use the proceeds from the investment to progress both its hard rock and geothermal work streams and is expected to provide sufficient working capital to fund its development plans to at least the end of 2022.

Cornwall is underlain by a mass of granite—the Cornubian batholith. This granite is one of five large-scale bulk lithium-enriched granites worldwide (as mapped and highlighted by the USGS). In Cornwall lithium is contained within mica minerals (zinnwaldite and lepidolite). Some Cornish granite is more highly enriched in lithium than others and the company is investigating the potential to produce lithium from such highly enriched granite at its Trelavour hard rock project.

The granite is also rich in heat. This means there is significant potential for lithium-enriched geothermal waters across the region. These waters can be accessed via boreholes drilled from the surface in to permeable geological faults at depth. Once the waters have been pumped to the surface it is possible to extract selectively the lithium compounds using environmentally responsible Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies.

By utilizing geothermal energy to power this extraction there is the opportunity to produce zero-carbon lithium. Cornish Lithium aims to produce battery-quality zero-carbon lithium chemicals directly from the geothermal waters.

With regard to Cornish Lithium’s exploration plans for lithium contained in geothermal waters the funding will enable the company to drill and evaluate additional sites further demonstrating the regional potential in Cornwall. In addition the Company will explore opportunities to generate complimentary commercial heat supplies in order to provide local businesses with low carbon energy.

The funding will also enable further research into DLE and refining technologies to optimize the recovery of lithium in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.

In relation to the Trelavour Project the proceeds will enable Cornish Lithium to complete several key workstreams. Following completion of the scoping study the company intends to construct a demonstration scale beneficiation and hydrometallurgical plant in order to refine further the metallurgical extraction process which will ultimately inform the design of a commercial production plant.

The company now expects to have sufficient funding to complete a feasibility study on the Trelavour Project which the company would use to obtain the necessary debt and equity finance to enable project construction.

TechMet was founded in 2017 by British/South African metals industrialist Brian Menell with the aim of developing assets that produce metals for which global demand is expected to vastly outweigh supply as the world moves to clean energy technologies. Its assets include Li-Cycle Corp (North America’s largest lithium-ion battery recycling company listed on the NYSE); Brazilian Nickel (a mining and extraction company developing production of nickel and cobalt suitable for EV batteries); US Vanadium (which produces vanadium products suitable for redox flow batteries); and Tinco (a portfolio of producing tin and tungsten mines).

TechMet’s largest shareholders include Lansdowne Partners (one of London’s foremost asset managers); the US International Development Finance Corporation (the US Government’s development finance institution); and Mercuria (the global energy and commodity trading company) together with TechMet Chairman and CEO Brian Menell.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2RheS5jby50dC8yMDIxLzExLzI4L3Bvcy1ob3NwaXRhbC10ZW50LXdhdGVyLWxvZ2dlZC1hcy1mbGFzaC1mbG9vZGluZy1oaXRzLWNpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PoS hospital tent water-logged as flash flooding hits city,"PoS hospital tent water-logged as flash flooding hits city

In this file photo a woman tries to get up after falling in flood water while trying to cross South Quay Port of Spain. -

Patients at the Port of Spain General Hospital were among people who were affected by flash flooding as thunder showers swept some parts of the country on Saturday.

Operations at a tent set up outside the Accident and Emergency department at the hospital were briefly halted when the tent flooded.

A video of the flooded tent which was circulated on social media showed several patients on stretchers some wearing oxygen masks as water covered the floor.

In a press release the North West Regional Health Authority said “The issue was immediately dealt with and clean-up operations at the site have been completed.

“As a precaution contingency measures have been implemented to mitigate against any further occurrence.

“The Authority apologises to our clients for this incident. We remain committed to the provision of care in a safe and comfortable environment.”

Port of Spain mayor Joel Martinez told Newsday that while there was widespread flooding there were no reports of damage.

“The Corporation really didn’t have to respond in any major way to the waters today because the waters subsided pretty quickly.

“I believe the tide was out so whatever pooling of water took place it was able to subside very quickly and there was no damage.”

In contrast to scenes in Port of Spain most of central and south Trinidad were spared the effects of the bad weather.

At 9:59 am on Saturday the TT Meteorological Office issued a yellow alert warning until 6pm for Trinidad as there was a 70 per cent chance of heavy showers and thunderstorms.

In its alert the met office also said there was the threat of isolated flash flooding and warned people to be cautious.

Chairman of the Penal/Debe Regional Corporation Dr Allen Sammy said there were no reports of flooding in the corporation.

Sammy told Newsday “I got no reports of flooding so I got the impression that rain didn’t fall in Penal/Debe like it did in other parts of Trinidad.

“It’s not the usual kind of heavy thunderstorms we usually get. It fell steadily from 11am until 1pm at least where I live and it has just been overcast since then.”

Though he was thankful there were no floods on Saturday Sammy said street and flash flooding has become a regular occurrence in Penal/Debe.

“As I always tell people we would get some (flood) in the road and so on but it’s not an issue in Penal/Debe it’s only when it goes into the home when people complain.”

Chaguanas Mayor Faaiq Mohammed told Newsday there were no reports of flooding in the borough.

Even though Saturday’s yellow alert level was expected to end at 6pm the met office discontinued it at 3.28pm.",,,,,,,,,

The Multi-Cultural Chambers of Commerce collaborated with Wells Fargo bank to give business owners information and access to capital at an event was held Nov.18 at Higher Ground Community Center 2010 Mandela Parkway Oakland California.

Banking professionals and representatives from Community Development Financial Institutions shared their knowledge en masse in the morning then following lunchbreak speakers were available for one-on-one networking.

“We are excited to have hosted an informative workshop with representatives from Working Solutions and KIVA” said Cathy Adams president of the Oakland African American Chamber of Commerce. “Our businesses have suffered in so many ways during this pandemic and we need to take advantage of each opportunity to access capital for our businesses to increase revenue sales.

“I am equally proud to have Wells Fargo as a partner with the Multi-Cultural Chambers of Commerce to unite our efforts to support our businesses in Oakland. The grant in the amount of $100000 will assist each Chamber to do similar workshops starting January 2022” Adams said.

Representatives from the following Chambers were in attendance: Oakland African American Chamber of Commerce Oakland Latino Chamber of Commerce Oakland Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce and Oakland Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce.

Wells Fargo Bank provided business owners the opportunity to learn what banks look for when they review loan applications. Wells Fargo Team Member Network discussed how they provide support for local business owners.

“Wells Fargo is proud to team up with the Multi-Cultural Chambers to create a three-phase coaching platform that can demystify access to capital” said Chuck Baker vice president of social impact and sustainability for Wells Fargo. “The first phase is the kickoff event that helps businesses understand how to access capital at a broad level — from crowdfunding via Kiva to low-interest loans with Working Solutions Microloans to up to $200 million through Wells Fargo.”

The next phase will be the culturally relevant workshops that will be conducted by each chamber in early 2022. The third phase will be one-on-one coaching that will occur directly with businesses including in-language tools and direct technical assistance for their members

The problem is how to get drugs like naloxone to the people who need them when they need them — when seconds matter.

Researchers at the University of Washington’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science along with their fellow Huskies at UW Medicine have designed a wearable device like an artificial pancreas that can detect the signs of an opioid overdose and automatically inject naloxone which can restore breathing.

“This wearable auto-injector may have the potential to reduce fatalities due to opioid overdoses” Shyam Gollakota professor of computer science and engineering at UW said.

“We are hopeful it can have a tangible impact on a big source of suffering in this country.”

The other epidemic: “The opioid epidemic has become worse during the pandemic and has continued to be a major public health crisis” lead author and Allen PhD. student Justin Chan said.

Fears of overdose deaths increasing amid COVID lockdowns economic and social disruption and the psychological and emotional distress wrought by the pandemic have come to pass in a tragic way.

CDC preliminary data estimates that over 100000 Americans died of overdoses in the 12 months after the country locked down in March 2020.

CDC preliminary data estimates that over 100000 Americans died of overdoses in the 12 months after the country locked down in March 2020. The death toll is the highest ever recorded an increase of 25000 deaths compared to the 12 months prior to the pandemic.

Fatal overdoses were up nearly across the board as opioid synthetic opioid (mainly fentanyl) psychostimulant (meth) and cocaine deaths all increased.

“Two forces here are the negative economic impact of the pandemic as well as the emotional impact” Johns Hopkins associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care Paul Christo told USA Today.

“That led a lot of people to use drugs … to cope.”

AI vs. ODs: The UW researchers’ wearable published in Scientific Reports is the latest idea in an approach to drugs called “harm reduction.” The strategy aims to reduce overdoses by making drug use safer with interventions like supervised use facilities needle exchanges and distributing naloxone.

Naloxone can reverse overdoses but it has to be administered by someone else. People consuming drugs alone are at high risk of overdose since there’s no one around to call 911 or administer naloxone — something that may have gotten worse in the era of social distancing.

The UW wearable works by detecting when a wearer is suffering from an opioid overdose and then injecting naloxone automatically to reverse it.

Naloxone can reverse overdoses but it has to be administered by someone else.

It is worn on the wearer’s stomach similar to an insulin pump or artificial pancreas combined with sensors that detect patterns in breathing and motion. When it detects that the wearer has stopped breathing and moving it injects naloxone using an under-the-skin injection device developed in a collaboration with West Pharmaceutical Services in suburban Philadelphia.

The prototype uses accelerometers to measure respiration and a built-in processor can detect the absence of the motions that signify normal breathing. All of that data is sent to an AI which determines if an injection of naloxone is necessary.

“We have created algorithms that run on a wearable injector to detect when the wearer stops breathing and automatically inject naloxone” Chan said.

How to train an AI to save a life: Those algorithms need training however and to acquire the crucial breathing data the researchers worked with volunteers in a Vancouver safe injection facility.

Working with 25 volunteers the AI was able to learn the respiration rates of people with opioid use disorder. The algorithm could also identify the signs of non-medical opioid-induced apnea a breathing problem which often heralds an overdose.

The small Vancouver study was only used to acquire breathing data to help train the AI; it did not involve the actual injection of naloxone.

Researchers have designed a wearable device that can detect the signs of an opioid overdose and automatically inject naloxone which can restore breathing.

Naloxone was injected into volunteers at a second study at the UW Medical Center. The hospital study had 20 volunteers simulate an opioid overdose. While wearing the injection system the participants first performed two breathing exercises to give the AI a baseline for their breathing.

Then they faked an overdose by holding their breath for 20 seconds; the algorithm recognized their “distress” at the 15 second mark and successfully injected naloxone. Post-injection blood analysis determined that the device got naloxone into their system.

The bigger picture: While the UW team’s work had previously shown that an AI can detect an overdose getting naloxone to the user in time remained the crucial challenge said UW’s Gollakota. The proof-of-concept device could potentially be this next step.

“This has the potential to be transformative for millions of people who have opioid overdose disorder.”

“This wearable auto-injector may have the potential to reduce fatalities due to opioid overdoses. We are hopeful it can have a tangible impact on a big source of suffering in this country.” Shyam Gollakota

No matter how effective the device proves to be — and it will need further training and testing — it won’t save lives if it can’t get to the people who need it. And that means receiving approval from the FDA which has released special guidance for injection devices as it looks to combat America’s spiraling overdose crisis.

“Further work is needed but this closed-loop system could potentially be transformative if it allowed an unwitnessed overdose to be detected and immediately treated while help was on the way” Jacob Sunshine a physician scientist at UW Medicine said.

Cyber Monday helps with some notable discounts but even the best NAS hard drive deal cannot beat this Western Digital 18TB Elements external storage offer. It's currently on sale with $90 discounted from the MSRP.

Instead of buying a NAS HDD you can simply extract a drive from these devices. It voids the warranty but if you already own a NAS you can sell the empty shell to someone else or recycle it. If you want to use four drives you could save upwards of $400 in total.

Western Digital 18TB Elements External Storage | $90 off! $340 at Amazon Inside this enclosure you'll find a white label 18TB Western Digital HDD. These devices are designed to run for prolonged periods of time just like a NAS enclosure.

Western Digital 18TB Elements External Storage | $90 off!

This 12TB enclosure comes with a NAS drive inside that costs less than an equivalent 12TB NAS drive if you buy them outright.

So just how good are these deals? If we look at the price of a new Western Digital Red series HDD especially the 18TB model the price difference is huge. There's an 18TB drive inside the Elements enclosure which costs $340 ($0.02 per GB $19 per TB) with Cyber Monday. Since it's an 18TB drive we need to move up to the more expensive Western Digital Red Pro series for a comparable 18TB drive and that retails for $430 ($0.02 /GB $17 /TB). Buying the enclosure would save you $90 per drive.

For the 12TB enclosure you're looking at a price of $200 ($0.02 /GB $ /TB) which is considerably more affordable than the $260 or so you can pay for a 12TB NAS drive.

Of course we don't recommend you actually carry out the process of voiding your warranty with Western Digital by taking apart the enclosures and extracting the drives but the entire process doesn't require anything other than a screwdriver. These drives are just as good as the NAS drives you can buy from WD or Seagate so this is a great offer.

If you're looking for an enclosure to use these larger drives with we're constantly adding more best Cyber Monday NAS deals so be on the lookout.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9kbmEtc3RvcmFnZS1jb3VsZC1iZS10aGUtc2F2aW9yLXdldmUtYmVlbi13YWl0aW5nLWZvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DNA data storage might sound futuristic but it's on the immediate horizon,"As the quantity of data generated worldwide continues to expand at an aggressive rate researchers are looking for ultra-dense and ultra-durable storage technologies capable of housing it all.

For example Microsoft is examining the possibility of using lasers to etch data into quartz glass or storing information in hologram form inside crystals. New developments in the field of tape storage the current leading choice for archival use cases are also promising.

However one new storage medium in particular appears to have all the necessary attributes: deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. Researchers have found a single gram of DNA is capable of storing 215 PB (220000 TB) of data.

To find out more about the work going into making DNA storage a commercial reality TechRadar Pro spoke with the DNA Data Storage Alliance founded last year by Microsoft Western Digital Twist Bioscience and Ilumina.

The Alliance was launched with the goal of raising awareness about the emerging storage technology and establishing a set of standards and specifications on which the industry can build.

What is DNA storage and what challenges is it expected to address? DNA data storage is the process of encoding and decoding binary data onto and from synthesized strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA has several unique properties including density it’s essentially free to copy the code will always be readable and the cost of ownership over time will be less due to the longevity. In addition it saves significantly on energy costs when compared to digital storage today. Legacy storage solutions have scaled extensively over the years but the areal density of magnetic media (HDD and tape) which enables today’s mainstream archival storage solutions is slowing and the size of libraries is becoming unwieldy. In short data growth is outpacing the scalability of today’s storage solutions. The industry needs a new storage medium that is more dense durable sustainable and cost effective in order to cope with the expected future growth of archival data.

How is it possible for digital information to be translated into a biological format (and back again)? What kinds of complications can arise here? To store data in DNA the original (binary) digital data is encoded (mapped from 1’s and 0’s to sequences of DNA bases ACGTs) then written (synthesized using chemical/biological processes) and stored. When the stored data is needed again the DNA molecules are read (sequenced to reveal each individual ACG or T in order) and decoded (re-mapped from DNA bases back to 1’s and 0’s). There are some concerns about data accuracy potentially introduced by oligonucleotide (short pieces of DNA) synthesis and sequencing errors. However unlike oligo synthesis for healthcare which must be perfect DNA storage can tolerate errors due to the error correction algorithms typically used in storage today. DNA data storage pioneers are already working on encoding/error correction algorithm improvement which will mitigate this risk and recover the data accurately. In addition cost speed logistics and other challenges remain as barriers for data centers to adopt this technology. The DNA Data Storage Alliance was formed by Illumina Microsoft Research Twist Bioscience and Western Digital. Our mission is to create and promote an interoperable storage ecosystem based on manufactured DNA as a data storage medium. Our initial aim is to educate the public and raise awareness about this emerging technology. In addition as the methods and tools for commercially viable DNA data storage become better understood and more widely available the Alliance will consider the creation of specifications and standards (e.g. encoding physical interfaces retention file systems) to promote the emergence of interoperable DNA data storage-based solutions that complement existing storage hierarchies.

What might the impact of DNA storage be on the data center industry? DNA is an inherently environmentally friendly medium in terms of power space and sustainability in addition to significantly reducing the need to migrate data every few years. When it is used as the main archival storage medium at a data center it has the potential to change data center’s size as well as total cost of ownership and alternatively place significantly lower burdens than legacy archival storage technologies on the earth’s resources.

What are the main barriers that DNA storage will need to overcome? DNA synthesis and sequencing cost are still relatively high when comparing with currently used archival storage media such as HDD or tape and significant cost reduction is required in order for DNA data storage to be adopted at scale. In addition education and trust building to prepare the market for this new storage media will also be critical which is why the DNA Data Storage Alliance was formed.

What are the latest R&D innovations bringing DNA storage closer to reality? Costs continue to come down due to miniaturization of the DNA synthesis process by Twist Bioscience. Other companies are pursuing alternative DNA synthesis methods with both approaches enabling massively parallelized synthesis and cost reductions. NGS cost and throughput are also continuously improving which makes DNA data retrieval more promising. In addition coding and decoding algorithm development has demonstrated successes.

What kind of timeline are we dealing with? DNA data storage will be available in the medium-term. There is more work to do and much momentum moving forward to make it a reality. Early adopters of DNA data storage are likely to be applications where they have Write Once Read Never (WORN) or Write Once Read Seldom if Ever (WORSE) data. As the technology evolves and gains acceptance within the community the market will expand and evolve.

Which incumbent storage technologies is DNA mostly likely to rival? The demand for long-term data storage in the cloud is reaching unprecedented levels. Existing storage technologies do not provide a cost-effective solution for storing long-lived data. Operating at such scales in the cloud requires a fundamental re-thinking of how we build large-scale storage systems as well as the underlying storage technologies that underpin them.

Are there any other emerging storage technologies under development that could be equally promising? Researchers are exploring a variety of technologies to support this evolution including storing data in synthetic DNA quartz glass and other scalable optical systems. DNA data storage is unique in its characteristics and properties – one can argue it will enable a new tier in storage.

Fortunately thanks to some nifty Black Friday deals out there just one day before the main event it is easier than ever to upgrade your storage without breaking the bank.

For Switch users a good place to start is the SanDisk Ultra 400GB. This Class 10 Micro SD features up to 120MB/s read speeds and is perfect for the Switch offering noticeably more space than a 256GB card while costing less per gigabyte than a 512GB card. You can now grab this for just £32.99 from Amazon or from the Western Digital website. That's a stiff reduction from the usual price of £49.99 and works out to just 8p per gigabyte. It's even cheaper than some similarly-specced 256GB Micro SD cards!

If you want more storage you may want to consider the SanDisk Ultra 512GB which has similar specifications but obviously is a bit bigger. This model is currently priced at £48.99 which works out as being 10p per gigabyte. This card has sold for £74.99 for ages and ages so this is still a considerable discount.

You can even get 1TB cards now which are also on sale for Black Friday - a SanDisk Ultra 1TB is now £129.99 down from an RRP of £217.99. That works out as 13p per gigabyte so you're paying a fair bit extra for the biggest possible capacity drive on the market. 400GB or 512GB are therefore our main recommendations but if you want to truly maximise your game storage this might be the best choice!

Micro SD cards aren't just for Nintendo Switch users either. Those who have cameras may also want to invest in a high capacity micro SD so you never run out of storage while you're out on a shoot. If your camera needs a more high performance storage solution you should consider the faster SanDisk Extreme 400GB priced at £59.99. This model boasts read speeds of up to 150MB/s and write speeds of 90MB/s making it ideal for high speed or high resolution action cameras and drones. This drive is also built and tested for harsh conditions which is especially useful for action cameras.

And finally for those on a tighter budget or less data needs the 256GB SanDisk Ultra is also a great option. It has similar transfer speeds as the large capacity model mentioned before but costs just £20.89.

Officers say they responded to the Walmart Supercenter in the 2300 block of Ferguson Road around 3:30 p.m. and found Jamontea Brown 24 suffering from a gunshot wound.

Brown died at the scene officers said.

Witnesses say that two men were in an argument in front of the Home and Living entrance which led to the fatal shooting.

“Well I was inside shopping. I was actually near the gift wrap when I heard a bang” shopper Colin Black said. “Then I heard a blood-curdling scream by a woman she was crying very loudly. I haven’t heard anything like that ever.”

Police have identified the victim that was killed Saturday afternoon at Walmart Supercenter as 24-year-old Jamontea Brown. (CPD)

Walmart was open for about nine hours prior to the incident.

Westwood Community Action President Rodney Christian says that these senseless murders have to stop.

“When is enough enough? When is everybody going to get inboard and start making changes for this senseless stuff like this” Christian said. “These shooters these fools have no conscience right now; they’re feeling really confident. People coming in and out this Walmart and they had no conscious at all to hold up.”

The Cincinnati Homicide Unit is investigating the shooting.

Police do not have a suspect at this time.

Anyone with information is asked to call the homicide unit at 513-352-3542.

We asked the director Kip Williams and his cast to let us in on some of the thinking behind this unique staging and reveal some of the backstage secrets of a show that mixes old-school “theatre magic” with cutting-edge technology.

Three is the magic number

Julius Caesar has around 40 speaking roles though not even Shakespeare himself would have considered a cast anywhere near that size. The Bard was a flinty producer as well as a genius playwright. He made a play that can be realised with a dozen or so actors doubling roles as required.

But this STC production has a cast of only three – Ewen Leslie Geraldine Hakewill and Zahra Newman.

So how does that work? And why three?

“My instinct and intuition” Williams says. “This is a piece that looks at the division between the public and private lives of people with power. It’s a play about masking and unmasking and with three performers doing the whole thing you are constantly seeing them mask and unmask themselves.”

The unkindest cuts of all

No matter how versatile the cast with only three actors to play with some notable characters had to go. Deciding who got the chop was one of the hardest problems to solve says Williams. Final cuts weren’t made until the third public preview of the production.

“Cutting Calpurnia and Portia [wives of Caesar and Brutus respectively] was a big one” says Williams. “We tried lots of ways of doing those scenes but in the end we asked ourselves why were we showing women begging on their knees but having no impact on the course of the action? We thought it would be better to have incredible women performing the great speeches of the play as part of our commentary on gender and power.”

The murder of Caesar is usually an all-hands-on-deck affair as the conspirators line up to stab the tyrant. This production uses prerecorded green screen trickery (designed by David Bergman) to get around the problem.

“We recorded the murder in week two of rehearsal with [fight director] Tim Dashwood choreographing the action to a click track” says Williams. “We started with a hero take with Ewen as Caesar Geri as Casca and Zahra as Brutus. Most of it was Ewen pretending to be stabbed by 20 or so other conspirators who would be composited on later. It was like learning a dance – very weird but amazing to watch.”

Pretty weird to actually do says Leslie. “It was click click stab click stab click click stab … You know how actors say ‘no one has ever done this before’? Well I’m pretty sure maybe I’m the only Caesar that has had to do this.”

With three actors playing various senators jabbing and poking away at a bewildered Caesar (some more enthusiastically than others) this intricate assassination dance is both gruesome and funny. It’s meant to be that way Williams says. “Right from the start thinking about the work we wanted to find a tone that oscillated between horrific and absurd.”

Other prerecorded sequences include spectacular rants from modern-day conspiracy theorists. “They are real taken verbatim from TikTok and from people like [US rightwing commentator] Alex Jones” Williams says. “All we’ve done is change the names.”

‘Heavy lies the phone’

The actors use smartphones throughout the production filming themselves in a tight selfie or turning the camera on each other. The images are then transmitted to the show’s most eye-catching design feature a huge cube of LED screens dominating the stage.

In short they are shooting a live movie at the same time as acting in it.

The smartphones allow for lightning-fast oscillations between public persona and private thought. “It’s also an amazing confessional space for a soliloquy” says Williams.

The power of the phone is one of the themes interrogated in the production he adds. “A lot of what interests me about the state of democracy today is the impact that technology is having on it. The mobile – and by extension social media – is central to the way we construct and disseminate political rhetoric today.”

Newman confesses to being “the Luddite” of the group. “I don’t love technology and I only ever use a phone to text people” she says.

“Heavy lies the phone!” chortles Leslie.

“I really struggle with it” Newman continues. “And I have the worst phone in the show. Everything goes wrong with it. It turns itself off and the pictures are weird. But I can’t ask for another. I’m scared of change. My phone is a Gremlin.”

Julius Caesar is a bloody play and phones are slippery things. Do the actors have nightmares about dropping them?

“I had to tone down the blood bag – much to my dismay – because one time I nearly flooded the phone with fake blood” Leslie says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHJ1Y2tlci1zaG9ydGFnZS1kcml2ZXJzLXBheS13b3JraW5nLWNvbmRpdGlvbnMtc2tpbGxzLXRyYS13aWxsaWFtcy1leHBlcnQtMjAyMS0xMdIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHJ1Y2tlci1zaG9ydGFnZS1kcml2ZXJzLXBheS13b3JraW5nLWNvbmRpdGlvbnMtc2tpbGxzLXRyYS13aWxsaWFtcy1leHBlcnQtMjAyMS0xMT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trucker shortage fueled by misconceptions over pay conditions: expert,"The US trucker shortage could last for years according to an expert. Erik Isakson/Getty Images

A trucking expert offered his perspective on the nationwide shortage of truck drivers.

FleetForce's CEO Tra Williams said it's untrue that drivers are always low paid and poorly treated.

According to Williams this is a flawed narrative and it's fueling the shortage.

A false perception of truck drivers' experiences and working conditions is fueling the ongoing truck-driver shortage according to an expert.

Tra Williams CEO of FleetForce a Florida-based truck-driving school told Insider: ""The problem is the perception that trucking is for people of low skill low education who are OK with low wages. All three are factually incorrect.""

In the US there is a shortage of around 80000 truck drivers Chris Spear president and CEO of the American Trucking Associations recently told CNN.

Insider previously reported that like other workers across the US truckers are leaving their jobs in search of better wages benefits and working conditions. The lack of drivers has worsened supply-chain woes as e-commerce sales and retail demand soar as Insider's Grace Dean reported.

Conversations have long existed around whether America has been facing a truck driver shortage for years Insider's Rachel Premack previously reported. Some truckers say it doesn't exist while executives consistently underscored the truck driver shortage as one of their biggest problems.

It's true that some truckers do experience low pay or conditions that they are unhappy with; one recently described their vehicle as a ""moving jail cell"" while a local port driver said her salary was not always enough to pay the bills.

But it's far from true that those experiences are universal. According to Williams public perceptions of the job are contributing to the nation's struggle to find drivers.

""Your average entry-level truck driver earns nearly double the starting salary for college graduates today"" Williams said.

Most of the graduates from FleetForce have two or three job offers waiting for them before they qualify with a starting salary between $50000 to $65000 a year according to Williams. And that's after only five weeks of training.

Another example involves female truckers making six-figure salaries which Insider's Hannah Towey recently reported.

It's also Williams' belief that conditions for over-the-road drivers are not poor. ""The inside of new sleepers looks like a hotel room"" he said referring to the vehicles of shipment transport companies that he works with.

Williams said: ""Bridge the gap between perception and reality and on the other side millions of young professionals will find a highly compensated career opportunity where they can literally be their own boss within a matter of months. Tell that story. Celebrate that.""







Another key factor that's exacerbating the shortage of drivers is a ""generational and cultural gap"" which exists for all skilled labor according to Williams.

Generation Z doesn't view truck driving as ""sexy"" Williams said. ""It's not insta-famous it's not [like being] a YouTube influencer"" he added.

Williams also said: ""Electricians carpenters masons plumbers etc … they are all more and more scarce because we have not properly celebrated the contributions they have made and continue to make toward building this country.""

He continued: ""YouTube and Tik Tok influencers don't expand the economy"" as opposed to truck drivers for example.

According to Williams the driver shortage is set to last years. ""It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better"" he said.

Williams added: ""We will not fill demand within the next five years. Perhaps within the next decade.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZnJhbmstd2lsbGlhbXMtZGllcy1vZi11bmRpc2Nsb3NlZC1jYXVzZXMtYWdlZC03OS0xNzUyMzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frank Williams Dies of Undisclosed Causes Aged 79,"In 1977 it was not unusual for people to form F1 teams and try to compete with the likes of Ferrari and McLaren. Frank Williams dared to do so and created one of the most victorious F1 teams in history with 114 victories nine constructors’ titles and seven World Champions. We have no idea if Frank Williams wanted to perpetuate his name long after he was gone but that’s what will happen from November 28 on: he is not among us anymore.

It is with great sadness that on behalf of the Williams family the team can confirm the death of Sir Frank Williams CBE Founder and Former Team Principal of Williams Racing at the age of 79. — Williams Racing (@WilliamsRacing) November 28 2021

The Williams F1 team released a note informing that Williams went to the hospital on November 26 and died peacefully on the morning of November 28 surrounded by his family. The death cause was not revealed but Williams was not well for quite some time already.His decaying health was possibly one of the causes for him and his family to sell the team to Dorilton Capital an American investment company that pledged to keep his name on the team at least while it owns the team. Investment companies are known for buying stuff that they can sell later for more money. Hopefully the next owner will also honor the team’s founder which would be a way to preserve its history.Williams gave world titles to Alan Jones (1980) Keke Rosberg (1982) Nelson Piquet (1987) Nigel Mansell (1992) Alain Prost (1993) Damon Hill (1996) and Jacques Villeneuve (1997). Ayrton Senna wanted to be among these guys when he joined the team in 1994 the same year in which he died driving one of Williams’ cars.The Italian Supreme Court of Cassation determined that Senna’s crash was due to “badly designed and badly executed modifications” to the steering column. The pilot wanted more room behind the steering wheel. The Williams F1 team cut the column and re-welded it to make it longer instead of replacing the entire piece. It eventually broke which would have made the car move in a straight line until Senna crashed at Tamburello.The Williams F1 was charged with manslaughter and Patrick Head was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison for omitted control. However since the judgment was only finished in 2007 Head was not arrested.Senna’s crash has deeply shaken Williams . Although his team swears the steering column was still working when the pilot crashed it pays tribute to the Brazilian pilot since the wreck by placing the stylized “S” Senna adopted as his logo in all cars. That’s a way to support the Instituto Ayrton Senna dedicated to philanthropic activities.If death is not the end Frank Williams is probably with Senna right now. We hope they have a friendly chat about racing wherever they are."

Brooks Koepka routed Bryson DeChambeau Friday afternoon in Las Vegas 5-and-3 at Wynn Golf Club in the fifth edition of the made-for-TV match.

Here's how it happened:

Brooks Koepka Defeats Bryson DeChambeau 5 and 3

A Note On A Final Score Discrepancy

Multiple outlets including the telecast reported that Brooks Koepka defeated Bryson DeChambeau by a final score of 4-and-3 in Las Vegas on Friday afternoon.

Bryson trailed 4-down with 4 holes to play entering the 9th hole at Wynn Golf Club. After missing his putt for birdie on the par-3 DeChambeau conceded Koepka a birdie putt ending the Match by an apparent final score of 5-and-3.

Both final scores have been reported by media outlets with the PGA TOUR reporting a 4-and-3 victory for Koepka while Golf Digest reported 5-and-3. Regardless it was a dominant performance on Friday by Brooks Koepka who won the Match in 9 holes.

Koepka Defeats DeChambeau 5-and-3 in The Match Romp

It's all over here in Las Vegas as Brooks Koepka defeated a notably rusty Bryson DeChambeau 5-and-3 in this 12-hole match.

Brooks hits an approach to about 10 feet or so here on the par-3 9th hole and wins $50000 for the charity of his choice.

Bryson hits a pretty pedestrian shot to about 35 or 40 feet and misses his birdie putt just to the left.

DeChambeau concedes Koepka his birdie putt and Brooks wins the match without Bryson winning a single hole.

There will be some additional bonus holes for charity purposes but Koepka has closed out DeChambeau after a hefty beating.

Charity Long Drive on Number 10:

A lot of money flying around here on the 10th tee as Bryson wins the initial Long Drive Contest to win $200000 for charity. The two players then put up $50000 each for two respective long drive contests one won by Brooks and one won by Bryson. Charles Barkley gets in on the fun and puts up some additional charity funds. A total of $350000 donated to good causes on this hole.

Closest To The Hole Contest on Number 11:

Brooks misses the green long on #11 and Bryson secures $50000 additional dollars for charity after hitting the front of the green. Neither shot flirted with a hole-in-one which would have won $2 million for charity.

A total of $3 million was for charity and over 7 million meals were donated to Feeding America in today's match.

Brooks Takes Dechambeau Dormie After Birdie on 8

Bryson has broken out the protein shake here on the Par-4 8th in hopes of channeling a comeback against Koepka.

While DeChambeau outdrives Koepka on 8 Brooks outclasses Bryson with a stellar hook wedge to about 4 feet out of the rough.

Bryson knocks it to about maybe 10 feet or so but is understandably disappointed with it considering his position in this match.

Dechambeau barely slides his birdie putt by on the low-side (and is visibly annoyed with the commentators talking in his earpiece during his putting stroke.)

Brooks easily drops his putt in for birdie and trolls Phil with a quick ""How are you feeling about your prediction?"" after Mickelson picked Bryson to win before the match began.

It's getting extremely late for DeChambeau as Brooks has him dormie. Koepka leads 4-up with 4 holes to go.

DeChambeau Misses Chance to Cut Into Lead

No cart golf from these two on No. 7 as Brooks misses ""left of left"" off a tree and Bryson's drive takes a nasty hop off the cart path way to the right.

Bryson actually has a fantastic angle to the pin and pays it off with a shot to about 10 feet pin-high.

Koepka's angle is less than ideal but he also hits a shot to pin-high. However his shot is a bit further away somewhere around 25 feet.

Brooks' right-to-left slider misses low giving Bryson a birdie putt to get the putt back to 2-down.

Bryson's putt misses high and both players concede their respective par putts.

Phil has been chirping a lot to Bryson over the ear piece about putting his mind into ""theta"" or ""beta...."" Whatever that means...

As we head to the 8th Koepka has shown to be the alpha thus-far.

Brooks is 3-up with 5 to play.

(For what it's worth: ""Yoga is just stretching they just call it yoga to charge you more"" is an iconic line from Charles Barkley.)

Brooks Koepka Takes Commanding Lead Through 6 Holes

The Par-3 6th Closest to the Pin Contest provides another opportunity for our players to do some good for charity.

Koepka cashes that in by knocking it to 10 feet 7 inches and wins 500000 meals for Feeding America.

DeChambeau hits a shot that lands near the hole but spins aggressively and gives him about 15-20 feet. Bryson burns the edge here on the par 3 and Koepka has a chance to take a commanding lead at the halfway point.

Brooks pours in the birdie putt to go 3-up at the halfway point of this 12-hole match.

With the win Koepka moves to a heavy -1205 favorite in the betting markets.

As Koepka said after draining the putt ""Any questions?""

Koepka Cashes In Lucky Break Goes 2-Up Through 5 Holes

For the second hole in a row Koepka again hits a wayward drive but again is quite fortunate this time barely avoiding the water on the left of this long Par 5th.

Meanwhile DeChambeau hits a booming drive that just finds the first cut.

Koepka hits an incredible recovery shot that bounds onto the front of the green and gives him a chance for eagle.

DeChambeau attempts a high slinging hook into the green but his ball clips a tree and gets a fortunate kick into the fairway just in front of the green.

Bryson hits a pretty routine chip shot to give himself about 5 feet up the hill. Koepka's eagle putt misses by a few inches to the left and has his birdie putt conceded.

DeChambeau finds himself needing to make another putt to stay just 1-down but after a misread he misses his putt to the left and falls to 2-down through 5 holes.

Players Share a Wild 4th Hole But Score Remains the Same

Koepka blows one way right off the Par-4 4th tee which initially looks like it's dead but he luckily finds a parallel fairway.

Brooks recovers beautifully with a fantastic high-cut approach that finds the center of the green.

After a bomb of a drive to the middle of the (correct) fairway DeChambeau juices one over the green flipping the outlook of the hole.

DeChambeau has a cheeky putt from off the green to about 4 feet while Koepka again leaves his birdie putt short and is given his par.

Bryson saves his par and Koepka remains 1-up after 4 holes.

DeChambeau Misses Golden Opportunity To Square Match

Koepka misses his tee shot to the right on the par-3 3rd hole while DeChambeau hits a beauty to 11 feet and wins $50000 to the charity of his choice in the Closest to the Pin competition.

Brooks hits a nice pitch to about 4 feet to set up an opportunity to save par.

DeChambeau has a birdie putt to win the hole and it just misses on the low side.

Koepka saves his putt for par and remains 1-up through three holes.

Brooks Koepka Takes 1-Up Lead Through 2

Approach shots on the 2nd are almost identical to the 1st with DeChambeau finding the bunker and Koepka finding the green in regulation. This time though Brooks takes advantage of his close approach and drains his putt for birdie.

Koepka ever so kindly gives his DeChambeau his putt for par.....

First blood is taken here in Vegas.

Bryson and Brooks Make Two Pars After Nervy Starts

After both players miss right off the 1st tee Bryson flares his approach shot into the right bunker while Brooks finds the center of the green.

After DeChambeau left his bunker shot about six feet past the hole Koepka had a 20-foot putt to win the match but left it about three feet short.

Facing the potential of a 1-down deficit DeChambeau ran in his par putt to keep the match square. To the second we go.

DeChambeau Rocking Two Drivers 👀

Bryson is channeling his inner Phil Mickelson and bringing out TWO drivers for the match. One can only assume the longer shafted driver goes 600 yards opposed to Bryson's typical 550 yards.

In This Corner....

We are almost ready to go from The Wynn Las Vegas. What would a heavyweight Las Vegas title fight be without an iconic pre-match stare-down photo?

Phil Drops The Hammer

Six-time major winner Phil Mickelson isn't playing in this edition of The Match but you really think that would stop him from taking an opportunity to gloat about his PGA Championship win?

Mickelson is serving as an Executive Producer for this Bryson vs. Brooks brawl but it doesn't appear that his move to the booth is going to dethrone him at the PGA TOUR's smack-talk king.

Disrespect Spans All the Way To Custom Carts

As in previous iterations of The Match players are rocking custom golf carts.

Look past the advertisements to the details as both players are featuring a bit of trolling on their rides.

The origin of the Brooks vs. Bryson feud

AP golf writer Doug Ferguson doesn't buy this feud as totally real but he does have some good background here on why Brooks and Bryson don't like each other:

Koepka and DeChambeau’s dislike for each apparently goes back to the first time they played together in the final round of the 2016 Masters.

“I never really liked him” Koepka said.

It became public at Liberty National in 2019 at the start of the PGA Tour postseason.

Koepka had been vocal about slow play and it was clear DeChambeau — who was glacial — was the target. So when DeChambeau saw Koepka’s caddie talking to two reporters on the practice green he walked over and told Ricky Elliott to tell his boss that if Koepka had any problems he could always go straight to him.

“You can tell him that” Elliott replied and sure enough that’s how it unfolded a short time later. And that supposedly was the end of it.

But then DeChambeau was doing a live streaming video game on Twitch when he was overheard making fun of Koepka by saying “he didn’t have any abs” in ESPN’s “Body Issue” magazine.

In Koepka’s mind it was game on. And on it went.

There was the leaked video of Koepka rolling his eyes as DeChambeau walked behind him at the PGA Championship. Fans began shouting “Brooksie” at DeChambeau.

Both stand to make money off this silly social media dispute and there remains no small measure of skepticism that it’s all staged as part of the hype Las Vegas loves.

The PGA Tour is offering a $40 million bonus pool for a “Player Impact Program” that is measured by various metrics and DeChambeau suspects that’s what has been driving Koepka.

“It’s disgusting the way the guy has tried to knock me down” DeChambeau said. “There’s no need for it in the game of golf. For what reason? I don’t know. Maybe he’s jealous and wants to get part of that PIP money from the tour.”

Koepka figures he’s already 1 up in talking smack. DeChambeau looks forward to a chance at “kicking his butt.”

One can only hope that what happens in Las Vegas really does stay there.

Bryson DeChambeau celebrated Thanksgiving at the Wynn

Very on-brand for all the sponsor's water to be properly arranged:

Bryson DeChambeau at 14 was already Bryson

Bryson DeChambeau says this feud is 'all real'

Las Vegas based journalist Brian Hurlburt was at the Koepka and DeChambeau media sessions in the desert this week which you can read about here. These are some of the best quotes from his piece:

Brooks Koepka: “I think I've said it like 10 different times I mean I've never really liked him ... I think I've already won the trash talking and I think that's a given.""

“I think I've said it like 10 different times I mean I've never really liked him ... I think I've already won the trash talking and I think that's a given."" Bryson DeChambeau: ""This is all real from my end at least. It's disgusting the way the guy has tried to knock me down. There's no need for it in the game of golf.""

John Hawkins makes his prediction for the Match

Longtime golf journalist John Hawkins breaks down Brooks and Bryson right here and predicts the winner. The entire piece is worthing reading of course but we'll spoil it a little bit here. Hawkins likes DeChambeau to prevail. His reasoning: Brooks Koepka saves his best play for the majors — and this isn't that — and comes to Las Vegas after two missed cuts.

Daniel Wooters likes Bryson at -120

Daniel Wooters makes weekly PGA Tour picks for us at si.com/golf. You can read his entire take on this match here. He leans more toward Bryson DeChambeau because he has more to prove than the too-cool-for-school Brooks Koepka.

The hype has begun for The Match

The last time we can remember seeing the the roof at Wynn Las Vegas was when Steve Wynn shot a commercial there for the resort's 2005 opening:

Wynn no longer owns the resort but there's still some happenings up on the roof:

A brief history of who's been in The Match

This is the fifth version of The Match. The first was also in Las Vegas and played at Shadow Creek north of downtown in 2018. Phil Mickelson defeated Tiger Woods to win $9 million.

The next was in May 2020 when Peyton Manning and Tiger Woods teamed up to beat Mickelson and Tom Brady by a shot at Medalist in Hobe Sound Fla.

Charles Barkley and Mickelson defeated Peyton Manning and Stephen Curry in the fourth Match at Stone Canyon Golf Club in Oro Valley Ariz. in November 2020.

The most recent was in July when Aaron Rodgers and DeChambeau defeated Brady and Mickelson at The Reserve Golf Course at Moonlight Basin in Big Sky Mont.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBva2VybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzExLzIwMjEtd3lubi1mYWxsLWNsYXNzaWMtcmVzdWx0cy00MDMzMi5odG3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Wynn Fall Classic Awards $24 Million; Rice & Brookshire Among Big Winners,"2021 Wynn Fall Classic Awards $24 Million; Rice & Brookshire Among Big Winners

How many casinos exactly does Las Vegas have?

Las Vegas’ casinos are designed to give players every possible kind of way to test their luck. While there’s a typical array of games found in every casino each has its own distinctive style and selection of games. And every gambler will find they develop some preferences whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned poker tournament player.

For the largest most posh casinos and newest games the Strip is the place to play. The Venetian offers one of the world’s largest casinos featuring a race and sports book a popular poker room and plenty of slots and video machines.

Las Vegas flourished as a global gambling center in the mid-70s. In 1977 the Clark County gambling industry reached over $ 1 billion in revenues for the first time. In 2018 this figure was already $ 10.25 billion. Interestingly the Strip casinos account for over 55% of all gambling money in Nevada. Since 2012 income from establishments on the Las Vegas Strip has fluctuated between $ 6.2-6.5 billion. Statistics from the Center For Gaming Research show that revenue for all Nevada casinos in the first 8 months of 2021 was $ 8589951000.

How many casinos are on the Las Vegas Strip?

Photo CNN

It sort of depends on your definition of the “Strip” but basically thirty-one casinos call the Strip home up from 29 just a few years ago.

These 31 Strip casinos range from dinky little dives like the cheesy but classic Slots A Fun to the glamorous (and expensive) Wynn and Encore resorts. All are located right on Las Vegas Boulevard.

The 31 casinos stretch from Mandalay Bay on the South up to the Stratosphere to the North.

Many others casino/hotels like the Rio Palms and new Virgin Hotel Las Vegas (formerly the Hard Rock) aren’t included in the thirty as they are not located right on Las Vegas Boulevard. However these near-strip casinos are within walking distance – albeit a long walk in the heat.

Vegas is a ghost town The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority released January data showing visitor volume to the city plunged 64% from a year ago though it is up slightly from December. Convention attendance also remains virtually nil which sent hotel occupancy plummeting 54% year over year though again it's up incrementally from the end of the year. With hotels running on shortened workweeks and casinos at reduced capacity operators are looking to the back half of the year for business to pick back up or maybe even later into 2022. A concrete industry convention this summer is seen as the first real test of whether Las Vegas can come back soon. It's the first big event since the numerous convention centers were closed a year ago and though there have been a number of small-scale meetings (MGM has reportedly hosted hundreds since it was allowed to reopen last June) it remains to be seen whether people are ready to meet again in large crowds. The problem for many casino operators is that they no longer own their casinos; they just rent them and the leases tend to be long term and not cancelable.

Strip-Area Casinos

Photo Daily Hive

According to the Nevada Gaming Commission there are actually 61 casinos in the Las Vegas strip area. Again however their definition of “strip” is not as strict nor literal as ours is here and therefore their list includes casinos off of Las Vegas Boulevard.

Excalibur

Tropicana

Besides the Virgin Hotel & Casino Las Vegas Rio Gold Coast and Palms some of the other casinos just off the strip which I did not include here include OYO and the Westgate. The list above is strictly for casinos with frontage on the Strip. Yes the Aria is a decent walk to the Strip but it still fronts it sort of.

PAUL -- When the Minnesota Wild signed budding superstar Kirill Kaprizov to a five-year $45 million contract this offseason make no mistake they were paying him to be an elite goal scorer.

He flashed his potential as a rookie last season with 27 goals in a condensed 56-game schedule. Just imagine the type of damage the 24-year-old winger could do across a full 82-game schedule.

A month and a half into this season however Kaprizov hasn’t been scoring goals at the same rapid rate. He’s getting increased attention from opposing teams on a nightly basis and thus has been bottled up for prolonged stretches.

A cause for concern? Not at all. In fact the way Kaprizov has handled the increased attention proves he has what it takes to be a superstar. Take away his time and space? It doesn’t faze him. He’s found ways to dominate as a distributor this season on the way to a team-high 16 assists.

“He understands and recognizes the opening might not be there for him” coach Dean Evason said. “That’s why he’s getting other people those opportunities. Because they’re all concentrated on him.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Asked about his ability as a playmaker Kaprizov replied through a translator “That’s the way the game’s going right now.”

Kaprizov isn’t focused on how many goals or assists he has to his name just how many wins his team has.

“The opportunities have been there to make assists” he said. “The same thing could happen with goals. They will start coming in (bunches). I’m not worried about it.”

Why should he be? He has proven to be a goal-scorer at every level. Plus after a relatively slow start to this season at least by his standards he’s starting to heat up.

In Friday afternoon’s 7-1 win over the rival Winnipeg Jets at Xcel Energy Center Kaprizov finished with a goal and three assists. He had the same stat line last week against the Dallas Stars and proved highly effective on the recent East Coast road trip.

That success has come thanks in large part to best bud Mats Zuccarello. To say Kaprizov and Zuccarello work well together would be putting it lightly. They developed instant chemistry last season and now with Ryan Hartman centering them the Wild have a top line that can put up goals in bunches.

“They just find each other” Hartman said. “I try to get to the front of the net when they have the puck in the zone which brings one or two defenders to the front of the net and that kind of opens up the zone for them. I’ve played with some skill guys in the past and they’ve told me just get to the net and they’ll do the rest. It’s very similar to that just trying to create space for them and at the same time make plays when given.”

As for Kaprizov he’s clearly enjoying himself at that moment. He looked right at home on Friday afternoon at the X. Never mind the stellar performance. After being named the No. 1 star for his efforts — for good reason — he flashed a big smile to the announced crowd of 19133.

He’s right where he belongs.

“It’s awesome playing in front of fans. Especially at home games” Kaprizov said. “In warmups we come out and see everybody. We can give someone a stick or a puck and interact with the fans. It’s an amazing experience.”

Whether he’s scoring goals or dishing out assists the same thing can be said about watching Kaprizov on a nightly basis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS93aWxkLXBsYXllcnMtcHJhY3RpY2Utc2F0dXJkYXktYXQtcmVjcmVhdGlvbi1vdXRkb29yLWNlbnRlci1pbi1zdC1sb3Vpcy1wYXJrLzYwMDEyMTQyMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild players practice Saturday at Recreation Outdoor Center in St. Louis Park,"They skated in the morning instead of at night and there wasn't an outfield just beyond the boards.

But Wild players had the upcoming Winter Classic on Jan. 1 at Target Field against the Blues on their minds while practicing outside on Saturday at the Recreation Outdoor Center in St. Louis Park.

""We're excited to play that Winter Classic game"" alternate captain Marcus Foligno said. ""Getting a feel out here outside it was kind of like the pregame before that game. It was a lot of fun.""

Fresh off a 7-1 dusting of the Jets on Friday afternoon at the beginning of a five-game homestand the Wild prepared for another matinee Sunday at Xcel Energy Center against the Lightning in front of a boisterous crowd that roared as players tossed pucks into the stands at the end of the session.

The cheers for Kirill Kaprizov who helped spearhead that lopsided win over Winnipeg with a four-point effort were particularly loud.

""Our fans have been absolutely incredible all year"" coach Dean Evason said. ""For them to have the ability to get close to us like they did today was exciting for us as well.""

Not only was the sun out during practice but the temperature was in the 30s. That might not be the case on New Year's Day; last Jan. 1 when the Wild was originally scheduled to host the Winter Classic before it was postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic the temperature in Minneapolis maxed out in the 20s.

""This was perfect today"" Blaine native Nick Bjugstad said. ""If we get mid-30s that would work. It'd be ideal. But January I don't know if it's going to be so forgiving then. You feel it out. We've all had the cold feet cold fingers. I'm sure the adrenaline will just kick in. It'll be a game to remember.""

What might be the same are the ice conditions.

""Late in periods or late in games I think you're going to have to play smart and move your feet more than moving your hands"" Foligno explained. ""I think the puck will start bouncing a little bit. Out here I think you saw guys taking one-timers and they were going sky high. So just to be smart with where we shoot and how much we shoot come towards the end of periods. I expect the puck to be a little bouncy then.""

A limited number of tickets are still available for the Winter Classic through Ticketmaster the Wild said and tickets are also on sale for the Winter Classic New Year's Eve Bash at Xcel Energy Center featuring country music singer Thomas Rhett.

More details on the Winter Classic are expected to be announced in the coming days and behind-the-scenes action of the lead-up to the game will air weekly starting Wednesday during TNT's NHL coverage.

""They'll see how light this team is and joking"" Foligno said. ""We're all really close this year. They're going to see a tight-knit group and guys like to have fun. It's been a good season so far a lot of positives.""

There's plenty more hockey to be played with 14 more games scheduled until the Winter Classic. But the Wild is looking forward to the unique opportunity.

""You're in the moment now and when it comes that's when the excitement will kind of hit"" Bjugstad said. ""It's kind of crazy that I'm playing an outdoor game in Minnesota with my hometown team. I'm sure that'll sink in probably a few days before. Yeah the excitement's there but there's not too much talk about it yet. I'm sure once Christmas comes around it'll be a big topic.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tbXVuaXR5LXN5c3RlbXMtb2ZmZXItYWx0ZXJuYXRpdmUtcGF0aHMtZm9yLXNvbGFyLWdyb3d0aC0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Community systems offer alternative paths for solar growth,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Varsity veterans Jared Turrubiartes Spencer VanBeek and Beau Schreiber also return up front. Josh Behrends and Mason Studier return to anchor the back end and veteran goalies Braden Fjelsta and Dakota Jahnke are both back after splitting time a year ago.

Erickson is in his first season as head coach. He’s an Albert Lea alum who played under legendary long-time Tigers head man Roy Nystrom.

Coach Erickson says: “It is an unbelievable opportunity for me as an alumnus. Coach Nystrom coached and had an influence on a lot of players over his coaching career of 43 years. Roy Nystrom’s coaching attributes and love of community are the most influential to me and our staff. We are fortunate to have a staff of all Albert Lea alumni – four of whom played for Coach Nystrom. … Our players are most excited for fans to be back in the rinks an improved game atmosphere versus last year.”

Austin

Head coach: Troy Schaefer

Assistant coach: Tim Schaefer

Conference: Big Nine Conference

Section: Section 1A

Last season: 0-16-0 lost to Rochester Lourdes in Section 1A first round

Top returners: F Cooper Guttormson F Aidan Pepper F Isaac Stromlund D Toby Holtz D Dylan Regenscheid G Ethan Knox.

Outlook: The Packers will rely on those returning players at each position to set the tone for this season. It’s a fresh start for a Packers team that struggled offensively a year ago and first-year coach Schaefer said he expects newcomers Gahvin Schaefer Grady Carney Wyatt Hamlin and Darren Plunkett to step into key roles immediately.

Coach Schaefer says: “The kids are a tight group and have positive attitudes.”

Dodge County

Co-head coaches: Nick Worden John Morales

Last season: 19-4-1 Section 1A champion Class A state runner-up.

Key returners: Sr. G Isaac Dale (16-4-1 3.00 GAA .882 save pct.); Sr. F Matt Donovan (25-32—57); Sr. D Easton Hammill (7-20—27); Sr. F Gavin Giesler (7-16—23); Sr. F Brendon Wolesky (7-8—15).

Outlook: It’s a season of change for the Wildcats who lost a superb senior class as well as last year’s Minnesota Associated Press Player of the Year Brody Lamb. The New York Rangers draft pick and University of Minnesota commit is playing with Green Bay in the USHL this season. Dodge County will also move up to Class AA this season after advancing to the Class A state championship game a year ago. The Wildcats have some talented players back with senior goalie Isaac Dale and senior forwards Matt Donovan and Gavin Giesler serving as captains. Veterans Brendon Wolesky Jake Isaak and Miles Smith are also key returning veterans up front along with talented young players such as Gryffon Funke and Cooper Jacobson a pair of sophomores who improved dramatically as last season went along. On defense Easton Hammill James McPeak Carl Schutz and Caeden Smith give the Wildcats a good nucleus of experienced players. Dale will anchor the team in goal with backup Ben Nelson returning as well. They’ll be pushed by a pair of sophomores Corbin Krueger and Jackson Roethler.

Coach Worden says: “Practices have been awesome so far. The guys are super excited. They realize they have a new challenge in front of them and they’re ready to get going.”

Faribault

Head coach: Dan Pumper

Conference: Big Nine Conference

ADVERTISEMENT

Section: Section 1A

Last season:

Top returners: So. F Oliver Linneman (3-13—16); Jr. D Owen Nesburg (7-8—15); Sr. F Keaton Ginter (7-2—9).

Outlook: Faribault has a good mix of young experienced players and older veterans this season. That group is led by Linneman just a sophomore who is the team’s top returning scorer. The Falcons will take a look at two or three goalies early in the season as they determine which one or two of them will serve as the starter(s). Senior Seamus O’Connor may have the edge in that competition.

Coach Pumper says: “Our strengths are the boys’ work ethic and coachability. We have decent team speed. They always come ready to learn. … The most normal thing about this season is starting when we normally do and being able to see the guys’ faces!”

Farmington

Head coach: Scott Macho

Assistant coach: Nathan Dapper

Conference: South Suburban Conference

ADVERTISEMENT

Section: Section 1AA

Last season: 3-14-1 lost to Owatonna in Section 1AA quarterfinal

Top returners: Sr. F Ryan Holmstrom (4-11—15) Sr. F Dylan Dodson (6-8—14) Sr. F Hayden Sanborn (8-5—13).

Outlook: The Tigers have their top three scorers back in Holmstrom Dodson and Sanborn. They’ll look to that trio to lead the way offensively and improve upon its combined 42 points from a year ago. Farmington will be inexperienced in goal to start the season as junior Mitch Getting has the only varsity experience and that is only two periods of playing time.

Hastings

Head coach: Matt Klein

Assistant coaches: Tom Kuhn Ryan Stoffel Blake Johnson Ben Tharp

Conference: Metro East Conference

Section: Section 1AA

ADVERTISEMENT

Last season: 13-7-0 lost at Lakeville South in Section 1AA semifinals

Top returners: Sr. F Jake Harris (13-9—22); Sr. F Connor Stoffel (10-11—21); Sr. F Luke Savage (6-12—18); Sr. D Collin Stewart (2-6—8).

Outlook: The Raiders finished third in the Metro East behind Hill-Murray and St. Thomas and reached the semifinals in Section 1AA before falling to Lakeville South. Hastings had five players with 20 or more points. They have 13 seniors on the roster this year and are looking to piece in a talented sophomore class with a mix of juniors to complete their squad. They’re looking for scoring depth from their top six forwards and they return three defensemen who are two-year letterwinners already. Goaltending will be solid with a pair enjoying the competition. Harris is a player to keep an eye on; the senior forward averaged more than a point per game last season.

Coach Klein says: “It’s a very selfless team looking to take the next step. Experience and team speed will be our strengths.”

La Crescent-Hokah

Head coach: Eriah Hayes

Assistant coaches: Adam Kimball Ben Tornow

Conference: Independent

Section: Section 1A

Last season: 6-14-0 lost to Mankato West in Section 1A semifinals

Top returners: So. F Wyatt Farrell (22-5—27) Jr. D Logan DeBoer (0-3—3) Jr. G Logan Yehle (5-10-0 5.31 GAA .834 save pct.).

Outlook: The Lancers return some talented and experienced players at all three spots in the lineup led by Farrell who scored 22 goals last year as a freshman. Farrell was lethal on specialty teams scoring six power-play goals (tied for 18th in the state) and four short-handed goals which tied for fourth-most in the state. Yehle’s return will help the Lancers build from the net out. The junior goalie won two of his final three starts both of those wins coming in Section 1A playoff games. Sophomore forwards Colton Holzer and Cody Hogan could become a big part of the Lancers’ offense this season too. “Both are highly skilled players who think the game the right way” coach Hayes said. “I’m excited to see what they can bring to the table for us.”

Coach Hayes says: “Last year’s postseason success was a huge step in the right direction for our program. We played a tough schedule last year and for them to get rewarded for all of the work they put in was great. They raised the bar and now they know where they need to be in order to have that same success. I can definitely feel a different sense of confidence with them. They are ready to pick things up right where we left off and they are ready to compete with those top teams in our section. … Up until this year we’ve had a very young team and not great numbers. This year we have seven seniors and some young kids that have a lot of experience at this level. They are confident and more ready than ever. I think we have a group that is going to surprise some people.”

Lakeville North

Head coach: Jake Taylor

Conference: South Suburban Conference

Section: Section 1AA

Last season: 12-7-2 Section 1AA runner-up

Top returners: Sr. F Luke Jech (13-14—27); Jr. F Kyle Doll (12-11—23); Sr. D Zach Enebak (1-16—17).

Outlook: Jech and Doll are not only players to watch in the section but they could be in the conversation among the top forwards in the state. Both averaged more than a point per game in a difficult conference. Jech had 13 goals and 27 points in 21 games a year ago while Doll finished the season with 12 goals and 23 points. Taylor a Byron native is in his third season as the Panthers’ head coach after serving as an assistant for six seasons.

Lakeville South

Head coach: Josh Storm

Conference: South Suburban Conference

Section: Section 1AA

Last season: 20-1-2 Section 1AA champion Class AA state runner-up.

Top returners: Jr. F Tanner Ludtke (16-34—50); Jr. F Ashton Dahms (14-10—24); Jr. F Aidan Willis (4-20—24); Sr. F Ben Portner (16-8—24); Sr. D Mason Johnson (4-11—15);

Outlook: Storm takes over for Jani Kivilhamme after the Cougars won the section and advanced all the way to the Class AA state championship game last season where they lost 2-1 to Eden Prairie in OT. South will be led by a strong group of returning players including junior forward Tanner Ludtke who had two goals and five points in the state tournament last season. The University of Nebraska Omaha commit had 16 goals and 50 points in just 23 games a year ago. South has good size too. In addition to the forwards listed above 6-foot-4 junior forward Zander Billins looks to step into a bigger role this season after recording four goals and eight points last year. Likewise for junior forwards Tate Pritchard (eight points) and Eli Miller. In addition to Johnson senior Wyatt Sender and 6-foot junior Tyler Lafferty will help anchor the blue line. In goal Owen Havlicek and Jack Hochsprung will battle for time while newcomers Joe Guentzel and Jack Novak will slot in on the blue line.

Coach Storm says: “The offensive talent of this group is very special. Every line has the ability to score on any shift. We have a very active defensive core who can create offense and skate extremely well. … The boys are looking forward to the normalcy! Hockey players enjoy each other; last year was rule after rule for good reason but it took away from a lot of the off-ice elements that make high school hockey so amazing. Now we can go watch other teams play in person enjoy our locker room do team building and team bonding activitites.”

Mankato East

Head coach: Adam Fries

Assistant coaches: Luke Meyer Matt Tyree Jeff Humble

Conference: Big Nine Conference

Section: Section 3A

Last season: 14-5-0 lost to La Crescent-Hokah in Section 1A quarterfinals

Top returners: Sr. F Quintin Steindl (6-13—19); Jr. F Zach Lebens (8-10—18); Sr. D Aiden Prochaska (5-8—13); Jr. D Shae Gavin (5-8—13); Sr. G Caelin Brueske (14-13-1 3.70 GAA .875 save pct. in 2019-20).

Outlook: East will move west this season sliding over to play in Section 3A come postseason time after becoming a perennial title contender in Section 1A. The COVID bug bit the Cougars late last year with all but two of their varsity players being ruled ineligible for the section playoff loss to La Crescent. The Cougars also lost one of the top forwards in the area Layten Liffrig to graduation as well as one of the top defensemen Brett Borchardt. With East’s top five scorers having graduated now-senior forward Quintin Steindl is the top returning scorer. Zach Lebens will join him among the team’s skilled forwards while Aiden Prochaska and Shae Gavin are back to anchor the defensive corps. Caelin Brueske is the lone goalie on the roster with varsity experience; he played 51 minutes last season after being the Cougars’ go-to goalie the prior season as a sophomore.

Mankato West

Head coach: Nate Olsen

Assistant coaches: Jacob Staszak Jason Anderson

Conference: Big Nine Conference

Section: Section 3A

Last season: 13-5-2 Section 1A runner-up

Top returners: Sr. F Gavin Brunmeier (17-13—30); So. F Gage Schmidt (15-8—23); Jr. F Zach Benson (2-5—7); Jr. F Sam O’Neil (2-2—4); D Toby Essay (2-2—4).

Outlook: After being a perennial contender for the Section 1A championship the Scarlets are moving west this winter just as their cross-town rival Mankato East Cougars are. Both Mankato teams will move out of Section 1A and into Section 3A. They’ll also have a new head coach on the bench for the first time in two decades as Olsen takes over for Curtis Doell who resigned after last season. The Scarlets have a handful of key players back from last season’s Section 1A runner-up team including forwards Brunmeier Schmidt Benson and O’Neil and defenseman Essay. The Scarlets will be green in goal though as none of the goalies on their roster have played in a varsity game. Coach Olsen expects a few JV players from a year ago to step in immediately and help out the varsity: junior forward Maddox Langworthy sophomore defenseman Hunter Rigdon freshman defenseman Jaeger Zimmerman and sophomore goalie Wyatt Lund.

Coach Olsen says: “Our guys are most excited about the opportunity to spend time together in the locker room and have our entire Scarlet hockey family together – last year we had to split our JV and our varsity guys for practice busses and locker rooms so having everyone together and being able to spend quality time off the ice together is a big deal to our guys. … Our biggest strength is the fact we have excellent hard-working young men in our program who are leaders at Mankato West and in our hockey community. We’re excited about the veteran depth we have up front and believe a deep group of forwards will help our young guys on the back end grow helping turn our team into a hard-nosed hard-working team who is difficult to play against for a full 51 minutes. I’m ultimately most looking forward to seeing our guys continue to improve day in and day out and to continue to improve upon the culture of the Scarlet hockey program as we look to achieve our goals.”

New Prague

Head coach: Brad Drazan

Assistant coaches: Ben Witt Grant Yackly Eric Brever Joel Barzee

Conference: Metro West

Section: Section 1A

Last season: 3-16-0 lost to Eden Prairie in Section 2AA quarterfinals

Top returners: Sr. F Will Andersen (6-5—11); Jr. F John Schmidt (3-5—8); Fr. F Luke Portner (2-4—6); Sr. G Carter Puente (3-14-0 4.11 GAA .887 save pct.)

Outlook: The Trojans are back in Class A and back in Section 1 after a handful of years in different sections and in Class AA. Will Andersen is the Trojans’ top returning scorer and their only returner who reached double figures in points. But they aren’t light on experience with forwards Schmidt Portner Will Seymour and Owen Wilkins and defensemen Ryan Brinkhaus Layton Kuehner Peyton Becker and Breck Hagen back after seeing plenty of varsity ice time. Puente gives the Trojans a veteran goalie too having played nearly 90 percent of the team’s minutes a year ago.

Coach Drazan says: “This group is a close group. They have enjoyed being together. It’s the little things for them they enjoy supporting each other and spending time together. They are also looking forward to having fans in the rink to cheer them on. ... This group has great cohesiveness and leadership. They have confidence in one another and enjoy both the game of hockey and also being with each other. They play hard and give great effort. They have great heads on their shoulders and show up ready to improve every day. We love their positivity on the ice and in the locker room. They have a wide range of acceptance of their teammates and trust in their goaltenders.”

Northfield

Head coach: Mike Luckraft

Assistant coaches: Scott Cloud Charlie Cloud

Conference: Big Nine Conference

Section: Section 1A

Last season: 12-6-1 no postseason due to COVID pandemic

Top returners: Sr. F Spencer Klotz (15-31—46); So. F Cayden Monson (20-15—35); Jr. F Cullen Merritt; Jr. F Gabe Sawyer (0-4—4); Jr. D Mike Fossum (1-8—9); Sr. D Matthew DeBuse (0-5—5); Sr. D Luke Johnson; Sr. D Alan Royle; Jr. G Keaton Walock (8-2-0 1.65 GAA .921 save pct. 4 shutouts).

Outlook: The Raiders return to Section 1A this year after two seasons at the Class AA level. They also return nine players from last season’s team though just four of them are seniors. In other words Northfield is a young but experienced team and is one of the favorites — if not the favorite — in Section 1A this season. More than all of that coach Luckraft said he and the players are looking forward to a more “normal” season with COVID restrictions greatly reduced across the state and the season starting on time. “Hopefully we are back to a normal hockey season no mask no COVID and can enjoy all that’s great about high school hockey: Teammates the locker room banter the bus rides and most of all fans in the stands!” Northfield will be led by those nine talented returners while sophomores Cam Kaiser Jake Geiger and Andrew Winter are expected to add some punch up front and sophomore Ty Frank could be an impact newcomer on defense.

Coach Luckraft says: “We bring back some skill in all three areas and great team leadership from our captains. The team should have some depth we have good team speed and goaltending.”

Owatonna

Head coach: David Fromm

Assistant coaches: Trace Strahle Justin Fletcher

Conference: Big Nine Conference

Section: Section 1AA

Last season: 13-5-1 lost 2-0 at Lakeville North in Section 1AA semifinals

Top returners: Sr. F Casey Pederson (8-6—14) Sr. D Joey Dub (3-9—12) Sr. G Preston Meier (8-3-0 2.44 goals-against average .893 save pct.)

Outlook: Fromm takes over as head coach of the Huskies after Josh Storm departed to take the head coach position at Lakeville South. Owatonna lost its top five scorers to graduation but they’ll have some talented returners including senior goalie Preston Meier to build around. Senior forward Casey Pederson is the top returning scorer after putting up 14 points last season. Among the newcomers Fromm expects to contribute right away this season are Mark Spurgeon Joesph Weber Ben Bangs and Owen Beyer.

Coach Fromm says: “Strong defense and goaltending will be our strength this season. I’m looking forward to the work ethic of this group and the compete level. … (After last season) the boys (appreaciate the) ability to be together in the locker room and have the whole team practicing together working out together.”

Red Wing

Head coach: Tony Casci.

Assistant coaches: Bill Redman Jack Strusz.

Conference: Big Nine Conference

Section: Section 1A

Last season: 4-13-1 lost to Two Rivers in Section 4A first round

Top returners:

Outlook: The Wingers are moving back south again this season as they return to Section 1A after two brief years in Section 4A. They hope to carry over the momentum built in the second half of last season. After a 1-8-1 start Red Wing went 3-5-0 in its last eight games. The good news is that if they’re building from the net out goalie Dixon Ehlers had a solid junior season last winter recording a 4.49 goals-against average and an .899 save percentage. The Wingers will need to find some scoring as last year’s top two scorers graduated and senior Casey Larson (5-7—12) is the only returning player who reached double digits in points.

Rochester Century

Head coach: Josh Klingfus.

Assistant coaches: Drew Fleming Adam Broich Tom Musta Casey Gorman Doug Zmolek.

Last season: 5-14-0 lost to Lakeville North in Section 1AA quarterfinals

Key returners: Jr. F T.J. Gibson (14-8—22); Sr. F Aidan Swee (6-10—16); Jr. F Aiden Emerich (4-10—14); Jr. F Jack Ottman (4-10—14): Sr. D Matt Haun (4-7—11); Jr. F Jonah Ottman (7-4—11); Sr. G Conor Cozik.

Outlook: The Panthers were a young team a year ago this year they have an experienced group that knows what it’s like to play at the varsity level. They return five double-digit scoring forwards (Gibson Swee Emerich Jack Ottman Jonah Ottman) and four key defensemen (Haun Grant Rosin Kroix Klingfus Ed Retzlaff). Cozik also returns in goal after playing 16 of 19 games a year ago. Century has eight of its top 10 scorers back from last season many of whom will get to play in their first “normal” varsity season this winter with the COVID pandemic having shortened and altered the 2020-21 season.

Coach Klingfus says: “Just being together is probably the biggest thing. It was hard to have that team building and comradery when we were separated so much last year. We have a great group of kids that are very coachable. They will come ready to work hard and compete as hard as they can.”

Rochester John Marshall

Coaches: Matt Erredge Pete Moehnke.

Last season: 1-13-0 lost to Lakeville South in Section 1AA quarterfinals

Key returners: Sr. F Ryan Hus; Sr. F Jake Schmidt; Jr. D Mason Decker (2-4—6); Jr. F Cody Ahlstrom; So. D Jayden Veney; Jr. G Cody Vlasaty; G Camdon Magle.

Outlook: The Rockets have a small group under first-year head coaches Matt Erredge and Pete Moehnke but it’s a group whose work ethic has impressed the coaches so far. With just 15 skaters out JM will count on every player on the roster to contribute in some way. Junior defenseman Mason Decker is the team’s top returning scorer. The Rockets will also bring back experienced defenseman Jayden Veney. Up front veterans Ryan Hus Jake Schmidt and Cody Ahlstrom will lead the way. Newcomers Aaron Terpstra Damon Miller and Adam Mullenbach will be looked to to help on both ends of the ice.

Coach Erredge says: “Our biggest strength is we are returning most of our defensive corps from last year. Most have played significant minutes at the varsity level in all situations. I am looking forward to surprising teams with our work ethic and seeing this group develop into a team. With our low numbers and transfers to local teams this team is out to prove we can and will get better as the year goes on and hopefully we can play spoiler to teams that take us lightly.”

Rochester Lourdes

Head coach: Jeff True.

Assistant coaches: Zach Bartosh Joe Knoepke Jim Renn Todd VerNess.

Last season: 11-6-1 lost to Mankato West in Section 1A quarterfinals

Key returners: Sr. F Matt Mahoney (18-11—29); Sr. F Brayden Magnuson (7-5—12); Sr. D Charlie Kielty (10-12—22); Sr. D Jackson Heim (4-12—16); Sr. D Brayden Swee; So. G Xander Carter-Kleven (4-1-0 3.00 GAA .911 save pct.).

Outlook: The Eagles lost a talented class to graduation including goalie Griffin Becher and leading scorer Jack Kleinschmidt. But they return four of their top five scorers and talented young goalie Xander Carter-Kleven who looked sharp in the five games he played last season. Mahoney plays a fast physical game; he led the team in goals last season. Kielty has a similar style on the blue line where he averaged 1.22 points per game.

Coach True says: “We have a group that is determined to work hard push themselves and their teammates and show up each day wanting to improve. We have a good mix of younger new players with veterans. The younger players bring some skill and talent and will push the returners for varsity spots and keep practices intense and competitive. As coaches we are most looking forward to a ""normal"" season being able to implement and do the things we would like as a coaching staff on the ice and away from the rink which we were restricted from doing as a first-year staff last year.”

Rochester Mayo

Head coach: Matt Notermann.

Assistant coaches: Alec Brandrup Nate Markus Ron Moffit.

Last season: 12-4-1 no postseason due to COVID-19.

Key returners: Sr. G Tate Cothern (7-1-0 1.38 GAA .949 save pct.); Jr. F Ethan Dennis (10-6—16); Sr. D Ethan Norman (3-10—13); Jr. F Mason Leimbek (4-8—12); Sr. F Javan Hodge (4-7—11).

Outlook: The Spartans look to pick up where they left off a year ago. Mayo was on a 9-1-1 streak over its final 11 games before the COVID pandemic ended its season just as the playoffs were about to begin. Mayo has high hopes this year with one of the state’s top goalies backstopping it. Cothern was 7-1-0 last season with a 1.38 goals-against average (sixth-best in the state) and .949 save percentage (second in the state). The Spartans had seven players finish with double-digits in scoring and 10 players had eight or more points. Dennis and Norman led the way atop the scoring list but the Spartans expect to receive key contributions from three if not all four forward lines. The team’s depth will make for great battles in practice and a competitive hard-nosed team on game day.

Coach Notermann says: “Like last year when our lines looked so even (statistically) our scoring was so spread out that we didn’t have one guy getting 25 goals. It was very evenly spread out. I expect that again this year. … We have eight defensemen who are good enough to play varsity hockey with a couple of young guys making it hard on us coaches to not give them a varsity job. … Our goalies as much as I feel very strongly about the rest of our roster I feel confident that we have the best goalie. Let’s not always leave it to him but I feel like in that area we should be as good as anybody.”

Waseca

Head coach: Chris Storey

Conference: Big South Conference

Section: Section 1A

Last season: 11-9-0 lost at Dodge County in Section 1A quarterfinals

Top returners: Jr. F Kyle Ahlschlager (31-26—57); Jr. F Leo Harguth (7-6—13); Sr. D Jarret Ahlschlager (3-10—13); Jr. F Griffin Krautkremer (9-4—13).

Outlook: The Bluejays welcome back one of the more dynamic scorers in Section 1A and southeastern Minnesota. Kyle Ahlschlager will again be looked to to produce at a high rate; the junior forward scored 31 goals and added 26 assists last season for 57 total points. Three other double-digit scorers return for Waseca in forwards Leo Harguth and Griffin Krautkremer and defenseman Jarret Ahlschlager. The Bluejays will need to find a goalie though as veteran Ben Diedrich graduated after playing more than 80 percent of the minutes last season going 10-8-0 with a 3.18 goals-against average and .908 save percentage. The two netminders listed on their roster — junior Eli Wetzel and freshman Derek Gustafson — have not played at the varsity level.

Winona Cotter

Head coach: Martin Raymond

Conference: Independent

Section: Section 1A

Last season: This is Cotter’s first season as a varsity program

Players to watch: Sr. D Ashur Rouleau; G Jozef Zilinec.

Outlook: The Ramblers are new to varsity hockey and are still building their program. Raymond came to Winona from California last year to run the team as a JV program. With just 13 skaters the Ramblers will look for their skaters to play short shifts and most importantly for their defensemen to break the puck out of their own end quickly. Rouleau a senior defenseman will serve as the team’s captain. Goalie Jozef Zilinec is an intriguing player to watch. The Slovakia native goes 6-feet-6 200 pounds and put up solid numbers at the U16 and U18 levels in his native country.

Coach Raymond says: “For me … our family came here because I wanted my kids to have a good place to live and experience the style of life here leaving California. The schooling here is great. … To be honest winning is (secondary) right now. It’s about improving the skills of the kids in high school and youth hockey help this area of the state develop more players. It’d be great to build more competitive teams (in southeastern Minnesota). That starts with the younger kids. That’s the future. Over the next five or six years we could see a big difference in that area.”

Winona High

Head coach: Fran McDevitt.

Assistant coach: Thomas Lueck.

Conference: Big Nine Conference

Section: Section 1A

Last season: 6-12-1 lost at Waseca in first round of Section 1A playoffs

Top returners: So. F Teis Larsen (9-13—22); Fr. F Aven Prodzinski (7-3—10); Sr. F Ayden Ruesgen (4-6—10).

Outlook: The Winhawks took a big hit to graduation losing three of their top four scorers including leading scorer Matt Thesing who had 18 goals and 31 points as a senior. Also gone is long-time starting goalie Alex Benson who played all but 43 minutes in goal last season and posted a 3.36 goals-against average and .908 save percentage. The Winhawks will build around two young playmakers Teis Larsen and Aven Prodzinski. Larsen was the team’s second-leading scorer a year ago. Senior goalies Justin Brickner and Brayden McDevitt are inexperienced having combined to play just 42 minutes 36 seconds last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmtsaXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcnlhbi1oYXJ0bWFuLWxpZnRzLXdpbGQtdG8tNC0yLXdpbi1vdmVyLWRlZmVuZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWN1cC1jaGFtcGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ryan Hartman lifts Wild to 4-2 win over defending Stanley Cup champions,"ST. PAUL -- Ryan Hartman only makes $1.7 million per season. He signed a team-friendly contract extension on April 22 2021 and talked at length about how he wanted to be a part of Wild’s core moving forward.

It’s been a match made in heaven.

Already well on his way to the best season of his career Hartman scored his team-high 12th goal of the season on Sunday afternoon at Xcel Energy Center to lift the Minnesota Wild to a 4-2 win over the defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning.

The goal itself was a thing of beauty as Hartman caught a pass from Kirill Kaprizov spun around with the puck on his stick then fired a shot on net to beat goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy.

“I’m just trying to get it on net” Hartman said. “I haven’t seen the replay. I don’t really remember how the play panned out. But I know I almost beat him there early that period. He just barely caught a piece of it so I was definitely going to that side.”

That makes three straight games with a goal for Hartman as he continues to establish himself as a legitimate scoring threat.

“It’s unbelievable” Nick Bjugstad said. “Every time he touches the puck in the slot we kind of figure it’s going in. He’s a great player and he’s really finding his way here in the Wild sweater.”

“Obviously he has something going right now” Rem Pitlick added. ‘We all want to watch him keep riding that wave. And he obviously has the talent to make that magic happen.”

It was a back and forth start to the game before Bjugstad put the Wild in front 1-0 midway through the first period with an incredible individual effort. He collected a loose puck in the neutral zone made a power move toward the net then beat Vasilevskiy with a top-shelf snipe.

“Just kind of shot it” Bjugstad said with a smile. “Sometimes it goes in like that.”

That lead was short lived as winger Corey Perry helped the Lightning tie the game at 1-1 less than a minute later with a top-shelf snipe of his own. Fortunately for the Wild they responded a few minutes later with Victor Rask scoring to make it 2-1.

The game took a turn in the second period as the Wild failed to take advantage with multiple chances on the power play. To make matters worse winger Alex Killorn scored for the Lightning midway through the second period to tie the game at 2-2.

Though those missed opportunities could’ve come back to haunt the Wild Hartman scored midway through the third period to put the Wild in front 3-2. He let out a gigantic fist pump after scoring the goal before his teammates mobbed him in celebration.

That proved to be the difference as the Wild ratcheted up their defense down the stretch before Marcus Foligno added an empty-net goal to finalize the score at 4-2.

“The commitment level was really high tonight” Evason said. “Obviously when we’re playing against the Stanley Cup champions our guys are really dialed in.”

Especially Hartman.

“It’s not like he’s getting bounces in” Evason said of Hartman’s recent hot streak. “He’s shooting it in a specific spot and it’s going in the net. It’s great to see him get rewarded. It’s also great for the team to get rewarded with the way that he’s playing.”

Briefly

Mats Zuccarello did not play in Sunday’s game. He injured his left hand in Friday’s game against the Winnipeg Jets and is considered day-to-day."

Tyson first appeared in the industry in 2017 with the line “Tyson Ranch.” While that business didn’t succeed Mike wasn’t about to leave the industry so easily. The new version Tyson 2.0 is reportedly operating their first grow houses with a staff of well renown industry veterans.

Tyson 2.0 vs Tyson Ranch

Tyson 2.0 CEO Adam Wilks reasons that “Tyson Ranch failed due to bad management and lack of cannabis knowledge. Unfortunately management was not what it should have been. Which is why for Tyson 2.0 I’m here and I’m excited to launch Mike’s cannabis brand for real this time.” His words don’t fall short as Wilks ran licensing and royalties with companies like Pinkberry Cold Stone Creamery and YUM fast food brands. Since 2013 Wilks has managed over 30 cannabis brands in North America.

Tyson 2.0 is teamed up with Columbia Care a multi-state operation in medical cannabis. When asked to give a statement CGO Jesse Channon said “Because of Mike Tyson’s passion for cannabis and the insight he brought to this brand through his own positive outcomes we knew we needed to bring this product line which has such a broad appeal to market as quickly as possible. We’re thrilled to be able to ramp up our partnership when we did. It is also perfectly fitting that we are launching in Colorado one of our largest markets and look forward to leveraging our experience and scale to bring it to fruition across the country.”

A Personal Passion

Mike Tyson has been open and vocal about using cannabis to calm pre-fight anxieties and as a safe pain reliever. For athletes across the country cannabis is a safe alternative to opioid painkillers and muscle relaxers. One of the most recognizable interviews with Mike Tyson is when he fought Roy Jones Jr.

In a CBS interview Tyson stated that:

“I smoked during fights. I just have to smoke I’m sorry. I’m a smoker … I smoke everyday. I never stopped smoking.”

Their Edge in the Market

What sets this company apart is that Mike Tyson personally chooses the strains they carry. Now what does it take for a product to be approved by Mike? Tyson 2.0 will typically preference the most potent strains though the brand also wishes to appeal for lower tolerances. Some favorites include the common classic “Sour Diesel” and a strain called “The Toad” named after Mike’s toad licking experiences.

Mike Tyson stressed that their genetics will come from the East African country of Malawi. Having recently legalized medical use CNN reports that Tyson will soon become the cannabis ambassador for the country’s Ministry of Agriculture. Having such a direct trade with the Malawian government will give Tyson 2.0 a serious edge in North American markets because of their access to an African ecological agriculture.

In terms of product and sales Tyson 2.0 will have flower grown from three different mediums. This includes direct sunlight with low potency experimental greenhouse strains and indoor with high potency. Coloradans can get excited for their line of Heavy Bags which will retail at under $100 per oz likely coming out to around $120 after tax. In the near future we can also expect to see edibles drinks and concentrates. Take a look at their website and be sure to stay on the lookout for Tyson 2.0 and try “The Toad” for yourself!

Diarrhoea in calves is characterised by the acute appearance of watery faeces.

According to Dr Brian Arinaitwe a veterinarian with Zoetis diarrhoea affects between up to 35 percent of suckling calves and is responsible for more than 50 per cent of pre-weaning losses.

While explaining about livestock diseases that need careful management during the 25th edition of the Seeds of Gold Farm Clinic at the National Livestock Resources Research Institute (NaLIRRI) in Namulonge Dr Arinaitwe said that diarrhoea causes loss of appetite and can reduce the average daily weight gain. Zoetis a global animal health company are partners of the Seeds of Gold Farm Clinic.

“Diarrhoea in calves causes serious economic losses. It can be reduced with adequate prevention and treatment” Dr Arinaitwe says.

In a natural setting calves suckle their mothers for up to a year. The incidence of diarrhoea is highly dependent on the level of colostral protection that a calf receives within the first six hours of life. It is generally recommended that calves receive three litres within the first two hours of life. However in commercial dairy farming calves are taken away from their mother within hours of birth for sale or to be reared for beef.

According to Dr Arinaitwe this causes severe pain to both the cow and the calf leading to diseases.

He explains that if calf diarrhoea becomes a problem on the farm the starting point is to check their immune status with a simple blood test. He recommends that the test is carried out by a veterinary doctor.

Causes

Dr Arinaitwe says diarrhoea is caused by viral infections including rotavirus. Calves are most commonly affected at eight to 14 days of age when there is an acute onset of diarrhoea excreting very watery yellow/green faeces.

The infection is most times acquired from the calving accommodation and then spread between young calves in the herd through contact. Early signs include a reluctance to stand and drink mild depression and salivation. The calf becomes dehydrated with sunken eyes and tight and inelastic skin.

To manage the condition Dr Arinaitwe says the calf should be isolated in a dry well-bedded pen. It should then be administered with Effydral tablets four to eight times a day. They are oral rehydration therapy to cure scours in calves.

Apart from rotavirus outbreaks of coronavirus diarrhoea are more severe although it is less common.

The treatment and prevention of coronavirus infection is the same as for rotavirus. Calves aged one to three days old which manifest sudden onset of profuse yellow/white diarrhoea may be affected by E. coli.

Diarrhoea is also caused by Cryptosporidiosis a zoonotic disease that can affect humans too. There is profuse yellow/green diarrhoea with a lot of mucus in it. Dehydration is mild but the calf rapidly loses condition over two to five days and has a dull tucked-up appearance.

Dr Arinaitwe advises farmers to consult a veterinarian for a suggested treatment protocol. Salmonella can also cause severe diarrhoea and may result in death.

Dr Arinaitwe explains that diarrhoea can also affect adult cows. He says that cattle naturally graze on grasses as they require lots of fibre in their diet. However dairy cows that produce high yields of milk require more nutrient-dense diets so are fed more concentrates and less forages. He says this leads to a build-up of acids in the rumen which causes acidosis if occurring for prolonged periods each day. Cows with acidosis often have diarrhoea.

Vaccination

Dr Arinaitwe says as with all animal diseases prevention is better than cure and an effective veterinary herd health plan is essential.

“Vaccines are available against the most important infectious causes of calf diarrhoea but a prevention strategy will only work if calves receive adequate volumes of good-quality colostrum within a few hours of birth” he says. Dr Arinaitwe says that vaccination of healthy cattle is highly recommended. Using the one shot Bovine Virus Diarrhea Vaccine farmers can protect against diarrhoea among other diseases. He says that calves need to be vaccinated before six months and be revaccinated after afterwards or at weaning.

Ultravac Scourshield vaccine can also be used for the vaccination of healthy pregnant cows and heifers as an aid in preventing diarrhoea in their calves caused by certain bacteria and viruses.

The primary vaccination should consist of two doses at least 3–9 weeks apart from pregnant cows with the second dose given 2–6 weeks prior to calving. He says that annual boosters with a single dose are administered 2–6 weeks before each subsequent calving.

In case of treatment calves can be administered with fluid therapy which is the most effective treatment strategy. Antibiotics can also be used to control concurrent infections.

All Zoetis solutions are available through partnership with local distribution agents at Eram Uganda and in Container Village.
