MMM,3M,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L2JldHRlci1idXktZ2UtdnMtM20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: GE vs. 3M,"GE's stock is rebounding strongly of late. Is that enough to make it a buy over an industrial stalwart like 3M? Read this before doing anything.

General Electric (GE -0.80%) has been struggling to get off its back foot since the 2007 to 2009 recession. Three CEOs later and as many turnaround plans it looks like the business may finally be solidifying. Before buying this icon however you should consider it compared to some peers. For example 3M (MMM 1.02%) could be a good alternative. Here's a head to head to see why.

1. The recent run

General Electric's stock is up roughly 85% over the past year. 3M's gain is a relatively meager 25% or so. Over the past three years GE's shares have risen about 4% while 3M's are basically flat. Since the start of 2007 however GE's stock is off by more than 60% while 3M's shares have gained 150%. These are three very different time periods but the big takeaway is that GE's stock has been performing better of late. However that hasn't been enough to make up for the hit the business took during the 2007 to 2009 financially-led downturn.

During that period GE's foray into finance caused massive financial harm leading to several rounds of restructuring asset sales and dividend cuts. That's a very truncated summary of what has been an incredibly trying time for the business but the truth is that GE is not the same company today that it was in 2007. That's notable because while there is likely to be more recovery potential in GE's stock it may take a long time before it regains anything close to prior peaks. By comparison 3M is still the lumbering giant it has been for decades. There's an important level of comfort in that for moderate and conservative investors.

2. The portfolio

Today GE breaks its business down into four main categories: power (21% of sales) renewable energy (20%) aviation (32%) and healthcare (26%). It makes fairly large industrial products that service businesses in each of these areas. 3M does things on a somewhat smaller scale creating products like adhesives and dental supplies not windmills and jet engines (two of GE's core products). 3M's business is broken down across its safety & industrial (35% of sales) transportation & electronics (27%) healthcare (24%) and consumer (14%) segments.

While both of these companies would fall into the industrial conglomerate category 3M's business has more diversification built into it. Diversification is good for your portfolio and it can be good for companies as well. To put a figure on that GE's sales fell 16% in 2020 while 3M's were flat. To be fair 2020 was an extremely unusual year given the coronavirus pandemic but 3M weathered the hit better because of its vast mix of products. Demand for GE's big costly industrial items were hit much harder. Once again conservative and moderate investors will likely favor 3M.

3. The dividend

This isn't perhaps a fair comparison given that GE has been working through a tough turnaround that has left its dividend at a token penny a share per quarter. At some point it will likely start to increase the dividend again which might end up being a sign that its turnaround is finally complete. But for now dividend investors won't be too happy with the shares and the scant 0.3% dividend yield. 3M has increased its dividend for more than 60 consecutive years making it a Dividend King. The current yield is around 3% which is toward the high side of its historical range. It has been higher so using yield as a rough gauge of valuation you wouldn't call 3M a screaming buy. But it is probably fairly valued to slightly cheap. Again 3M ends up looking like the better option for most investors.

4. Nothing is perfect

GE has been in turnaround mode for over a decade thanks to some pretty big self-inflicted wounds (straying too far into the finance industry was the biggest issue). It is getting past major structural problems as it slims down its operations with the focus now on getting its remaining businesses back on more solid footing. So there's progress here but still issues.

But don't think that 3M is without its own warts. The biggest one right now is a pair of lawsuits that it is fighting around environmental and product quality issues. The costs could end up being material. However the core of the business remains strong and 3M is a large and financially robust company that should be able to handle the legal costs should it end up losing these cases. This isn't as fundamental an issue as what GE has been dealing with. All in it would probably be best to view GE as a special situation stock as it looks to complete its turnaround effort a type of investing that's really best suited to more aggressive types. Buying 3M involves some uncertainties but they won't likely scare off conservative investors.

Boring is better

When you add it all up 3M looks like the safer option here. That's not to suggest that GE won't reward investors with larger stock gains as it has over the past year. But that's a function of the high risk turnaround that's taking place -- if the effort stalls the shares could drop just as quickly. Most investors will be better served sticking with a slow and steady name like 3M. Perhaps when GE starts to increase its dividend again it will be time for a reexamination but for now 3M looks more appealing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpdGMuY29tL2VuLWdiLzIwMjEvMDYvMjYvZGVhZGxpbmUtc2V0LW92ZXItcmFuZ2Vycy1hbmQtY2VsdGljLXBsYW5zLXRoYXQtd291bGQtcmFpc2UtM20tZm9yLXNwZmwtY2x1YnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deadline set over Rangers and Celtic plans that would raise £3m for clubs,"Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)

Clubs have been given until July 7 to decide if they will back reconstruction proposals which would see Rangers and Celtic Colts join SPFL League Two next season.

With the Old Firm fielding a B team in the Lowland League season talks have taken place over plans that would see the SPFL increased to 48 teams over 4 divisions of 12 with Rangers and Celtic Colts the first two added.

The Daily Mail’s Stephen McGowan has reported that there is opposition from clubs in various divisions to the plans with the backing sought before a decision is made to take it to a formal vote of clubs – although HITC understands that several Premiership clubs have expressed their own interest previously.

Heavy investment from Rangers and Celtic could sway the balance

Rangers and Celtic would pay just short of £300000 each year for the next five years for the right to field a second string side in the senior leagues putting a total of around £3million into the lower tiers.

With the current set-up only intended for one year Rangers and Celtic are looking at the longer-term for their best youngsters and it will be interesting to see whether it advances further this time.

By Peter Duru Makurdi; Wole Mosadomi Minna; Ndahi Marama Maiduguri and Ibrahim HassanWuyo Kaduna

10 years of insurgency in the North-East raging banditry in the North-West and armed herdsmen menace in the North-Central have left on their trail millions of displaced residents according to Sunday Vanguard findings.

The displacement comes with the attendant huge financial and material resources borne by government and humanitarian agencies to cater for victims.

For instance although about one million residents displaced in Borno State the hotbed of the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East have returned home following the restoration of peace in their parts of the state the state government continues to struggle with the upkeep of at least one million other Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) because there is no enabling environment to return to their ancestral homes.

There are 31 official IDP camps in the state.

In essence the number could be more if unofficial camps are added.

Reports from Kaduna State say whereas there are no officially designated IDP camps in the state bogged down by banditry there may be no fewer than one million IDPs scattered across the state.

Benue is contending with 1000007 IDPs sent packing from their ancestral homes by suspected armed herdsmen while whereas there were no official figures on IDPs in Niger where bandits are on the rampage sacking residents at will sources said there may be nothing less than 500 000 IDPs harbored by their different host communities in the state.

Borno

Borno which bears the greatest brunt of insurgency in the country initially has a total of over two million IDPs mostly women and unaccompanied children from Northern Central and Southern Senatorial Districts.

But with the liberation of some communities and quite a number of IDPs relocating back to their ancestral homes over a million of IDPs are still living in camps.

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) it was learnt has been doing a lot distributing food and non-food items monthly to the IDPs in addition to other humanitarian assistance from sister agencies.

Although Governor Professor Babagana Umara Zulum had said government would close all IDP camps in Borno on or before May 29 2021 to allow inmates go back to their ancestral homes the move may not be realistic considering renewed terror attacks on communities in the last one month which caused huge displacement.

Zulum bemoaning the challenge of taking care of the IDPs while flagging off the distribution of food items donated by an NGO (Baba For All) linked to President Muhammadu Buhari at Muna IDP camp Maiduguri said the state government was doing its best adding that the task was huge for government alone to handle hence all hands must be on deck to address the challenge.

“When I took over the mantle of leadership we inherited a total of two million IDPs” he said at the occasion.

“Presently we have 25 formal camps and 35 non- formal camps. On a serious note government is finding it very difficult to provide food for this quantum number of our IDPs”.

Kaduna

Reports from Kaduna State say whereas there are no officially designated IDP camps in the state there may be no fewer than one million IDPs scattered across the state.

These are people displaced by the Southern Kaduna conflict and attacks by bandits.

Officials of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) revealed that there are no officially designated camps for IDPs saying the one previously used as camp had been given to the military to house female soldiers now providing security on the dreaded Kaduna- Abuja highway.

On how government is taking care of those that were internally displaced in communities across Kaduna the officials said they had been integrated into their host communities while government relates with them through Local Emergency Management Committees at the local government level.

Sunday Vanguard learned that SEMA officials get quarterly updates on the IDPs from the Local Management Committees’ officials.

Since the IDPs are in the local communities either with relations or other caring citizens their health concerns are taken care of by Primary Health Care facilities.

The government is according to officials discouraging the setting up of IDP camps in the state because of alleged atrocities committed in such camps.

Donations from NGOs and other groups reach the IDPs through local government officials and traditional leaders.

The Federal Ministry of Agric and the National Commission for Refugees have been donating foodstuff to the IDPs who relocated from communities at Birnin Gwari Giwa Chikun Kajuru and other troubled areas of Kaduna.

Niger

In Niger State where 15 of the 25 local government areas have been taken over by bandits there may be no less than 500 000 IDPs scattered in different parts of the state.

Worst hit are Shiroro Munya Rafi Mariga Paiko and Mashegu local government areas.

Because of the incessant invasion to these communities residents have either been ejected from their ancestral homes by banditry or they voluntarily fled to the various IDP camps in the state.

As of now there are five camps in Niger located in Kuta Gwada both in Shiroro LGA one in Rafi headquarters of Rafi LGA and one each in Maikunkele Maitumbi in Bosso and Chanchaga LGAs respectively.

The one at IBB Primary School in Minna the state capital has been merged with the one at Gwada.

Officials said the state government had not relented in its responsibility of catering for the inmates though resources may not be enough due to cash crunch.

Religious organizations including Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and individuals have been playing supportive roles in providing various items including foodstuff water detergents and beddings to assist inmates.

No doubt the camps are faced with numerous challenges including accommodation feeding deficiency in provision of health facilities and lack of conveniences like toilets.

Because the camps are not permanently built to take care of emergencies schools are mostly used and are grossly inadequate.

No fewer than 30 to 40 people are clustered in each of the classes available including children.

Water is rationed with no essential drugs to cater for the sick and other emergency cases.

In other words the inmates are left in the “hands of God” for their survival.

Because of lack of adequate security at the camps the store where foodstuff and other essential commodities are kept for the inmates in Gwada was burgled few hours after delivery sometime ago.

In an exclusive interview with our correspondent the Director General of Niger State Emergency Agency (NSEMA) Alhaji Muhammad Inga said the exact number of those in various IDP camps in the state could not be determined.

According to him people in the camps keep rising every day.

“We have a lot of security challenges and government is making efforts to make peace prevail in the camps for the people until they return to their ancestral homes” Inga said.

“If I give you figures today in the next one hour the figure might change and that is why we don’t have the exact number of people in the various camps.

“We are lucky that despondency has not set in and that is why we are managing the situation professionally because in IDP camps you have to be careful to know the best strategy to adopt to avoid crisis because if despondency sets in it will be a bigger issue to manage”.

Benue

In Benue since 2018 shortly after the New Year’s Day massacre in Logo and Guma LGAs and the subsequent attacks that followed in the days and months after the state has been challenged by IDPs sacked from their ancestral homes by suspected armed herdsmen who the people believe are on a mission to take over Benue land.

While the attacks raged the state government was compelled to open official IDPs camps for the displaced and presently the officially recognized camps in the state are seven.

Aside the official camps IDPs also reside in host communities since the facilities in the camps lacked carrying capacity for all the displaced persons at a time.

Then there are the unofficial camps where people have also sought refuge.

According to records obtained from the Benue State Emergency Management Agency SEMA in the official and unofficial facilities or camps we have records of inmates who moved into the safe haven in 2019 2020 and 2021.

A breakdown of the 2019 record of IDPs showed that Abagena camp has 8210 IDPs while the Abagena host community is home to 7691 inmates. Daudu Camp 1 (UNHCR Shelter) has 5451 IDPs Daudu ll has 20172 while Gbajimba camp is home to 29500 inmates.

Others are Anyiin camp with 7466 inmates Ugba camp with 3080 Abeda camp with 2668 while Abeda host community has 22948 IDPs.

Agan camp has 4798 inmates while the host community is home to 5517 IDPs.

Agatu is home to 65347 IDPs Angwan Ochonu has 4951 IDPs Anyiin community has 65496 IDPs Daudu community is home to 43344 inmates FHA camp has 4353 IDPs and Gbajimba community is home to 28875 IDPs.

Gwer West has 60243 IDPs Ichwa 9587 Kwande 9465 LDEA NASME 23151 LGEA Tyodugh has 5672 IDPs NEPA Qtrs 8008 Ogiri Ajene 9506 Okpokwu 4080 Tionsha 20500 and Ugba community is home to 8651.

The total number of IDPs living in official and unofficial camps and host communities since 2019 is 483692.

The number of those displaced as a result of herdsmen attacks as updated in June 2020 is 75811 and a breakdown of the figure indicated that Mbakunu (Kwande) is home to 2951 IDPs Mbaper (Kwande) is hosting 1602 IDPs Iyon (Kwande) has 489 inmates and Jato Aka/Nyihemba (Kwande) has 37675 IDPs.

Others are Ogere (Obi) 17 858 Torkula (Guma) 817 Agasha (Guma) 1502 Kaseyo (Guma) 652 Ikponko (Guma) 712 and Uikpam (Guma) is home to 11554 IDPs.

These figures updated in December 2020 as a result of sustained attacks by armed herders in more communities indicated that more communities in Guma like Uleva community is host to 13855 IDPs Iye community is hosting 16578 displaced persons and Tse Akenyi community has 22873 IDPs.

Logo has Iorja community hosting 14000 IDPs Tse Akpam community 11369 and Igbatim community with 16541 inmates.

In Makurdi there are 18000 IDPs in Imande Akpu community while Tse Chagu community is playing host to 6000 IDPs.

The total number of persons displaced in 2020 as a result of sustained attacks on Benue communities by suspected herdsmen militia is 205 027.

Meanwhile the statistics of displacement as a result of further attacks on several communities in Benue in 2021 showed that Guma LGA Uikpam IDP camp is home to 27222 persons Yogbo community hosts 19911 persons Udei community hosts 20932 Ortese community harbors 17 654 Umenger has 19277 while Yelwata community is host to 1700 IDPs.

In Gwer West Naka community harbors 23070 IDPs Aondoana community has 15171 while Tyoughtee community has 19888 IDPs.

In Makurdi there are 16865 IDPs in Atson community and 11987 in Anter community. Logo is harboring 13065 in Tse Agure while 1765 IDPs are in Tse Akau Akpor community.

Konshisha where a military operation recently took place to recover the weapons of the soldiers slain by bandits has 5958 IDPs in Gungul community. Agidi community is home to 1143 IDPs Aku community has 3852 Adoka community has 702 Bonta 2250 Gbinde community 1548 Tse Anyon 1512 and Guleya Community is home to 2142 IDPs.

In Oju LGA Ukpute community is host to 1954 IDPs while Agatu LGA has 10981 IDPs in Okokolo community 21098 in Obagaji 10400 in Aila 12091 in Odugbeho and 11850 are harbored in Oweto communities.

The total figure of people displaced in Benue communities in 2021 alone is put at 311288 bringing the overall number of IDPs in Benue to a grand total of 1000007.

As mentioned earlier these IDPs are from different communities of the state including Kwande Okpokwu Guma Makurdi Gwer West Logo Oju Konshisha and Agatu LGAs who were attacked and sacked from their ancestral homes by suspected armed herdsmen.

However those of Konshisha were sacked from their homes after a military operation to recover the weapons of the soldiers slain by bandits in the area.

According to the Executive Secretary of Benue SEMA Dr. Emmanuel Shior since the displacement of these persons the state government took it upon itself to ensure that the needs and security of the IDPs were catered for.

He explained that the efforts of government is being complemented by NGOs public spirited individuals and groups who have been providing food shelter medical water sanitation and hygiene activities in the camps.

“Regrettably the Federal Government has not shown enough commitment to the welfare of the IDPs leaving the state government to grapple with the overwhelming challenge of catering for the IDPs” he said

The Executive Secretary also pointed out that quantifying the worth of government’s intervention in the camps in terms of Naira and Kobo may be difficult but it runs into millions of Naira monthly.

On the challenges in the camps he said “the challenges we have in these camps are that of food security and health issues.

“But I must acknowledge that we have some international and local organisations supporting the government have been doing so in the areas of water supply health including WASH.”

On the issue of outbreak of diseases in the camps he clarified that the camps had not recorded any of such because inmates were receiving adequate medicare from partners and the state government.

“But our worry at the moment is that of security in the camps. In all the camps IDPs are entertaining fears of being attacked due to the recent attack that happened at the Abagena IDPs camp. So there are fears of possible attacks in the camps at the moment” the SEMA boss said.

“In fact some of the IDPs out of fear look for where to sleep in the host communities for fear of being victims of another herders’ attack” he said.

Suspected armed herdsmen had at the wee hours of April 27 2021 invaded the Abagena IDPs camp in the outskirts of Makurdi town killing seven inmates.

The attack which took place at about 2am also left many of the nearly 20000 traumatized IDPs with serious injuries.

That invasion almost sparked a reprisal by angry Benue youths who recovered the remains of the slain IDPs and laid them on the busy Makurdi-Lafia highway threatening to avenge their death.

They also demanded to be allowed to carry AK47 rifles to defend themselves just like armed herders.

It took the personal intervention of Governor Samuel Ortom to prevail on the angry youths to sheath their swords.

After convincing the youths the governor appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to take decisive action against armed herders who had been accused of unleashing mayhem on innocent Nigerians warning that the people were not convinced that he was doing enough in that regard.

Greg Abbott and Donald Trump plan border visit to Texas: Here's what to know,"Donald Trump whose last official trip before leaving the White House was to South Texas to tout the progress toward building a wall to discourage illegal immigration will return on Wednesday for the first time as an ex-president for a similar purpose.

Trump plans to join Gov. Greg Abbott at the Texas Department of Public Safety facility in Weslaco at 11:30 a.m and then take a tour of part of the border barrier at an undisclosed location an hour later.

The McAllen Monitor has reported that Trump and Abbott will participate in a town hall meeting for invited guests at 2:15 p.m. at the DPS hangar in the South Texas International Airport in Edinburg. Fox News commentator Sean Hannity will be the moderator the newspaper said.

Trump:Charges against Trump Organization expected as soon as next week attorney says

Abbott citing a dramatic upswing in unauthorized border crossings since Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden has announced plans for Texas to continue building border barriers at state expense.

This month Abbott and top legislative leaders agreed to divert $250 million of already allocated tax money to the project. Also the governor's office has established a fundraising portal to accept donations for the project. As of Friday more than $566000 in private donations has been received Abbott's office said.

For the two-year budget cycle that begins Sept. 1 state lawmakers have committed about $1.1 billion for other border security measures. The money is primarily directed toward law enforcement.

Also this month the Biden administration announced plans to divert $2.2 billion previously allocated for the border wall to military projects in the United States and overseas.

Construction chiefly focused on federal land in Arizona California and New Mexico. In Texas 131 miles were built in El Paso and Hudspeth counties and 17 miles in Cameron Hidalgo and Starr counties according to CBP.

Now imagine the authorities couldn’t care less. Imagine they create barrier after barrier to make sure it’s as hard as possible to ever buy a farm have a livelihood or even a full way of life. Now imagine time goes by and the land stolen from you becomes the basis upon which the robbers begin accumulating more and more wealth for themselves their children and their children’s children.

You would be angry depressed but still determined to see that the original theft was returned with interest to you your children and their children.

Now think about African Americans and Native Americans today.

America has unfinished business. Though over the years the country has made attempts to right the original wrongs it has never attempted a full repair. Instead the country has watched for four centuries as the wealth gap between African Americans and Native Americans and whites has grown and grown. Whites have grown richer on theft that impoverished their African American and Native American brothers and sisters. Do we really want this to go on? Are whites really that hard-hearted and cowardly that we would let this crime go unanswered for yet another generation? I hope not. The time has come for a great nation to complete the repair of this crime.

The United States is great country but it is not uniquely exceptional. All countries are in one way or another exceptional. Like other countries throughout history the United States has used a belief in ethnic superiority religious legitimation duplicity injustice and violence to enrich and expand its territory. Over 350 years African Americans have been deprived of their “inalienable rights” to freedom dignity political participation and wealth. They have been offered neither an apology nor reparations from the governments of the United States. The consequences of these thefts have yet to be fully reckoned with.

Native Americans were expelled from their lands despite treaties with the United States government. They had children taken away from their families to attend government schools that forbade the children to speak their own languages or to practice their religions. They lived through many horrors such as the Trail of Tears the Sand Creek Massacre and the Wounded Knee Massacre. There was the infamous Dawes Act of 1887 that took away 90 million acres of land without compensation that the U.S. Government had promised Native tribes for eternity. My ancestors received 160 acres of that land free in eastern Oregon because of that Act. That land enabled them to restart their lives after the Civil War.

Under President Truman a payment of $1.3 billion was paid to tribes for land the U.S. government seized illegally without payment. Much of that money was put in trust to the government because the government decided that Native Americans would not be able to manage the money. Over the years the money grew but when Eloise Cobell of the Blackfoot Nation began to ask what happened to all the money she found the government had committed huge fraud on Native Americans by “losing” billions of dollars from their endowment. In the end 15 years later the government paid $3.4 billion as restitution to Native Americans for that fraud.

In the Ten Commandments revered by Jews and Christians alike we are told that the sins of the fathers will pass down to the children through the third and fourth generations. Though our nation is not founded on any religion a majority of people in our country are Christians and Jews who claim to worship the God of the Bible.

Even if one is not such a believer our Declaration of Independence asserts “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Though the United States has been working to put this belief fully into practice for nearly 250 years there is still a long way to go. Why do I say that? Because it is a lie to say that African Americans and Native Americans have ever fully enjoyed those self-evident rights.

The time has come for an apology and full restitution. The sins have been passed down to the children long enough. African Americans Native Americans and others have suffered under the culture of white supremacy long enough. It is time to give sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf so they can see and hear of horror of what America’s “original sin” has wrought.

If the civil governments show themselves to be reluctant to act I call on the churches synagogues and other religious institutions of this country to take leadership in turning our government to do the right thing. They can show examples of repentance and restitution. Already some churches and their institutions such as Georgetown University and Princeton Seminary have made apology and offered reparations. Are we able to live in peace as the cost of this injustice continues to do grievous harm to the lives of African Americans and Native Americans? I hope not. Do we really want to continue passing on this injustice to our children and their children? With God’s help we can make reparation.

But finally a pastor who reportedly abused multiple youth in his care has been removed from office.

As we reported in an article in May claims that former youth intern Paul Warren had abused boys in the 1980s at Lookout Mountain Presbyterian Church in Lookout Mountain Tennessee circulated in the church for decades. But it wasn’t until 2019 when Pastor Brian Salter learned about the claims that the church took swift action to investigate expose and heal these sins that had been buried.

We praised the church’s response applauding its transparency; regular communication with church members and the public; its hiring of Godly Responses to Abuse in the Christian Environment (GRACE) to perform an independent investigation; and its efforts to address these issues in the context of loving Christian community.

But the story didn’t end there. As Lookout Mountain soon discovered Warren was still serving as a pastor at Abbott Memorial Presbyterian Church (AMPC) in Baltimore.

The wheels of ecclesiastical justice can turn slowly at times. But recently the Chesapeake Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in America and Abbott acted to bar Warren from further ministry.

Details about how the presbytery and the church handled Warren’s case were spelled out in a recent undated letter posted on Abbott Memorial’s website.

“It is with deep sorrow that I write this letter to our congregation and Baltimore community not only because of the actions that have come to light regarding Paul Warren who was our pastor but also how we as the Session and as leaders in the church addressed these actions” wrote George Lenning clerk of the church’s session.

The letter admitted the presbytery’s failure for initially ruling last September that Warren was qualified for ministry because he “had confessed and demonstrated repentance for his former transgressions over 35 years ago.”

“Abbott Memorial Presbyterian Church is deeply sorry for our decision in allowing Paul to continue his employment with Abbott Memorial Presbyterian Church and recognizes the undue hurt we may have caused Paul’s victims. The Session and congregation of AMPC have been devastated and heartbroken to hear of these abuses and we grieve with the survivors.”

Here’s a timeline of events:

May 2020: Lookout Mountain informs Abbott Memorial that it is investigating Warren the pastor at Abbott Memorial related to alleged abuse.

“The Session of AMPC took immediate action to release Paul Warren from active ministry in May 2020 and waited for the ruling of the Chesapeake Presbytery Paul’s oversight association which was conducting a separate investigation” says clerk Lenning’s letter. Warren continued as pastor of the church.

September 2020: The Chesapeake Presbytery accepted Warren’s “demonstrated repentance” for his former transgressions and “confirmed him in his pastoral qualification.”

January 8 2021: GRACE releases its investigation report commissioned by Lookout Mountain.

January 24 2021: Warren resigns as pastor of Abbott Memorial.

February 2021: The Chesapeake Presbytery of the PCA acknowledged that it erred in Sept. 2020 when it recommended that Warren continue in the pastorate reversed its ruling and found Warren guilty of “flagitious sin” and deposing him from his call as teaching elder.

Dee Parsons who has covered the saga at her blog The Wartburg Watch said the presbytery finally did the right thing. But she believes it finally did so because it could no longer avoid the public scrutiny brought by her blog and other news reports.

“I will give the PCA kudos for getting him out of there” she said in a phone interview with The Roys Report. “But they should have been smarter to get him out of there sooner.”

Parsons says forgiveness is essential when pastors confess sin but forgiveness should not be a pathway back to ministry for those who have abused young people.

“I don’t believe any man who has been working in a church and has been molesting kids should ever be allowed to be in a position of authority again” she said.

Real Estate Editor Emeritus

The Milam House 18 miles southeast of Jacksonville was the last of about 80 residences designed in Florida by the controversial Paul Rudolph as he transitioned from modest midcentury modern beach houses to more substantial structures such as Sarasota High School’s 1960 addition.

By the time he designed a house for Jacksonville lawyer Arthur Milam in 1961 he was well-established as the dean of the architecture school at Yale where his Art & Architecture Building of 1963 set American architecture on a Brutalist course.

At Yale Rudolph’s students included Carl Abbott and his friends Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. Abbott has practiced a singular form of architecture in his own Sarasota practice since 1966 and Foster and Rogers both Pritzker Prize winners have been members of the world’s architectural elite for decades.

Each acknowledges the influence Rudolph had on their careers. Abbott has said that Rudolph was an outstanding if sometimes harshly critical educator who rather than taking a “my way or the highway” approach encouraged students to find their own paths.

After World War II Rudolph had been a student of Walter Gropius at Harvard. While at a Harvard reunion around 1960 Rudolph met Arthur Milam and soon Rudolph was designing a house for the lawyer and his wife Teresa. Rudolph was given total design freedom.

For the Milam House the plans for which were drawn in his studio in New Haven Connecticut Rudolph had the luxury of designing for air-conditioning. Where his houses of a decade earlier in Sarasota were designed to open to sea breezes the Milam House has large fixed panes of glass.

The outstanding architectural feature is the array of open concrete boxes on the east side of the house. These boxes some square some rectangular remind many of the paintings of Piet Mondrian – without the vivid colors. From the outside they make the house a landmark on a 28-mile stretch of beach that is lined with mansions. They also serve to create shadows from the harsh sunlight.

The boxes are independent of the layout of the interior rooms. From the main living room the boxes do frame views of the Atlantic Ocean. At least one researcher has reported that Rudolph wanted to use poured-concrete construction but to reduce costs concrete blocks were used.

The interior does not have the standard open floor plan of a modernist house but instead an intricate layout with tall and low ceilings nooks and at least one unexpected staircase. The main living room has an “inglenook” that forms an intimate conversation area in front of the fireplace. But while Rudolph used a sunken conversation pit at the 1953 Umbrella House in Lido Shores here it is elevated; it provided a convenient speaking platform for Abbott and others when the SAF took a bus trip to the house in August 2017. Instead the entire living room is sunken.

The tour was held while the house was listed for sale by the Milam family at $4.75 million. But a month later Hurricane Irma visited its wrath upon the state causing severe erosion of the dune separating the house from the beach and destroying much of the wooden deck.

“The house did well” in Irma said Realtor Claire Berry. “The dune did not.” Restoration she said “is a work in progress.”

The homeowner planned to build a $300000 seawall to protect the house which went back on the market in 2019.

Erosion has long been a problem for Ponte Vedra Beach the community group Save Ponte Vedra Beach Inc. stated on its Facebook page and a St. Johns County sand renourishment effort is now in the funding stages.

Architectural Record’s “House of the Year” in 1963 the Milam House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2016 because of its architecture. “The Milam House proved to be a pivotal work in the architect’s career” according to the NR nomination written by historic preservationist Carl Shiver. “It points more to Rudolph’s future than his past. While the earlier houses featured lightweight construction modular organization and interior spaces opening directly to the subtropical landscape the Milam House takes a more muscular approach to design.

“The building is a highly individual stylistic statement a one-of a-kind design created to suit the needs and tastes of a client for a comfortable and visually distinctive residence.”

ABBV,AbbVie,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGluYW1lcmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi9zY3JlZW5pbmctYmlwb2xhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Screening for Bipolar: Have You Ever Been “Unusually Happy"" for More than a Week?","In a recent article published in the journal Current Medical Research and Opinion researchers funded by AbbVie (a pharmaceutical company that sells several medications for depression and bipolar disorder) stated that they had developed a six-question “Rapid Screening Tool” for diagnosing bipolar I.

This screening tool is now being promoted in outlets such as Psychiatric Times which features a slideshow titled “How to Screen for Bipolar Disorder in 2 Minutes.” The subtitle: “A new test screens for bipolar disorder with respectable accuracy.”

Yet as even a quick look at the research paper reveals this questionnaire wasn’t even tested as a screening tool and it relies on questions that mistake adverse reactions to antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs as symptoms of bipolar disorder.

But this publication also suggests a larger subject: Is there any evidence for “screening” for psychiatric disorders? And what are the potential harms?

The Pharmaceutical Company Connection

According to the declaration of funding published with the article in Current Medical Research and Opinion the pharmaceutical company Allergan funded the development and testing of the screening tool. Allergan is now owned by pharma giant AbbVie.

Among Allergan’s top products are the antidepressant drugs citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro); AbbVie is the producer of Depakote (divalproex sodium) an anti-epileptic whose first indication is the “treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder.” They also market the antipsychotic drug cariprazine (Vrylar) for bipolar disorder.

The authors of the publication on the screening tool are Roger S. McIntyre Mehul D. Patel Prakash S. Masand Amanda Harrington Patrick Gillard Susan L. McElroy Kate Sullivan C. Brendan Montano T. Michelle Brown Lauren Nelson and Rakesh Jain.

Three of the listed authors—Patel Harrington and Gillard—are listed as employees of AbbVie.

Two other authors—Brown and Nelson—are employees of RTI Health Solutions a company that the pharmaceutical industry uses to analyze data and then write and publish their research so that it appears not to come from the industry itself.

All of the listed authors report extensive conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry except for the employees of RTI. Masand McElroy Sullivan and Jain report receiving speaker’s bureau or consulting payments from Allergan or Abbvie specifically.

The top earners were Masand and Jain: In 2019 Allergan paid Masand $152000 for promoting Vraylar. Jain earned $862000 from the pharmaceutical industry in 2019 with $131000 of that from Allergan.

The authors also acknowledge the work of AbbVie’s contracted ghostwriting firm as follows: “Writing and editorial assistance was provided to the authors by Carol Brown MS of Prescott Medical Communications Group (Chicago IL) a contractor of AbbVie.” Brown is not a listed author on the paper.

Even the peer reviewer hired by the journal to ensure an unbiased review of the manuscript lists 22 different conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry although none were with Allergan or AbbVie specifically.

Conducting the Study

The researchers call their tool for detecting bipolar disorder the RMS—Rapid Mood Screener. So how did they develop and test this measure?

First the researchers scanned the existing literature for symptoms that were different between depression and bipolar I disorder. Next they drafted a questionnaire based on these concepts. They interviewed 12 people with a diagnosis of either depression or bipolar I to see how well these concepts fit. Finally they tested their questionnaire in 67 people with a bipolar I diagnosis and 72 people with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. (All participants were already being treated with psychiatric drugs.)

The researchers did not test whether the tool could be used to spot “bipolar I” or “depression” in people who presented without symptoms or whether it could differentiate between healthy or “normal” controls and people with a diagnosis. Instead they tested whether the RMS could differentiate between people who were already diagnosed and being treated for either depression or bipolar I.

Thus the tool does not actually meet the definition of a “screening” instrument.

“Screening” in the medical field is the act of using a test to detect people who are not showing symptoms (or showing very few symptoms) but who may have the early stages of an illness that will get progressively worse.

Even more concerning is that at least four of the six questions on the RMS essentially measure the adverse effects of psychiatric drugs. One of the questions specifically asks whether the patient has experienced mania induced by antidepressant use.

Answering four of the six questions “yes” results in a positive “screen” for bipolar I disorder. In total the RMS consists of two questions about depression and four questions about the adverse effects of antidepressant drugs.

That is a clinician using the RMS will almost always conclude that people who experience the mania-inducing effects of antidepressant drugs should be diagnosed with bipolar I disorder.

The six questions on the RMS are:

Have there been at least 6 different periods of time (at least 2 weeks) when you felt deeply depressed? Did you have problems with depression before the age of 18? Have you ever had to stop or change your antidepressant because it made you highly irritable or hyper? Have you ever had a period of at least 1 week during which you were more talkative than normal with thoughts racing in your head? Have you ever had a period of at least 1 week during which you felt any of the following: unusually happy; unusually outgoing; or unusually energetic? Have you ever had a period of at least 1 week during which you needed much less sleep than usual?

Notably if a patient answers “yes” to question 3—indicating that they experienced the mania-inducing effects of antidepressant drugs—they will likely also meet criteria for questions 4 5 and 6 which are the symptoms of (hypo)mania.

Thus after experiencing just one week of adverse effects from an antidepressant the patient will screen positive for a diagnosis of bipolar I.

It is likely that in the general population this measure could lead to further increases in the bipolar disorder diagnosis since the criteria for these six questions would be remarkably easy to meet.

For instance ask anyone you know: “Have you ever felt happier than usual for one week?” or “Have you ever slept less than usual for a week?”

What’s the Harm of Screening?

Screening is a debated procedure even for many physical illnesses. For instance screening for cancer can help detect the illness before a person experiences symptoms but it also leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Low-risk abnormalities (which might never turn dangerous) may end up being treated with procedures like chemotherapy which are themselves harmful to the body. In some cases it is unclear whether the benefit exceeds the risk.

The risk/benefit ratio is even more unclear in psychiatric diagnoses. In fact there has not been a single study that provides direct evidence of a benefit for screening for psychiatric disorders.

In 2016 I was part of a research team that investigated the evidence for screening for psychiatric disorders. Guidelines from the US had very different opinions from guidelines from Canada and the UK on when screening would be helpful—and even whether there was any evidence for it.

We found that the US guidelines promoted screening for alcohol misuse adolescent depression adult depression and intimate partner violence—but the Canadian and UK guidelines did not.

Why the discrepancy? The US guidelines pointed to indirect evidence—particularly studies that showed that screening could be implemented but didn’t appropriately compare outcomes or studies that provided extra care to the screened group but not the non-screened group (that is these studies didn’t compare “apples to apples”).

In contrast the Canadian and UK guidelines looked for direct evidence. They found that there was not one study focused on any of these issues that directly compared screening to non-screening and found better outcomes.

We were able to find six studies that compared screening to non-screening in an appropriate fashion. Five of those studies found no statistically significant benefit to screening. The final study reported ambiguous results that also didn’t strongly support benefit.

Screening for depression specifically has long been lambasted in the research literature as useless at best and dangerous at worst:

What Happens in the Real World?

But sometimes the data from clinical trials and meta-analyses don’t tell the full story. Doctors may dismiss this data preferring to rely on “clinical judgment” to do their job. So what happens in the real world?

A new article by trauma survivor Anna Austin published in JAMA Internal Medicine may help tell that story. She explains how she has answered “yes” on the trauma screening she’s given every time she seeks medical care—and how she has never received any follow-up or even acknowledgment of that disclosure.

She describes the feelings of shame that accompany trauma and how this can be exacerbated when disclosure is ignored especially repeatedly and especially by someone in a helping profession. She describes how she was left questioning whether she should ever disclose something like this and whether her medical professionals even cared.

“Questions about traumatic experiences are deeply personal” she writes. “And while perhaps well intentioned asking patients to disclose potentially painful and distressing experiences with no follow-up can cause more harm. A key tenet of public health and medical ethics is that screening without readily available and accessible evidence-based interventions let alone a compassionate conversation is unethical.”

The Human Cost

As demonstrated by Anna Austin’s experience there is a real-world human cost to people exposed to screening. Screening for trauma can leave a person feeling worse than if they had never disclosed it.

But another harm of screening is overtreatment and the Rapid Mood Screener (RMS) for bipolar disorder is the quintessential example of such harm. People who are taking antidepressants for mild depression or anxiety may experience adverse effects of these drugs such as (hypo)mania. Research has demonstrated that a person taking antidepressants is three times as likely to experience mania after taking the drug.

And the RMS “screening” tool makes it very easy for someone experiencing that side effect to now be given the much more serious diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

So what happens then? The person’s life may be upended. They will likely be told they have a lifelong chronic illness. They may be prescribed lithium or—just as likely—an antipsychotic such as those marketed by AbbVie/Allergan. These drugs have many adverse effects which could negatively impact their physical and mental health.

Common side effects of lithium include headache nausea tremors dizziness and drowsiness—and the person must be monitored for lithium toxicity which is deadly if not treated immediately. Common side effects of antipsychotics include drowsiness dizziness nausea seizures and tardive dyskinesia as well as adverse effects on heart health and metabolism problems that can lead to extreme weight gain and diabetes. Antipsychotics have also been found to shrink brain volumes.

Such is the potential for harm. And in terms of the use of the RMS this turn in a person’s life could all be due to a side effect of a drug they were on for a milder condition—a side effect that could have been resolved just by tapering off the antidepressant. But instead with the use of this bipolar “screening tool” they end up with a more serious diagnosis on more drugs and experiencing all the harms of those drugs too.

So think about it. Have you ever been especially happy for a week? Have you ever had trouble sleeping for a week? If you tell your doctor you just might end up diagnosed with bipolar disorder.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ACN,Accenture,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS9lbnRlcnByaXNlLXN0b3J5LzIwMjEvMDYvYWNjZW50dXJlLWJ1bGxpc2gtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdXBw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stories about startups & entrepreneurships,"Equity brokerages and analysts in India routinely track Accenture's quarterly results for a bunch of reasons. The $44-billion technology consulting firm is the industry bellwether in global IT services.





Two its latest financial quarter showed momentum in billings and revenue particularly outsourcing revenue. In Accenture's third quarter ended 31 May 2021 its outsourcing revenue breached the $6-billion mark up from an average of $5.2 billion in the preceding four quarters. This augurs well for Indian IT firms that generate revenue from outsourcing or offshore delivery.





And three Accenture is seen as a strong indicator of how the global technology-services market is shaping and where it's headed. In February Accenture’s management said its revenue growth returned to the pre-COVID level a quarter ahead of expectations. And its hunger just hasn't waned.





When Accenture began its financial year on 1 September 2020 it had earmarked $2 billion for M&A. That is expected to touch $4 billion when it concludes the financial year in August. It has made 39 acquisitions so far compared to 34 in 2019-20.

Recently it announced three acquisitions in a week. On June 18 Accenture acquired Exton Consulting a banking and insurance technology outfit in Paris. Four days before that it had announced the buyout of DI Square a software services firm in PLM (product lifecycle management) and ALM (application lifecycle management).





Accenture had also agreed to acquire umlaut an engineering consulting firm in Germany with clientele in automotive aerospace and defence telecommunications and energy and utilities. Umlaut is a billion-dollar deal which will get closed in 2022.

So how is the market shaping?

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet is bullish on the digitisation opportunity in manufacturing and product engineering. In the pre-pandemic era manufacturing enterprises weren't as fast to digitise as financial services and retail sectors. Accenture has a group called ‘Industry X’ that combines data and digital capabilities with engineering to help clients transform factories and plants.

Both umlaut (4200 engineers and consultants) and DI Square (70) will join Accenture’s Industry X group. DI Square takes Accenture deeper into automotive and manufacturing clients in Japan and other markets while Umlaut's workforce is spread across 17 countries.





“COVID-19 has accelerated the need for companies to transform these core operations and umlaut’s highly-specialised engineering services will enhance our ability to meet the accelerating demand” Sweet said in a press statement to announce the acquisition.





In March Sweet had explained the rationale driving Industry X to equity analysts pointing to its strong double-digit growth. ""It is also driven by the need to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of manufacturing facilities and the ability to interconnect machines and operate remotely"" she said. Since 2017 Accenture has made more than 20 buyouts to build its Industry X capabilities.





In June she cited an Industry X project with a global automaker to execute online remote software updates for in-car computer systems. It allows seamless deployment of new software versions. In another Industry X engagement with a large electric company in Japan Accenture is digitising their operations and standards across each department of the power plants.





Its Industry X acquisitions include operations technology provider Electro 80 in Australia industrial robotics and automation services provider Pollux in Brazil operations consultancy Myrtle in the US and technology consultancy SALT Solutions in Germany.





For large Indian IT firms like TCS and Infosys manufacturing has been a weak spot. Both derive a bulk of their revenue from banking and financial services and retail. If Industry X is anything to go by product-engineering opportunities will open up in manufacturing communications as well as energy and utilities industries.





As Sweet told analysts in February “We’re at this amazing tipping point right now where we’re seeing an acceleration of digitisation in manufacturing and product engineering.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you’re using Photoshop Sketch and Illustrator Draw Adobe encourages you to enjoy the powerful comprehensive drawing and painting tools inside Adobe Fresco.”

This means that instead of having to maintain multiple apps that share similar functionality users can just move over to Fresco instead. The app will be removed from the App Store and Play Store on the 19th of July but users are free to continue using it. The app will officially no longer be supported on the 10th of January 2022 but you probably can keep using it after that as long as it works.

In the meantime those who are interested can download Adobe Fresco for free from their respective app stores but there are also additional premium features that can be unlocked for $9.99.

Wouldn't the world be great if we could all just work together? Enemies could be allies foes could be friends. Lenovo's Legion 5 Pro proves what's possible when two opposing forces come together for the greater good. Those forces are AMD and Nvidia and the greater good is the gaming community. Armed with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800 CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 graphics the Legion 5 Pro gives gamers the power they need to run the latest AAA titles at Ultra graphics settings.

Stellar performance doesn't tell the full tale. Seemingly inspired by its business-focused ThinkPad relatives the Legion 5 Pro flaunts one of the best keyboards I've ever used. Paired with a comfortable typing experience is a bright and vivid 16-inch display a generous selection of ports and decent battery life. Best of all the Legion 5 Pro is priced aggressively at $1529. The laptop's bland and thick chassis means it won't satisfy mobile gamers but for everyone else the Legion 5 Pro is among the best gaming laptops available today.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro price and configuration options

Pricing varies depending on the retailer. For $1529 (at Walmart) our review unit comes with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU 16GB of RAM a 512GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 GPU with 8GB of vRAM.

Lenovo's website has some odd pricing schemes. For $1699 you can get the Legion 5 Pro with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU 16GB of RAM a ""1TB SSD + 1TB SSD"" and an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU with 6GB of vRAM. There is also a $1959 edition with the same specs but an RTX 3070 GPU. Lastly there is a 32GB of RAM model with an RTX 3070 but the price is not set.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro design

Simple and straightforward the Legion 5 Pro strips the chassis down to the essentials and lets you focus on what matters.

The Legion 5 Pro isn't an attractive laptop but what it trades in beauty is gained in utility. The generic chassis has a bland gray color and the only regalia is an illuminated Y-shaped Legion logo centered on the aluminum lid. An RGB glow on the four-zone keyboard gives a pleasing light show but this isn't the same fireworks display you get from per-key RGB lighting. Centered on the deck is an LED-illuminated power button and Lenovo's customary T-shirt-tag branding hides discreetly on the palm rest and rear spine.

Practical if not pretty the Legion 5 Pro flaunts thin display bezels that keep your eyes focused on gameplay and boasts a large keyboard and trackpad to ensure you bring down your enemies before they get the better of you. Everyday conveniences include a lip on the front edge for easily opening the lid with one finger and a webcam kill switch to ensure your privacy.

Flip the laptop over and you'll spot large rubber bumpers providing plenty of clearance so air can flow freely once pushed outward by the quad vents. Those giant fans flank the I/O on each end of the Legion 5 Pro's spine making the rear of the laptop reminiscent of a DeLorean.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The Legion 5 Pro feels robust — and its hefty weight is only partially to blame. The dual hinges are stiff and there is certain rigidity to the construction. Oh about the weight. At 5.4 pounds and 14 x 10.4 x 1.1 inches the Legion 5 Pro is heavier than the Razer Blade 15 Base Edition (4.6 pounds 14 x 9.3 x 0.8 inches) but weighs less than the Acer Predator Helios 300 (5.5 pounds 14.3 x 10 x 0.9 inches) and the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (6.6 pounds 13.9 x 10.2 x 1 inches).

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro ports

Left right and center various ports lining the Legion 5 Pro let you connect peripherals and enjoy the fastest internet speeds.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

On the left side is a USB 3.2 Type-C input for power delivery and data transfer alongside a headphone/mic jack. Move to the right side and you'll find a convenient USB 3.2 Type-A port for connecting wired peripherals.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Most ports reside on the spine. There you can access an RJ-45 Ethernet jack another USB 3.2 Type-C port (with Power Delivery) three additional USB 3.2 Type-A inputs an HDMI 2.1 and Lenovo's proprietary power input.

This being an AMD-powered notebook the Legion 5 Pro lacks Thunderbolt 4 support for the quickest transfer speeds and connections to multiple 4K monitors. If you need more ports see our best USB Type-C hubs and best laptop docking stations pages.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro display

It turns out 16 is the new 15 — I don't mean age I'm talking about display sizes. The adoption of thin display bezels across the industry is disrupting norms; now 16-inch panels fit in 15.6-inch frames giving users a larger more engrossing canvas for watching movies. Or in the case of the Legion 5 Pro sniping an enemy across the map when playing an FPS.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Digging into the specs the Legion 5 Pro has a 16-inch 2560 x 1600-pixel IPS display with a 165Hz refresh rate and 16:10 aspect ratio. The panel sounds great on paper and passed the eye test when I watched a trailer for Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Watching the clip on the Legion got me excited for this action movie; colors were vibrant and the bright matte panel effectively squashed reflections. The screen was detailed enough for me to see individual threads in the ninja-yoroi (ninja outfit) as well as water droplets hovering in the air of a dojo. Colors didn't pop off the screen in part because of the matte finish but hues looked natural and vivid enough.

The vibrant panel made my elven outfit in Middle-earth: Shadow of War appear as if it were constructed of precious stone and rare fabric. My golden chest plate glistened as the rain gave way to sunlight and the teal accents in my tunic popped against the olive green base layer. I'm not usually one for gore but there was something satisfying about seeing bright red pools left behind after a merciless battle against the slave-owning Uruk-hai.

According to our colorimeter the Legion 5 Pro's display covers 82% of the DCI-P3 color gamut  making it more vivid than those on the Predator Helios 300 (74%) the ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (77%) and the category average (67%). Only the Blade 15 Base Model (87%) has a more impressive panel in this price range.

Capable of reaching 472 nits of brightness  the Legion 5 Pro outshone its competitors including the Predator Helios 300 (283 nits) ROG Strix G15 (280 nits) Blade 15 Base (271 nits) and the category average (287 nits).

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro keyboard and touchpad

Close your eyes and you might guess this keyboard belongs to a ThinkPad . It has that oh-so-satisfying tactile bump that rewards your digits for completing a full keypress. Lenovo calls this the TrueStrike keyboard and it gives gamers deep key travel with 100% anti-ghosting support. The excellent actuation was achieved by increasing the aperture of each key in the baseplate for a larger area of shock absorption.

There are a few other highlights with this keyboard though they feel somewhat half-baked. The first is optional RGB lighting that is limited to four zones; per-key illumination would have provided the spectacle that's lacking from the Legion 5 Pro design. The other feature is a full numpad crammed into the right side of the keyboard. It's a useful perk for quickly typing numbers but the keys are so small that I only had room for one-finger typing instead of putting three fingers on the 4 5 and 6 keys.

I typed at 116 words per minute with a 94% accuracy on the 10fastfingers.com typing test outpacing my usual 109-wpm with a 5% error rate.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The 4.7 x 3-inch touchpad is large and responsive. My fingers glided across the smooth surface as I scrolled through web pages while a subtle texture gave my fingertips slight feedback. Executing Windows 10 gestures was a cinch; two-finger swipes to zoom in and out and three-finger movements to change programs were instant.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro audio

Dual speakers flanking the Legion 5 Pro's deck produce balanced sound but lack presence. Listening to Poolside's ""Can't Stop Your Lovin'"" the vocals were recessed revealing the drawbacks of the speaker's bottom-firing orientation. It's a shame because the drivers get loud enough to fill a large room and never showed signs of distorting even at the loudest volume. Better yet the fun bass thud the Legion 5 Pro output made my heel instinctively tap the floor with every drum hit.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The speakers adequately captured the sounds of J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy universe when I played Middle-earth: Shadow of War. My sword made a satisfying slicing ""chink"" when I buried into the shoulder of a foe and there was enough detail for me to hear my bowstring tightening as I locked on to a nasty orc. Most importantly turning the volume to 80% drowned out the loud fan hiss.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro gaming graphics and VR

Equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 GPU with 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM  the Legion 5 Pro has no problems playing the latest games at high frame rates even when set to Ultra graphics settings. In fact I played Middle-earth: Shadow of War at a steady 80 frames per second. It never dropped below 70 fps even during an action-packed fight against two dozen Orcs.

In our benchmarks the Legion 5 Pro played Assassin's Creed Odyssey (1080p) at 64 fps topping the ROG Strix G15 (49 fps) and matching the Razer Blade 15 Base Edition (64 fps). Only the Predator Helios 300 (68 fps) beat the Lenovo which also surpassed the 51-fps average.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Action-adventure fans will appreciate the 80 fps the Legion 5 Pro hit on the Shadow of the Tomb Raider (1080p) benchmark. It falls below what the Predator Helios (86 fps) and ROG Strix G15 (88 fps) achieved but ran smoother than the Blade 15 (78 fps) and the average (62 fps).

The Legion 5 Pro stumbled on the Grand Theft Auto V (1080p Very high) benchmark playing the game at 84 fps several frames below the Predator Helios 300 (103 fps) ROG Strix G15 (98 fps) and the Blade 15 Base Model (96 fps). It did breach the 72-fps average.

You can saddle up in Red Dead Redemption 2 because the Legion 5 Pro played the critically acclaimed western at 66 fps a notch below the Predator Helios 300 (69 fps) and ROG Strix (70 fps) but ahead of the Blade 15 (64 fps) and the average (50 fps).

And finally in anticipation of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands the Legion 5 Pro ran Borderlands 3 at 80 fps. This time it took the first place prize ahead of the Predator Helios 300 (77 fps) ROG Strix G15 (79 fps) Blade 15 Base (67 fps) and the average (57 fps).

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro performance

Armed with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and 16GB of RAM  the Legion 5 Pro demonstrates the mouthwatering potential of AMD's new 5000-series chips.

I did all I could to find the upper limits of the Legion 5 Pro's performance but every task I ran was chewed up and spat right back out. I loaded 32 Microsoft Edge tabs four of which played 1080p YouTube videos and a pair were streaming Twitch . With those going in the background the Legion 5 Pro instantly loaded my favorite websites. I then streamed the Denmark vs. Belgium Euro 2020 match as my last trick but the Legion stifled even that attempt to slow it down.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Continuing the trend set by other AMD-powered laptops the Legion 5 Pro aced our performance benchmarks. Starting with the Geekbench 5.4 overall performance test the Legion 5 Pro scored a 7342 taking down the Predator Helios 300 (6257 Intel Core i7-10750H) Blade 15 (Intel Core i7-10750H 5564) and the mainstream gaming laptop average (5263). It took the ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition with a Ryzen 9 5900HX (7746) to stop it in its tracks.

We saw similar results in our video transcoding test. The Legion 5 Pro converted a 4K video to 1080p resolution using the Handbrake app in just 7 minutes and 6 seconds. Its Intel-powered rivals the Predator Helios 300 (9:18) and Blade 15 (10:57) needed more time. Again the ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (6:57) got the better of the Lenovo.

Tired of being second best the Legion 5 Pro with its 512GB PCIe SSD  sped past the others in our storage test by duplicating 25GB of multimedia files in 32 seconds for an 832.7 megabytes per second transfer rate. The Predator Helios 300 (544 MBps) ROG Strix G15 (340.7 MBps 1TB NVMe SSD) and Blade 15 (602 MBps 512GB SSD) lagged behind.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro battery life

It may not break any records but the Legion 5 Pro enduring for 6 hours and 16 minutes on the Laptop Mag battery life deserves subdued applause and finger snaps — just not a roaring cheer.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

In comparison the ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition flexed the efficiency of its AMD CPU better by lasting for 10 hours and 14 minutes on a charge. The Legion 5 Pro did at least top the Predator Helios 300 (4:40) and Razer Blade 15 (4:36). A slightly larger battery and it might have reached the 6:29 average.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro webcam

""It's a good thing I have a microfiber cloth on hand because this webcam is smudgy"" I foolishly thought as I stared at the blurry photo I'd just snapped on the Legion 5 Pro. Wait a second. Why isn't the image quality improving as I wipe the lens? The answer is not one you want to hear — it's because the 720p webcam just isn't good. My face looked like an impressionist painting my smeared skin appearing smoother than any expensive cream could ever get it to look. Also my dark green shirt was an unpleasant olive — as if it were the first shirt issued to me after joining the Army.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro heat

Uh oh the Legion 5 Pro has a toasty rear-end despite flaunting quad exhaust vents. Even in our non-gaming test (playing a 15-minute 1080p video) the underside hit 103 degrees Fahrenheit above our 95-degree comfort threshold. When we gamed on the notebook for 15 minutes that same location reached a concerning temperature of 132 degrees.

Thankfully your fingers will be mercifully spared from the excess heat as the touchpad and keyboard maintained 79 degrees and 94 degrees respectively on the video test. When gaming the touchpad was even cooler at 74 degrees but the keyboard jumped to 102 degrees.

Lenovo Legion 5 Pro software and warranty

Lenovo Vantage is the go-to software for tinkering with performance cooling and optimizing apps. It's a beautiful program with large graphics and an easy-to-use interface. You're immediately shown CPU GPU and vRAM performance along with remaining storage space. From there you can adjust thermal modes or enable Network Boost Auto Close or Hybrid Mode (use both integrated and discrete graphics) among other settings.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

You can also use Vantage to perform a hardware scan and within the app are tools for system updates key macros lighting profiles power management. Also installed on the Legion 5 Pro are Radeon graphics software and two Nahimic apps for altering the sound. Lastly an X-Rite Color Assistant for switching between display profiles.

Lenovo shops the Legion 5 Pro with a one-year warranty. See how Lenovo fared on our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands special reports.

Bottom line

From ThinkPads to Yogas Lenovo has earned a reputation for making quality laptops. It's why the company sells more notebooks than any other brand. However gaming is one segment where Lenovo lags behind some of its rivals. The Legion 5 Pro has convinced me that it could change that. Yes the design is bland but Lenovo's other wildly popular products are successful because they address function before form — much like the Legion 5 Pro.

What it lacks in flashy aesthetics it makes up for with a gorgeous 16-inch QHD display an exceptional keyboard and touchpad plenty of ports and outstanding performance from the one-two punch of an AMD CPU and Nvidia GPU. And despite harnessing so much power the Legion 5 Pro delivers respectable battery life.

The Legion does get a yellow card caution for some warm temps under a heavy load and it's a hefty rig compared to sleeker rivals. If you're looking for something more travel-friendly consider the 4.2-pound Asus ROG Zephyrus G15. Otherwise the Legion 5 Pro is an excellent option for gamers who want the best performance for the price.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ob2xseW9ha3Mtc3Rhci10YW1hcmEtd2FsbC1jYWxscy0xNjIxMDA1MzkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hollyoaks star Tamara Wall calls for Esther Bloom to return,"Hollyoaks spoilers follow.

Hollyoaks star Tamara Wall has revealed she would like a former fan favourite character to return.

The actress has admitted that her character Grace Black hasn't really retained many female friends but one she did have was Esther Bloom – though Esther left the village back in 2018 to move to Spain.

Tamara has now called for Esther to return as she was ""the last great friend Grace had"" even though it seems that Grace is getting close to someone else.

""I love that Grace and Martine are getting so close"" Tamara told Inside Soap. ""Grace always has a man around yet she rarely has any girlfriends.

""And I'm really hoping that friendship carries on because it's so nice and unexpected – especially with their big personalities.

""To be honest I'm always rooting for Esther to return she was the last great friend Grace had.""

She added: ""Maybe I'll give Jazz [Franks who played Esther] a call and ask when she's coming back.""

It looks like Grace really does need a friend at the moment with all the problems she is having with Fergus Collins.

Fergus (Robert Beck) has orchestrated Grace's downfall by causing the sign to fall on Darren Osborne outside of the club then tricking her into signing over control of The Loft.

Digitimes reports that the company will build its first wafer fabrication manufacturing company in Wuhan Hubei Province. According to the report the company is expected to start production in stages from next year.

Sources say that this factory initially used to produce optical communication Kirin chips and modules to gain self-sufficiency and keep a good quantity of required chipsets.

Digitimes further claims that this factory will be used to produce optical communication chips and modules to gain self-sufficiency and create microcircuit designs.

Huawei is yet to make any official announcement or confirmation on the HiSilicon factory in Wuhan.

HiSilicon Huawei’s chip designing subsidiary has the capability to design advanced chip designs.

And while Huawei is best known for its telecom equipment dominance currently the company’s Wuhan-based Research Institute has nearly 100000 R&D personnel that mainly research and develop optical communication equipment HiSilicon chips and even automotive laser radars.

In fact HiSilicon might be the only company in China that has the ability to develop a coherent optical DSP chipset. The applications for optical chips will range from electronic vehicles to autonomous driving to advanced identification process.

In the proposed plan Huawei will back the Wuhan HiSilicon factory project with a total of 1.8 billion yuan investment.

Currently Huawei’s Wuhan-based Research Institute has nearly 100000 research and development personnel that mainly researching and developing optical communication equipment HiSilicon chips and automotive laser radars. Credit: Handout.

It’s mission: develop its own chipset for 5G and IoT devices.

And how is that possible with China trailing Taiwan and South Korea in advanced chipset design?

According to an industry insider who spoke to Asia Times you don’t need to put a 5nm chip into a laptop because processing is moving back to the center with rapid emergence of 5G.

The key is fast communications which means the Chromebook idea could dominate the market in the future.

“You can set up massive parallel processing arrays with 14-28 nm chips that are as fast as you want and the laptop is simply a dumb terminal for this central processor” the insider said.

“The importance of the superfast narrow gateway chips is exaggerated. China can now or soon will be able to produce all the 14-28nm chips it needs — and that’s 98-99% of the total market.”

China’s 30-year-long semiconductor journey has grown into a major player accounting for nearly 13% of the global IC design market in 2020.

Amid the continuing trade and tech standoff with the US China has been speeding up the development of domestic fabrication plants to localize the most vital elements of the technology supply chain.

In that IC assembly line a lithography machine is fundamental to the entire manufacturing chain.

China’s “national champion” in the area Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) which was founded in 2002 by Shanghai Electric Group is per some reports full speed ahead to develop its second-generation deep ultraviolet (DUV) immersion lithography system which could produce down to 7nm chips with multiple patterning.

In 2002 a lithography machine technology research project was first included in China’s National High-tech R&D Program (863 Program). SMEE was founded in the same year.

Its research in the area continued in the “02 Special Project” along with other 15 National Special Projects published in the National Outlines for Medium and Long-term Planning for Scientific and Technological Development (2006-2020) in 2006.

The 02 Special Project focuses on the extensive circuit integration and peripheral equipment manufacturing where developing a home-grown lithography machine supply chain was one of the critical tasks.

Since the project was launched SMEE has gradually become the primary designer and the “integrator” of a plethora of made-in-China lithography equipment components.

By no means is this a magic carpet ride — China’s chip industry still faces massive challenges and fierce competition.

But to date SMEE has developed 4 series of lithography machines for IC front-end manufacturing IC back-end advanced packaging LED/ MEMS /power devices and TFT circuit manufacturing.

Hundreds of economists at leading universities live a double life: By day they conduct research teach classes and rub padded elbows at academic conferences. But by night they moonlight as analytic mercenaries helping to tear down—or defend—the world’s biggest monopolies. These academics work for economic consulting firms and few firms are as feared and revered as 44-year-old Compass Lexecon headquartered in Washington DC.

In legal jurisdictions from the US to the EU to China the outcome of anti-monopoly lawsuits and merger reviews hinges on hard-to-answer economic questions: How much of the relevant market does a company control? What is the relevant market anyway? If two companies combine will their customers wind up paying higher prices?

Private businesses and government regulators hire Compass Lexecon to answer those questions. The firm has scores of top-flight economists on hand who can create economic models to prove whichever version of reality its clients need to prove. (“They can testify that the world is flat or round” former US Federal Trade Commission chairman William Kovacic says of economic consultants in general.) Sometimes consulting firms work for both sides of a legal dispute presenting opposite arguments for each client. The economists also serve as expert witnesses breaking down complicated economic ideas for judges and juries during antitrust trials.

Compass Lexecon says on its website that it “has evaluated thousands of proposed mergers and acquisitions across virtually every industry on behalf of both private parties and government agencies” in addition to weighing in on four decades of antitrust lawsuits. Over the years the firm has consulted for tech giants like Huawei Motorola IBM and NVIDIA telecom giants like Sprint AT&T and Verizon automakers like GM and Fiat Chrysler airlines like American and Southwest pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer and GSK publishers like Hearst insurers like Anthem and dozens of regulatory bodies that target dominant companies like these.

Ironically economic consultancies present problems for antitrust enforcement. Their high fees drive up the costs of bringing cases to trial and over time they’ve convinced lawyers judges and regulators to consider ever more complicated economic models as evidence.

“They have pushed the system in the direction of more complex analysis” says Kovacic. “As you make the system more complex you tend to favor defendants—especially big defendants.” Dominant companies after all can afford the consulting fees while cash-strapped enforcement agencies have to make triage decisions about which cases to prioritize.

The history of Compass Lexecon

1977: Consulting firm “Lexecon” is founded by University of Chicago law professor Richard Posner and two colleagues. Posner is one of the leading figures in the “Chicago School” of legal thought which pushed American courts to consider antitrust cases narrowly on the basis of the impact to consumer prices. “Lexecon” is a mashup of lex the Latin word for law and “econ.”

1978: Lexecon gets its first big break: AT&T hires Posner to consult on its defense in a federal antitrust lawsuit that ends in the court-ordered breakup of AT&T.

1981: US president Ronald Reagan appoints William Baxter a prominent “Chicago School” law professor as attorney general. He helps usher in a new era of antitrust enforcement. Business begins to boom for economic consultants who build models (for the prosecution or defense) that quantify the impact dominant companies have on consumer prices.

1998: Nextera Enterprises a company owned by “junk bond king” Michael Milken acquires Lexecon for $60 million.

2003: FTI Consulting acquires Lexecon for $130 million.

2006: FTI Consulting acquires another antitrust consultant firm Competition Policy Associates and merges it with Lexecon to form Compass Lexecon.

An army of antitrust consultants

FTI keeps growing the number of economic consultants in its eponymous division which is dominated by Compass Lexecon.

Even so US merger enforcement has remained relatively flat over the past decade: New presidential administrations tend to take it easy in year one and ramp up by the end of each term.

How much it costs to hire Compass Lexecon

$599 million: Revenue generated by FTI’s economic consulting division in 2020

175: PhD-credentialed consultants employed by Compass Lexecon

2: Nobel prize winners working for Compass Lexecon (University of Chicago economist James Heckman and New York University economist Robert Engle)

$494: Average hourly fee for a Compass Lexecon consultant (though top experts charge as much as $1350 per hour)

84: Fortune 100 companies that have hired Compass Lexecon

23: Compass Lexecon offices in 14 countries

The small world of antitrust consultants

The industry of antitrust consultants is itself highly concentrated: About half a dozen firms control the lion’s share of the market for expert witnesses and economic reports in antitrust cases and merger reviews.

Charles River Associates: Often listed alongside Compass Lexecon as the world’s top antitrust consulting firm CRA has a similar reach operating 22 offices in 10 countries.

National Economic Research Associates: Founded in 1961 NERA is the oldest consulting firm that specializes in using economic models to support antitrust litigation.

Bates White: With one office in Washington DC Bates White focuses primarily on US antitrust cases but has an international network of consultants spread across the globe.

Analysis Group: This Boston-based firm has offices in North America Europe and Asia and in the past year has represented firms like Qualcomm and GSK in antitrust cases.

Cornerstone Research: Based in San Francisco Cornerstone most memorably consulted on the mega-merger between Sprint and T-Mobile.

Berkeley Research Group: The youngest entrant on the list BRG was founded in 2010 but has quickly ballooned to 45 offices in 17 countries.

What it takes to be an economic consultant

“It’s a pretty rare skill set to be able to have both very good qualifications substantively in economics…and also to have the skills to sit in the stand and testify and explain it in plain English. Not everybody can do that. And the people that can do it can charge pretty good fees.” —Janelle Wrigley former FTC prosecutor

It takes a particular person to become a $1000-an-hour economic consultant. And it helps if you look and act the part of a pointy-headed tweed-bound professor.

ProPublica describes Dennis Carlton a University of Chicago economist and leading Compass Lexecon consultant—who has raked in about $100 million in fees over the course of his career—as being self-effacing with small bespectacled eyes a habit of speaking in a slow nasal voice and an overall demeanor that’s about “as intimidating as a high school guidance counselor.” And yet “his calm unassuming demeanor even under intense cross-examination makes him the perfect champion for his corporate clients.”

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Cooperman’s history and hedge fund performance go directly to Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 5 Stocks.

The hedge fund manager and American billionaire investor Leon Cooperman recently stated in an interview that the stock market will be down from a year from now amid rising inflation increasing taxes along with prospects for an interest rate hike. Though Omega Advisors chairman doesn’t see any immediate downside risk he still believes the long-term US economic outlook is not favorable as the world’s largest economy is pulling the demand forward. He says that the recent stock market rally was supported by sentiments that the economy will rebound but he is concerned that how long stocks could move higher on recovery projections. He is also worried about the rising government debt levels as well as the strategy of supporting the labor market through multi-trillion dollar stimulus packages.

""If you spoke to a hundred economists today and he asked them what their view is of the potential real growth of the US economy the response would be centered on 2%"" Cooperman said. ""We're growing this year four to five times potential yet the Fed is persistent in keeping interest rates at near zero. That doesn't make any great sense to me. It's just pushing people out on the risk curve.""

He is also showing concerns over the rising inflation with the expectation that the inflation number will move well over Fed’s expectations.

""I think that Mr. Powell will be surprised by inflation. It's not going to be as quiescent and transitory as he thinks. I think the Fed will be forced to say something before the end of 2022"" Cooperman said.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman who worked for Goldman Sachs for 25 years remained busy last year in adjusting his portfolio to cope with rapidly changing market dynamics. He significantly expanded his focus towards financial stocks since the beginning of last year. As of the end of the first quarter financial stocks accounted for more than 40% of $1.6 billion worth of Leon Cooperman’s 13F stock portfolio up significantly from 17.88% of portfolio weighting at the end of 2019. Interestingly instead of chasing big banking stocks the billionaire investor invested heavily in small and mid-cap loan and mortgage companies. In the past couple of quarters he also expressed confidence in business acquisition and development companies.

Story continues

Leon Cooperman who sits on a net worth of around $3.2 billion believes in the portfolio diversification strategy instead of a concentrated portfolio. He has well-diversified his stock portfolio towards value and growth stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Microsoft and Alphabet Inc may seem like growth stocks because of their growth rates but we actually classify especially Alphabet Inc as a value play because of its huge discount compared to sum of its parts as well as its peer's P/S multiples. The billionaire investor is also seeking to take advantage of the booming information technology communications and consumer discretionary sectors. Furthermore Leon Cooperman invested millions of dollars in real estate and energy stocks to capitalize on the economic recovery period. At the end of the first quarter the real estate sector represented 7.26% of the entire Leon Cooperman's portfolio while energy stocks weighted around 8.96%.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman grew up in a Jewish family in New York City after immigration from Poland. After completing his MBA degree from Columbia Business School in 1967 he joined Goldman Sachs and spent 22 years in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989 he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. He also headed GS Capital Growth Fund for more than 1 year. After retiring from Goldman Sachs he founded Omega Advisors and converted it into a family office fund in 2016.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 10 Stocks

While Leon Cooperman’s reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy more than 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 206.8% since then and beat the SPY's 91% gain.

Despite several portfolio adjustments billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about few stocks that he believes would perform well in 2021. Let start digging into 10 stocks billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about:

10. Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $51744000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.22% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25

Leon Cooperman has been holding a position in Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) since 2017 amid its strong dividend yield and steady share price upside potential. During the first quarter of 2021 Omega Advisors raised its stake in ET by 4% to 6.73 million shares valued at around $51.7 million. Shares of Energy Transfer LP rallied close to 90% since the beginning of this year thanks to improving energy prices and economic reopening. The company offers a dividend yield of 5.61% with a current quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.

Energy Transfer L.P. was in 25 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2020 flat compared to the previous quarter. The all-time high for this statistic is 36.

9. Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $55990000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.49% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12

Leon Cooperman left his position unchanged in specialty materials company Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) in the first quarter of 2020. Fortunately shares of Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) saw a stunning share price rally of almost 50% so far this year driven by economic reopening. Furthermore reports are showing that Ferro to be acquired by Prince International in a $2.1B deal.

Ferro Corporation was in 12 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021 flat compared to the previous quarter. The all-time high for this statistic is 28.

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $57930000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.61% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 251

The tech giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is among the long-running stock holding of Omega Advisors. The firm first initiated a position in MSFT in 2015. At the end of the first quarter of 2021 Leon Cooperman held 245705 shares of Microsoft accounting for 3.61% of the overall portfolio. Shares of the tech giant are up 13% year to date followed by robust appreciation in the previous years. Moreover the company has the potential to offer double-digit dividend increase to investors.

ClearBridge Investments an investment management firm mentioned a few stocks including Microsoft Corporation in the first quarter investor letter. Here is what ClearBridge Investments stated:

“We also made adjustments to the portfolio’s top 10 holdings to increase the participation of select stocks. The FAANGs and Microsoft delivered mixed results during the quarter and we continue to be mindful of our weighting to these mega cap growth stocks to ensure they are not limiting our ability to add diversity through new ideas. Our repositioning has been encouraging so far with the portfolio performing better on up days in the market while maintaining good down capture during more turbulent sessions.”

7. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $68174000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 4.25% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52

Billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about the oil exploration and production company Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN). He initiated a big position in Devon Energy during the first quarter by purchasing 3.12 million shares valued at around $68.17 million accounting for 4.25% of the entire portfolio. In the past couple of quarters Devon Energy's stock price benefited from an improvement in oil prices. Its shares are up almost 95% since the beginning of this year. Devon’s dividend yield is close to 1.50%.

GoodHaven Capital Management a concentrated portfolio investment management firm highlighted a few stocks including Devon Energy in the first quarter investor letter. Here is what GoodHaven Capital Management stated:

“After a rough start to the year our two biggest energy holdings – WPX Energy rebounded materially in the last six months though energy was still our biggest detractor for the year. I’ve previously written about deciding earlier this year to direct new capital towards better businesses versus adding more to the energy sector but given the material optionality at WPX we opted to maintain a material exposure. Recently WPX announced an all stock merger with a larger competitor – Devon Energy – which will leave the new company with plenty of cash flow at lower oil prices less leverage and material upside to higher commodity prices.”

6. Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ASH)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $71190000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 4.44% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36

Specialty chemical solutions Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ASH) is among the long-running stock holding of Omega Advisors. Billionaire Leon Cooperman left his position unchanged in Ashland during the first quarter. His firm held 801965 shares valued at $71.1 million representing 4.44% of the overall portfolio.

Ashland Global Holdings investors should pay attention to a decrease in support from the world’s most elite money managers recently. Ashland Global was in 36 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021 compared to 38 positions in the previous quarter. The all-time high for this statistic is 46.

You have probably set foot on Interface products. The company based in Atlanta makes commercial flooring — carpet tiles lightly napped highly durable easily overlooked in the commercial offices and educational facilities where they are mostly in use. When Interface sent me samples of its newest product earlier this year at a glance they seemed banal familiar: These were the marled gray patterns that cover the floors of airport terminals corporate hallways and CVS pharmacies all over the world. How many miles had I walked on those carpets?

Yet in their very composition they were something new. This carpeting was a result of four years of intensive research and development according to Interface. It incorporated a material made from recycled vinyl and processed vegetation; it was infused with a latex created from smokestack exhaust. It was topped and tufted with salvaged nylon. And it had been manufactured in the least environmentally demanding way possible. By Interface’s reckoning the carpeting had a carbon footprint of negative 300 grams per square meter. “It’s not a magic material” Erin Meezan chief sustainability officer at Interface told me recently. But the math does have a magical quality to it: In part because of how the carbon is sourced carpeting a 10-feet-by-20-feet conference room say with these tiles can be seen as the equivalent of pulling roughly 12 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

For decades Interface has made most of its domestic carpets at a cluster of factories in LaGrange Ga. about an hour southwest of Atlanta. John Bradford its chief science-and-technology officer led me on a tour one afternoon as he explained the company’s reconfigured manufacturing processes. “We recycle every frigging thing” he said. His work goes far beyond recycling however. Interface requires a detailed accounting of the company’s renewable energy sources exhaust fumes supply chains and waste streams. Some of the immense machinery akin to blocklong newspaper presses where hot sheets of vinylized carpet filler are rolled out now runs at lower temperatures to save energy. A short distance away a recycling center the size of several gymnasiums was crowded with rows of fabric sacks overflowing with nylon filaments rescued from factory trimmings ready to be turned into the face cloth for new carpet. The noise was deafening as jumbo fabric shredders extruders hoppers and conveyors rumbled away. Things quieted down only when we visited the company’s design center: From floor to ceiling in aisles resembling a supermarket that sold color rather than food were huge spools of yarn all recycled in every conceivable hue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8yNy9jYXJib24tbmVnYXRpdmUtY2FyYm9uLW5ldXRyYWwtbWF0ZXJpYWxzLXJvdW5kdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ten materials that store carbon and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"As our carbon revolution series continued this week here are ten materials that store carbon including bioplastic cladding and mycelium insulation.

Sequestering carbon that has been removed from the atmosphere in buildings and products is a key way of tackling climate change.

This can be done by taking plant matter such as wood cork hemp and algae that has captured atmospheric carbon via photosynthesis and using it directly. Alternatively it can be turned into other materials that store carbon more permanently.

""What if everything we're surrounded with was removing emissions instead of releasing them?"" said Neema Shams of Made of Air which makes carbon-negative bioplastic from forest and agricultural waste.

The material is carbon-negative because it contains more carbon than was emitted during the material's manufacture and use.

""Climate change is a material problem""

""Climate change is really a material problem in that there's too much carbon in the atmosphere. So how come we can't turn that into our biggest resource?"" Shams told Dezeen in the interview conducted as part of the carbon revolution series.

Other products utilise carbon captured from factory chimneys and other industrial processes that emit greenhouse gases.

However such products cannot be considered carbon negative since they do not result in a net reduction in atmospheric carbon.

Dezeen's carbon revolution series explores how this miracle material could be removed from the atmosphere and put to use on earth.

Here are ten examples of carbon-storing materials from our archive.

Bioplastic

German brand Made of Air has developed a carbon-negative bioplastic that can be used in cars interiors and cladding.

The material contains biochar a carbon-rich substance made by burning biomass without oxygen which prevents the carbon from escaping as CO2.

""With biochar if you just left it on the ground and came back a thousand years later it would look exactly the same"" Shams said. ""Only if you were to burn it would that carbon be re-released.""

The bioplastic was recently used to clad a car dealership in Munich with the installation storing 14 tonnes of carbon according to Made of Air.

Mycelium insulation

Start-ups including London-based Biohm are using mycelium to create building insulation that is naturally fire-retardant and removes ""at least 16 tonnes of carbon per month"" from the atmosphere as it grows.

Mycelium a biomaterial that forms the root system of fungi feeds on agricultural waste and in the process sequesters the carbon that was stored in this biomass.

Sustainability expert David Cheshire described mycelium as ""part of the solution"" to making buildings carbon-negative.

""It's naturally fire retardant"" he told Dezeen. ""It's actually got better insulation properties than most standard insulation and it's actually sequestering carbon.""

Mycelium is fast-growing and cheap to produce in custom-made bioreactors. It can be grown in moulds to create usable products such as packaging and lamps.

It can also be turned into new materials including leather-like products such as Mylo. These in turn can be used to produce handbags and clothes.

Carpet tiles

American carpet-tile manufacturer Interface is aiming to make its entire product range carbon negative by 2040 starting with the Embodied Beauty and Flash Line carpets that were released this year.

They are constructed almost exclusively from recycled plastic and various biomaterials which the brand says store more embodied carbon than is emitted by the products in their production.

Interface describes the tiles as carbon-negative ""from cradle to gate"" meaning their lifecycle after they leave the factory is not taken into account.

""It's not carbon-negative for its full lifecycle because elements of transport and end-of-life use we can influence but we can't control at this stage"" Interface sustainability leader Jon Khoo told Dezeen.

""So we wanted to focus on going carbon negative with what we can control.""

Wood

A fully-grown tree can remove 22 kilograms of CO2 from the atmosphere over the course of a year meaning that the material is carbon negative as long as it is responsibly sourced and that the felled tree is compensated by new planting.

Any carbon stored in the wood needs to be weighed against the emissions generated during transport and processing and replacement trees need to be left growing long enough so they themselves can be harvested and turned into carbon-storing materials.

However one problem with wood is the tremendous amount of waste produced by the timber industry. Only part of each tree is used and processing timber generates significant amounts of offcuts and sawdust. In addition only around 10 per cent of timber is recycled.

""Just think about carving wood"" said sustainable-design guru Willian McDonough in an interview with Dezeen as part of carbon revolution. ""It's a negative process right? We're cutting away stuff all the time.""

3D-printed wood

Additive manufacturing company Forust has developed a way of turning sawdust and lignin discarded by the timber and paper industries into a 3D printing filament.

By making products from waste the company hopes to stop additional trees from being cut down as well as preventing the waste wood from decaying or being incinerated which would re-release the carbon is stored.

""It could save a lot of trees"" said McDonough. ""It's kind of fun and it's quite beautiful.""

Olivine sand

Olivine which is one of the most common minerals on earth is capable of absorbing its own mass in CO2 when crushed and scattered on the ground.

This means it lends itself to being a fertiliser and a replacement for sand or gravel in landscaping while the carbonated version (above) can be used as an additive in the production of cement paper or 3D-printing filaments.

""It absorbs CO2 very easily"" said Teresa van Dongen who has included the mineral in an online library of carbon-capturing materials.

""One tonne of olivine sand can take in up to one tonne of CO2 depending on the conditions. You just have to spread it out and nature will do its job.""

Concrete

Montreal company Carbicrete has developed a type of concrete that captures carbon in its production while substituting emissions-intensive cement which is responsible for eight per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions with waste slag from the steel industry.

Currently the process relies on captured industrial emissions meaning that it reduces the amount of new emissions being pumped into the atmosphere but does not reduce atmospheric CO2. However once the company draws its CO2 from the atmosphere via direct air capture (DAC) this would make the final material carbon-negative.

""It's negative emissions"" Carbicrete CEO Chris Stern told Dezeen. ""We're taking CO2 out of the system every time we make a block.""

Bricks

Australian company Mineral Carbonation International injects CO2 into industrial waste such as mine tailings turning it from a gas into a solid that can then be used to create cement bricks and other building materials.

The process replicates the same mineral carbonation process that takes place in nature as carbon dioxide dissolves in rainwater and reacts with rocks to form new carbonate minerals.

""We're trying to embed emissions into as much of our everyday life as possible"" said MCi chief operating office Sophia Hamblin Wang. ""We turn waste into new products. And we aim to do it in a way that makes money.""

Food

Solar Foods is one of a growing cohort of companies using emissions captured from industrial plants to create foods and drinks. The Finnish company uses microbes to turn carbon dioxide into a meat substitute called Solein.

The CO2 is injected into a fermentation tank together with hydrogen and different nutrients all of which the microbes consume and turn into protein that is then harvested and dried resulting in a powder with a similar composition to dried soy.

The carbon dioxide currently comes from industry but could one come from captured atmospheric carbon.

If scaled up the technology could potentially provide humanity with its protein needs while using a fraction of the land and resources used by traditional agriculture thereby freeing up more land for afforestation solar power and other means of tackling climate change.

Producing Solein is entirely free from agriculture"" said Solar Foods. ""It doesn't require arable land or irrigation and isn't limited by climate conditions.""

Vodka

Brooklyn-based Air Co uses CO2 to make vodka. The brand breaks down carbon dioxide with water and a proprietary catalyst in a reactor to create ethanol which is then used to distil vodka.

""We invented a way to capture excess carbon from the air and turn it into ultra-refined covetable products"" Air Co said although the claim is misleading since the CO2 comes from factory emissions meaning it reduces rather than reverses greenhouse-gas emissions.

In addition food and drink only offer short-term storage of carbon since the product is soon consumed and the carbon returned to the atmosphere via the natural carbon cycle.

The village had nothing in its code regulating the short-term rentals of fewer than 30 days such as Airbnb or VRBO rentals.

The moratorium was put in place after some village residents raised concerns about a home that they thought was being used as an Airbnb rental.

At its April 5 council meeting resident Sharon Jewell of Robindale Drive presented a petition by concerned residents who were against allowing a possible Airbnb rental on her street.

Jewell expressed concerns about property values being brought down. In addition she said there were concerns about the element of some renters and felt it would be bad for the community to allow Airbnb rentals in areas of the village that are zoned for single-family residential homes.

A special council committee met multiple times in May to review ordinances from other communities and developed the proposed ordinance presented on June. 7.

At the June 7 meeting Robert Cross a North Main Street resident who wanted to operate an Airbnb location in his 185-year-old house questioned the amount of regulation in the ordinance.

Following a lengthy discussion council gave the proposed ordinance a first reading and addressed some of the concerns raised by Cross.

At Monday’s meeting council reviewed the changes made by Law Director Jeff Forbes as well as other changes by council members before they voted unanimously to approve the ordinance.

“I’m happy with it” Cross said. “I feel they were respectful to me and that they listened to my concerns. I believe they (council) were genuinely concerned to make it right for all of us.”

Jewell expressed her thanks to council for addressing the issue.

“I think this is a win/win for the community” she said. “We’ll be a better community for doing this right and I think we handled this as adults.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHltb250YW5hbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi9zaG9ydC10ZXJtLXJlbnRhbC1pc3N1ZXMtcGxhZ3VlLWlzbGFuZC1wYXJrLW5lYXIteWVsbG93c3RvbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Short-term rental issues plague Island Park near Yellowstone • Daily Montanan,"Picturesque views and endless supply of outdoor recreational opportunities have always attracted visitors to the West — tourists and new residents alike. But the dynamic changed in the past decade with the rise of third-party rental websites like Airbnb VRBO and Vacasa. These short-term rentals and vacation homes opened up lodging to more visitors in Idaho.

One of those corners is Island Park population 266 where city and county officials have been unable to regulate short-term rental properties causing complaints from some residents.

Fremont County Commissioner Blair Dance said the real estate industry in Island Park a half-hour drive from West Yellowstone has exploded in recent years. And it likely won’t let up anytime soon — May was a record-breaking month for visits to Yellowstone.

“(The short-term rental market) built up and developed and became a viable economic option for people with their residences their second homes to help defray some of their costs and more and more people were getting into it” Dance said. “The word spread and it really has mushroomed quite rapidly in the last five to 10 years.”

While other rental-heavy areas across Idaho have staff and plenty of information around rules and regulations for short-term rentals in a designated area Fremont County has a brochure outlining the permitting process and three staffers in the planning and zoning department to enforce the county’s ordinances.

The county’s rules allow property owners to get a transient lodging permit — which is a stay of fewer than 30 days. The permit is broken into two classifications based on the home’s guest capacity — a Class 1 permit costs $200 for up to 15 guests and a Class 2 permit costs $500 for 16 to 30 guests. Both include requirements for septic and well inspections every two years.

“I assume that there are those people who are avoiding letting people know that they’re renting out their home on short-term rentals and our struggle is ‘OK how do we get that policed and how do we find the manpower to do that?’” Dance said. “It’s a challenge.”

Tom Cluff planning and building administrator for Fremont County told commissioners at a meeting in April that he estimates about 60% of the cabin rentals in the area are permitted. In a follow-up email to the Idaho Capital Sun Cluff said that number is a worst-case scenario estimate.

“I was telling the commissioners that our records show there are nearly 600 permitted cabin rentals in Fremont County” Cluff said. “There are some other people who think there are more than that — maybe as many as 1000 rentals in the Island Park area.”

A search of Airbnb.com found so many short-term rentals in the Island Park and Fremont County area that it stopped at the maximum display of 300 rentals. A search on VRBO.com found 896 rentals. Vacation rental investment website Airdna lists 838 active rentals in the area.

Fremont County had 13099 residents and 9186 housing units as of July 2019.

If Cluff discovers an owner is renting without a permit whether through a resident complaint or other methods the focus is on compliance rather than punishment. People almost always choose to get a permit after they are contacted he said and fines and other penalties are rarely necessary. No set of rules is perfect he said but Fremont County’s procedures have worked pretty well for the most part.

‘The peace and tranquility of the area … is gone’

Ken Watts a resident since 2010 is chairman of the Island Park Preservation Coalition a local advocacy group. Watts said transient rentals have caused a tremendous amount of conflict in the community. He said he has submitted complaints to the county about short-term rentals in his area that went unanswered including one last July. Cluff said he was aware of the complaints but could not comment on current investigations or pending enforcement efforts.

Watts said the rental across the road from his home costs $735 per night and he knows others cost more than $1000 per night. Those prices often attract big groups and multiple vehicles parked in front of the home along with a lot of noise and sometimes people shooting off guns or yelling at neighbors.

“You cannot believe the tension and conflict it’s causing for the people who live here. The people who live here full time or part time they just hate it” Watts said. “The peace and tranquility of the area they moved to and built homes in is gone.”

Watts partly blames House Bill 216 which was passed in the 2017 session of the Idaho Legislature and signed into law for the county’s lack of response. The law bars local governments from restricting short-term rentals. He says some officials interpret that as barring them from regulating the rentals at all but the law also includes language about protecting the integrity of neighborhoods and health and safety.

“Imagine you’re in a residential neighborhood and you see 20 30 40 strangers walking all around your streets” Watts said. “We never used to lock our doors or windows and now we don’t know who’s in our neighborhood so we’re more cautious.”

Watts said his goal is not to abolish transient rentals but he does want the criteria for a rental to become more consistent with the neighborhood in which it is located.

“So if the average is four people in a given house well then try not to exceed that very much (in a rental) because it would change the character of the neighborhood to put 20 people in there” he said.

Officials don’t single out HB 216 as a contributing factor

Cluff said he is exploring what options might be available to issue citations to individuals in response to a problem rather than mailing a violation notice that requires a response. Cluff said those citations likely wouldn’t be aimed at unpermitted rentals but rather those who are causing problems for a neighborhood like the ones Watts describes.

But he disagrees that House Bill 216 had any effect on enforcement efforts. When the bill passed he said Fremont County’s rules for short-term rentals had already been in place for several years.

“I don’t think it makes enforcement against unpermitted rentals any harder” Cluff said.

Seth Grigg executive director of the Idaho Association of Counties said he hasn’t heard complaints from many county officials about short-term rentals not being regulated or registered properly. The bigger concern he hears is about the effect on housing costs as individuals or investors buy homes in popular vacation communities then rent them out.

Executive Director of the Idaho Association of Cities Kelley Packer said she hasn’t heard widespread concern about short-term rentals from city leaders. And further as a former legislator Packer voted ‘yes’ on House Bill 216 in 2017 and said it was meant to protect personal property rights and purposely included a carveout for the regulation of health safety and welfare for residents.

“I think there’s a fine line between maintaining personal property rights and a community still being able to create reasonable standards for homeowners within their jurisdiction” Packer said. “… So I think 216 was a pretty good bill.”

Residents worry about lack of enforcement mechanisms

Another issue of short-term rentals raised by Island Park residents is registration with the Idaho State Tax Commission. House Bill 216 changed the law so that if an owner chooses to advertise a rental through a third-party site such as Airbnb the company automatically collects the applicable taxes and sends it to the tax commission on the host’s behalf.

But if an owner lists a rental through the classifieds section of a newspaper or only reserves short-term stays through direct contact they can theoretically skirt the state’s occupancy and lodging taxes. It is up to the owner to register as a short-term rental with the state to remit taxes within 45 days.

Ron Folsom former Ammon city administrator lives in the Island Park area and said he knows it is a problem.

“I have people I know that have had rentals here for 30 years and so they have long-term tenants that come every summer and they’re not registered (with the state to collect taxes)” Folsom said.

Folsom inquired with the state tax commission about registration asking for confirmation that a formal enforcement mechanism for registration of such rentals doesn’t exist.

Daniel Reines a tax research specialist for the Idaho State Tax Commission responded to Folsom’s inquiry by saying there are individuals at the commission who are aware of short-term rentals and dedicated to their responsibilities and promoting voluntary compliance.

Reines said he thinks the goal of compliance is ensuring a fair and competitive market but tax specialists also have to consider whether the effort and methods of gaining compliance are more costly than the revenue that would be collected.

Could HOAs step in? ‘We are digging into it’

While adding more staff to Cluff’s department could help with enforcement Dance also thinks homeowner’s associations could be used to make sure rentals are permitted. House Bill 216 does not allow an association to restrict short-term rentals but Dance said the association could require proof of permits as a means of enforcement.

“It’s just a process we’re learning about and trying to address” Dance said.

He and the two other Fremont County commissioners are communicating with other counties across Idaho as well to understand how they address short-term rentals.

“We are digging into it and going through an educational process and looking to formulate ways that we as a county can through various means get a return on (rentals) from that industry that will help defray the additional costs that these additional people bring the burden that they bring to the county” Dance said.

Jessie Danielson it’s just “shameful.”

Companies large and small have been barring workers in Colorado from applying for remote work positions in what appear to be efforts to bypass a state law mandating companies provide salary ranges when posting job openings in the state.

“This is a remote job except that it is not eligible to be performed in Colorado” a listing for an account manager position with short-term vacation rental giant Airbnb says.

“We are seeking applicants from the Boston area and from any state except Colorado” reads another recent job listing this one from Denver-based tech education and shared office space provider Galvanize.

The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act took effect Jan. 1. The purpose of the legislation is to combat gender-based pay gaps in the workplace in part by providing workers with hard numbers about who is making what for the work they are doing.

“The companies that are fighting to avoid this pay transparency are simply working very hard to avoid this Colorado law so they can continue to underpay women” said Danielson one of the bill’s four primary sponsors.

An Airbnb representative did not return an email seeking comment Thursday. A Galvanize spokesperson provided the following statement from the company:

“That posting verbiage was an error. The job is actually a Boston-based role and therefore the candidate would need to be physically in the office.”

When it comes to future job postings for remote work Galvanize’s policy is under review the spokesperson said.

Danielson’s strong criticism comes after a Reddit post last month slammed the Colorado shunning practice and urged naming and shaming companies that are doing it in their listings.

That thread helped inspire Aaron Batilo a software engineer who lives in Commerce City to launch a website dedicated to cataloging such postings. As of Thursday afternoon ColoradoExcluded.com had links to 193 job listings for remote work positions from 98 companies.

Batilo has been a remote worker since before the COVID-19 pandemic something that has afforded him better pay from companies based in Seattle and the San Francisco area. He noted worker demand for remote positions is reaching new heights in the wake of the virus.

“I do think it is kind of taking advantage of the opportunity because you might have someone living in a lower cost of living state and you might be expecting to pay them less” Batilo said of companies leaving salary ranges off their online postings. “I am personally of the opinion that with remote work you should not do location-based pay.”

Increased awareness has boosted the number of listings pouring into Batilo’s submission-based site. 9News first covered the job posting practice in late May speaking to Batilo. He was also featured in a Wall Street Journal story last week. At the time his site featured listings from 46 companies.

“These companies are already aware of their salary range. They already have a budget. I would prefer that they would share that” Batilo said.

The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act does outline penalties for companies that don’t share salary ranges or violate the law in other ways such as by not notifying all of their employees about internal job openings.

The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment has a complaint form that can be accessed online. Companies found to be in violation can be fined $500 to $10000 per offense.

The labor department has one active investigation into a company accused of excluding Coloradans from remote job openings said Scott Moss the director of the labor department’s division of labor standards and statistics. A decision is expected to be issued in that case shortly.

The department has fielded dozens of additional complaints but none of those have risen to the level of a full investigation yet. With a relatively new law the department’s approach is to focus on educating employers first before resorting to fines. An employer-focused fact sheet is available at coloradolaborlaw.gov.

“Where we have found a violation we give the employer a period to bring the posting into compliance and if they do we waive the fine” Moss said. “We have a 100% success rate when finding a violation of the company promptly fixing it.”

Moss emphasizes that despite the media attention the labor department’s internal research shows that remote work ads barring Colorado applicants are relatively rare. After tracking a random sample of 203 job posts on Indeed covering both companies based in Colorado and those headquartered outside the state the department found just one using language barring Colorado applicants.

Moss said that among the 50 largest employers in the state compliance has been impressive and improved every month so far in 2021.

The labor department’s powers have limits. Companies with no physical presence in Colorado — meaning no employees currently working in the state — aren’t subject to the law Moss said. With that in mind listings that bar Colorado applicants are “puzzling and self-defeating” Moss said.

“They are just undercutting their own talent base to their own detriment by excluding a high-skill labor force state” he said.

For Oisin Hanrahan CEO of Denver-based home services marketplace company Angi combating the gender pay gap has been and remains an important goal. The idea of writing job posting to specifically exclude Colorado workers in an effort to obscure pay data is something he said his company would never do. Angi has roughly 4500 employees across the country including 1600 in Colorado. The company is giving many of its employees the option to work remotely even after it reopens offices.

“I think that it’s unfortunate that this measure has essentially got some pretty poor unintended consequences and I think it’s a poor workaround by companies that are deciding that’s the approach they want to take” Hanrahan said. “I think the more we can do to shine a light on areas where we have a problem the more likely it is that we’ll fix that.”

The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act has already overcome a legal challenge from the Rocky Mountain Association of Recruiters Danielson noted. She maintains that the law does not constitute an undue burden on employers and in fact she has heard from companies that say that listing salary ranges is helping them attract better-qualified candidates.

“The public was demanding and still is demanding that the legislature in Colorado do everything possible to stop discriminatory practices that lead to gender gaps in pay” she said. “I’m open to ideas on working with the (labor) department) on more options for enforcement.”"

Or follow us on Google News

It’s been a few months since we looked at electric vehicle market share trends in several top markets so it’s time for another deep dive. Six static charts are included in this article with commentary before them to examine EV market share changes from 2020 compared to the first 5 months of 2021.

On the bottom of this article are extra interactive charts (note that they tend to work much better on real computers not phones). Six of those charts are like the ones within the article but have extra bars in the middle for May market share. There’s also one extra chart that focuses in on each country individually with a toggle button to change between the countries.

One more important note is that electric vehicle market share tends to rise through the year. It should get notably higher from here on out in 2021 so expect the light blue bars to grow in future reports.

On to the charts.

Fully Electric Vehicles

To start with we’re looking at market share of 100% electric vehicles in 7 top countries but excluding country #1 — Norway — because it’s hard to see the trends in other markets when you include the Norwegian behemoth. You can see that pure-electric vehicle market share grew strongly in Germany and China so far this year; grew a little bit in the UK Sweden and France; declined a little bit in Switzerland; and declined drastically in the Netherlands after an enormous peak in 2020 that was superpowered by certain policies.

The following chart is the same thing but with Norway added. As noted above Norway is a beast which makes all the other trends seem minimal. As it turns out BEV market share has just creeped up so far in 2021 but it is at an impressive 54.9% compared to 54.3% in 2020. In May its market share was 60.4%.

Market share changes in the other countries (which you can also find by hovering over bars in the interactive charts on the bottom of this article) are as follows:

Germany

2020 — 6.7%

Jan–May 2021 — 10.3%

May 2021 — 11.6%

Sweden

2020 — 9.6%

Jan–May 2021 — 10.2%

May 2021 — 16.2%

China

2020 — 5.1%

Jan–May 2021 — 8.3%

May 2021 — 9.4%

Netherlands

2020 — 21%

Jan–May 2021 — 7.9%

May 2021 — 13%

UK

2020 — 6.6%

Jan–May 2021 — 7.5%

May 2021 — 8.4%

France

2020 — 6.7%

Jan–May 2021 — 7.1%

May 2021 — 8.2%

Switzerland

2020 — 8.2%

Jan–May 2021 — 7%

May 2021 — 10.2%

As you can see the May results are better than the January–May results for all 7 of those countries as well as Norway.

Plugin Vehicles (Full Electric + Plugin Hybrid)

Looking at overall plugin vehicle trends the story looks a little bit brighter. Market share in several countries rose faster than market share of BEVs rose and the Netherlands didn’t have nearly as bad of a drop.

Adding Norway in it’s still the same story with Norway also seeing its plugin vehicle share grow much more than its BEV share grew in the first 5 months of this year compared to 2020 as a whole.

The next two charts show the same as above sets of charts but all combined. Seeing the difference between BEV market share and overall market share you can eyeball the role that plugin hybrids play in these different markets.

I won’t comment on most of the interactive charts but this first one is particularly interesting because it shows the long-term market share trends in each of these countries. The 2021 chart though being immature is not continuing the trend perfectly. The second half of the year will indeed see much higher EV sales and EV market share. The first 5 months will not be representative of the year. Just expect that last bar in each chart to climb through the end of 2021.

Or follow us on Google News

I just published a report on the 30 best selling electric cars and SUVs across 10 European countries. The model races and rankings are always fun but there’s more to explore and compare than just models. As we all know by now some companies have focused on a small number of models (sometimes out of necessity) whereas others have been rolling out a larger number of models and spreading the electrons across styles sizes and tastes.

Looking across the same 10 European countries as before — Denmark Finland France Germany Ireland the Netherlands Norway Spain Sweden and Switzerland — the clear brand leader is Volkswagen with 18.3% of the pure electric vehicle sales across those 10 markets. That’s nearly one out of every five electric vehicles sold in those 10 countries.

Tesla still carried by just the top-selling Model 3 is #2 holding 10% of EV sales. Renault is not far behind with 9.2% EV market share but expect Tesla to grow its lead notably in June and probably further through the end of 2021.

Peugeot (7.7%) and Hyundai (6%) round out the top 5.

Hyundai’s partner in crime Kia comes right after Hyundai in #6 which brings up another matter. You can look even broader than brands and examine the results of automotive groups and alliances as well. I’ll come back to that in a minute after looking at the most recent brand stats across these markets — May sales.

When you look at May EV sales alone not much changes compared to the January–May sales rankings. However Škoda jumps from #10 to #4 on the back of the highly popular Škoda Enyaq. Also Kia and Hyundai which are very tight switch places. Additionally Opel climbs from #9 to #8 Smart drops from #7 to #9 and Fiat climbs from #12 to #10 to close out the top 10.

Overall it seems likely that Volkswagen ends the year at #1 Tesla at #2 and Renault at #3 — but we’ll see and be sure to report back if any other brands make a sprint for a medal position.

Let’s look at automotive groups alliances and confusing conglomerate partnerships now.

Clearly Volkswagen Group is king of European electric vehicle sales at the moment. And one has to wonder how long it will be until it is dethroned. It could be a long long time.

Will Tesla Giga Berlin be able to put Tesla back on top once it is pumping out German-made electric cars? We’ll see but that’s still a ways off. In the meantime if a European is buying an electric vehicle she or he is most likely buying something from the Volkswagen stable.

Some big props are also due for Stellantis which has quickly climbed the EV sales ladder to #2. I recall when Maarten Vinkhuyzen was predicting big things from PSA (the core of Stellantis) a couple of years ago and being a bit skeptical yet open minded because it was coming from Maarten (who I trust as much as anyone when it comes to market commentary and analysis). Indeed he was right PSA has come on strong. Additionally Fiat woke up and has been delivering quite a few units of its cute little 500e.

There is actually one way Volkswagen Group could be dethroned overnight — if Tesla joined Stellantis. Teslantis? (Of course that is just a joke as it is not even remotely possible.)

The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance and the Hyundai-Kia partnership continue their steady second tier of EV sales semi-leadership followed for now by the premium-class trio of Tesla Daimler and BMW. Tesla is sure to jump in the rankings for the first half of the year though when June sales come in. This is after all one of its 4 peak sales months of the year due to Tesla’s shipping patterns always favoring the last month of the quarter.

Any other thoughts on these EV sales rankings and expectations for the future?

Wisconsin Senate: No Licenses For Braiding Hair

The state Senate has passed a bill that would allow people to braid hair without a license. The Black community has been pushing to deregulate braiding for years.

According to the Institute for Justice 30 states currently exempt braiders from licensure. Wisconsin doesn’t require licenses for braiding hair but the bill’s main authors Rep. Shelia Stubbs D-Madison and Sen. LaTonya Johnson D-Milwaukee contend braiders are getting mixed messages about whether they need them. They also contend hair-braiding is an ancient craft and de-regulating it will allow more female entrepreneurs to practice braiding.

The Senate approved the bill on a voice vote Wednesday. The Assembly passed it in March. The bill goes to Evers for his signature.

When you see that Allstate commercial where the guy drives around picking up fresh-from-the-water fish and warm bakery bread exchanging pleasantries in a tone that hints at a close-knit community do you think about insurance? Or does your mind wander to wondering about that scene where the camera pans out? That's when we see where it's all happening a tiny idyllic island where a person can accomplish an entire round of errands before a pot of kettle left on the stove has time to boil down and create a fire hazard. (And huzzah to Allstate for finding a clever way to illustrate a message about reduced rates for low-mileage drivers.)

Back to the island though which really does spark curiosity. For anyone who doesn't live in a charming tranquil spot surrounded by the sea it appears too good to be true—a figment of a marketing team's imagination. Maybe even a set built by Allstate. On the other hand one can't help but hope this location exists somewhere out there in real life ideally offering plenty of well-paying dream jobs and affordable real estate options to boot.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL21hcnRpbnN2aWxsZWJ1bGxldGluLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2VkdWNhdGlvbi92Y3Utc3R1ZGVudHMtcmV0dXJuLXRvLW1hcnRpbnN2aWxsZS1jbGluaWMtbWFnbmEtdmlzdGEtc3R1ZGVudC13aW5zLXNjaG9sYXJzaGlwL2FydGljbGVfODYwOWJkODgtZDVjYi0xMWViLTljODMtNzNhNWYyNTgzYWI0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VCU students return to Martinsville clinic; Magna Vista student wins scholarship,"





VCU students back at clinicFourth-year students from the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Dentistry have returned to the Community Dental Clinic in Martinsville working under the supervision of Chief Dentist Dr. Aimn Abbasi and local dentists who volunteer their time for at least a week as part of their training.

Every senior dental student at VCU rotates through the clinic and approximately 1400 dental students have treated patients since the clinic opened in 2005 a release from the clinic said. The program had been interrupted by the pandemic.

“Our relationship with the VCU School of Dentistry has enabled the foundation to serve a larger number of patients in our community” Dr. Mark Crabtree president of the foundation said in the release. “This is win-win situation for the School and students and our community. The students gain practical experience in Martinsville and an understanding of the importance of meeting the needs of the underserved in our community and advancing the quality of oral health.”

The clinic at 23 Fayette Street is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Patients are treated on a sliding scale of fees.

Catherine Malone of Lynchburg said working in the clinic provided “a rewarding feeling to help people with preventive oral health.”

Magna Vista student picked

James “Finley” Underwood of Magna Vista High School was among 19 students statewide who were honored by The Allstate Foundation/Virginia High School League Achievement for their academic excellence and participation in athletics and school activities and community service.

Each student will receive a $1500 scholarship as chosen by a panel of five Virginia-area Allstate agents.

“The Allstate Foundation is proud to support these next generation leaders and history-makers from Virginia” Jessica Hurd Allstate agency manager in Charlottesville said in a release announcing the winners. “These amazing young students have shown outstanding initiative both in and outside of the classroom. We know that many families have encountered significant financial hardships resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and it is an honor to assist these VHSL students in their future endeavors and watch them achieve their full potential.”

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Cooperman’s history and hedge fund performance go directly to Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 5 Stocks.

The hedge fund manager and American billionaire investor Leon Cooperman recently stated in an interview that the stock market will be down from a year from now amid rising inflation increasing taxes along with prospects for an interest rate hike. Though Omega Advisors chairman doesn’t see any immediate downside risk he still believes the long-term US economic outlook is not favorable as the world’s largest economy is pulling the demand forward. He says that the recent stock market rally was supported by sentiments that the economy will rebound but he is concerned that how long stocks could move higher on recovery projections. He is also worried about the rising government debt levels as well as the strategy of supporting the labor market through multi-trillion dollar stimulus packages.

""If you spoke to a hundred economists today and he asked them what their view is of the potential real growth of the US economy the response would be centered on 2%"" Cooperman said. ""We're growing this year four to five times potential yet the Fed is persistent in keeping interest rates at near zero. That doesn't make any great sense to me. It's just pushing people out on the risk curve.""

He is also showing concerns over the rising inflation with the expectation that the inflation number will move well over Fed’s expectations.

""I think that Mr. Powell will be surprised by inflation. It's not going to be as quiescent and transitory as he thinks. I think the Fed will be forced to say something before the end of 2022"" Cooperman said.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman who worked for Goldman Sachs for 25 years remained busy last year in adjusting his portfolio to cope with rapidly changing market dynamics. He significantly expanded his focus towards financial stocks since the beginning of last year. As of the end of the first quarter financial stocks accounted for more than 40% of $1.6 billion worth of Leon Cooperman’s 13F stock portfolio up significantly from 17.88% of portfolio weighting at the end of 2019. Interestingly instead of chasing big banking stocks the billionaire investor invested heavily in small and mid-cap loan and mortgage companies. In the past couple of quarters he also expressed confidence in business acquisition and development companies.

Story continues

Leon Cooperman who sits on a net worth of around $3.2 billion believes in the portfolio diversification strategy instead of a concentrated portfolio. He has well-diversified his stock portfolio towards value and growth stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Microsoft and Alphabet Inc may seem like growth stocks because of their growth rates but we actually classify especially Alphabet Inc as a value play because of its huge discount compared to sum of its parts as well as its peer's P/S multiples. The billionaire investor is also seeking to take advantage of the booming information technology communications and consumer discretionary sectors. Furthermore Leon Cooperman invested millions of dollars in real estate and energy stocks to capitalize on the economic recovery period. At the end of the first quarter the real estate sector represented 7.26% of the entire Leon Cooperman's portfolio while energy stocks weighted around 8.96%.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman grew up in a Jewish family in New York City after immigration from Poland. After completing his MBA degree from Columbia Business School in 1967 he joined Goldman Sachs and spent 22 years in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989 he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. He also headed GS Capital Growth Fund for more than 1 year. After retiring from Goldman Sachs he founded Omega Advisors and converted it into a family office fund in 2016.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 10 Stocks

While Leon Cooperman’s reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy more than 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 206.8% since then and beat the SPY's 91% gain.

Despite several portfolio adjustments billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about few stocks that he believes would perform well in 2021. Let start digging into 10 stocks billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about:

10. Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $51744000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.22% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25

Leon Cooperman has been holding a position in Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) since 2017 amid its strong dividend yield and steady share price upside potential. During the first quarter of 2021 Omega Advisors raised its stake in ET by 4% to 6.73 million shares valued at around $51.7 million. Shares of Energy Transfer LP rallied close to 90% since the beginning of this year thanks to improving energy prices and economic reopening. The company offers a dividend yield of 5.61% with a current quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.

Energy Transfer L.P. was in 25 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2020 flat compared to the previous quarter. The all-time high for this statistic is 36.

9. Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $55990000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.49% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12

Leon Cooperman left his position unchanged in specialty materials company Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) in the first quarter of 2020. Fortunately shares of Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) saw a stunning share price rally of almost 50% so far this year driven by economic reopening. Furthermore reports are showing that Ferro to be acquired by Prince International in a $2.1B deal.

Ferro Corporation was in 12 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021 flat compared to the previous quarter. The all-time high for this statistic is 28.

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $57930000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.61% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 251

The tech giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is among the long-running stock holding of Omega Advisors. The firm first initiated a position in MSFT in 2015. At the end of the first quarter of 2021 Leon Cooperman held 245705 shares of Microsoft accounting for 3.61% of the overall portfolio. Shares of the tech giant are up 13% year to date followed by robust appreciation in the previous years. Moreover the company has the potential to offer double-digit dividend increase to investors.

ClearBridge Investments an investment management firm mentioned a few stocks including Microsoft Corporation in the first quarter investor letter. Here is what ClearBridge Investments stated:

“We also made adjustments to the portfolio’s top 10 holdings to increase the participation of select stocks. The FAANGs and Microsoft delivered mixed results during the quarter and we continue to be mindful of our weighting to these mega cap growth stocks to ensure they are not limiting our ability to add diversity through new ideas. Our repositioning has been encouraging so far with the portfolio performing better on up days in the market while maintaining good down capture during more turbulent sessions.”

7. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $68174000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 4.25% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52

Billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about the oil exploration and production company Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN). He initiated a big position in Devon Energy during the first quarter by purchasing 3.12 million shares valued at around $68.17 million accounting for 4.25% of the entire portfolio. In the past couple of quarters Devon Energy's stock price benefited from an improvement in oil prices. Its shares are up almost 95% since the beginning of this year. Devon’s dividend yield is close to 1.50%.

GoodHaven Capital Management a concentrated portfolio investment management firm highlighted a few stocks including Devon Energy in the first quarter investor letter. Here is what GoodHaven Capital Management stated:

“After a rough start to the year our two biggest energy holdings – WPX Energy rebounded materially in the last six months though energy was still our biggest detractor for the year. I’ve previously written about deciding earlier this year to direct new capital towards better businesses versus adding more to the energy sector but given the material optionality at WPX we opted to maintain a material exposure. Recently WPX announced an all stock merger with a larger competitor – Devon Energy – which will leave the new company with plenty of cash flow at lower oil prices less leverage and material upside to higher commodity prices.”

6. Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ASH)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $71190000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 4.44% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36

Specialty chemical solutions Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ASH) is among the long-running stock holding of Omega Advisors. Billionaire Leon Cooperman left his position unchanged in Ashland during the first quarter. His firm held 801965 shares valued at $71.1 million representing 4.44% of the overall portfolio.

Ashland Global Holdings investors should pay attention to a decrease in support from the world’s most elite money managers recently. Ashland Global was in 36 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021 compared to 38 positions in the previous quarter. The all-time high for this statistic is 46.

Could deep-sea mining get the go ahead within two years?

The so-called ""two-year rule"" would compel the ISA to allow seabed mining to go ahead within two years effectively setting a deadline for the body to finalise mining regulations.

The source who was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be named said Nauru would send the request to the ISA on June 30.

Ambassador Margo Deiye permanent representative of Nauru to the ISA was not available for comment.

The Pacific island nation roughly 2800 miles (4506 km)northeast of Australia is a sponsoring state for The Metals Company formerly known as DeepGreen. The Metals Company plans to list on the Nasdaq next month in a merger with blank-check company Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp (SOAC.N).

Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea private mining companies must be sponsored by a state in order to do seabed mining. The Metals Co is also sponsored by Kiribati and Tonga.

Any ISA member state that either holds or sponsors a deep-sea exploration license for a private company can trigger the two-year rule. The ISA has not yet received any request to trigger the rule a spokesperson for the agency said.

Deep-Sea mining is targeting polymetallic nodules

Deep-sea mining involves sucking up potato-sized rocks (known as polymetallic nodules) that contain cobalt nickel and other battery metals and are strewn across the Pacific Ocean floor.

Some scientists and environmentalists have called for a ban on the practice saying too little is known about deep-sea ecosystems and mining could wipe out as-yet undiscovered species. Alphabet Inc's Google and BMW have called for a moratorium on the practice.

The Metals Company has argued that seabed mining will be more sustainable than mining on land producing less waste and fewer carbon dioxide emissions.

Based in Vancouver The Metals Company has said it aims to start mining in 2024 and expects exploitation regulations to be approved within the next two years. In regulatory filings the company raised the possibility that an ISA member state might trigger the rule. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.

Conservation groups have raised concerns about a fast-tracked timeline. The ISA postponed meetings set for July but this week said it aimed to hold in-person sessions later this year.

Matthew Gianni co-founder of the Deep-Sea Conservation Coalition said the ISA's review process must be properly finished and should not be pressured by the two-year countdown.

""Negotiations around regulations and the royalty regime are still underway and should not be rushed to meet an artificial deadline"" he told Reuters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3Blb3BsZS9nYXV0YW0tYWRhbmktaGFzLXRocmVlLXJlYXNvbnMtdG8td29ycnktYXMtbXVrZXNoLWFtYmFuaS1wbGFucy1hLWppby1mb3ItaW5kaWEtcy1ncmVlbi1lbmVyZ3ktc3BhY2UtMTE2MjQ2NzkzNDM4NzguaHRtbNIBpQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3Blb3BsZS9nYXV0YW0tYWRhbmktaGFzLXRocmVlLXJlYXNvbnMtdG8td29ycnktYXMtbXVrZXNoLWFtYmFuaS1wbGFucy1hLWppby1mb3ItaW5kaWEtcy1ncmVlbi1lbmVyZ3ktc3BhY2UvYW1wLTExNjI0Njc5MzQzODc4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gautam Adani has three reasons to worry as Mukesh Ambani plans a 'Jio' for India's green energy space | Mint,"Mukesh Ambani’s rivals should be relieved though perhaps not too much. The petrochemicals czar has just told shareholders that he’s undertaking his life’s “most challenging"" mission by investing 750 billion rupees ($10 billion) in clean power and fuel over three years.

It doesn’t appear to be a big capital commitment from India’s most powerful businessman certainly not when he’s just raised $44 billion of capital during a pandemic and made the $180 billion balance sheet of his flagship Reliance Industries Ltd. free of net debt.

But these are still early days for a decisive change in the energy mix of India’s largely coal-fueled economy. Ambani’s plans could easily turn as aggressive as his 4G telecom venture initially dismissed by naysayers as a me-too entry into a crowded field of a dozen players. In just five years Ambani’s digital startup has acquired 420 million-plus subscribers bankrupted several other operators and will soon launch one of the world’s cheapest smartphones in partnership with Alphabet Inc.’s Google. If he displays a similar hunger in solar energy other aspirants might have to rethink their strategies.

Among them may be France’s TotalEnergies SE which has picked up a 20% stake in Adani Green Energy Ltd. and invested directly in some of the projects in the firm’s 25 gigawatt solar-energy portfolio which has grown by 50 times in three years. Gautam Adani who earlier this year took his spot behind Ambani as Asia’s second-richest man wants to be the world’s largest renewable energy producer by 2030.

Will Ambani get in his way? Until now the two billionaires both hailing from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat have largely operated in their separate spheres. Ambani has leaned toward data-driven consumer businesses like retail and telecom whereas Adani has focused on infrastructure and utilities. Clean energy would see them overlap. Although Ambani’s initial plans aren’t overly dominant — he wants to meet 100 gigawatts of Modi’s green energy target of 450 gigawatts by 2030 — that’s probably because he’s yet to scope the policy terrain.

After spending $90 billion over the past decade Reliance Industries says it has the “capacity to catalyze"" another $200 billion in investment over the next 10 years. From a renewed focus on gas exploration to e-commerce over WhatsApp India’s largest business enterprise has many irons in the fire beyond clean energy. It also has deep pockets and influential friends like Google and Facebook Inc. Yasir Al-Rumayyan the head of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is joining the Reliance board. The goal which is running behind schedule is to have Aramco as a strategic partner in Reliance’s cash-spewing refinery on India’s west coast and reposition it at the center of a low-carbon oil-to-chemicals empire.

To support those initiatives Reliance has $13 billion of annual earnings before interest depreciation tax and amortization. Its foreign-currency debt is rated BBB by Fitch Ratings a notch higher than India’s government. Meanwhile the listed entities in the Adani Group have a little more than $3.5 billion of annual Ebitda and combined net debt in excess of $19 billion.

After a spectacular surge over the past year the smaller group’s share prices have wobbled recently amid concerns around some opaque foreign funds’ outsize exposure. That bout of nervousness has underscored the crucial role financing will play for Adani to realize his sprawling ambitions spanning India’s ports airports coal mining power generation and transmission gas supply warehousing and data centers.

It’s equally possible that the wealthier tycoon is spreading himself a tad too thin. Reliance is battling Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. in e-commerce and will soon be challenging Xiaomi Corp. with JioPhone Next custom-built by Google for the 300 million Indians still on 2G devices. Then there’s the foray into the unfamiliar world of technology services: Not only does Ambani want to be the first off the block with 5G in India he also aims to sell to other telecom operators globally competing perhaps with Huawei Technologies Co.

Adani is impatient to grow because he wants to diversify cash flows beyond his successful port business and catch the inevitable resource boom as the average earnings of India’s 1.4 billion people go from low-middle-income to high-middle-income. What is Ambani’s hurry?

To stuff clean energy into a packed catchall shows that the 64-year-old may be getting serious about succession planning. Mukesh Ambani’s own past battle with younger brother Anil for a division of family assets would be a reminder that he needs to use Reliance’s cost-of-capital advantage to nurture self-sustaining conglomerates for each of his three grown children to manage. That’s another reason to expect that the four giga factories Ambani announced this week — one each for solar panels batteries green hydrogen and fuel cells — is just the beginning. The push could very quickly become a shove.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Cooperman’s history and hedge fund performance go directly to Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 5 Stocks.

The hedge fund manager and American billionaire investor Leon Cooperman recently stated in an interview that the stock market will be down from a year from now amid rising inflation increasing taxes along with prospects for an interest rate hike. Though Omega Advisors chairman doesn’t see any immediate downside risk he still believes the long-term US economic outlook is not favorable as the world’s largest economy is pulling the demand forward. He says that the recent stock market rally was supported by sentiments that the economy will rebound but he is concerned that how long stocks could move higher on recovery projections. He is also worried about the rising government debt levels as well as the strategy of supporting the labor market through multi-trillion dollar stimulus packages.

""If you spoke to a hundred economists today and he asked them what their view is of the potential real growth of the US economy the response would be centered on 2%"" Cooperman said. ""We're growing this year four to five times potential yet the Fed is persistent in keeping interest rates at near zero. That doesn't make any great sense to me. It's just pushing people out on the risk curve.""

He is also showing concerns over the rising inflation with the expectation that the inflation number will move well over Fed’s expectations.

""I think that Mr. Powell will be surprised by inflation. It's not going to be as quiescent and transitory as he thinks. I think the Fed will be forced to say something before the end of 2022"" Cooperman said.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman who worked for Goldman Sachs for 25 years remained busy last year in adjusting his portfolio to cope with rapidly changing market dynamics. He significantly expanded his focus towards financial stocks since the beginning of last year. As of the end of the first quarter financial stocks accounted for more than 40% of $1.6 billion worth of Leon Cooperman’s 13F stock portfolio up significantly from 17.88% of portfolio weighting at the end of 2019. Interestingly instead of chasing big banking stocks the billionaire investor invested heavily in small and mid-cap loan and mortgage companies. In the past couple of quarters he also expressed confidence in business acquisition and development companies.

Story continues

Leon Cooperman who sits on a net worth of around $3.2 billion believes in the portfolio diversification strategy instead of a concentrated portfolio. He has well-diversified his stock portfolio towards value and growth stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Microsoft and Alphabet Inc may seem like growth stocks because of their growth rates but we actually classify especially Alphabet Inc as a value play because of its huge discount compared to sum of its parts as well as its peer's P/S multiples. The billionaire investor is also seeking to take advantage of the booming information technology communications and consumer discretionary sectors. Furthermore Leon Cooperman invested millions of dollars in real estate and energy stocks to capitalize on the economic recovery period. At the end of the first quarter the real estate sector represented 7.26% of the entire Leon Cooperman's portfolio while energy stocks weighted around 8.96%.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman grew up in a Jewish family in New York City after immigration from Poland. After completing his MBA degree from Columbia Business School in 1967 he joined Goldman Sachs and spent 22 years in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989 he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. He also headed GS Capital Growth Fund for more than 1 year. After retiring from Goldman Sachs he founded Omega Advisors and converted it into a family office fund in 2016.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 10 Stocks

While Leon Cooperman’s reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy more than 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 206.8% since then and beat the SPY's 91% gain.

Despite several portfolio adjustments billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about few stocks that he believes would perform well in 2021. Let start digging into 10 stocks billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about:

10. Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $51744000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.22% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25

Leon Cooperman has been holding a position in Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) since 2017 amid its strong dividend yield and steady share price upside potential. During the first quarter of 2021 Omega Advisors raised its stake in ET by 4% to 6.73 million shares valued at around $51.7 million. Shares of Energy Transfer LP rallied close to 90% since the beginning of this year thanks to improving energy prices and economic reopening.

9. Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $55990000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.49% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12

Leon Cooperman left his position unchanged in specialty materials company Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) in the first quarter of 2020. Fortunately shares of Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) saw a stunning share price rally of almost 50% so far this year driven by economic reopening. Furthermore reports are showing that Ferro to be acquired by Prince International in a $2.1B deal.

Ferro Corporation was in 12 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021 flat compared to the previous quarter. The all-time high for this statistic is 28.

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $57930000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 3.61% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 251

The tech giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is among the long-running stock holding of Omega Advisors. The firm first initiated a position in MSFT in 2015. At the end of the first quarter of 2021 Leon Cooperman held 245705 shares of Microsoft accounting for 3.61% of the overall portfolio. Shares of the tech giant are up 13% year to date followed by robust appreciation in the previous years. Moreover the company has the potential to offer double-digit dividend increase to investors.

ClearBridge Investments an investment management firm mentioned a few stocks including Microsoft Corporation in the first quarter investor letter. Here is what ClearBridge Investments stated:

“We also made adjustments to the portfolio’s top 10 holdings to increase the participation of select stocks. The FAANGs and Microsoft delivered mixed results during the quarter and we continue to be mindful of our weighting to these mega cap growth stocks to ensure they are not limiting our ability to add diversity through new ideas. Our repositioning has been encouraging so far with the portfolio performing better on up days in the market while maintaining good down capture during more turbulent sessions.”

7. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $68174000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 4.25% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52

In the past couple of quarters Devon Energy's stock price benefited from an improvement in oil prices. Its shares are up almost 95% since the beginning of this year. Devon’s dividend yield is close to 1.50%.

GoodHaven Capital Management a concentrated portfolio investment management firm highlighted a few stocks including Devon Energy in the first quarter investor letter. Here is what GoodHaven Capital Management stated:

“After a rough start to the year our two biggest energy holdings – WPX Energy rebounded materially in the last six months though energy was still our biggest detractor for the year. I’ve previously written about deciding earlier this year to direct new capital towards better businesses versus adding more to the energy sector but given the material optionality at WPX we opted to maintain a material exposure. Recently WPX announced an all stock merger with a larger competitor – Devon Energy – which will leave the new company with plenty of cash flow at lower oil prices less leverage and material upside to higher commodity prices.”

6. Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ASH)

Cooperman’s Stake Value: $71190000 Percentage of Leon Cooperman’s 13F Portfolio: 4.44% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36

Could deep-sea mining get the go ahead within two years?

The so-called ""two-year rule"" would compel the ISA to allow seabed mining to go ahead within two years effectively setting a deadline for the body to finalise mining regulations.

The source who was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be named said Nauru would send the request to the ISA on June 30.

Ambassador Margo Deiye permanent representative of Nauru to the ISA was not available for comment.

The Pacific island nation roughly 2800 miles (4506 km)northeast of Australia is a sponsoring state for The Metals Company formerly known as DeepGreen. The Metals Company plans to list on the Nasdaq next month in a merger with blank-check company Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp (SOAC.N).

Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea private mining companies must be sponsored by a state in order to do seabed mining. The Metals Co is also sponsored by Kiribati and Tonga.

Any ISA member state that either holds or sponsors a deep-sea exploration license for a private company can trigger the two-year rule. The ISA has not yet received any request to trigger the rule a spokesperson for the agency said.

Deep-Sea mining is targeting polymetallic nodules

Deep-sea mining involves sucking up potato-sized rocks (known as polymetallic nodules) that contain cobalt nickel and other battery metals and are strewn across the Pacific Ocean floor.

Some scientists and environmentalists have called for a ban on the practice saying too little is known about deep-sea ecosystems and mining could wipe out as-yet undiscovered species. Alphabet Inc's Google and BMW have called for a moratorium on the practice.

The Metals Company has argued that seabed mining will be more sustainable than mining on land producing less waste and fewer carbon dioxide emissions.

Based in Vancouver The Metals Company has said it aims to start mining in 2024 and expects exploitation regulations to be approved within the next two years. In regulatory filings the company raised the possibility that an ISA member state might trigger the rule. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.

Conservation groups have raised concerns about a fast-tracked timeline. The ISA postponed meetings set for July but this week said it aimed to hold in-person sessions later this year.

Matthew Gianni co-founder of the Deep-Sea Conservation Coalition said the ISA's review process must be properly finished and should not be pressured by the two-year countdown.

""Negotiations around regulations and the royalty regime are still underway and should not be rushed to meet an artificial deadline"" he told Reuters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3Blb3BsZS9nYXV0YW0tYWRhbmktaGFzLXRocmVlLXJlYXNvbnMtdG8td29ycnktYXMtbXVrZXNoLWFtYmFuaS1wbGFucy1hLWppby1mb3ItaW5kaWEtcy1ncmVlbi1lbmVyZ3ktc3BhY2UtMTE2MjQ2NzkzNDM4NzguaHRtbNIBpQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3Blb3BsZS9nYXV0YW0tYWRhbmktaGFzLXRocmVlLXJlYXNvbnMtdG8td29ycnktYXMtbXVrZXNoLWFtYmFuaS1wbGFucy1hLWppby1mb3ItaW5kaWEtcy1ncmVlbi1lbmVyZ3ktc3BhY2UvYW1wLTExNjI0Njc5MzQzODc4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gautam Adani has three reasons to worry as Mukesh Ambani plans a 'Jio' for India's green energy space | Mint,"Mukesh Ambani’s rivals should be relieved though perhaps not too much. The petrochemicals czar has just told shareholders that he’s undertaking his life’s “most challenging"" mission by investing 750 billion rupees ($10 billion) in clean power and fuel over three years.

It doesn’t appear to be a big capital commitment from India’s most powerful businessman certainly not when he’s just raised $44 billion of capital during a pandemic and made the $180 billion balance sheet of his flagship Reliance Industries Ltd. free of net debt.

But these are still early days for a decisive change in the energy mix of India’s largely coal-fueled economy. Ambani’s plans could easily turn as aggressive as his 4G telecom venture initially dismissed by naysayers as a me-too entry into a crowded field of a dozen players. In just five years Ambani’s digital startup has acquired 420 million-plus subscribers bankrupted several other operators and will soon launch one of the world’s cheapest smartphones in partnership with Alphabet Inc.’s Google. If he displays a similar hunger in solar energy other aspirants might have to rethink their strategies.

Among them may be France’s TotalEnergies SE which has picked up a 20% stake in Adani Green Energy Ltd. and invested directly in some of the projects in the firm’s 25 gigawatt solar-energy portfolio which has grown by 50 times in three years. Gautam Adani who earlier this year took his spot behind Ambani as Asia’s second-richest man wants to be the world’s largest renewable energy producer by 2030.

Will Ambani get in his way? Until now the two billionaires both hailing from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat have largely operated in their separate spheres. Ambani has leaned toward data-driven consumer businesses like retail and telecom whereas Adani has focused on infrastructure and utilities. Clean energy would see them overlap. Although Ambani’s initial plans aren’t overly dominant — he wants to meet 100 gigawatts of Modi’s green energy target of 450 gigawatts by 2030 — that’s probably because he’s yet to scope the policy terrain.

After spending $90 billion over the past decade Reliance Industries says it has the “capacity to catalyze"" another $200 billion in investment over the next 10 years. From a renewed focus on gas exploration to e-commerce over WhatsApp India’s largest business enterprise has many irons in the fire beyond clean energy. It also has deep pockets and influential friends like Google and Facebook Inc. Yasir Al-Rumayyan the head of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is joining the Reliance board. The goal which is running behind schedule is to have Aramco as a strategic partner in Reliance’s cash-spewing refinery on India’s west coast and reposition it at the center of a low-carbon oil-to-chemicals empire.

To support those initiatives Reliance has $13 billion of annual earnings before interest depreciation tax and amortization. Its foreign-currency debt is rated BBB by Fitch Ratings a notch higher than India’s government. Meanwhile the listed entities in the Adani Group have a little more than $3.5 billion of annual Ebitda and combined net debt in excess of $19 billion.

After a spectacular surge over the past year the smaller group’s share prices have wobbled recently amid concerns around some opaque foreign funds’ outsize exposure. That bout of nervousness has underscored the crucial role financing will play for Adani to realize his sprawling ambitions spanning India’s ports airports coal mining power generation and transmission gas supply warehousing and data centers.

It’s equally possible that the wealthier tycoon is spreading himself a tad too thin. Reliance is battling Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. in e-commerce and will soon be challenging Xiaomi Corp. with JioPhone Next custom-built by Google for the 300 million Indians still on 2G devices. Then there’s the foray into the unfamiliar world of technology services: Not only does Ambani want to be the first off the block with 5G in India he also aims to sell to other telecom operators globally competing perhaps with Huawei Technologies Co.

Adani is impatient to grow because he wants to diversify cash flows beyond his successful port business and catch the inevitable resource boom as the average earnings of India’s 1.4 billion people go from low-middle-income to high-middle-income. What is Ambani’s hurry?

To stuff clean energy into a packed catchall shows that the 64-year-old may be getting serious about succession planning. Mukesh Ambani’s own past battle with younger brother Anil for a division of family assets would be a reminder that he needs to use Reliance’s cost-of-capital advantage to nurture self-sustaining conglomerates for each of his three grown children to manage. That’s another reason to expect that the four giga factories Ambani announced this week — one each for solar panels batteries green hydrogen and fuel cells — is just the beginning. The push could very quickly become a shove.

When climate researcher Dailson Bertassoli went to measure greenhouse gas emissions at the Belo Monte hydropower plant in Brazil the first thing he noticed was the bubbles.

Developers have built hundreds of hydroelectric plants in the Amazon basin to take advantage of the allegedly ""green"" energy generated by its complex of rivers.

But climate researchers now know hydropower is not as good for the environment as once assumed. Though no fossil fuels are burned the reservoirs release millions of tons of methane and carbon dioxide as vegetation decays underwater.

So called run-of-river (ROR) dams like Belo Monte along the Xingu River which have smaller reservoirs and channels allowing reduced river flow were meant to address the problem but a study Friday in Science Advances found that has not been the case.

Bertassoli's team studied methane and carbon dioxide emissions during Belo Monte's first two years of operation and compared the results to levels prior to the reservoirs being filled finding a threefold increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

""Once you have the flooding of dry land the organic matter that was trapped in the soil starts to degrade"" the professor of geology and climate change at the University of Sao Paulo told AFP.

These were the source of the bubbles he saw at one of the plant's reservoirs.

""Instead of a natural river we now have a reactor that favors the production of methane"" he added.

And as fellow author and climate researcher Henrique Sawakuchi pointed out these ""smaller"" reservoirs are still quite large with the largest on a partly dammed river where dead trees stand starkly white amid vast stagnant green channels.

Sawakuchi's brother Andre Sawakuchi a University of Sao Paulo professor focusing on climate change and river systems who also participated in the study added that this analysis highlights two issues to consider when building hydropower plants in the region.

One is the local environmental impact on aquatic species unique to the area"" he told AFP. ""The other is the social impact to indigenous communities that live along the river.""

Checkered history

Indigenous and environmental groups protested the Belo Monte's proposed construction back in the 1990s causing it to be abandoned before being revived again as an ROR plant in 2011.

Environmental groups protested the loss of the forest that had to be cleared for the site while indigenous groups resisted the loss of flooded land and redirected or siphoned natural river flow.

Andre Sawakuchi argues it is important to keep the Amazon flowing despite increasing energy needs and not to ""disrupt this natural cycle with hydropower plants of any type.

""This is the pulse of the river"" he said. ""With a hydroplant there is no more pulse.""

The authors concluded in their study that if Brazil must continue to build ROR dams along the Amazon then it is important to at least avoid flooding vegetation thereby increasing greenhouse gases.

A 2019 study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that some of the world's hydropower plants are carbon sinks—meaning they take in more carbon through photosynthesis by organisms living in the water than they emit through decomposition—while others are net emitters.

""There is no utopia here"" Bertassoli said. ""Especially for countries that look so hard at hydropower as a sustainable 'green' answer to their energy needs.""

Airlines are discovering they retired too many aircraft during the pandemic and let go too many pilots and flight attendants.

Southwest Airlines says it doesn't have enough planes to sustain its model in 2022 and 2023.

Airline schedules are highly unreliable as a result leading to flight changes and cancellations.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Travel is surging in the US and airlines are once again faced with shortages but it's more than just pilots this time.

Many US carriers shed older aircraft from their fleets in a cash-saving effort during the worst times of the pandemic. At the time vaccines a distant dream and travel demand wasn't expected to rebound for years.

""The airlines were being forced to make very complex decisions under enormous pressure"" Henry Harteveldt travel industry analyst and cofounder of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider. ""Key among them is: How do you bring your costs down to survive an approximately 96% decline in demand?""

But Southwest Airlines after accelerating the retirement of 737-700 aircraft in 2020 is now saying that the airline's current fleet won't be enough to support the carrier's business model in the upcoming years and could hinder expansion efforts.

""We don't feel like we have enough airplanes for 2022 and 2023 and that's just doing what you know us to be famous for"" Gary Kelly Southwest's chief executive officer CNBC referring to its current business of mostly domestic flying.

Now that demand is ramping up airlines might find themselves without enough planes to keep up and Southwest isn't the only airline that shed planes during the pandemic. Delta Air Lines similarly parted with three fleet types including the McDonnell-Douglas MD-80/MD-90 Boeing 737-700 and Boeing 777-200 series of aircraft.

Those aircraft now sit in storage facilities and bringing them back into service would be too great of an expense for airlines according to Richard Aboulafia vice president of analysis for Teal Group. New builds from manufacturers including the Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A220 are preferable but come at a slower rate.

The aircraft shortage is also compounded by the age-old pilot shortage with not even pilots to fly the ambitious schedules that airlines have set. American Airlines saw the impacts of over-scheduling in mid-June when hundreds of flights were canceled in a single weekend thanks to a combination of labor shortages and severe weather.

""The pilot shortage that loomed over the industry in 2019 may have abated slightly but it hasn't gone away"" Harteveldt said.

Airlines moved to shed staff last year including pilots and flight attendants through buyouts and voluntary separation programs in a bid to lower costs. But just like with aircraft some may have parted ways with too many now that demand is rebounding.

""Perhaps they had lost more pilots and flight attendants than they otherwise would have wanted and as a result that may have reduced their ability to scale up their flying as demand returned"" Harteveldt said.







Shortages stemming from massive staff reductions also could've been avoided since airlines were the recipients of three rounds of federal stimulus money.

""I think that the airlines would probably admit – privately if not on the record – that perhaps they should have been less aggressive in encouraging employees to the pilots and flight attendants to take buyouts and leave the company when the government was going to cover 70% of those employees' wages"" Harteveldt said.

Delta has committed to hire and train 1000 new pilots between now and next summer and United has launched a pilot training program Aviate that provides financing options and a pathway to flying its aircraft for students.

Airline schedules are now highly unreliable and travelers booking flights should be prepared for unexpected changes or cancellations. Changes to airline schedules can occur anytime and travelers should frequently be checking their bookings to see if changes have occurred.

If an airline has changed a traveler's trip they have the right to request a new flight or even a refund if the change is great enough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNDQ3OTIxL2hvdy1zZXJ2aW5nLW9uZS1sZXNzLW9saXZlLXBlci1zYWxhZC1zYXZlZC1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy0xMDAwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Serving One Less Olive Per Salad Saved American Airlines $100000,"How Serving One Less Olive Per Salad Saved American Airlines $100000

In marketing circles there is the legend of the $100000 olive. As ABC recounted in 2001 Robert Crandall the head of American Airlines in the 1980s calculated that he could save the company $100000 a year though Forbes and other sources peg the amount at $40000. They could be counting for inflation though US Inflation Calculator finds that $40000 in 1980 would only be worth $85922.33 in 2001. The point however is that Crandall figured a good wheeze for squeezing some extra savings.

The trick was to remove one olive from every salad served. No passenger Crandall thought would notice if a single olive had been removed. Such a reduction of course scales to a large amount when you consider how many people fly with American Airlines in a year.

Since then the American Airlines olive has ascended to the realm of business management lore which is probably an added reason for the confusion in savings. In the smallest details great amounts of money can be found. That some claim is the lesson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjYvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlybGluZXMtY2FwaXRvbC12aW9sZW5jZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flight Attendants Complain of 'Mob Mentality' in Air,"One flight attendant needed medical attention for a crippling migraine brought on by confronting a passenger who refused to wear a mask.

Dance Moms

More than a decade ago a new show debuted about a take-no-prisoners dance studio owner and her talented competitive dancers with their even more competitive helicopter mothers. The Lifetime reality show Dance Moms was anchored by the brash studio owner of Abby Lee Dance Company and now star Abby Lee Miller. Miller is the daughter of local dance legend Maryen Lorrain who started her own studios in Pittsburgh with significant success.

The brash owner of the dance studio Abby Lee Miller has had a tough time since the show began. In 2010 owing $400000 in back taxes on her Penn Hills studio in North Pittsburgh PA. She filed bankruptcy but as the show continued onward investigators found evidence that she had lied about her income:

“Both the IRS and FBI investigated Miller and found that she had hidden $775000of her income from the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings according to the Associated Press. It was also found out that in 2014 Miller had friends divide and smuggle $120000 that she earned from her Dance Moms Australia masterclass tour into the United States from Australia. This violated the customs and immigration requirements to declare any cash over $10000.” – Woman’s Day

Miller reached a plea deal on her 20 counts of bankruptcy fraud and sentenced to a year and one day in prison plus penalties of $160000. She served ten months before an early release in April 2018 when she was diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma; she was transferred to a halfway house for treatment.

Incident in Pittsburgh

In 2019 Miller was on an American Airlines flight back to Pittsburgh. Disabled by her spinal variant of Hodgkin Lymphoma she was bound to a wheelchair. Miller claims that staff was to wait until the flight emptied then transfer her to her personal wheelchair on the aircraft rather than the airport’s wheelchair.

“But at the airport she said airline employees transferred her from the plane seat to an airline wheelchair instead of her own wheelchair. They then moved her to the terminal gate while she waited for them to get her wheelchair from the plane. When it came they tried to transfer her and dropped her according to the complaint within view of a crowd.” – Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

She was later moved by the airport’s fire department to her own wheelchair in the gate area. Miller claims she suffered injuries related to the fall and was unable to attend medical therapy for a spinal infection.

Frivolous Lawsuit

Miller’s suit is filed against American Airlines Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) and the Allegheny County Airport Authority. If there was any doubt as to whether or not the suit was frivolous this is a good indicator. Allegheny Airport Authority manages PIT so suing both is already unnecessary.

Further American Airlines staff do not operate wheelchair assistance for their customers. They act as a facilitator in summoning the third-party company but American’s staff do not push the chairs. That third-party operator is not named in the suit though PIT could bear the responsibility as the contractor of those services.

The incident took place on July 6 2019. The wheels of justice turn slowly but this seems like an extraordinarily long time to file suit. It no doubt follows months of settlement discussions without a successful outcome.

While embarrassing and perhaps even traumatic it would be difficult to measure the long-term damage caused by this fall. In her condition I am sure it was painful and may have set back her progress but there’s no further specific injury named in the brief.

If this were an injurious event specific maladies resulting from the fall would have been named the lawsuit would have been filed sooner and would have named the contracting party responsible. However the contracted third-party wouldn’t be able to draw the attention of a suit against American and PIT nor would it have the backing to award a large sum either in judgement nor in a settlement.

Given the aforementioned legal troubles and financial issues of Abby Lee Miller and her proclivity to act with impunity in judicial matters it’s not surprising that she filed suit. It also casts doubt on the veracity of her claims.

Conclusion

Abby Lee Miller will be hard-pressed to find much sympathy despite her unfortunate physical condition. The dance instructor that screamed at crying children to “cry on your pillows at home” and was ruthless with the mothers that paid her wages won’t garner much support from the public at large. The court will treat the suit with some prejudice given her financial motivation and prior concealment of financial information. It will also factor the Customs declaration evasion when she smuggled $120000 from work in Australia to avoid $10000 cash declaration requirements. The court may toss the suit out entirely on the basis that she’s not naming the correct defendants. I’m sure her fall was painful and embarrassing but so is this attempted extortion.

What do you think? Was American Airlines PIT or its governing board responsible for her safe transfer? Should the suit be tossed out or should she be awarded damages?"

The Northeast Louisiana Electric Power Cooperative will vote on Tuesday to borrow $50 million to set up the infrastructure for broadband access in its coverage area.

Co-op board member Thad Waters opposes the co-op's foray into broadband service.

""I think that is unwise. I think it's illegal I think it could possibly lead to the bankruptcy and loss of the co-op itself"" Waters said. ""Northeast Power was organized 83 years ago in 1938. Its mission is to provide electric power and there's nothing its charter that says anything about having subsidiaries and working in other areas.""

The venture would be in direct competition with Conexon an internet service provider in Kansas City Missouri which was awarded $33 million in federal funds to build a fiber broadband network for the region according to Waters.

Those funds were granted through President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act which prioritized spending on internet infrastructure for local governments.

The Northeast Louisiana Electric Power Cooperative serves electric customers in Franklin Madison Richland Tensas East Carroll West Carroll and Morehouse parishes.

When contacted for this story board members Weldon Fitch Alton Welch Jr. Charles Hixon Steve Pylant Ronald Pippin and Richard Strong all declined to comment.

For thousands of Louisiana households and businesses affordable high-speed internet is out of reach making simple tasks of modern living such as internet browsing online shopping or watching a YouTube video often impossible.

The problem is particularly acute in Louisiana's rural communities — where residents are widely dispersed and internet providers have little incentive to shell out the capital it takes to install fiber cables the gold standard of broadband capabilities.

Recently published data from the Federal Communications Commission suggests that the need for affordable internet is greater in Louisiana than other states as Louisiana saw the largest number of households approved for a $50 per month home internet stipend this spring per capita than any other state.

More than 81000 Louisiana households applied for and received the stipend through the FCC’s Emergency Broadband Benefit program which was launched in May. That amounts to 1750 households per 100000 residents in Louisiana far above the next nearest state which was Kentucky at 1576 per 100000 residents.

The meeting of the co-op board is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday at the co-op's office at 150 Christian Drive in Rayville.

MGM Resorts International will flip on the switch Monday to a 100-megawatt solar array that will power 13 Strip properties and 36000 hotel rooms.

The power-up plan will provide a long stride toward the company’s energy sustainability goals.

The Mega Solar Array project was developed in partnership with Invenergy — a privately held developer and operator of sustainable energy projects — and structured through a 20-year power purchase agreement.

In early 2021 Invenergy sold a 75 percent interest in the MGM Resorts Mega Solar Array to AEP Renewables a subsidiary of American Electric Power one of the nation’s largest electric companies. Invenergy Services a subsidiary of Invenergy will provide operations and maintenance and balance-of-plant services under a long-term agreement.

The array is the largest maintained by a resort company and is expected to provide 90 percent of MGM’s daylight power needs.

“With MGM Resorts’ significant scale and resources we’re positioned to make a meaningful difference in the fight against climate change and we recognize our responsibility to build a more environmentally sustainable future” said Bill Hornbuckle CEO and president of MGM Resorts. “Today we’re marking a significant step forward in our environmental sustainability initiatives in Las Vegas and our long-term vision to protect the planet and achieve an enduring positive impact in our communities worldwide.”

MGM’s Mega Solar Array is located on 640 acres in the desert north of Las Vegas. It has 323000 solar panels and provides the equivalent of power used by 27000 homes. Among the resorts that will benefit from the power grid are Bellagio Aria Mandalay Bay MGM Grand and The Mirage.

Several dignitaries and MGM executives will attend the launch of the use of the array.

In attendance will be Gov. Steve Sisolak Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen D-Nev. Michael Polsky founder and CEO of Invenergy and Greg Hall executive vice president of AEP Energy Supply.

From MGM will be Jyoti Chopra chief people inclusion and sustainability officer Rose McKinney James chair of the MGM board of directors sustainability committee and Hornbuckle.

So straighten your fedoras and do up your most dashing six-button vest because we’re going for a cruise in a classically inspired electric roadster chaps! And we’re going to do it on budget too.

I’m not entirely sure what vintage we should call this little motorcar. But it’s giving me something close to late Gatsby-esque vibes so that’s what I’m going to go with.

This glam electric two-seater may come from Zhejiang China but it’s got early Americana written all over it.

From the giant sweeping fenders to the gold embellished grille this spirited specimen is ready for a cruise down a long since forgotten Fifth Avenue. Just imagine the hoo-ha I could be raising as I roll up to my favorite clip joint in style just as soon as I call for my butler Baxter to bring me my driving shoes.

I may need them too because with a top speed of 65 km/h (40 mph) this little EV actually has more pep in its step than most of the Chinese electric cars we’ve seen.

Just don’t get too carried away old sport as the lack of seat belts seems to imply a similar crash-test rating to the very vehicles that inspired this knock-off time capsule. I’m not sure if the seat belt-less design is a nod toward authenticity or a cost-saving measure but we’ll give the factory the benefit of the doubt that it’s all about throwing the driver back in time (and not through the air into a stop sign).





The dandy little roadster sports a 72V and 50Ah battery that offers 3.6 kWh of capacity. The factory calls that good enough for around 100 km (60 miles) of range.

There’s even an 1800 W motor hidden under the lively bodywork somewhere though the 70A controller seems to imply that the motor is going to get a bit toasty with nearly 5000W of electrical power.

A mere 2.5 horsepower might not sound like much but our debonair test driver in this factory video seems to take it on a sprightly ride up a moderate hill just fine.

True to form for any self-respecting quasi-vintage electric roadster this motorcar comes full of fancy features.

A cupholder conveniently finds its way in between the two bucket seats surely ready to hold your driving whiskey after the recent repealing of Prohibition.

A pair of tail lights blinks yellow for some reason and their dazzling appearance in every product video seems to imply that their flashing isn’t a choice.

There’s even a spare tire adorning the rear of the car though I’m not sure if a pair of white gloves is packed away with a gentleman’s jack for roadside repairs.

But with a shockingly low price of just $2800 for the car you can surely afford to add the gloves yourself. The price feels giddily vintage just like the car. And the shipping cost of $200 seems to defy logic in the same way the vehicle defies Father Time himself.

As much fun as something like this would be I’m going to sit this one out while I wait for the last Chinese electric car I bought from Alibaba to arrive.

And despite my lively sales pitch I’m not actually suggesting anyone plop down three grand for their own fantastical vintage roadster.

Alibaba can be a tricky place to navigate. Some readers have actually purchased the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicles of the Week that I’ve covered but it’s an exercise solely for the brave.

Instead it’s probably a better idea to just window shop like the rest of us and stick to cruising around in a snappy little electric two-seater in our dreams.

And then it fizzled in months.

By the time the 2019 Mazda CX-5 Skyactiv-D finally arrived in 2019 diesel was on the verge of irrelevance outside of bigger trucks intended to haul long distances. Several intriguing EVs its size were about to hit the market. Hybrids beat it in fuel efficiency price and performance.

That’s essentially the tl;dr version for this model which in quick retrospect was a last whimper of the passenger-vehicle diesel for the U.S. market. If you really want one it’s going to take some patience. As of this past week I couldn’t find a single used or certified pre-owned one in a search of dealerships.

Mazda confirmed in January that after evaluating consumer demand it would no longer offer the diesel in the U.S. market—although it would continue to advance its diesel tech globally. It still won’t say exactly how many it ended up delivering but we suspect it’s in the very low thousands—mostly to people who had waited for them.

A decade in the making

A little context and history is in order. Ironically given the Volkswagen diesel scandal it was VW that Mazda had seemed to be chasing into the U.S. market initially with its long-winded diesel project. I was one of those eagerly anticipating the engine then badged Sky-D—many years ago before long-range mass-market EV options and before hybrids and PHEVs accelerated their evolution.

Mazda originally touted that with its active ceramic diesel particulate filter there was no need for urea exhaust treatment. Company officials said that it would be the cleanest diesel for the North American market—cleaner than the versions of VW’s TDI engine at the time. Mazda boasted that its approach which relied on a lower compression ratio and more even combustion would likely result in lower levels of the fine particulates that have been the subject of greater public health concern in the past decade.

Mazda CX-5 Skyactiv-D Mazda CX-5 Skyactiv-D Mazda CX-5 Skyactiv-D

An early drive in 2011 was promising and I found this combination to be very perky and engaging.

The engine which was announced in 2010 and originally due to arrive in 2012 in the Mazda 6 sedan was touted as being capable of reaching an EPA rating of 43 miles per gallon highway better than the Toyota Camry Hybrid and at that time Ford Fusion Hybrid and Hyundai Sonata Hybrid.

Hybrids have advanced tremendously in efficiency though. The Camry Hybrid and Sonata Hybrid both hit an EPA combined 52 mpg today. Shifting more to the CX-5’s form factor the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid and Honda CR-V Hybrid achieve 40 mpg and 38 mpg combined respectively.

A series of delays did bring the engine to the U.S.—retuned with the addition of urea injection. Based on some time with the CX-5 Skyactiv-D in August 2019 I found it didn't deliver what had been promised all along.

Underwhelming numbers for the driving experience

Today or nearly two years ago none of the numbers are particularly compelling. In its final U.S. spec the engine made 168 horsepower and 290 pound-feet of torque it was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission and only came in all-wheel-drive form. The Signature all-wheel-drive model I tested—the only way to get it—was optioned up with a roof rack a trailer hitch and a few other accessories bringing the total MSRP to $44040 and its window sticker listed EPA ratings of 27 mpg city 30 highway 28 combined.

Mazda CX-5 Skyactiv-D

I gulped at the value proposition thinking that I could have a luxury brand plug-in hybrid for that money—or a few months later a Tesla Model Y.

Temperatures were mostly in the 80s and I ran errands for several days mostly short trips and was rather shocked to see the CX-5 had averaged less than 21 mpg over around 50 miles of driving. The Skyactiv-D was a little rougher and coarser than Mazda’s gasoline engine in the CX-5 until it fully warmed up reaching a smooth purr of a low idle but I never smelled even a whiff of diesel outside of when I was filling it.

I’d just been in a RAV4 Hybrid a couple of weeks earlier and noted that the Toyota had felt quicker around town. A substantial turbo lag at lower speeds delayed quick responses and it was lazier to rev than earlier versions.

Mazda CX-5 Skyactiv-D

I then took the CX-5 on a 245-mile loop past Mt. Hood and through high desert and part of the Columbia Gorge on a mix of two-lane highways and 65-mph freeway stretches keeping close to the speed limit but not hesitating to enjoy the CX-5’s nimble handling and comfortable cabin. The Skyactiv-D which several test sources have pegged at about 9 seconds to 60 mph isn’t quick but particularly on curvy roads around Mt. Hood keeping the engine on boost it was rewarding to drive and felt stronger than gas or hybrid alternatives.

Mazda CX-5 Skyactiv-D

Over that trip my average was 31 mpg according to the trip computer confirmed at that according to a precise fuel fill. Because that result had been a bit disappointing versus what I’d expected I ran the CX-5 diesel on an out-and-back 65-70-mph highway trip covering 118 miles in all and resulting in an indicated 33.5-mpg average—less than I’ve seen in recent versions of the RAV4 Hybrid and CR-V Hybrid.

Diesel era is long over—even for niche models

Diesel is more expensive than gasoline. When I drove the Skyactiv-D I noted that diesel costs about 15 cents more a gallon versus gasoline. Now on a national average the difference is even more pronounced. The last time I’d tested a gasoline CX-5 I got within 2 mpg of my 31 mpg trip total and without seeing close to the claimed numbers around town I just don’t see how the numbers would ever bear out in favor of diesel over the life of the vehicle.

Mazda CX-5 Skyactiv-D

The diesel era for passenger cars in the U.S. didn’t reach an actual choke point until sometime in 2020 during the pandemic—a lung-related one. It's no coincidence that was when automakers were making larger commitments to EVs and big battery supply announcements.

Diesel isn’t just big heavy-breathing pickups but this year the selection of diesels offered in the U.S. without a pickup bed has been winnowed down to just a handful of models: the Jeep Wrangler the Land Rover Range Rover and Range Rover Sport and GM’s full-size SUVs the Cadillac Escalade the GMC Yukon and the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban.

Green Car Reports will keep taking a pragmatic look at what each of those models provide. But the environmental advantages of EVs are undeniable and with the arrival of trucks like the Rivian R1T the Ford F-150 Lightning GMC Hummer EV SUT and the Tesla Cybertruck among pickups and the Rivian R1S and GMC Hummer EV SUV among other electric trucks on the way that window of opportunity is closing rapidly.

What’s ahead: Plenty of quirk yet with EV+rotary and Skyactiv-X six

Mazda announced a large-scale electrification strategy earlier this month including a dedicated EV platform by 2025 plus various hybrids and plug-in hybrids. The MX-30 electric crossover is also coming to the U.S. later this year with a range-extended version expected to join the lineup with a version of Mazda’s rotary engine.

2022 Mazda MX-30

In the meantime Mazda also confirmed to Green Car Reports this past week that it’s continuing development on its Skyactiv-X homogeneous charge compression ignition engine—including making it a 6-cylinder engine.

These technologies take a massive amount of engineering resources and just because a company is capable of perfecting them doesn’t mean that—like chasing VW’s TDI—they should. But Mazda’s role as an automotive outlier making different decisions than other big automakers will fuel a lot of exciting vehicles yet and we look forward to them. They’ll almost certainly make more sense than this diesel did.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0ci5vcmcvY29ubmVjdGljdXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the Republican Tax Cuts Are Helping Connecticut,"Connecticut is benefiting greatly from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted by Republicans in 2017:

213800 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s doubling of the child tax credit.

Every income group in every Connecticut congressional district received a tax cut. Nationwide a typical family of four received a $2000 annual tax cut and a single parent with one child received a $1300 annual tax cut.

1028380 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s doubling of the standard deduction. Thanks to the tax cuts nine out of ten households take the standard deduction which provides tax relief and simplifies the tax filing process.

45200 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s elimination of the Obamacare individual mandate tax. Most households hit with this tax made less than $50000 per year.

Lower utility bills: As a direct result of the TCJA’s corporate tax rate cut Connecticut residents are saving money on utility bills. Lower electric water and gas bills help households and small businesses operating on tight margins. For example at least eight Connecticut utilities reduced their customers’ bills (see below).

Thanks to the tax cuts Connecticut businesses of all sizes are hiring expanding raising pay and increasing employee benefits:

Charter Communications Inc. (Stamford Connecticut) – Base wage raised to $15 per hour; commitment to hire over 20000 employees by 2020:

With the resources and investment confidence resulting from historic tax reform legislation and the FCC’s removal of the 1930’s era regulatory framework for internet service Charter is increasing our investment in our workforce by ensuring all employees are paid a minimum wage of at least $15 per hour including target commissions within the next year.

In addition the reforms in Washington are allowing Charter to increase its capital investment including in its broadband network. Last year given the general deregulatory environment and anticipating the Administration Congress and the FCC enacting these pro-growth policies we announced we would hire 20000 employees and invest $25 billion in infrastructure.

Today with tax reform and the removal of the Title II statutory framework both a reality Charter will continue the capital investment program we started last year and will complete it by 2020. In 2017 we extended the reach of our high-speed broadband network in rural areas like Meeker CO Lakeview OR Hawthorne NV as well as to more than 42000 underserved and unserved homes and businesses in New York State. Charter remains steadfast in our commitment to continue to bring our broadband service with a minimum speed of 100 Mbps to more communities across the country. – Feb. 2 2018 Charter Communications Inc. statement

Thomas Hooker Brewery (Bloomfield Connecticut) – The brewery used savings from the tax cut to expand the business and create new jobs:

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says a federal tax credit for small-scale breweries distilleries and wineries has helped create jobs in Connecticut.

The tax credit for small scale alcohol producers was initially part of the 2017 Trump tax cut. It’s been extended in the bipartisan federal budget passed by Congress last month. Blumenthal says he opposed Trump’s tax cuts to big business but this particular tax cut is for small businesses and is a job creator.

“These craft breweries put the savings back into their businesses. They create jobs. They produce more beer. They meet demand. And they provide good value.”

Blumenthal spoke at Thomas Hooker Brewery in Bloomfield. Brewery owner Curt Cameron agrees that he’s putting 100% of his tax cut back into his business “in our case a brand-new pizza kitchen which is an offshoot of our existing business. It will create at least seven jobs immediately.”

If the tax break had not been extended craft breweries like Thomas Hooker would have faced a federal excise tax increase of 400% this year. – Dec. 31 2019 WSHU article.

Shortway Brewing Co. (Newport Connecticut) — Increasing wages and hiring new employees:

Mr. Shortway said the new tax plan along with the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act also passed last year have already helped the brewery save money. The craft beverage act greatly reduced excise taxes on small-scale brewers and the tax plan has additional provisions designed to help small businesses.

Mr. Shortway said he was able to give his employees a small raise and hire more workers as a result of the tax savings. He said although it is a bit early to know what the long-term impact of the tax plan will be he expects it will keep helping going forward.

“Growth is picking up” he said. – May 11 2018 News-Times article excerpt

The Travelers Companies Inc. (Hartford Connecticut) — $1000 bonuses for 14000 employees with a base salary less than $75000:

Today comprehensive U.S. tax reform has been signed into law. One objective of the legislation is to spur economic growth and therefore the U.S. economy.

In addition to benefiting from economic growth Travelers will benefit directly from the legislation in two important ways. First like all companies our corporate tax rate will decrease from 35% to 21%. Second the legislation will level the playing field for U.S. insurers by eliminating a loophole that foreign insurers have used to our disadvantage for decades to move their U.S. profits offshore to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.

One of the opportunities all of these benefits create for us is to make additional investments in our business. I shared at a recent all-employee meeting that our vision as it relates to investment and innovation is to strengthen our competitive advantages with two goals in mind: be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers.

The leadership team decided that given our confidence in our business and the way we are successfully positioned for the opportunities ahead we should start making additional investments immediately. We also came to the conclusion that we should use the opportunity to make our first investment in our most valuable asset and greatest competitive advantage — our people.

I’m pleased to announce that we will be giving approximately 14000 employees with a base salary of $75000 per year or less and who meet our performance expectations a special one-time bonus of $1000. The bonus will be paid in January to then current employees. Eligible employees will hear more shortly.

In addition while we have only a small number of U.S.-based employees making less than $15 an hour we will increase their hourly wage to $15. – The Travelers Companies Inc. note to employees

The Sunrise Is All Some Travelers Need. (Published 2021),"One year into the coronavirus pandemic after months of gaining weight and feeling groggy Mayra Ramirez stopped drinking. And this summer she’ll mark a new milestone for her sobriety: a completely alcohol-free vacation.

Ms. Ramirez 32 spent the first 12 months of the pandemic working remotely from a tiny Brooklyn apartment drinking every weekend and many weekday evenings as well. In March like many others during this hard year she realized her drinking was spiraling beyond the merely social kind. She has now been sober for three months. So when she began scouting locations for a break with a few non-sober friends she suggested Sedona Ariz. where they all will hike and wake up early and she will avoid potential pitfalls like nightclubs and beachfront bars.

Many Americans turned to alcohol to blunt the stress isolation and fear of the past 15 months: An October study in JAMA Network Open the journal of the American Medical Association found that Americans were drinking 14 percent more than in the previous year. Now as vaccination levels rise and Americans head back to the roads and skies sober travel a subset of vacations once relegated only to 12-steppers and recovering addicts is going mainstream.

Ditching the drinks

In a June poll of more than 23000 people by Branded Research 29 percent of respondents said they planned to take an alcohol-free trip after the pandemic. Forty-seven percent of the respondents to American Express’s Global Travel Trends Report in March said that wellness and mental health were among their top motivators for travel in 2021 and an analysis of social media chatter from Hootsuite a social-media management platform showed mentions of the term “sober vacation” jumping more than 100 percent over Memorial Day weekend. Even airlines are going dry: After banning booze in the cabin in 2020 several airlines are postponing a return to serving alcohol thanks to unruly passengers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hlbGVyb2Jzb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi93aGljaC1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtdG8tc3RheS1hdC1pbi0yMDIxLWluLW1hbHRhLWFuZC1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LXRoZS1iZXN0LXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Luxury Hotel To Stay At In 2021 In Malta And How To Get The Best Price,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelerobson/2021/06/26/which-luxury-hotel-to-stay-at-in-2021-in-malta-and-how-to-get-the-best-price/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hlbGVyb2Jzb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi93aGljaC1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtdG8tc3RheS1hdC1pbi0yMDIxLWluLW1hbHRhLWFuZC1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LXRoZS1iZXN0LXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

I love to sit on my balcony and watch as the city wakes up. In the hour just after dawn you can still hear the call of geckos and the songs of birds. It’s never really cold here but at that time the air is relatively cool and the smell of fresh-baked empanadas de leche wafts up to my fourth-floor balcony. Time to put on coffee and think about what I have planned for the day.

There’s no need to be up early but it’s a habit I never lost after I moved here in July 2017. I’d been the typical driven executive when I lived in Vancouver Canada. My life was spreadsheets reports meetings commuting donuts at my desk for lunch out before dawn home after dark.

Looking back it’s obvious something had to give. But although it was me who was living the unhealthy lifestyle it was my husband Ron who succumbed. He was a self-employed mechanic who always seemed to have a stress-free working life. When he passed away in January 2017 from a stroke I just didn’t see it coming.

I moved to San Salvador because it was the first place I could find with a school that was willing to employ an English teacher with no experience. I was desperate to get away from Vancouver and everything that was there after Ron passed away. I gave notice to my employer registered our house with a rental agency and sold pretty much everything but photographs in yard sales.

Teaching boisterous teenagers and giggling children wasn’t as simple as I expected but I loved teaching adults learning about their lives and helping them with their careers and prospects.

In return I gathered a group of willing guides who were so kind to me in those early days that I blush to think about it now. I was invited to homes shown around the city brought to the beach just taken under the wing of these wonderful kind people who must have recognized that I was in need even though I never discussed my past with them.

I didn’t really need a job here—I pay $700 a month now for a two-bedroom condo in a building with 24-hour security a lovely concierge and balconies on two sides. It’s more luxurious than I need really but the rental of my place in Vancouver more than covers it plus I have a few investments which top up my income.These days I choose to work because I like it.These days I choose to work because I like it. I do one-on-one conversation classes with adults which feels more like chatting with a friend than anything I could describe as work. We meet in cafés or in a city park and talk for an hour; I correct their grammar and vocabulary. I usually continue beyond the allotted time because it’s so easy.

I’m considering buying a place here soon once we see how things settle down after the coronavirus. The San Francisco area of San Salvador is a delightful international area with leafy parks and little cafés artisan stores and independent restaurants. I have everything I need here. I buy groceries from the Mercado Urbano a few blocks north of my apartment for next to nothing. I go to yoga twice a week with a group of international friends at Peace and Yoga near the German School. Things are a little upside-down at the moment due to the pandemic but my plan is to apply for a retirement visa soon. I’m eligible in age; I just need to show proof of a $1000 per month income which is within my means.

I pay out of pocket for any medical treatments I need from my English-speaking doctor Luis who charges just $30 for a visit. My dentist José Prieto is very reasonable too (a new crown on one of my top teeth cost $350 including a full cleaning and check-up). I live half-an-hour from the beach at La Libertad (although I’m not really a beach gal so I don’t go often. When I do it’s a $2 bus ride from the city).

It was a tough time when I first got here. I think I would have gone anywhere just to change my life. I’m glad I ended up here though. El Salvador still has a reputation that it doesn’t deserve. In fact it’s safer than a lot of Latin American countries the roads are the best in Central America and it’s super affordable. The president Nayib Bukele has stamped down hard on the gang violence and corruption that held the country back for decades and has been decisive in his response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the end of the civil war in 1992 El Salvador suffered from pretty bad government for years but my experience here is that it’s a country with a bright future. I feel as safe here as I ever did in Vancouver.

As for the countryside—that has to be the most unexpected joy of all. What can I tell you? Untracked jungle forests Maya ruins spectacular beaches fantastic weather stuffed pupusas (cornmeal flatbreads) and prices that look like Mexico from 30 years ago—El Salvador’s a tiny country but it has a whole lot of heart.

The protests embarrassed the government which was ready to celebrate both independence and the centenary of the birth of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman — also the father of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

The protests were led by Hefazat-e-Islam but saw participation by students in Dhaka. Government offices and private property were burned down in Chittagong and Brahmanbaria in Eastern Bangladesh from 25–27 March 2021. Seventeen protestors died in clashes with law enforcement agencies. Hundreds of activists and top leaders of Hefazat-e-Islam have been detained.

Hefazat-e-Islam is an Islamist movement based in Qawmi Madrasas. Bangladesh has two distinct madrasa education systems Qawmi Madrasas which are not regulated by the government and Alia Madrasas where the curriculum is provided by the government along with funding.

Hefazat-e-Islam formed in January 2010 to protest the Women Development Policy draft and other policies they perceived as anti-Islamic. The group came to prominence in 2013 when it staged violent protests in Dhaka demanding that the government enact a blasphemy law that would sentence critics of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad to death.

Since 2013 Hefazat-e-Islam has established a more productive relationship with the government. Frequently the government of Bangladesh has pandered to Hefazat-e-Islam. It removed a Lady Justice statue from the Supreme Court following Hefazat demands. The government has recognised degrees from Qawmi Madrasas as equivalent to Master’s degrees. The government also removed works by secular and minority authors from national curriculum textbooks at the insistence of Hefazat-e-Islam.

In return Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina received a grand reception in Dhaka and the honorary title ‘Mother of the Qawmi’. This was an important endorsement before the 2018 parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. Shah Ahmad Shafi the then chief of Hefazat-e-Islam had a good working relationship with the government. In return for concessions Hefazat did not publicly oppose the Awami League government.

The relationship with the government changed drastically after Shah Ahmad Shafi died on 18 September 2020. Before his death Shafi had been forced to resign from his post as director general of Hathazari Madrasa in Chittagong the base of Hefazat-e-Islam.

Following Shafi’s death more hard-line leaders — who were against the government — were given leadership roles. Leaders who had a good working relationship with the government were excluded from the new management committee. The group also severed all unofficial communication channels with the government. The first public evidence of a change in policy was the group taking a public stand against building statues of former president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman an emotive issue for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

After that the government still attempted to negotiate with the group rather than use force. The government moved for punitive action after the violent protests in March. Since then the government has arrested 434 people and filed 56 cases over the ‘Brahmanbaria mayhem’ alone.

Hefazat-e-Islam leaders speak in sermons against the government and Bangladesh’s secular judicial system. They call for a revolution and for the establishment of an Islamic state under Sharia law in Bangladesh. Joint Secretary General of Hefazat-e-Islam Mamunul Haque is one of the most notorious preachers of the organisation. He is known for his fiery sermons that he spreads online through Facebook and YouTube. He has a verified Facebook page with 1.2 million followers. Videos of his sermons generate millions of views.

The government has become increasingly authoritarian and intolerant of criticism. Recent actions by Hefazat-e-Islam might be seen as a challenge to its leadership. The protests were a challenge to one of the core principles of the government close friendship with India. This challenge would be seen as completely unacceptable to the government.

While the Awami League allowed Hefazat-e-Islam to become a powerful force by seeking an opportunistic partnership to secure support among religious voters the government has reversed course and is cracking down. Yet it has not yet withdrawn any of the concessions it gave the organisation. It would be difficult for the government to completely rid itself of a relationship with Hefazat-e-Islam or support for Islamism. The religious right is a force to be reckoned with and the Awami League is not in a position to dismiss its views completely. In this scenario a religious right that works with the Awami League and not against it seems like the government’s ideal solution. The government might go for a carrot and stick approach the carrot being policy concessions and the stick being detention.

In reaction to the crackdown Hefazat-e-Islam recently dissolved its central committee and removed leaders with political connections. Leaders met with Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan to negotiate an end to the crackdown. Yet the government remained silent about the subject of the meeting and has not released Hefazat-e-Islam activists. The authoritarian predisposition of the Awami League government demands a Hefazat-e-Islam that doesn’t challenge its rule or embarrass it in front of important foreign allies.

“The United States like the rest of the international community recognizes the Republic of Yemen government which is the only legitimate internationally recognized government in Yemen” it said. “The Houthis control people and territory and must be dealt with. They are real political actors in Yemen.”

The assurance from Washington of its support for the Yemeni government came a day after US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking sparked a furor when he said that his country “recognizes” the Houthis as a legitimate force in Yemen.

“I have spoken on a number of occasions about the legitimacy of the Houthis which is to say that the United States recognizes them as a legitimate actor” he said during an online roundtable discussion on Thursday arranged by the National Council on US-Arab Relations. “We recognize them as a group that has made significant gains.”

Lenderking’s remarks were “a clear coup against local Arab and international resolutions” that recognize the Yemeni government’s authority Ahmed Ayedh Marib Press editor

Asked whether it is realistic that the Houthis will bow to US demands that they stop fighting given they possess large numbers of weapons and continue to have the upper hand on battlefields Lenderking said that some elements within the Houthi leadership have expressed a commitment to peace and Washington encourages the group to engage with peace efforts.

“I hope and encourage the Houthis to support the UN-led process and the efforts that are underway to support peace and the political transition” he said.

The Yemeni government politicians and journalists expressed dismay over his remarks. A senior government official who asked not to be named told Arab News that the Yemeni foreign minister and the speaker of the parliament had contacted officials at the US embassy in Yemen asking for clarification which came on Friday morning.

Meanwhile Yemenis expressed outrage on social media and in the local media about what they perceived as a shift in US policy on the Houthis.

Ahmed Ayedh the editor of Marib Press news site described the Lenderking’s remarks as “a clear coup against local Arab and international resolutions” that recognize the Yemeni government’s authority and called on the authority to boycott him.

The US State Department said the envoy’s words were taken out of context. As well as reiterating the support of the US government for the Yemeni government it slammed the Houthis for escalating their military operations.

“We remain concerned that the Houthis are more focused on waging war and exacerbating the suffering of Yemeni citizens than they are on being part of the resolution to the conflict” it said.

The Houthis viewed the perceived shift in US tone as a victory and vowed to press ahead with their “resistance.”

Without specifically mentioning the Lenderking’s comments Mohammed Ali Al-Houthi president of the Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee demanded that the international community deal with the group as the sole legitimate representatives of Yemen.

“Thanks to God Yemen has won due to its steadfastness and strength that achieved its legitimacy and independence” he said in a message posted on Twitter.

Muammar Al-Eryani Yemen’s information minister said on Friday that the Houthis interpret the international community’s “soft” handling of the war in Yemen and human rights abuses by the rebels as a green light to push ahead with their military operations.

In a message posted on Twitter he said the Houthi militia considers the international response as “encouragement for its aggression and military escalation killings of Yemenis and violations of human rights.”

He denounced the militia’s terrorist activities which he said threaten regional and international security disrupt peace efforts and exacerbate the human suffering in the country.",,,,,,

The team of Home Front Command soldiers headed to Florida following a series of talks over the weekend between Israeli defense officials and officials in Miami the Defense Ministry said in a statement on Saturday night.

Defense Minister Benny Gantz said the move was approved in coordination with the Foreign Ministry.

“As with any national mission the IDF and the defense establishment are ready to respond act and assist. Every effort will be made to save lives support the Jewish community and our friend the United States” Gantz said.

Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said the sending of the delegation demonstrated the depth of friendship between the two nations.

“The mission of the delegation is to assist in the life-saving efforts by mapping the challenges at the site of the destruction assisting the Jewish community and supporting the local rescue forces” the IDF said.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke with Florida’s Governor Ron DeSantis on Saturday night to express his condolences and said Israel would assist in any way needed.

“The United States is our greatest friend and we stand by your side during this difficult time. We all pray for the safety of the wounded. I instructed all authorities in the Israeli government to assist in any way that may be required” Bennett told DeSantis according to a readout from the Prime Minister’s Office.

Nearly 160 people are still unaccounted for after the Champlain Towers South building in Surfside came down on Thursday.

Surfside is one of four small cities that together make up North Beach the north end of Miami Beach just east of the city of Miami. The area covers the top of a narrow stretch of land on the Atlantic Ocean. The area is more than a third Jewish.

The 12-story tower’s collapse has left at least four people dead and 159 missing as of Friday. Search and rescue teams are still trying to find survivors in the rubble and the cause of the disaster is still unknown.

The missing include people from around the world reportedly including from Israel.

Israel’s United Hatzalah the largest volunteer emergency service sent a delegation of six psychological assistance professionals to assist the affected families and community.

“The purpose of the senior delegation is to provide initial psychological assistance to those who witnessed the incident and to the community through tools that are used by us here in Israel in difficult events” Eli Beer the president of the EMS said in a statement.

The IDF is often one of the first countries to send humanitarian delegations to countries hit by disasters.

Israeli disaster relief delegations provided rescue and medical services after an earthquake in Turkey in 1999 an earthquake in Haiti in 2010 a typhoon in the Philippines in 2013 an earthquake in Nepal in 2015 an earthquake in Mexico in 2017 and most recently after a series of explosions in Equatorial Guinea this year.

Third Place Award: Pedestrian Enclave by Dalia Qasem

""The concept of Pedestrian Enclave revolves around the nature of social gathering and interaction in the site. These encounters have a unique identity and result from multiple factors that include but are not limited to: overcrowding vibrant street life and the presence of low-income residents that feel a disconnect from the rest of the city.

""The goal was to integrate a structure into the chosen site to refine the pedestrian experience and create pleasant gathering spaces by inserting elevated platforms with different levels connected to the roofs of the existing buildings and create a central hub to host some of the missing amenities.

""Overall this decreases the congestion on the ground level of the site responds to the need for gathering spaces and provides a more three-dimensional pedestrian experience as opposed to the flat urban fabric of the current area.""

Honorable Mention: A Child's Place by Klara Bekhet

""A Child's Place proposes a residential building typology that challenges the current standalone towers present in Dubai with a focus on how children perceive and react to residential spaces cognitively physically and emotionally. The proposed project takes inspiration from the traditional Sha'biyaat housing.

""It tackles three main design approaches an abundance of communal spaces for frequent interaction between the children the rejection of the vertical void created by elevator-dependent multi-story buildings and the importance of child-scale for the younger residents to be able to perceive their homes and surrounding.

""The project aims to provide 'homes' rather than transitory sellable units encouraging children to form a sense of place attachment to these spaces and the city of Dubai.""

Honourable Mention: Bridging The Gap by Zinah Al Asad

""Internally displaced people (IDPs) are continuously being viewed as a threat to a host society's security history and cultural relationships and are therefore excluded and restrained.

""The objective is to gradually merge IDPs into the urban fabric of their host city rather than exclude them. Here architecture creates a physical bond between the host society and the 'new society' the IDPs and creates a link between the two histories. Moreover it allows them to benefit society and themselves through the incorporation of self-build structures.

""The project comes to life through a continuous path that physically connects the three different plots while occasionally becoming the roof of recessed volumes. The path starts from an archaeological site to a final site of a refugee accommodation with an intermediate museum in the second plot.""

Officials so far say only four people have died in the Champlain Towers collapse while 159 are missing but three days after the building’s devastating tumble no more survivors have been found.

In 1981 114 people were killed when two walkways directly on top of each other collapsed at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City Missouri and crashed into a tea dance being held in the lobby.

In addition to the dead 216 were injured. Rescue personnel worked for 14 hours to free survivors buried under a tangled mess of steel concrete and glass.

About 1600 people had been gathered in the lobby according to reports at the time.

The final report from the investigation into the cause of the collapse said it was structural overload resulting from design flaws where “the walkways had only minimal capacity to resist their own weight.”

The Hyatt hotel collapse was the deadliest non‑deliberate structural failure in American history and it was the deadliest structural collapse until planes hit the World Trade Center on 9/11."

California was once the site of a gold rush.

But now arguably one of the most precious commodities in parts of the state and in the Southwest is something else entirely -- water -- as the region grapples with a decades-long megadrought that experts say has been spurred on by a warming Earth.

Farmers struggle to water their crops. Less snowpack feeds rivers streams and lakes in areas surrounding the mountains. And what little runoff there is from snow in the spring is immediately sopped up by the arid soil before it can reach important bodies of water.

A February report from the California State Water Resources Control Board for instance said the question is not whether warming will occur but the ""magnitude of warming"" instead and says the state is facing the ""threat of greaterscarcity of water supplies increased water demand and limited water supply reliability."" The report said the state said it has taken ""bold"" actions to reduce the effects of climate change as well as increase water resilience such as the expansion of recycled water.

And the Southern Nevada Water Authority which gets 90% of its water from the Colorado River acknowledges it is ""facing the worst drought in the basin's recorded history"" and has been working to address the drought's impact on water supply for 20 years including using 23 billion fewer gallons in 2020 than 2002 despite a massive population growth.

Water levels in major bodies of water in the Southwest -- both natural and manmade -- are approaching historic lows as the drought is exacerbated by heatwave after heatwave during a dry season that started earlier this year.

""The American Southwest has always been at risk for this but climate change even pushes that risk much much higher"" Brad Udall climate research scientists at Colorado State University's Colorado Water Institute told ABC News.

While some water variation level is cyclical experts fear that prolonged warming combined with diversion and other human activities are putting the region at risk. The Southwest is ""particularly dependent"" on surface water so ""even a small increase in temperature -- which drives evaporation -- or a decrease in precipitation in this already arid region can seriously threaten natural systems and society"" the Environmental Protection Agency said.

The region which is normally hot and dry has experienced temperatures above the long-term average with some areas 2 degrees warmer over the past 20 years and some parts are ""experiencing long-term reductions in mountain snowpack"" according to the EPA.

The depletion of these water sources could be disastrous as it affects the supply for drinking for tens of millions of people and agriculture ruins local biodiversity by eliminating crucial habitat and negatively impacts billion-dollar economies experts say.

Here is how the ongoing megadrought is affecting five major bodies of water in the West:

Lake Mead Nevada and Arizona

Earlier this month Lake Mead the massive reservoir formed by the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River hit its lowest water levels since the lake was created in 1935.

About 25 million people are served by the reservoir -- either by electricity water supplies or both. Officials expect the water levels to continue to decline until November when the wet season starts U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spokeswoman Patti Aaron told The Associated Press.

Water levels at Lake Mead -- and Lake Powell on the other side of the Grand Canyon the second-largest reservoir in the U.S. -- are headed toward being 30% less than what they were 20 years ago at the start of the most recent warming period Udall said.

""There are huge big bathtub rings very visible at both Lake Mead and Lake Powell"" Udall said referring to previous high water levels.

Minor cutbacks in water deliveries are expected next year if water levels in Lake Mead do not rebound. Another couple of bad years would result in a ""major shortage"" Udall said.

If water levels drop low enough it would be the first-ever official water shortage declared in Arizona and Nevada and the governments could order cutbacks.

The Bureau of Reclamation is expected to release an official projection in August which will determine the water deliveries to Arizona California and Nevada in 2022. Water levels should begin to rebound in November Aaron said.

Folsom Lake California

One of California's largest reservoirs Folsom Lake is crucial to providing water to the more than 40 million residents in the Golden State but is also in danger of drying up.

Severe drought conditions in the West have left barely any snowpack on the neighboring Sierra Nevada Mountains contributing to record lows in the reservoir which is used for drinking water fisheries in the American River which feeds the lake and farming and agricultural purposes Rich Preston-Lemay the sector superintendent for Folsom Lake Park told ABC News.

The lake is 68 feet lower than it was last year -- the equivalent of a five-story building ABC San Francisco station KGO reported earlier this month. Memorial Day visitors were surprised to find that only one of the lake's 13 boat ramps was operating over the holiday weekend the station said and there has been zero precipitation so far in June according to the Bureau of Reclamation.

The water has receded so much that a plane that crashed in 1986 was visible from the bottom of the lake the Placer County Sheriff's Office announced on June 16. Despite the drought the lake is not at a record low. That came in 1977 after the Great Drought at 347.57 feet. Its current elevation is 388.61 feet.

Officials are in a ""race against time"" to protect communities and other natural resources from the effects of climate change California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot told ABC News.

""Climate change impacts have become a matter of protecting communities in California -- worsening wildfire risk worsening drought extreme heat"" he continued. ""We used to think about preparing for climate change impacts as sort of a future planning exercise for coming decades. Now we're actually responding to it as the public safety imperative.""

Lake Tahoe Northern California and Nevada

Variability in water levels is typical at Lake Tahoe a 22-mile-long and 12-mile-wide lake on the border of California and Nevada -- dropping during the summer and rising during the early part of the year Geoffrey Schladow director of the Tahoe Environmental Research Center at the University of California Davis told ABC News.

But the combination of less snowpack drought and increased usage by humans has left the water just about 2 1/2 feet above the natural rim of the lake at the start of the dry season -- and it will only continue to empty as the season goes on Schladow said.

Come October the water will likely be at the rim which means water will no longer naturally flow out of the lake and into the Truckee River the sole outlet of Tahoe and an important source of irrigation along adjacent valleys Schladow said. The Truckee River also feeds into Pyramid Lake which supplies water for the city of Reno.

The water level was already lower due to a relatively dry year in 2020 that added little volume to the lake Schladow added.

In May water levels in Lake Tahoe were so low that some boats could not be launched from ramps and docks. The City of South Lake Tahoe even closed a boat ramp to motorized boaters for the 2021 due to the low levels ABC Sacramento affiliate KXTV reported.

Despite the drop the communities surrounding Tahoe likely won't suffer as much as those who depend on reservoirs elsewhere in the West that supply water to millions of people Schladow said. Lake Tahoe by contrast is massive and serves just tens of thousands of residents rather than millions.

Scientists and lawmakers who monitor the lake are not yet overly concerned about the water levels in Tahoe because fluctuations are normal -- the last time water levels went below the rim was in 2016. However if the trend were to continue over the next few years and the region continues to experience dry winters concerns may be raised Schladow said.

""We're not in any imminent or real danger of not being able to supply in basin water needs at least not for the next few years"" he said.

Great Salt Lake Utah

The Great Salt Lake the largest saltwater lake in the world and the eight-largest terminal lake -- with no natural outlets -- has lost at least half of its water since the first settlers arrived in the region in 1847 a 2017 study published in Nature Geoscience found.

The decline is mostly a result of humans redirecting the water from streams and rivers that feed the lake for use in homes farms and industries the study found with levels dropping 11 feet over the past 150 years -- despite a peak elevation of 4211.6 feet in 1986-87. The usage has been aggravated by drought and climate change leaving water levels at near-historic lows Laura Vernon Great Salt Lake Coordinator for the Utah Department of Natural Resources told ABC News.

The lake levels are currently at three-tenths of a foot away from the historic low set in 1963 Vernon said adding that she expects that barrier to be broken within weeks. Experts and lawmakers in the region are currently coming to terms with ""what that means exactly"" she added.

The drops are even more significant considering the size of the lake. At 1700 square miles ""it takes a lot of water to make a change"" Vernon said adding that it was likely ""something continuous over time"" to make a difference in the water levels.

The economic impacts of a drying Great Salt Lake could be devastating. In 2012 the Salt Lake Advisory Council valued the annual economic industry from the lake at $1.3 billion Vernon said. Depending on how low the water levels were to get there could be a $1.69 billion to $2.17 billion economic loss every year for the brine shrimp harvesting and mineral operations the products of which would dwindle as the lake recedes she added.

The skiing industry could be affected as well as the lake effect snow that is created as a result of the moisture over the lake would cease to exist Vernon said. And if the snowpack on the mountains doesn't stay frozen it will all rush down at once and fail to consistently provide water to the surrounding communities Vernon said.

Human health can take a toll as well as water recedes exposing more of the lake bed embedded with decades worth of heavy metals and toxic substances within the sediment. When the bed dust is exposed for long periods of time the particles can end up in the air and can pose a danger as residents breathe it in experts say.

The biodiversity the lake promotes would dwindle as well. About 10 million birds stop over at the lake every year to rest and feed during their migration routes -- such as the Pacific Flyway route before they head to South America Vernon said.

Colorado River

Water flow in the Colorado River which supplies water to more than 40 million people and feeds into the two largest reservoirs in the country -- Lake Mead and Lake Powell -- has decreased by about 20% over the last 100 years according to a 2020 study by U.S. Geological Survey scientists

Several scientific papers published in recent years point to human causes for about half of the decline in river flows. The other half is attributed to warmer temperatures which then lead to higher evaporation and water use by plants Udall said.

""And if that evaporation goes up slightly river flow and decline precipitously"" Udall said. ""So roughly speaking a 1% increase in evaporation can lead to a 5% decrease in river flow.""

In this May 1 1997 file photo a sign marks the Colorado River as it flows past the Never Summer Mountains in Rocky Mountain National Park near the town of Grand Lake Colo. David Zalubowski/AP FILE

The Colorado River system is one of the most important in the country. As the river begins in the Rocky Mountains and wraps across the Southwest before it feeds into the Gulf of California water is diverted to major cities such as Denver Los Angeles Las Vegas Phoenix Tucson San Diego and farms to the south in Mexico. About a quarter of the water in Lake Mead and Lake Powell comes out of the Colorado River system Udall said.

Recent droughts have been so severe that even in years when the Rocky Mountains experience a high snow pack the arid soil in the region is so parched that it absorbs up any moisture as soon as it melts and flows down Udall said.

For instance in any given year 50% the water from a full snowpack would be expected to be runoff Udall said. Despite the warming temperatures the region saw an 85% snowpack last year -- described by Udall as ""not a bad year."" But only about 30% of runoff water made it to the river Udall said.

""On any given day it's now likely to be hotter. We have a longer growing season so more days for it to be hot. And the atmosphere because it's warmer actually wants to absorb or suck up more moisture"" Udall said.

The new trends are ""basically our future"" Udall said adding that scientists have predicted a worst case scenario of a 40% flow loss by 2050.

""It's very worrisome"" Udall said.

Today though a microscope is almost a necessity since parts have shrunk to flyspeck-size. [Maker Mashup] recently picked up an AD409 and posted a video review of the device that you can see below.

The microscope in question has a 10-inch screen so it is a step up from the usual cheap microscope we’ve seen on a lot of benches. Of course that size comes at a price. The going rate for a new on is about $400.

If the 10 inch screen isn’t enough you can connect the microscope to an external monitor. That does disable the onboard monitor though. The microscope offers plenty of space to solder under and has a removable lens and filter so you can add filters or even put on a wide-angle lens.

We also liked that the scope has a remote control so you can operate it without touching it. We’ve used scopes where pushing the buttons to do things like snap a photo sometimes causes vibrations or worse when you are trying to focus on something specific.

If you use these you support the website. Thanks!

Peter Forrest’s A-Z of Analogue Synthesizers books from 1994 are very popular rare but now revised versions are out so everyone can enjoy them without paying astronomic second-hand prices.

I recently reported on the new version of Kim Bjørn’s bestseller Push Turn Move. A book that deals with the concepts of electronic instruments. However this is not the first.

In 1994 Peter Forrest published the A-Z of Analog Synthesizers series of books dealing with analog synthesizers. In these he cataloged the well-known but also obscure analog synthesizers from the past and wrote down interesting facts about each one. Very interesting reference work for friends of analog synthesizers.

At the time however the books were limited and in great demand. This had the consequence that the books in second-hand platforms like Ebay when they appeared were traded at astronomical prices. I regularly found them there in used condition for +/- 250 €.

Peter Forrest A-Z Analog Synthesizers Revised Version

Anyone who is still interested in these works can be happy. Peter Forrest has reissued both books (A-M & N-Z) in revised versions after a long time. They now offer 80 more pages of analog synth goodness to discover 92 color photos loads of graphs and more. That sounds like a must-have and must-reading for the summer vacation. And yes I’ll click the buy button.

Books still have their charm and such books even more so. On Wikipedia or vintagesynth.com you can find all information about the respective synthesizer in a few clicks. That’s great and it’s free. Here you can also take a leisurely look into it offline without a screen and learn new things from familiar or very strange analog instruments. As I said a must for all fans of good Synthesizer reading.

The A-Z of Analogue Synthesizers books by Peter Forrest are now available from the official website. Both volumes are £45 and one is £25.

This addition makes several apps including Measure and Photos work better and faster. The company introduced liDAR in the 2020 iPad Pro.

What Is LiDAR?

LiDAR stands for ""Light Detection and Ranging."" Simply put it describes a system that measures how long light (usually a laser) takes to reflect off of an object and return to its source. A processor then uses that information to make an accurate picture of whatever the device scanned.

Developers typically use LiDAR for augmented-reality apps because the technology lets them create accurate models of both objects and spaces.

Where Is the iPhone 12 Pro's LiDAR Scanner?

You can find the LiDAR scanner on the back of the iPhone 12 Pro next to the three camera lenses. It's the dark circle opposite the flash. Because of its location the sensor only works with the rear-facing camera.

How to Use LiDAR on iPhone 12 Pro

Because LiDAR is a system that apps on your iPhone use behind the scenes you don't use it directly. Instead you'll notice improvements in the apps that use it.

One of the primary beneficiaries of LiDAR in the iPhone 12 Pro is Apple's Measure app which scans its environment and then lets you tap specific points to calculate distances lengths areas and more. LiDAR reportedly makes Measure faster and more accurate than using just the camera because the system is capable of more delicate details.

You'll also notice that the iPhone 12 Pro needs way less time to scan its surroundings in Measure before you can start taking readings. The speed-up is thanks to LiDAR's superior ability to read and interpret its surroundings over the standard camera.

You'll also see some help from LiDAR in the Camera app which uses the sensor to work better in low light. According to Apple the camera can now autofocus six times faster even when the lighting isn't ideal.

It also lets the phone take ""Night mode portraits"" which are close-range snapshots of other people using the iPhone's low-light-compensation mode. Because LiDAR is better at spotting the difference between foreground and background (based on the distances it measures) it should produce better-contrasted images at night or in a darkened room.

The iOS App Store is also full of third-party programs that make the most of Apple's new sensor but the primary uses are making 3D scans of objects and rooms. With these you can see how a new piece of furniture will look in your living room get a scan for 3D modeling and printing and more. You can find these apps by searching for ""LiDAR"" in the App Store.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3QtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktd2FsbGV0cy1kZXNrdG9wLW1vYmlsZS1hbmQtaGFyZHdhcmUtb3B0aW9ucy1jb21wYXJlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Cryptocurrency Wallets: Desktop Mobile and Hardware Options Compared,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3QtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktd2FsbGV0cy1kZXNrdG9wLW1vYmlsZS1hbmQtaGFyZHdhcmUtb3B0aW9ucy1jb21wYXJlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc2luZm90ZWNoLmNvbS9hZWdldXMtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWluZGlhcy1jbGVhbi1lbmVyZ3ktbWFya2V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aegeus Transforming India's Clean Energy Market,"Aegeus Technologies plans to achieve the transformation of India’s clean energy market with sustainable means while having its headquarters at Bengaluru.

The organization engages with the customers right from the design stage to understand their challenges develop products and offer services to improve efficiency. Also their products and solutions help protect the environment. Aegeus is deploying image recognition IoT and ML technology in their autonomous solar panel cleaning robots.

2. How do you differentiate Aegeus from other clean energy technology Companies?

Aegeus Technologies operates at the intersection of two of the world’s biggest challenges- clean energy generation and water conservation.

Today solar panels are deployed at a massive scale to help drive the transition towards clean energy. But Soiling is a major challenge that can reduce the plant efficiency anyway between 3-40%. Present method of cleaning uses another valuable natural resource… water. We offer Intelligent Waterless Solar Panel cleaning robots which help our customers improve efficiency and conserve water.

We are the only Indian company with an indigenous technology for intelligent waterless cleaning of solar panels and that we are unique to any other design in the world. We have received patents in India and have applied for patents across different parts of the world.

3. Which sectors are your key focus areas and upcoming projects?

We are currently focused on helping customers truly produce clean energy. We will continue to develop products and solution that help improve efficiency conserve natural resources. Unicorn is an intelligent waterless solar panel cleaning robot ideally suited for large ground mount projects. We have now developed Shreem suited for rooftop installations and have also introduced hand-held dry-cleaning brush for small residential rooftops. The solar adoption is increasing at an exponential rate and we are geared up to cater to the market demands.

We have a strong understanding of the Robotics & IOT technology and have a roadmap to develop products for diverse challenges becoming sector agnostic.

4. How did your Solar panel Cleaning Robot help in country’s solar energy technology adoption?

Our robots have helped save millions of liters of water improve the plant efficiency and reduce carbon footprint. The installations in India are on uneven surfaces and have large undulations making it challenging for the robotic cleaning. However our design is ideally suited for such conditions and has helped customers deploy robotic cleaning.

5. Is there any expectation from the government? Explain.

The entire Western US is in the grip of extreme drought. We are staring at a similar situation if we do not take adequate measures in India. Nearly half of India’s population faces extreme water stress. Therefore water conservation is no more a fad – it’s the only way for survival. MNRE has to impose a huge cost on usage of water for cleaning of the solar modules. We cannot solve one problem by creating another.

6. How did your company cope during COVID-19 and any plans for expansion?

The vagaries of weather and the pandemic has been a major roadblock in our journey. Like any startup funds became a major bottleneck.

We owe our success to the strong team who persisted despite all the challenges. We are driven by a strong passion and are now backed up by investors who firmly believe in our capabilities and support our vision. We are strongly poised for growth not just in India but in the global markets as well. We are receiving a lot of traction from the global customers considering the unique benefits of our design.

7. Challenges and scope in the industry?

The technology adoption has been slower than expected however the glaring water scarcity is pushing the industry towards robotic cleaning.

Solar Panel Cleaning Market size exceeded USD 560 million in 2019 and is estimated to achieve over 11% CAGR through 2026. Rising solar PV installation trends along with decreasing overall unit cost will drive the industry potential. In addition growing focus toward panel efficiency optimization followed by increasing renewable integration across the global energy mix will positively stimulate the industry landscape.

8. Lastly major trends you see catapulting and dominating the clean energy industry in coming time?

It could atleast take next 30 years to transition to a fully clean energy production. However by 2030 atleast 80% of the worldwide energy will be generated by renewable sources. On site On Demand decentralized generation with a combination of PV solar wind & biomass fuel could be a strong possibility. Storage is another area which is seeing huge traction at the moment. Green hydrogen is another source of renewable energy which is expected to grow. However the fundamental question we need to answer ‘Are we truly producing clean energy that preserves our natural resources protects the environment?’"

But the proxy statement can be just as revealing as it delves into business relationships the backgrounds and compensation of corporate officers.

A proxy statement is a document provided by public corporations so that their shareholders can understand how to vote at shareholder meetings and make informed decisions about how to delegate their votes to a proxy. Issues covered in a proxy statement can include proposals for new additions to the board of directors information on directors' salaries information on bonus and options plans for directors corporate actions like proposed mergers or acquisitions dividend payouts and any other declarations made by the company's management.

Below is some of the information you can glean from this important document.

Key Takeaways As a shareholder you are entitled to vote by proxy on the important issues that impact a company's financials even if you can't attend the meeting in person.

The proxy statement provides details about management their experience and qualifications.

The document also provides important information on their compensation and whether their compensation structure is aligned with shareholder interests.

The proxy statement can reveal potential conflicts of interests such as related-party transactions that may not be beneficial to the company.

Another thing to look for is company loans advanced to senior executives. These loans can deprive the company of capital are often made on generous terms and sometimes are forgiven footing shareholders with the bill.

How to Find a Proxy Statement

Because proxy statements are required regulatory documents they are kept on file for public view using the SEC's database known as EDGAR. From the EDGAR web portal simply enter the company’s name here and select the appropriate entry to view its SEC filings including its proxy statement.

To view the most recent proxy statement find the entry for the latest SEC Form DEF 14A also known as a ""definitive proxy statement"" which is a required filing when a shareholder vote is required. The Form DEF 14A outlines the list of items up for vote by shareholders such as the hiring of new directors or other business decisions.

The EDGAR database will also let you view proxy materials issued at earlier points in time for comparison or research purposes.

Proxy voting is often the sole means by which investors can have a say in the business operations and societal activities of the companies that they are shareholders of.

Profile of Management

The proxy provides detailed information about a company's chief executive officer chair and board of directors. This is valuable because it gives investors insight into officers' abilities and experience.

Have the officers worked in the industry before? Did they move up the corporate ladder in typical fashion or were they somehow transplanted from another industry? Do they sit on boards at other companies? Do they have any potential conflicts of interest? Are their duties spread too thin? These are important questions the proxy can often answer.

Insider Ownership and Executive Compensation

The proxy statement can tell you whether a company is being run for the benefit of shareholders or for the benefit of insiders. One section will detail executive compensation and how much board of directors members get paid.

Also look at their option positions. Does the board and management have a vested interest in seeing the shares rise? Or are they merely collecting a fat paycheck?

Ideally you want to see a large percentage of management's pay coming from out-of-the-money call options meaning options that are currently worthless but could be worth a bundle if the share price moves materially higher. Put simply option-based stock compensation gives management an incentive to enhance shareholder value and to find ways to drive the share price higher.

Senior-Level Loans

Sometimes in the course of business companies will make sweetheart deals with their senior-level executives. These loans are sometimes in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. This is bad for the average shareholder for several reasons.

First the company should not be acting as a bank. Its capital if it were looking out for the common shareholder should ideally be retained to spur business-related growth or be paid back to the shareholders in the form of a dividend.

A second issue is that the interest rate being charged on these loans is often below what is being offered in the broader lending market. This is problematic because it means the company is being inadequately compensated for making the loans. A third problem—and perhaps the most worrisome—is that many times companies will forgive these loans entirely particularly if the employee is fired or retires leaving shareholders to foot the bill.

Changes in Auditors

Sometimes a company will switch auditing companies. The proxy will outline the rationale behind the change and give the investor some insight into whether it was a legitimate switch or due to a disagreement on accounting practices.

Overall Health of the Business

Similar to an annual or quarterly filing in a proxy statement management will also typically include a general discussion about the overall health of the business. Interesting insights can often be gleaned from information on the backlog gross margin trends balance sheet opportunities or other concerns.

Detailed Business Plans

The proxy will detail business plans or issues on which the board may vote. This information while sometimes contained in the 10-K is often much more concise and easy to read in the proxy statement.

This valuable information should be analyzed by the investor to determine whether the company is facing any potential challenges down the road or if there are any opportunities that management has not outlined on conference calls or in the management discussion and analysis section of the 10-K or 10-Q.

Related Party Transactions

In the proxy there will also be a section that reveals related party transactions. Look for potential conflicts of interest or sweetheart deals that management has set up for themselves.

For example is the company obtaining a critical raw material for its products from another company owned by the chief executive? If so perhaps the company may be paying more than it has to. Too many conflicts of interest should certainly pique your interest as a shareholder and make you wary of the company's investment merits.

Litigation Risks

The company may describe litigation risks in the footnotes of other financial statements. The proxy will often comment on the potential outcomes of certain suits or the possibility that management may set aside money in the form of a reserve to pay for the potential loss of a suit.

Example of a Proxy Statement

Proxy statements can be long technical documents that are difficult to read. But these documents can also provide crucial insight into a company's operations in addition to management's intentions requiring a shareholder vote.

In its 2021 proxy statement for instance says that ""Apple's significant business risks"" include among other matters ""antitrust compliance."" Moreover it indicates that Apple has an ""Antitrust Compliance Officer"" who works closely with the Audit Committee of the company's board of directors which has ""primary responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management"" including ""antitrust compliance.""

A section headed ""Selected Areas of Audit Committee Oversight"" includes a paragraph on antitrust. It states in full:

The Audit Committee and Board regularly review and discuss with management Apple's antitrust risks. Apple's Antitrust Compliance Officer is responsible for the development review and execution of Apple's Antitrust Compliance Program and regularly reports to the Audit Committee. These reports cover among other matters the alignment of the program with Apple's potential antitrust risks and the effectiveness of the program's design in detecting and preventing antitrust issues and promoting compliance with laws and Apple policies.

Apple's proxy statement also asserts that experience in ""antitrust compliance"" is among the qualifications considered in the selection of directors. However the thumbnail biographies of the eight directors including the four who are members of the Audit Committee do not indicate specifically what if any experience in antitrust compliance these people have.

You can view the entirety of Apple's proxy statement here.

The Bottom Line

The proxy statement is probably the most overlooked form that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However it can inform and enlighten the curious and diligent investor.

Frequently Asked Questions

Why are proxy statements important for investors?

A proxy statement is most relevant for shareholders preparing for a company's special or annual meeting in order to get information on how they should vote in-person or via a proxy. As a shareholder investors have the right to express their voice on the company and its direction via votes often one vote per share.

This document can also aid potential investors in assessing the qualifications and compensation of its management team and board of directors. A finding that chief officers of an underperforming company are paid compensation significantly above those of peers may raise a red flag of excessive spending and weigh on an investor's decision of undertaking an investment.

What is SEC Form DEF 14A?

Form DEF 14A is the official name given to the final version of a company's proxy statement filing. It's called a ""DEF 14A"" because it's the ""definitive"" or final proxy statement. ""14A"" refers to the fact that proxy statements are filed pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

How is a proxy statement used in shareholder voting?

Today publicly traded corporations have many thousands of shareholders all over the country and even around the world. As such these individuals cannot all attend the company's annual meeting to vote in person. Instead the proxy statement allows shareholders to choose how they will vote and then send that to a third party known as the proxy who will vote collectively on their behalf.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdHJhbnNmZXItcGhvdG9zLWZyb20taXBob25lLXRvLXBjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Transfer Photos From iPhone to PC: 5 Methods,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdHJhbnNmZXItcGhvdG9zLWZyb20taXBob25lLXRvLXBjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMS8wNi8yNy9ob3ctdG8tbWFnbmlmeS15b3VyLXNjcmVlbi13aXRoLXRoZS16b29tLWZlYXR1cmUtaW4tbWFjb3PSAWlodHRwczovL2FwcGxlaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjEvMDYvMjcvaG93LXRvLW1hZ25pZnkteW91ci1zY3JlZW4td2l0aC10aGUtem9vbS1mZWF0dXJlLWluLW1hY29zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to magnify your screen with the Zoom feature in macOS,"How to magnify your screen with the Zoom feature in macOS

If you're having trouble seeing elements of your Mac's desktop take advantage of its Zoom accessibility tool to magnify the part of the screen you need.

Apple's accessibility features in macOS provide many different ways to customize the experience all to allow as many people as possible to use the Mac. Of the tools available one of the most useful is Zoom which magnifies the display.

This is essential for people with visual impairments but it's also handy for people with perfect vision for day-to-day tasks. With high-resolution monitors on the market sometimes the text and other parts may be too small to easily read making the magnification of the display very useful.

Here's how to take advantage of Zoom in your workflow.

Enabling Zoom

Zoom is not enabled by default in macOS with users needing to enable it within the Accessibility menu.

How to enable Zoom magnification in macOS

Click the Apple logo in the Menu Bar and select System Preferences .

in the Menu Bar and select . Click on Accessibility .

. In the left-hand column select Zoom . It will be under the Vision section near the top of the list.

. It will be under the Vision section near the top of the list. Tick the checkbox next to Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom.

Alternately click Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom.

Once enabled the feature is available immediately.

To turn off the features simply reach the same menu and uncheck the relevant boxes.

Basic Zoom control

Depending on the checkboxes you selected there are two main ways to start using Zoom.

If you selected to enable keyboard shortcuts you have three commands at your disposal:

Press Control-Option-8 to toggle Zoom on and off.

to toggle Zoom on and off. Press Control-Option-= to zoom in or increase magnification.

to zoom in or increase magnification. Press Control-Option-Minus to zoom out or to decrease magnification.

If you selected to use the scroll gesture you could select from several modifier keys to hold down to enable Zoom then you can change the magnification using a mouse scroll wheel or a one-finger vertical scroll gesture on a trackpad.

You can customize the modifier key from the dropdown box with Control Option and Command available to use. While not labeled you can also click in the box and press multiple modifier keys to create a custom shortcut combination.

Zoom Styles

There are three Zoom styles to choose from with each having its strengths and weaknesses.

Full screen

Selecting Full screen will magnify the entire screen with the cursor used as the focal point for magnification.

Full screen zoom uses the entire display. This pointer is measurable in centimeters.

If multiple monitors are in use the Choose Display option will bring up the ability to choose between the currently active displays on a Mac. Selecting a display will mean that it will be used to show the magnified version of the other screen.

If you select All you retain the use of multiple monitors with all zooming in as if they are one screen at one point on the desktop.

Split screen

Opting for Split Screen will cut the main display into two regions with the lower area showing the desktop and the upper area displaying the magnified screen again focused on the cursor.

Split screen uses only part of the display while leaving the rest of the screen devoted to the macOS desktop.

The lower desktop section will scroll up and down to give full use of the desktop space.

Picture-in-picture

The third option provides a highly localized magnification than the other two in that it is a rectangular overlay that follows the cursor around the screen. Changing magnification affects the zoom of just the overlay rectangle not the entire display.

Picture-in-picture zooms in a small movable section of the screen wherever the pointer is.

This is a really useful option for occasional fine detail work such as correctly positioning a cursor when editing a document.

Advanced Options

Apple provides many further customization settings under the Advanced Options pop-up with many of the items here can change all three Zoom versions and some are limited to fewer.

Under Appearance the top section provides options for how the zoomed-in screen image moves with users able to set it to move continuously with the pointer only when the pointer reaches the edge of the zoomed-in section and ensuring that the pointer remains relatively near to the center of the zoomed image.

You can tweak how the zoomed-in section acts.

Further options cover features such as restoring the zoom level on startup keeping the zoom window stationary rather than moving it around following the keyboard focus and smoothing zoomed-in images.

It is also possible to set the zoomed-in section to have inverted colors. You can even set the screen to flash when a notification banner appears outside of the zoomed view.

The Adjust Size and Location button appears for both Split screen and Picture-in-picture and gives you the chance to change how big the zoomed-in screen is during use.

More shortcut options are available including adding more trackpad controls and adjusting the zoom limits.

The Controls tab offers extra keyboard and trackpad-based options including the ability to temporarily toggle zoom with a keyboard shortcut holding another to temporarily detach the zoom view from the pointer and even to toggle between Full screen and Picture-in-picture modes.

Keyboard shortcuts can also be enabled to adjust the zoom window size and enable trackpad gestures to zoom and change options.

Controls are also presented to set the zoom range namely the maximum magnification and the minimum magnification.

Hover Text

While not specifically magnifying the display the Zoom menu also includes an option for ""Enable Hover Text."" Available without needing Zoom to be enabled the feature lets users press the Command key to temporarily magnify just the text under the pointer.

As the name suggests hover over text and Hover Text will make it larger.

An Options menu offers extra personalization including changing the size of the zoomed-in text to between 14pt and 128pt the font how the text appears around the cursor and what modifier key triggers the feature.

You can change how Hover Text works and appears.

Further configuration options are available for colors including text colors the insertion point color background border and element highlights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzVlNjlmYjRiLWM0ZjYtNDdjMy04ZmYyLTEyMmM4YWUzNzc5ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TSMC tie-up puts spotlight on Japan's hidden chip champions,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Archer Daniels Midland closed recently on the purchase of the plant she said. And soon the plant that has stood empty for nearly three years will become a soybean crush plant — something North Dakota ag and government officials have long sought for the state.

Ova the CEO of the Jamestown/Stutsman Development Corp. and COO of the Spiritwood Energy Park Association said value-added agriculture has long been seen as a benefit to the region. The development corporation first got into agriculture projects in the 1990s with a Cavendish Farms potato facility. Later developments included the Cargill plant which shuttered in the fall of 2018 and the Dakota Spirit Ag Energy ethanol plant.

According to statistics from the North Dakota Soybean Council  North Dakota is the No. 5 state for planted and harvested soybean acres and the No. 9 state for produced bushels of soybeans.

""We're not small beans "" Ova quipped.

But with no crush plants active in the state those soybeans have had to go elsewhere to find their ultimate markets.

""We knew that there was a major need for a soybean crush facility in the area"" Ova said. ""In fact there probably is room for another three or four is what the statistics show. This plant will be able to process 25 to 30% of the total soybean production of North Dakota.""

Some of the bones of the former Cargill malt plant at the Spiritwood Energy Park Association will be remodeled into an Archer Daniels Midland soybean crush plant. Photo taken June 22 2021. (Jenny Schlecht / Agweek)

After a previous attempt to put a soybean plant at the Spiritwood Energy Park fell through Ova said state officials put the park on ADM's radar. ADM considered both a ""greenfield"" project or one started from scratch and the Cargill plant. They ultimately decided on the Cargill plant which Ova said is a win-win for the park.

""Our worst nightmare was that it would continue to sit there not doing anything"" she said.

While the facility will need major overhauls to take it from holding and malting barley to holding and crushing soybeans into meal and oil Ova said there are some valuable pieces of infrastructure there that ADM will be able to use. There already is a rail line though she said the energy park will work with ADM to put another loop inside an existing rail loop. And there is a steam line from Great River Energy located right next door to the plant.

""That was another plus not having to bring that steam across the road"" Ova said.

Getting a crush plant to the Jamestown area has been in the works at least five years and Ova said there have been plenty of lessons learned around doing due diligence and research and getting things to completion. In the end she said it was well worth it for the ag industry and for the community.

During demolition and construction 200 to 600 workers will be on-site at the plant she said. Once the facility is up and running in the fall of 2023 ADM expects to offer ""75 good high-quality diversified jobs"" she said.

""It will provide other better jobs for individuals in the area for people that are looking to relocate to North Dakota to come back to North Dakota or are who are looking for good jobs with good benefits"" Ova said.

The ADM plant isn't the only ag project expected to come to fruition at the park. Canadian company Houweling's Tomatoes has signed a letter of intent to build a 30-acre all-under-glass greenhouse south of Dakota Spirit Ag Energy. The company intends to grow tomatoes year-round at the facility.

Both ADM and Houweling's were attracted to the location in part by tax incentives and by state programs for value-added agriculture Ova said. She said the energy park located close to Interstate 94 has the essential infrastructure for plants including roads water utilities and internet.

""We totally understand the need to diversify the economy and with that value-added ag processing is huge to this area"" she said.",,,,,,,,,

Mario Barrios gave Davis a tougher fight than many expected on Saturday night at a packed State Farm Arena in Atlanta but in the end it was Davis’ punching power that allowed him to win by an 11th-round knockout after moving up two divisions for the fight.

Barrios (26-1 17 KOs) controlled the first four rounds with his jab and enough power shots to win rounds as Davis (25-0 24 KOs) tried to figure out how to get inside his opponent’s long reach.

“Tank” started to find success in Round 5 as he closed the distance and began to land eye-catching punches.

He was the aggressor from then on although the next few rounds were competitive as Barrios continued to hold his own.

Then came a huge round for Davis. About a minute into Round 8 Davis landed a right hook to Barrios’ temple that sent him to the canvas. He got up but went down again moments later from a big left.

Barrios demonstrated his resilience by surviving Davis’ efforts to end the fight and actually winning Round 9. However that was his last hurrah.

Davis hurt Barrios with several big shots toward the end of Round 10. And then he did what does which was to score a brutal knockout. The big punch was a left uppercut to the body that sent Barrios to all fours in great pain.

He managed to get to his feet. However moments later a big left hand sent him into the ropes and referee Thomas Taylor ended it at that point to protect Barrios who lost a secondary junior welterweight title.

The official time was 2:13 of Round 11.

All three judges had Davis winning by a large margin after 10 rounds 97-91 (seven rounds to three) 97-91 and 96-92. Boxing Junkie had it even 94-94.

Of course Davis who can fight at 130 135 or 140 has many options. Oscar Valdez Jamel Herring and Shakur Stevenson reside at 130. Teofimo Lopez Devin Haney and Ryan Garcia are the stars at 135. And assuming Davis was comfortable at 140 he could target undisputed champ Josh Taylor.

And Davis just might be favored to beat all of the above.

Johnny Nunez/Getty Lil Nas X BET Awards performance

The genre-bending rapper sang his hit ""Montero (Call Me by Your Name)"" at the awards show bringing members of the audience to their feet as he wrapped a special rendition of it by locking lips with a dancer. The performance had an ancient Egyptian theme with Nas dressed in shining gold like a pharaoh surrounded by a group of male followers in an homage to Michael Jackson's 1991 ""Remember the Time"" music video. Nas even injected the chorus of Jackson's song into the end of his set.

Fans took to Twitter after the sweltering moment to celebrate noting that it arrived on the last day of Pride.

On the last day of #pride 2021 @LilNasX got on the #BETAwards stage and kissed another guy.



If you grew up Black and gay you know how major this is.

Nas came out as gay publicly on June 30 2019 on the final day of Pride month. He announced the news on Twitter by referring to the lyrics of his song ""C7osure.""

""Some of y'all already know some of y'all don't care some of y'all not gone fwm no more"" he wrote. ""But before this month ends i want y'all to listen closely to c7osure."" The tweet included a rainbow emoji.

After the BET Awards Nas hung out with Tyler the Creator who also performed during the show rapping his new song ""Lumberjack"" from his recently released album Call Me If You Get Lost. Nas shared a few photos of him and Tyler featuring them both still dressed in the outfits they wore during their respective performances.

The BET showcase was electrifying and definitely much more successful than Lil Nas X's Saturday Night Live performance in May during which he ripped his pants. About two years ago the rapper also delivered a buzzy entertaining performance at the BET Awards singing his record-breaking chart-topping smash ""Old Town Road"" with Billy Ray Cyrus.

After riding a stripper pole to hell in the ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name)"" music video Lil Nas X to the single to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April. He previously opened up about the release of the track with a personal message to his fans. He dedicated the song to his childhood self (Nas' birth name is Montero Lamar Hill). In the notes for ""Montero"" the rapper wrote that his music ""will open doors for many other queer people to simply exist"" and hit back at haters who said he was promoting ""an agenda.""

""Dear 14-year-old Montero I wrote a song with our name in it. It's about a guy I met last summer. I know we promised to never come out publicly I know we promised to never be 'that' type of gay person I know we promised to die with the secret but this will open doors for many other queer people to simply exist"" the note read. ""You see this is very scary for me people will be angry they will say I'm pushing an agenda. But the truth is I am. The agenda to make people stay the f--- out of other people's lives and stop dictating who they should be. Sending you love from the future.""

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Dans le Centre-Nord les manifestants réunis à Kaya le chef lieu de la région ont marché vers le gouvernorat brandissant des pancartes où on pouvait lire : ""Des morts et des morts on n'en veut plus !"" ""Non à l'insécurité grandissante"" ou encore ""On veut cultiver nos champs en paix"".

Cette manifestation ""fait suite à l'attaque contre une unité de police sur l'axe Barsalogo-Foubé qui a coûté la vie à onze d'entre eux lundi dernier"" a expliqué à l'AFP Boukari Ouédraogo président du mouvement ""Appel de Kaya"" à l'origine de la marche.

""Nous ne voulons plus que des avions ramènent les corps de nos maris"" a affirmé une manifestante Aguiratou Sawadogo épouse d'un soldat.

""La gestion chaotique et par tâtonnement de la situation sécuritaire a fini par convaincre les populations que la situation ne semble pas préoccuper nos autorités"" a estimé M. Ouédraogo assurant que ce n'est que ""le début d'une lutte qui appelle à plus d'engagement d'organisation et de détermination sans faille pour (...) le droit à la sécurité"".

Dans la région du Nord une manifestation similaire à Titao a entraîné le saccage d'un bâtiment officiel selon les autorités locales.

Vendredi l'opposition a appelé à des ""marches"" dans tout le pays pour ""protester contre la dégradation de la situation sécuritaire et exiger des mesures fortes"" face à la montée des violences jihadistes de plus en plus meurtrières.

Le 12 juin plusieurs milliers de personnes avaient déjà manifesté à Dori dans le nord du Burkina Faso pour dénoncer ""l'inaction"" des autorités après le massacre dans le village de Solhan dans le nord-est.

Dans la nuit du 4 au 5 juin des hommes armés - dont ""des jeunes âgés de 12 à 14 ans"" selon le gouvernement - ont attaqué cette localité tuant au moins 132 personnes selon le gouvernement 160 selon des sources locales.

« AU PIED DU MUR »

Elle nous a devancés. Jeanine Assani-Issouf 28 ans ne nous a pas laissé le temps de poser notre première question. Elle a coupé d’entrée : « Je suis au pied du mur j’en ai conscience ». Avant de nous rassurer : « Je ne me mets pas de pression ».

Après avoir effectué quatre compétitions (1360 m 1380 m 1355 m 1394 m) la sociétaire de Limoges Athlé a fait l’impasse sur plusieurs meetings pour « se concentrer et tout donner aux championnats de France ».

« Ninja » a désormais une seule et dernière compétition pour réaliser les minima (1432 m) ou au pire une performance l’assurant d’une bonne place à la ranking list mondial (32 premières). Ce sera à quitte ou double à Angers dimanche.

ELLE L’A DÉJÀ FAIT

Cette situation où une saison voire une carrière se joue lors d’une épreuve Jeanine Assani-Issouf l’a déjà vécue. « En 2017 après avoir été blessée j’avais dû faire l’impasse sur des meetings et j’avais tout misé sur les championnats de France rembobine-t-elle. J’avais réalisé une grande compétition (1448 m mais trop de vent NDLR) et je m’étais qualifiée pour les mondiaux ».

« En 2011 elle avait aussi obtenu sa qualification pour les championnats d’Europe juniors lors du dernier essai du dernier concours » ajoute son entraîneur Jean-Christophe Sautour.

DES CONDITIONS POUR SORTIR LE GRAND JEU

Jeanine Assani-Issouf connaîtra-t-elle une nouvelle issue heureuse après deux années compliquées (blessures Covid) ? Plusieurs éléments pourraient la placer dans les meilleures conditions à commencer par la concurrence de Rouguy Diallo 26 ans qui vient de réaliser un triple bond à 1451 m la deuxième meilleure performance française de tous les temps reléguant Jeanine au quatrième rang (1443 m). « J’étais contente pour elle cela m’a encore plus motivée » confie Jeanine Assani-Issouf en quête d’une neuvième couronne nationale.

Cette adversité lui a permis de s’approcher des 14 mètres lors de son dernier concours à Marseille (1394 m). « « Là-bas j’ai retrouvé des sensations que je n’avais pas eues depuis longtemps détaille-t-elle. Il y avait mes camarades de l’équipe de France et plusieurs filles à plus de 14 mètres. Cela m’a remise dedans (sic) j’ai eu un nouveau déclic ».

Suffisant pour réaliser ce que beaucoup considèrent comme impossible ? « En 2017 on attendait Éloyse Lesueur pour faire les minima personne ne parlait de moi répond l’intéressée. Personne ne m’attendait et j’aime ça ». À elle de surgir au meilleur moment…

He died in a rehabilitation facility while recovering from a recent heart attack his son Chris McNulty said.

Mr. Thompson was the last surviving member of MC5 which will be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in October.

He joined the group in 1966 at 17 years old. His intense playing style in MC5 short for Motor City Five earned him his nickname “Machine Gun” from his bandmates for how ferociously he hit the drums.

(1:02)

Open Extended Reactions

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were front and center Sunday in what appeared to be a happy reunion during the live roast of Tom Brady.

But according to two former players who attended the roast the former New England Patriots coach and the longtime team owner also shared some awkward moments offstage.

Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe discussed the three-hour roast during the latest episode of Edelman's ""Games with Names"" podcast and described the scene in the green room before the event.

""Preshow we're in the green room -- remember that? Were you in there?"" Edelman asked Bledsoe. ""Bill's opening up. He's having fun he's talking war stories talking rookie skits talking fun s--- doing s--- we know what Bill's all about but it was like amplified because he was excited to see you guys because he doesn't have a job anymore.""

Edelman and Bledsoe said they were both in the green room with Belichick along with former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss when Kraft arrived.

""Then Kraft walks in ... Belichick's kind of holding court"" Bledsoe recalled. ""As he's in the middle of the story Kraft walks in and so you guys all go over to say hi to Kraft.""

""The tension in that room though could cut f---ing glass"" Edelman said.

Edelman said he tried to give Belichick a ""head's up"" when he saw Kraft walk into the green room but that Belichick did not pick up on the cue.

""[Kraft] came in and I was like 'Oh s--- there's gonna be some fireworks'"" Edelman said. ""I just walked away. I didn't want to get in there.""

Bledsoe added that Belichick and Kraft did at one point ""break it down and got together for I don't know 10 minutes at least."" But the former Patriots quarterback agreed with Edelman's assessment about the tension in the room saying ""it was very real it was very real.""

Belichick and Kraft drank a shot together on stage at one point with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during Sunday's made-for-streaming live comedy show on Netflix titled ""The Greatest Roast of All Time.""

Belichick left the Patriots in January after 24 seasons with the team and there has been reported friction between the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach and Kraft over the past couple of years.

As part of an ESPN report published last month that detailed Belichick's departure from the Patriots and his inability to land the Atlanta Falcons' head-coaching job a source said Kraft called Falcons owner Arthur Blank ""to warn him not to trust Bill.""

The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice this offseason for their vacant head-coaching position before ultimately hiring Raheem Morris for the job.

After joking about the event being like a reunion and that ""unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid"" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.

""I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me"" Kraft said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing jet skids off runway injuring at least 10,"A Boeing 737 skidded off a runway at an airport in Senegal’s capital injuring at least 11 people and grounding all operations while crew assisted with an evacuation of the aircraft.

The Air Senegal flight operated by TransAir was set to take off from the Blaise Diagne airport in the country’s capital of Dakar and fly to the city of Bamako in Mali on Thursday around midnight when the plane ""came off the runway during its take-off phase"" Senegal Transport Minister El Malick Ndiaye told reporters.

The plane skidded into the grass that flanked the runway where crew were able to deploy the side exit ramps and ferry passengers off the plane as it started to burn.

""Our plane just caught fire at Blaise Diagne airport"" Cheick Siriman Sissoko a Malian musician wrote in a post on Facebook along with a video of rescue crews helping passengers evacuate the plane. An orange glow is visible under the jet.

The plane was carrying 79 passengers two pilots and four cabin crew according to Ndiaye. The airport has opened an investigation to determine the cause of the accident the Independent reported.

""Carriers operate and maintain their airplanes for upwards of 30 to 40 years"" Boeing said in a statement to FOX Business referring to TransAir for further questions but assuring that the company ""will provide any requested support to our customers.""

The plane in question was first delivered 30 years ago to Romanian company TAROM before TransAir leased it starting this year according to Plane Spotters. The plane had previously suffered a tail issue during takeoff but returned to service a month later.

The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2RjLzIwMjQvMDUvcG9saWNlLWluc3RhbGwtZmVuY2luZy1hcm91bmQtZm9ybWVyLWd3LWVuY2FtcG1lbnQtc2F5LTExLW9mLTMzLWFycmVzdGVkLWlkZW50aWZpZWQtdGhlbXNlbHZlcy1hcy1zdHVkZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pro-Palestinian protesters disperse after police presence at GWU campus; at least 1 arrested,"A groups of around 100 protesters linked arms and encircled several tents.

Pro-Palestinian protesters returned to the George Washington University and pitched tents on campus Thursday night just one day after police cleared an encampment on the D.C. campus arresting dozens of people.

A group of around 100 pro-Palestinian protesters linked arms and encircled several tents along F Street in Foggy Bottom on Thursday night. Demonstrators chanted for around five hours at times in heavy rain.

Around 11:30 p.m. D.C. Police gave its first warning to the demonstrators to disperse from the area or face arrests for unlawful entry and trespassing on campus property. Many protesters could be seen collecting their signs and packing up tents and leaving the area.

After the sixth warning MPD officers linked arms and began advancing on the protesters until 19th and F streets according to 7News’ Christian Flores who was on the scene and told WTOP. He said many of the organizers and protesters decided to leave on their own.

“We haven’t seen any [response from university officials] late this evening. It is pretty calm” Flores said as protestors were leaving the area of the university. “So it does appear that there was a plan in place by MPD to not only disperse the protesters but also to make sure there wasn’t any sort of second gathering after that dispersal order.”

Police confirmed to WTOP that one arrest was made for assault on an officer.

As the campus encampment crossed the two-week mark overnight Wednesday D.C. police broke up the gathering and arrested 33 pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Six of those arrested are current students the university said in a statement Thursday.

After that clearing of the tents dozens of protesters came back to campus and gathered at the intersection of 21st and H Street early Thursday evening before marching to F Street at around 8 p.m.

Seemingly peaceful

The group carried signs that read “We are not leaving” and chanted “Free free Palestine.” Marchers paused in front of the residence that’s traditionally occupied by the university’s president and chanted outside the home.

Then they marched down F Street where several administrative offices are also located — including the office of university President Ellen Granberg.

That’s where protesters put up several tents — the university’s student newspaper The Hatchet reported saying nine tents were pitched. Some participants also climbed the brick entrance to a university building nearby the tents.

WTOP's Scott Gelman reports from George Washington University as pro-Palestinian protesters return to campus.

Dozens of D.C. police officers some on bikes gathered on F Street and the surrounding area.

WTOP’s Scott Gelman reported a brief moment of pushing and shoving earlier in the evening when police on bicycles appeared to be attempting to control a sidewalk in front of a university building.

Outside of that scuffle the protest appeared to have remained peaceful.

WTOP has reached out to the university for comment. D.C. police told WTOP the department is monitoring the First Amendment activity.

All roads are open as of 1 a.m.

Protesters are back. Here’s how students are reacting

Among those in the crowd on H Street was GW student Reem Lababdi who told WTOP she was pepper sprayed in the back by D.C. police but not arrested Wednesday.

“We said we weren’t leaving and we meant it” Lababdi said in reference to the encampment. “We will not be pushed aside when our administration is funding the genocide of our people.”

The encampment which had been in place for 13 days was cleared early Wednesday morning by officers that deployed pepper spray and arrested 33 protesters who police said refused to vacate after six warnings.

Students from other nearby colleges including American University George Mason and the University of Maryland took part in the protests on GW’s campus.

Lababdi said protesters are there to send a message to Mayor Muriel Bowser congressional lawmakers and Granberg whom she criticized for allegedly declining to meet with student protesters.

“She would sooner brutalize her own students than come to the negotiating table with them” Lababdi said.

But there’s division among GW students about the protests.

David Delarosa a GW student told WTOP he encountered protesters on H Street while returning home from work Thursday.

“We have students here who just want to go to work want to go finish their finals go home enjoy their summer” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”

Protest organizers have called accusations that the demonstrations are antisemitic “baseless.” But some Jewish students have said they feel intimidated by the protests.

“Jews like myself feel threatened they feel scared and we just want to live our lives” he said.

Barriers around site of former encampment

The events Thursday come after fencing was installed around the GW’s University Yard. The fence barriers standing over 10 feet tall resemble those put in place around the Capitol building after the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection — and are now blocking all entrances of University Yard.

It is unclear how long the fences are expected to remain around the area.

When asked at a Wednesday news conference whether the encampment clearing meant there would be no more protests on GW’s campus D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said it was Granberg’s decision “to determine if she will allow protests in other areas of the campus.”

Smith said that no protests will take place in the now-secured area.

Smith said there were many indicators that the protests were becoming more volatile outlining intelligence that officers had been collecting over the days leading up to Wednesday. One of the concerning indicators Smith mentioned was that non-students were joining the protests on campus and had been found in secure campus buildings.

Granberg also said in a statement over the weekend that the protest had “been co-opted by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community’s best interest in mind.”

Arrest records show that the 33 arrested protesters ranged in age from 18 to 33 years old with most of them college-age.

Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the U.S. — and increasingly in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University in New York.

Some colleges cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war. Among those that have tolerated the tent encampments some universities have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life safety and the involvement of nonstudents.

Since April 18 just over 2600 people have been arrested on 50 campuses according to figures based on reporting by The Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.

Rebalancing datasets can introduce bias. When you resample you do nothing more than artificially increase or reduce the number of data points. If you choose to under-sample the majority class bias can be introduced if critical observations are removed. The new sample may also not accurately reflect your true test data. Conversely over-sampling the minority class can unintentionally expand hidden data anomalies and create over-fitting. SMOTE is another resampling technique that can improve decision boundaries [2] but predictive enhancement is minor if new data contains similar properties as labeled samples in the minority class [3]. SMOTE also tends to suffer in highly-dimensional datasets because it does not take into account all neighboring classes and can result in an overlap of important class distinctions.

So why did we get so intense about rebalancing our datasets? Really the impetus came about to correct for another issue with estimating global accuracy. Take our denied claims example from above; a basic model can achieve an astounding 95% accuracy because the majority class represents that exact proportion in the entire dataset. In short just predicting the majority class “non-denied” every time you’ll have an average 95% accuracy. By rebalancing the accuracy score becomes more realistic.

However getting caught up in all the varied ways we can rebalance we left behind some more important considerations: do we have enough representative data? Are our variables actually predictive and important? And are we creating proper thresholds for our predictions? Actually the setting of thresholds is very important for prediction tasks and you can optimize them with precision and recall. Weather reports are a good example of why thresholds are better than binary classification accuracy anyway. For example weather forecasters never report “it will rain” or it “won’t rain.” They provide thresholds like “there’s a 52% chance of rain” which provides us with better insight and autonomy into making a decision given other relevant factors in our life i.e. how bothered would I be holding a jacket all day if the sun is shining? If I really hate carrying around a jacket all day and the chance of rain is only 52% I’ll roll the dice and leave the house without a jacket. However in our healthcare example these thresholds can be life or death not simply an inconvenience.

Most predictive models set automatic thresholds at 50% though choosing a more contextually-relevant threshold is important and can be done [4]. Although if you’re focusing too much on rebalancing your classes than optimizing these types of trade-offs you can travel down a rabbit hole trying to “solve” the wrong problem.

Rebalancing classes also has some historical roots in statistics and old habits die hard. Many experimental designs assume balanced data such as multi-factor ANOVA [5]. Balanced designs in such cases improve statistical power and reduce homoscedasticity [6]. Before computers estimating models with very imbalanced data was especially challenging to process manually. Today advancements in computing have rendered these problems mostly obsolete. Advanced prediction models can optimize within highly-dimensional and sparse matrices and they can certainly tackle class imbalance.

Reason 2: Training data needs to reflect the real world

Another reason not to rebalance datasets is that models should be trained on datasets whose distributions will reflect the future real-world test cases for which they will ultimately be applied. If rebalancing is determined to be absolutely necessary training and testing sets should be split prior to any rebalancing practice.

In a paper by Harrell the classifier trained on balanced data would need to be re-trained on proper test data for which predictions and patterns may change immensely [7]. For example assume you have two imbalanced classes: 1000000 non-cancer patients and 1000 cancer patients. If you trained a model on balanced classes by down-sampling the majority class by 90% you’d be training a classifier to 1/10 prevalence not the 1/1000 prevalence that naturally occurs. As Provost points out the assumption that a classifier makes is that it “will operate on data drawn from the same distribution as the training data” [4]. Training on balanced data may not be generalizable to real-world data that is naturally imbalanced.

Several methods have been designed to improve algorithmic performance on imbalanced datasets. We can simply split classes into testing and training sets before applying a re-sampling technique. This prevents the possibility of similar data being present in both sets which can cause overfitting and poor generalization. A more intensive Boosting method involves adapting the training model back to fit the test distribution by using two learners (L1 L2) on different samples of the total dataset and a final learner to detect differences between them (L3) [8]. Other common approaches include assigning class weights inversely proportional to the class frequencies in the training data which also prevents overfitting [9]. Kernel-based learning methods have also been used improve decision-boundaries in SVM models [10]. But again these solutions address class imbalance as if they’re singularly problematic when more pressing questions exist— is your minority class representative? Is there noise present in that minority? Are your classes actually over-lapping? Are your feature variables actually important? Are there too many “disjuncts” in your majority and minority classes? [11–17].

Instead of balancing classes then the application of cost-sensitive learning has shown some promising results when applied directly to imbalanced classes we see naturally occurring in life [12 18-19]. In particular for large data sets cost-sensitive learning on natural imbalanced distributions yielded better results than over-sampling or under-sampling imbalanced classes. The authors believe a larger amount of training data allowed the model to more accurately estimate the class-membership probabilities [20]. Other empirical studies have shown superiority of cost-learning in imbalanced distributions to sampling methods [20–22].

Reason 3: Minority class count may already suffice

Rebalancing may also be unnecessary if your minority class contains enough relevant and powerful dependencies to inform your classifier [23]. This takes ultimate precedence to the extreme imbalanced proportions that may exist between minority and majority classes. In several studies with imbalanced data sets the minority concept was accurately learned with little disturbance from the imbalance [24–26].

Think of it this way. An imbalanced dataset with 101 samples — 100 majority cases and 1 minority case — would make for a terrible predictive model. But what if you had 10000000 majority cases and 100000 minority cases? Same degree of class imbalance. But the minority class may be sufficiently large in the second example to build a quality prediction model.

This is especially true if both classes come from non-overlapping distributions with very well defined (i.e. different) feature variables [1]. In my own work with predicting denied claims in healthcare imbalanced classes was not the culprit for poor predictions; my initial features were simply non-informative to my outcome variable (denied vs. not denied). If you are also encountering highly-dimensional and sparse feature spaces these issues take corrective precedence over class imbalance.

If on the other hand the number of examples in your minority class is too small for classifiers to learn adequately then you really have a problem of incomplete training data not one of imbalanced datasets. You can call it class imbalance sure but it’s really just a problem of power. If this occurs I’d really be wondering if the minority class is missing at random or missing disproportionally? The former is OK as long as you can access more data the latter might present sampling bias.

Low minority sample sizes rather than class imbalance can be a particular hindrance for predictive models. The Random Forest Classifier (RFC) is especially “data hungry” requiring lots of data to derive meaningful results. For example van der Ploeg and colleagues demonstrated that in order for RFCs to work as well on new data as they do in training data the overall sample size should be 200 times the number of candidate features [27]. As such minority classes that have enough samples may be acceptable for usage in classification models. What’s “enough”? There’s no real hard and fast rules. Keep optimizing precision and recall while also ensuring your data is not over-fitting or experience leakage.

Conclusion

If your imbalanced classes are well separable have good minority class representation and present unique and powerful influences to your outcome variable then despite being imbalanced the data should pose few problems for building solid predictive models. Conditional probabilities such as precision and recall should be evaluated and optimized within the natural distribution of your classes.

While class imbalance gets a lot of attention and concern far more important questions to consider are:",,,,,,,,,,,,

Charles Williams was arrested in California on Friday for allegedly gunning down Darryl Whitfield 26 inside the AutoZone parking lot on Northern Blvd. near 95th St. in Jackson Heights on Sept 30 2018.

Williams started a new life in California while Whitfield’s family was left with nothing but pain since he was killed the victim’s mother Jewel Bradley told the Daily News Sunday.

“It still feels like day one” Bradley 53 said from the family’s Jamaica home where Whitfield lived with her his grandmother and his two daughters.

“It’s hard. It’s unbelievable. I wake up and look for him every morning. That’s my baby.”

A memorial blanket with photos of Darryl Whitfield hangs in the living room of the family’s home in Jamaica Queens.

Williams 35 was a suspect from the start but justice was delayed until video surveillance and a last-minute DNA match led investigators to the arrest according to sources.

An AutoZone employee coming into work discovered Whitfield in the back seat of a BMW dead from a gunshot wound to the head police said.

The NYPD Fugitive Task Force tracked Williams down to Sacramento where he currently lives and filed a warrant for his arrest on March 10. Sacramento police nabbed the fugitive March 26 and he was brought back to Queens on Friday sources said.

Williams lied to detectives after the shooting admitting he and Whitfield had gone bowling on the day of the shooting but claiming they parted ways after hanging out sources said.

Cops investigate after Darryl Whitfield 26 was found dead inside an AutoZone parking lot on Northern Blvd. near 95th St. in Jackson Heights on Sept 30 2018.

Detectives suspected Williams because he was the last person with the dead man but they faced difficulties piecing together the evidence sources said.

A second man Careem Holder 30 was arrested two days after the shooting for possession of the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver that killed Whitfield and for destroying evidence. Holder is due to be sentenced Aug. 12.

“He thought they were his friends” Bradley said of her son and the suspects adding that they got to know each other from the neighborhood.

An AutoZone employee coming into work discovered Whitfield sitting in the backseat of a BMW pictured here dead from a gunshot wound to the head police said.

Whitfield served prison time for assault but had come home and turned his life around his mother said. He was married living with two of his three children and working at the Greater Allen AME Cathedral near his home as a maintenance man. He had just gotten hired to also do night security at the church she said.

“Darryl was working seven days a week day and night and they went bowling that night” she said explaining that Whitfield had taken a nap while his car was parked in AutoZone’s lot.

“He was sleeping in the back of the car and the guy came and shot him in his sleep” Bradley said. “Come on.”

Bradley started to get worried when she didn’t hear from Whitfield that night.

“I was looking for him because I hadn’t heard from him and I’d always hear from him at night” she said. “A cop called for me and asked me Was that my son?”

Charles Williams was arrested in California Friday for allegedly gunning down Darryl Whitfield 26 inside the AutoZone parking lot on Northern Blvd. near 95th St. in Jackson Heights on Sept 30 2018.

Sources say getting the DNA match that helped pin the murder on Williams may have been delayed due to evidence Holder destroyed.

Williams was awaiting arraignment Sunday in Queens Criminal Court on charges of murder weapon possession and tampering with evidence.

Whitfield’s family celebrates his birthday every year mourns for him during holidays and commemorates the day of his death. He had two daughters ages 14 and 6 and an 11-year-old son.

“We went to the cemetery the other day for Father’s Day” said his mother. “We always recognize him.”

“I’m going to every court date” she added. “I have to stand for my boy. Not a day hour minute second goes by that I don’t think of him.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now it’s official.

Baker’s addition to the team was announced by the university in a tweet sent out on Tuesday June 22.

The 6-feet-7 inch wing will enter SDSU as a sophomore with four years of eligibility and is immediately eligible to play in the upcoming season.

Baker-Mazara first announced he would enter the transfer protocol on April 29 after spending his freshman season at Duquesne University where he averaged 9.5 points on 43.8% shooting while playing 24.4 minutes per game.

Baker-Mazara didn’t stay in the transfer portal long as he announced that he would be donning the Scarlet and Black just one week after entering the transfer pool via Twitter.

With the addition of Baker-Mazara the Aztecs hope to regain some offensive firepower after losing two seniors second-team All-Mountain West guard Jordan Schakel and Mountain West player of the year Matt Mitchell to graduation.

Baker-Mazara played 15 games for the Dukes as a freshman and recorded double-digit points in five of them.

Baker-Mazara scored over 20 points in a game on two separate occasions. One such matchup against Fordham University saw him drop 23 points while shooting 8-15 with 21 of those 23 points coming from beyond the arc.

He was very efficient from the three-point line landing 41.7% of his three-point attempts the second-best mark amongst freshmen in Duquesne history.

His 13 blocks last season were good for second on the team behind senior Michael Hughes’ 23. Baker’s 15 steals tied freshman Toby Okambe for fourth on the team.",,,,,,,,,,,,

She speaks in a surprisingly hushed manner given that there is nobody else in the room. “There was a time when I found looking back to the 90s a little bit… tricky” she says with a diplomatic tone.

When her kids (Ball and Cook also have a daughter Nelly 11) ask about it she isn’t entirely keen to reminisce although she recently turned 50 and appreciates having such distance from her wilder youth. “Woody says ‘You had so much fun! Tell the story about this’ and we groan and say ‘Ugh you don’t want to hear about that.’ And he says ‘I do I want to hear the story.’ So our kind-of extended family tell him the tales. My friends say ‘Let me tell you about the time your mother was…’” she tries to think of something printable to say. “‘On roller skates.’ Whatever.” She also sometimes finds old photographs and wails: “‘God I was so thin!’ I look back and I was dangerously gaunt. Not that that’s good – that’s not good. But we didn’t stop.”

Zoë Ball is still a very big thing of course. She is slightly hidden behind her fringe and rather gentler manner today but she is also the highest paid woman in the BBC after taking over the Radio 2 breakfast show from Chris Evans in 2019 at a time when the Beeb was painfully aware of its lack of gender parity in pay. She was given a breakfast show annual salary to match his of roughly £1.36m and is thought to have also received an additional £400k or so for presenting Strictly’s companion show It Takes Two on BBC Two which she recently gave up after a decade. She is also sober unable to believe her first child is already 20 and says her Friday nights are spent watching Gardeners’ World with a cup of chamomile tea made from her own garden since she moved away from Brighton (and her marriage and perhaps her past) into the deepest countryside.

She has made the Radio 2 breakfast show into a national safe space of cheery chirpy cosiness but back in the 90s her galloping chat and her joie de vivre made her a sensation. After starting out as a runner and researcher for various production companies she followed her father Johnny Ball into kids’ TV then became the host of the Radio 1 breakfast show in October 1997 six months after Tony Blair became prime minister. She was an anchor of the Cool Britannia scene in London: she looked cool her relationships looked cool her life looked cool. You didn’t just want to be her friend – you kidded yourself that you actually were. To me listening at home she and Sara Cox seemed to have a whole new way of being female in media. At a time when so many of the others felt fake they felt real. They weren’t ladettes as the tabloids called them they were young women doing what young women all around the country were doing: going out and having a bloody good time.

But while we were longing to be Zoe it turns out Zoe was secretly longing to be Paula Yates: “She was so effortlessly cool and nonchalant and she didn’t really care. But then there was always this great sexual chemistry with everybody she ever interviewed. Whereas I think in some of those early interviews I was a bit like don’t want to be here don’t think I can handle this.” Ball was actually quite shy which is one reason the drinking got out of hand fighting to stay on top of so many huge social occasions. The tabloids lapped up her late nights and painted a picture of her as a cheekily smiling hell-raiser a legend which she says she found herself almost trying to live up to – a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.

I never think I’ve smashed it. I don’t think you ever take any of it for granted at all

She eventually went to rehab as she alluded to on Desert Island Discs but hasn’t been keen to expound upon since. I ask what she learned in rehab but she answers only in vague platitudes about “accepting your strengths and your weaknesses”. I sense it feels uneasy for her to talk about anything with even a whiff of scandal now that she has such a high-profile job as the UK’s cheerer-upper in chief.

Her job at Radio 2 took on particular significance during the worst of the pandemic when her listeners often key workers contacted the show. She remembers “someone who was sat outside the hospital about to go in for another shift. They were exhausted and they just sat for a minute to listen to the radio and fill themselves up with the strength to face it. So it was good to get those messages – but they had us in tears.”

She adds that “The voice on the radio is a friend and is company” and insists she needed it too listening to her favourites Liza Tarbuck and Jo Whiley and as much news as she could handle which wasn’t much. “Bit of Emma Barnett Adrian Chiles on Five Live a bit of Evan [Davis] at PM. Just to hear some calm news rather than the hysterical. And we had new listeners coming across from the current affairs space going ‘Actually that’s quite harrowing I just want to hear some Cher.’”

As for the show she and her team had just been getting into the swing of it before the pandemic altered what they could do. (The recording studio at Wogan House became skeletally staffed.) They were determined to turn around the reports saying that they had lost a million listeners since Chris Evans left and the columnists crowing that Zoe wasn’t worth the money. Given what many people think about six-figure salaries especially in relation to a public body I wonder if Ball has ever felt able to thoroughly celebrate to admit she’s smashed it.

“Er no. I never think I’ve smashed it” she says. “I don’t think you ever take any of it for granted at all. Erm you know honestly I’ve never done what I do because of the money. I have worked for the BBC for a lot of my career and I kind of always did it for the love. People always go ‘Oooh well that’s nonsense’ but it isn’t I love my job I love what I do. It’s great fun to try to entertain.”

I tell her that she will always be the woman who broke the BBC’s glass ceiling that it’s a historic position to be in. “Well” she says slowly and carefully. “It did feel like a good positive moment that there was a big corporation willing to pay a woman about the same as what they had paid a man.” She relaxes a bit and lets out a laugh. “Sadly for some that story didn’t really seem to be that… And then suddenly you’ve got other headlines.”

It can be a poisoned chalice I say.

“It can. There is always going to be flux between you know you’re taking over from Chris and he took over from Terry [Wogan] – you’re taking over from a hugely loved popular host there is going to be change. That takes time. And we were just getting really into it with all our big plans and then there was the pandemic. So it will be interesting when the ratings start to come out again. We’ve had a little break from that which was joyful.”

The week I meet her she has been working alongside Scott Mills who is standing in for Ken Bruce and it brings back shudders from her former life when she would start her Radio 1 show after him if she woke up in time.

“Whenever I think of Scott I just think of apologising to him” she admits. She impersonates her younger self whispering guiltily: “‘So sorry you had to do the first 20 minutes of my show.’ I could have been a little bit more responsible. But I did love it when Grimmy [Nick Grimshaw] was doing Radio 1 breakfast and it was say the morning after the Brits I would just laugh. Because at the start of the show he’d be” – she makes an energetic noise – “giddy giddy giddy! But then it would go on and on and I’d think Yeah now you’re holding on to yourself thinking ‘When is this show over?’”

I don’t bring up the dreaded L word but she does; she knows it’s there. “It’s that thing of going ‘Oh the ladette days the ladette days’. But we didn’t set out to be ladettes we were just girls who were having a great time and happened to do that job. I was busy being young. I used to interview people and not know what the fuck I was doing. And now I’m like ‘OK I feel I can chat confidently with you now.’ When I think back to interviewing Noel and Liam for The O-Zone… I’ve always been good about doing my research but there wasn’t the internet then so it was all you know you had to either get hold of your copy of NME or Melody Maker or just wing it. And I did wing a lot of those.”

A highlight of her current show was interviewing Robert De Niro and Al Pacino together which she was not intending to wing at all – she’s had 30 years’ experience now and she adores their work.

Own it represent yourself tell people the truth about who you are

“Even when they greeted each other it was like so many scenes from every film they’ve ever made suddenly happening in front of you. So the interview was going great but suddenly I could feel it coming. This great heat. It’s kind of damp as well and you go quite red. My glasses were steaming up and sliding down my nose in this great heat in this tiny room. And I could see Al Pacino looking at me sort of willing me to get to the end of the question which had no point to it by now since I was on fire.”

It wasn’t until a year or so later she realised that had been her first hot flush. “Menopause took me a while to get a handle on but I seem to be getting there” she says. “It’s a strange thing I look at my daughter and think she’s about to start that journey and I’m about to end it.”

I am unnerved by Zoë Ball being 50 – it doesn’t seem possible. But the change is real in more ways than one. She was going to give in and have a big old celebration for her milestone birthday a proper disco with lots of dancing. “I only really dance at weddings these days I don’t go to clubs or anything any more so when there was talk of this party among my friends I thought yeah all right I’ll have this big do. But to be honest with you when the pandemic came I actually thought” she whispers the next bit guiltily “‘Ooh I don’t have to have a party.’ It was actually quite nice.”

She adores it when her son comes home even though he usually arrives in the middle of the night. “He scares the bejeesus out of me. ‘MUM I’M HOME!’ I’m like ‘It’s midnight I thought you were an intruder.’ He says ‘Do you want a chat?’ and I’m like ‘I’ve got to get up at four what are you doing?’”

Woody has also started not only DJing like his father (his little sister also performs at Camp Bestival as Fatgirl Slim with her dad’s help) but also doing video interviews with people who make music just like his mum. Ball and Cook have been watching approvingly. “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” she says. “Woody makes mixtapes for all the long car journeys we go on together and God he plays great music. I’m constantly going ‘Who’s this new band who’s this?’ He’s been playing for all the gang in his halls probably driving some of them mad; some of the others are having a great time.”

As for her daughter they tried to rope Johnny Ball in to help with the home schooling. “We’ve always tried that: ring Grandad! Grandad will know! Because he’s so clever and he just knows everything. But I remember when I was young asking him why does x equal y doing algebra – and he was so enthusiastic getting the books out talking about Pythagoras. I’d be like ‘Dad I just wanted the answer.’ Although recently I did have a brilliant conversation about Einstein with him. We were under the monorail at Legoland I listened for about 20 minutes and then said ‘OK Dad you’ve lost me now.’ I also had an embarrassing conversation with Nelly lately when she said ‘Test me test me on the Battle of Hastings!’ All I knew was Harold and the arrow. I didn’t know anything else. She just looked at me like shameful. At 11. It’s impressive.”

Ball watched the recent documentary about Britney Spears and says she found it heartbeaking. “The pressure she was under – you just wanted someone to step around her and protect her. It will be interesting to see what happens with that case. Now I look at Billie Eilish and some of those other girls Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift and I love how they are writing their own stories. I just think good on you fucking own it represent yourself tell people the truth about who you are.”

I say but you had the tabloids right up in your face. Are you ever going to say “Well actually what they did to me was really damaging?”

“I think we all know the things they did were… I’m not talking about myself just the overall picture. But it’s just how it was. You just hope that it has changed.”

Still things have not always been easy since the early years. Four years ago Ball’s boyfriend Billy Yates killed himself an event she has described as the worst thing she has ever been through. Since then Ball has done a lot of work for mental health charities including a 500-mile sponsored bike ride. (She has also been in a relationship with Michael Reed a construction firm owner and model – she won’t discuss that; she promised not to.)

She is doing this interview because she has just done her 500th breakfast show on Radio 2 though on the day itself when listeners phone in to congratulate she says she can’t quite believe she’s still allowed to be in the job and jokes that perhaps nobody has noticed. I do think she lives with the anxiety that it could all end. She says her dad taught her to go with the fear of live broadcasting and channel the anxiety into adrenalin but she also clearly loves it. Really truly loves it.

“I think there’s something quite lovely about coming to this sort of age and thinking yeah! Do you know what? I mean 30 years of working in telly and radio. I’ve had it pretty good.”

In collaboration with Bank of America Fairfield Dolan recognized three master’s degree candidates last semester as part of the Women Scholars Program. Cristina Pellegrino ’20 MSBA’21  Diana Velez MSF’21 and Katheryn Xenelis ’20 MSF’21 were selected as recipients of the scholarship based on their academic merit. The scholarship is part of a grant from Bank of America that also supports Fairfield Dolan’s Professional Development Series and the Women in Quant Interdisciplinary Mentoring Series Program that provide practical skills for women entering quantitative fields.

One of the Women Scholars Program recipients Diana Velez had a unique journey to Fairfield with both enriching academic and extracurricular experiences. A competitive golfer since age five Velez received an athletic scholarship to Florida International University. Due to the pandemic she was given an extra year of eligibility to pursue competitive golf at the college level and started to consider where she might be able to pursue a master’s in finance while also playing golf.

“I am from Puerto Rico and I previously interned at Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico's leading bank)” she said. “ Through networking I heard from several people that Fairfield has a strong finance program and I decided to look into it. I am so glad that I did.”

After being accepted to the MSF program and also to Fairfield’s Women’s Golf Team Velez moved to campus where she trained during the day with her teammates and took her courses online during the evenings.

“Even though my classes were online my professors put a lot of effort into making them engaging. Every class had a final presentation and we did interesting projects where we analyzed data from real firms and companies.”

Since recently graduating with her MSF Velez has started a one-year training program in City National Bank of Florida’s Wealth Management / Private Banking division in Miami. She is excited about the opportunity to have hands-on experience with an increase in demand in her field due to the current tax conditions which have influenced many people to move to Florida. Velez is also excited about settling in Miami where she’ll have exposure to international clients as she pursues her interest in wealth management.

“Being recognized by the Bank of America Women Scholars Program is an honor to me as I am pursuing a career in banking. I am aware that this field is known to be a ""men's world"" and in order to stand out and gain credibility as a woman you must be brave and willing to put in double the effort. The fact that I was able to receive this award and join such an amazing group is something truly amazing that gives me a great push and motivation to continue working hard.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZmFhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21vbmV5L2FuYWx5c2lzLXNob3dzLWJhbmstYnJhbmNoZXMtc291dGhlcm4tZGFsbGFzLWRlcG9zaXRzLWZldy1sb2Fucy13ZWFsdGgtZ2FwLWJhbmtpbmctYmVsb3ctMzAvMjg3LTA1MTY2OTU2LWIzMTgtNDRkOC1hMTk0LWRlNzEyNDZiOTE3M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'That's a smoking gun': Analysis shows bank branches in Southern Dallas take deposits but make few loans,"43% of the city’s population lives below Interstate 30 -- about 560000 people -- but only get 26% of the bank loans. The majority are Black and Hispanic.

DALLAS — A bank is supposed to do two things: collect deposits and make loans. And many do – if you live in the right part of town.

Banking Below 30 WFAA’s ongoing investigation of banking practices has found that south of Interstate 30 where most of the residents are Black or Hispanic many bank branches take deposits but those same banks don’t lend much back out to customers in the surrounding neighborhoods.

“It’s devastating and it sets you back financially for years” said Traswell Livingston III. “You can’t catch that up.”

The first time Livingston tried to buy a home in South Dallas three banks turned him down.

“Very frustrating very disheartening” he said “It makes you build up a thick skin.”

Today Livingston owns a home in an historic block near Fair Park where he said many neighbors don’t trust banks.

“They don’t even … inquire anymore because they don’t even think it’s possible to get a loan” he said.

The homeownership gap

Without home loans there is no homeownership. And homeownership is an important way for parents to build up and transfer assets to their children experts say. Research shows however that many Black families lag far behind.

According to the Federal Reserve by age 55 the rate of homeownership among Blacks is 32% lower than it is for whites. And the homes Black families own are worth 35% less.

The disparity gets worse as people age. According to Brookings by age 75 median wealth for a Black family is $46000 compared to $302000 for a white family.

Livingston funneled his negative experiences into a career in real estate and today he is concerned about some of his neighbors who have lived here for decades and are desperate for a small loan to keep up their properties.

“But most of them know that’s not going to happen” he said adding that many are forced to defer maintenance further eroding their home’s value. “Patch it up. Close off the door. Don’t go in that room. Keep moving. Do it with cash or don’t do it at all.”

North-south disparity

WFAA’s analysis of banking data shows in the northern half of Dallas there are 296 bank branches. In the southern half there are 55.

But according to the Child Poverty Action Lab 43% of the city’s population lives below I-30 or about 560000 people. And our analysis shows they are only getting 26% of the bank loans.

But of the banks that do have branches in Southern Dallas how are they performing?

Neighborhoods in DFW are broken down into census tracts. The one Livingston lives in is near Fair Park and includes a Bank of America and a Chase Bank.

We clustered this tract with adjacent tracts -- to create a large area that a bank branch might serve. Then using federal government home loan data which banks are obligated to report publicly we counted all the loans the bank – though not necessarily originated from that branch – made here in 2018 and 2019.

Over two years Chase made four home-related loans and Bank of America made five.

By comparison six miles away in a census tract cluster around a Chase and Bank of America in Lakewood Chase had 171 loans. Bank of America reported 143.

“That’s a smoking gun” said John Taylor a fair lending advocate and head of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. The NCRC has assisted WFAA in analyzing government loan data throughout the Banking Below 30 investigation.

“Should banks be investing in credit-worthy borrowers in South Dallas? If they can show they can pay these loans back that they have enough income should the banks be doing it? The answer is yes of course. That’s the law” he said.

What’s the overall picture for Chase and Bank of America north and south of I-30? In the neighborhoods around Chase’s northern branches there were on average 102 loans around each branch. In the south there are 32. Around Bank of America’s northern branches the average was 67 and 23 to the south. Wells Fargo made an average of 65 around its northern branches and 18 to the south.

In statements to WFAA Chase wrote that it “regularly ranked first or second in southern Dallas for all mortgage lenders and typically ranked first among banks. However we recognize that too many people are not sharing in the region’s prosperity. In southern Dallas and within communities of color we know we can do better…”

Bank of America told WFAA that loan data from 2018 and 2019 doesn't capture the bank's more recent affordable homeownership initiative in Southern Dallas which has recently lent $75 million dollars to 365 low- to moderate-income borrowers and made $4 million in down payment grants to first-time buyers.

Bank of America's latest initiative ""focuses on closing the racial wealth gap in Black and Hispanic-Latino communities with a focus on affordable housing health and healthcare jobs/reskilling and small business"" the company said in a news release earlier this year. ""Through the Community Homeownership Commitment Bank of America is addressing two of the biggest barriers to homeownership -- down payments and closing costs -- which will increase access to homeownership for thousands who have historically not been able to own a home.""

Wells Fargo told WFAA that on its bank exams its distribution of loans to low- to moderate-income borrowers ""exceeded the aggregate lending and received a rating of “good” despite affordability challenges…"" in Dallas.

""Wells Fargo remains committed to helping the southern Dallas community and others thrive with a variety of offerings to address low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities and small businesses"" the bank wrote in a statement to WFAA.

“If the regulators just raised the question ‘Gee you only made four or five loans in all South Dallas what the heck is going on here?’ – that’s what examiners regulators are supposed to do” Taylor said. “They won’t do it unfortunately unless someone makes an issue of it.”

Big banks are regulated by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency. In a statement to WFAA it says: “… examiners do not have the authority to require a bank to make mortgage loans or to make such loans in a specific area.” And that the localized lending data used in our story can be influenced by the level of owner-occupied housing income level market volatility and population trends the OCC said.

A call to activism

Again the definition of a bank is a “financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans.” Advocates say a keyword is “licensed.” The government grants a bank the right to operate and make big profits. But in exchange there are rules.

And they include the Community Reinvestment Act. It’s a powerful federal law that says banks are required to meet the credit needs of the entire community and reinvest in the minority neighborhoods they’ve long ignored.

“We have to confront their greed” said Diane Ragsdale a former Dallas city council member with the Intercity Community Development a nonprofit that helps working families in low- to moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods achieve homeownership.

“The law was created for a reason – banks refused to lend to LMI communities” Ragsdale said. But she acknowledged the law doesn’t work unless the public knows about it and acts. “And that’s where a movement comes into play” she said.

She said people need to understand their roles as advocates for themselves and their neighborhoods and banks need to understand – and take seriously – their roles under the law.

“What is your role? To sit there and do nothing? Just sit there and receive deposits. No!” Ragsdale said. “Your role is to get out there and develop relationships with people – communicate with the people and determine what I can do to meet your lending needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yYXctbWF0ZXJpYWwtY29zdHMtcmlzaW5nLWZvci1hdXRvbW90aXZlLWluZHVzdHJ5LWJvZi1hLXJlcG9ydC0xNzI4MTIzMTUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raw material costs rising for automotive industry: BofA report,"Widespread inflation has led to the highest raw material cost per U.S. vehicle since 2011 a new Bank of America (BAC) Global Research report found.

The report examines the recent bout of US inflation and examines its consequences for the automotive industry.

One key takeaway from the report is that the cost of raw materials has risen sharply since mid-2020. “In the past year the raw material cost in an average U.S. vehicle has been steadily rising increasing ~87% from a low point of approximately $2200/unit in Apr '20 to now roughly $4125/unit in May '21” the report found. “During this raw material cost inflation average transaction prices seem to have stalled although [they] still remain elevated at record high levels.”

The compressing spread between rising raw material prices and stagnating average transaction prices is expected to increase pressure on automakers and suppliers’ respective financial bottom lines.

The average vehicle is composed of 39% steel and 11% aluminum. The increase in raw materials cost has been concentrated heavily in high steel prices; the Bank of America report estimated that the average cost per pound for steel used in automotive manufacturing has increased 106% year over year as of last month. This is “relatively alarming” according to the report given the high makeup of steel in the average vehicle.

Suppliers and original equipment managers (OEMs) are expected to bear the brunt of rising material costs with the latter facing even greater exposure to indirect costs from the former.

Rising inflation costs plus pre-existing damage to supply chains caused by the pandemic present problems for both groups. “The automotive value chain is already facing significant headwinds from supply chain disruptions and production stoppages” the report noted “which continue to pressure margins in addition to rising raw material costs.”

The costs of raw materials have risen so greatly that they now make up a significantly larger percentage of the price of a vehicle. “The cost of raw materials in an average vehicle as a % of the average transaction price (ATP) in the U.S. reached historical lows around 6% (5.9% in April '20) at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic driven by historically low raw material costs and all-time high average transaction prices” the report found. “However this cost ratio has since increased now reaching ~11% as commodity prices have bounced materially off of lows and ATPs have remained near peak levels.”

By the end of spring raw material costs had approached post-2000 historical levels while average transaction prices remained essentially unchanged posing “significant headwind for companies at the front end of the value chain” according to the report.

Story continues

Rising inflation has been an issue of concern for several months now with the Bureau of Economic Analysis reporting Friday that the price index tracking personal consumption expenditure (PEC) rose 3.9% year over year as of May 2021. This is the index's highest level since April of 2008.

The automotive industry has faced a shortage of new vehicles as well as higher demand since the relaxing of lockdown procedures occurred driving up inflation. Imbalances in supply and demand in the automotive industry have accordingly accounted for a large proportion of recent increases in inflation measures like the Consumer Price Index.

It will also see him profit handsomely from a financial services firm he invested in over a decade ago that has among other things helped companies operating in the seedy underbelly of the internet make money.

The company Payoneer is set to go public on the NASDAQ at the end of the month via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) at a valuation of $3.3 billion.

According to Forbes Israel [Hebrew link] Bennett is set to make some $5 million from the move having invested several hundred thousand shekels in Payoneer some 13 years ago. Bennett’s spokesman confirmed to The Times of Israel that he invested in the company but declined to specify how much Bennett stands to earn from the acquisition stating that the amount is “a few million dollars.”

Payoneer was founded in 2005 in Israel by Yuval Tal and Yaniv Chechik. Today it is characterized as one of the largest online money transfer platforms in the world allowing online businesses and gig economy freelancers in different countries to seamlessly transact with each other and with clients. It counts Amazon Airbnb and Fiverr among its partners and transfers payments between buyers and sellers on these platforms.

But a recent leak of US Treasury Department documents reveals that alongside its regular customers Payoneer has also provided services to murky offshore companies allegedly involved in pornography scam dating websites a forex company investigated by French law enforcement and companies involved in the fraudulent binary options industry.

A spokesman for Payoneer acknowledged to The Times of Israel that it had processed payments for such companies but said emphatically that it no longer does so.

“In 2016 Payoneer made a business decision to stop processing payments for high-risk businesses” the spokesman said.

“We no longer process payments for any of these companies and haven’t for years. Payoneer’s compliance program meets the highest industry standards including as it relates to the filing of confidential Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and is audited regularly by leading global auditors and financial regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Payoneer has never been found to have violated any of its AML obligations by FinCEN or any regulator or authority anywhere in the world. Today Payoneer is trusted by many of the world’s leading digital brands including Amazon Airbnb Google and Upwork as well as millions of SMBs worldwide.”

The FinCEN files leak

On September 20 2020 BuzzFeed News together with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and over 100 news organizations around the world published a series of investigative reports based on a trove of over 2500 leaked documents from the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN.

Most of the documents are “suspicious activity reports” commonly called SARs that 90 banks and other financial institutions had submitted to FinCEN between the years 2011 and 2017. FinCEN’s mandate is to combat money laundering.

US banks and other financial institutions are required by law to submit SARs when they suspect that a transaction or series of transactions is implicated in money laundering. The 2500 leaked documents are a small fraction of the 12 million SARs submitted to FinCEN between 2011 and 2017. But they offer a rare glimpse into the murkier side of the global financial system.

The leaked documents which ICIJ has shared with The Times of Israel reveal that numerous Payoneer customers and business partners as well as Payoneer itself were flagged by banks submitting SARs to FinCEN between 2011 and 2016. As a registered US Money Service Business Payoneer is obligated to have a robust anti-money laundering program and even submit its own SARs.

“The bottom line is that money services businesses have a responsibility to try to prevent their own participation in money laundering” Kieran Beer chief analyst for the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) a global anti-financial crime membership organization told The Times of Israel.

“There is a global standard that they’re supposed to meet. It involves having an empowered and qualified anti-money laundering officer. It involves ways for that officer to be heard. It involves training.” he said.

Bennett’s level of involvement in Payoneer’s operations is unknown. While he reportedly [Hebrew link] introduced Payoneer CEO for Israel Keren Levy to Payoneer founder Yuval Tal it is unclear how much involvement a shareholder at his level would have had in the company beyond that. A Payoneer spokesperson declined to address this question on the record. Bennett’s spokesperson did not respond to The Times of Israel’s questions about his level of involvement in the company’s operations.

A high-tech entrepreneur before entering politics Bennett has made millions when companies he owned or had shares in were bought out by larger firms known in Israel as an “exit.”

In 1999 he co-founded the information security company Cyota which was sold to RSA Security in 2005 for $145 million. He is also the former CEO of Soluto which was sold to Asurion in 2013 for $100 million. Bennett reportedly earned several million dollars from each exit.

News of the Payoneer SPAC became public in February. In March reports began to surface of Bennett making millions from an unspecified tech exit. Asked by The Times of Israel he refused to name the firm and the link between Bennett and Payoneer stayed under wraps until Forbes Israel reported on it in early June.

Bennett did not respond to The Times of Israel’s request for comment beyond acknowledging that he is an investor in Payoneer.

The fact that a SAR was submitted does not necessarily mean that any illicit activity took place merely that a pattern of financial transactions raised the suspicions of a bank’s compliance officer. Most SARs do not lead to criminal prosecutions due in part to the sheer volume of them as well as law enforcement being underfunded Beer said.

Nevertheless the leaked documents show that Payoneer sent and received payments for a long list of businesses that operate on the seamier side of the internet.

Payoneer acknowledged to The Times of Israel that in the past it processed payments for the companies listed below but said that it terminated its contracts with all of them several years ago.

From the bedroom to the bank

On August 12 2016 the New York Branch of Barclays Bank PLC filed an SAR about Alcuda Limited a Cyprus company that operated the websites Shagaholic.com Saucysingles.com freesexmatch.com getanaffair.com and hornyasia.com among others.

Alcuda was not a direct client of Barclays but Barclays held a bank account for Earthport PLC a payment services provider while Earthport in turn held an account for Payoneer Inc which was used by Alcuda Limited to move money around according to Barclays.

“A Payoneer customer Alcuda Limited was flagged for review as part of Barclays NY’s surveillance program” the SAR read.

According to the SAR Alcuda sent 29 wire transfers totaling $678810 from Alcuda’s Swiss and Cypriot bank accounts to its Payoneer account.

Barclays Bank submitted the SAR it said because of rumors that the company’s websites were scams and because its domain hosting service had reportedly hosted child pornography.

Alcuda Limited has been accused on multiple consumer complaint websites of allegedly charging credit cards without permission.

According to a 2020 investigative report by the website Snopes.com Alcuda Limited websites were part of a network of about 200 niche dating websites many of them nearly identical in appearance that allowed users to sign up for free but then required a subscription that was nearly impossible to cancel. Snopes.com reporters signed up for a free account on one of the websites in the network and were promptly contacted by a user named “anatasia_mikov” whom they learned was using a stolen photo of a professional model.

“When ‘anatasia_mikov’ messaged us (in Finnish because Snopes was testing the site’s appearance in other countries at the time) she asked if we would like to chat with her. To take ‘anatasia’ up on that offer however a credit card number was required” Snopes.com reported.

At the time of the SAR Alcuda Limited was owned by Ukrainian businessman Maxim Polyakov.

While pornography is generally not illegal several leaked SARs suggest that Payoneer transacted with a company that in at least one instance allegedly employed women who had been trafficked.

A 2014 SAR filed by the New York branch of Societe Generale reported $7196694 of suspicious activities involving three companies: Alcuda Ltd.; Payoneer Payment Solutions Ltd. a Belize-based subsidiary of Payoneer Inc.; and a company registered in Andorra called I.M.L. SLU between November 9 2011 and February 25 2014.

According to the SAR on April 10 2012 and June 6 2012 I.M.L. SLU a client of Payoneer received two wires for $77712.88 and $57825.45 respectively from Alcuda Limited.

I.M.L. SLU was a company that hosted various online adult video streaming sites including imlive.com. It is a sister company of the Israeli company CoolVision owned by Muly Litvak one of Israel’s richest and best-known pornography purveyors.

In 2006 The Manila Times reported that Filipino women and girls providing live sex performances on imlive had allegedly been trafficked by a third party and were allegedly being held as cybersex slaves in apartments throughout the city.

A Filipino official told the newspaper that “the company now allegedly maintains at least 40 women and girls in multiple apartments and condominium units in Metro Manila mostly in Quezon City.”

In 2014 the Israeli television show “Uvda” interviewed some of the women performing for imlive in the Philippines. Interviewees said they worked 12 hours a day were unable to leave their workplaces and go outside except for a day a month and received very little to eat.

The same year Payoneer Payment Solutions transacted with yet another offshore company: Sellinge Management S.A. registered in the British Virgin Islands. According to a SAR Sellinge Management owned the website Anastasiadate.com which according to a 2014 exposé in The Guardian was a dating platform that brought together Ukrainian women and Western men.

While some men have reportedly found love through Anastasiadate.com it came at great expense. The men had to pay for every minute spent video-chatting with a love interest and for every chat message sent.

“Ukraine’s Internet romance industry is booming” The Guardian reported about Anastasiadate.com. “But after chatting online travelling to Odessa and wooing women on flashy dates most men fly home alone and far poorer. Are they unlucky in love or have they been scammed?”

The Guardian concluded that while some of the women on the website were there in good faith many others were perpetrating a sophisticated scam to bilk the men out of money. Even if the site itself was not part of the scams it did benefit from them.

“Anastasia International while not directly colluding in the scams runs a highly profitable business model that allows them to flourish.”

Neither Polyakov Coolvision or Anastasia International responded to The Times of Israel’s requests for comment.

Forex and binary options

According to documents from the FinCEN Files leak Payoneer also transacted with Israel-based companies involved in the forex and binary options industries which allegedly scammed customers out of millions by selling them fake investment bets.

In April 2014 according to an SAR Payoneer sent a payment to Reliantco Investments a Cyprus-registered company behind the website UFX.com the sister website of the binary options website ubinary.com.

Barclays NY filed a January 2016 SAR on ReliantCo and affiliated companies. It explained that it filed the SAR because of the companies’ bad reputations: “One they are located and banking in high risk jurisdictions for money laundering; two they have collectively received financial services warnings from at least twenty (20) different countries for operating as unauthorized unregulated foreign exchange trading companies; and three they were the subjects of numerous unverified complaints in the public domain alleging their business model is a scam” according to the SAR filed by Barclays.

The binary options industry flourished in Israel for a decade before it was outlawed via Knesset legislation in October 2017 largely as a result of investigative reporting by The Times of Israel that began with a March 2016 article entitled “The wolves of Tel Aviv.” At its height hundreds of companies in Israel employed thousands of Israelis who allegedly fleeced billions out of victims worldwide. The fraudulent firms would dupe victims into believing that they were successfully investing and earning money encouraging them to deposit more and more into their accounts until the company eventually cut off contact with the investor and disappeared with all or almost all of their money.” Many of the Israeli firms have since relocated overseas and continued the scam.

Forex or foreign exchange companies offer investors a way to make money off of fluctuations in the international currency market though many are also allegedly fraudulent. The industry remains legal in Israel while many of its allegedly fraudulent actors go unprosecuted.

In 2014 Payoneer received at least two wire transfers from the forex company Aston Invest Ltd according to a SAR submitted by Barclays Bank.

Aston Invest operated from a Ramat Gan call center called Union Inter Ltd. according to Israeli court filings. The call center was owned by a recent French immigrant to Israel named Samuel Shamal whose brother Jimmy Shamal also worked there. Both men according to reports in the French media were previously suspects in the 1.6 billion euro carbon VAT fraud known as the “crime of the century” in France.

In 2016 Aston Invest was investigated by a French judge for forex fraud with a prosecutor in the case visiting Israel. Jimmy Shamal was eventually tried and imprisoned in France according to French media reports though they did not specify which crime he was imprisoned for.

A Payoneer spokesman told The Times of Israel that the company did not do the processing of payments for forex or binary options and the only connection back then was in providing services to networks affiliated with these services.

He said that while Payoneer did process payments for forex and binary options affiliate marketers this was a small part of the company’s overall business.

“Even in 2016 at the point when we decided to stop processing payments for high-risk verticals it was a small part of our business” the spokesperson said.

‘Unknown’ customers and beneficiaries

Other SARs included in the FinCEN trove reveal that Payoneer transferred payments to a money service provider whose end beneficiaries were unknown to the bank filing the report.

In 2016 The Bank of New York Mellon submitted a SAR stating that from February 11 2016 to May 17 2016 it had seen 768 suspicious wires totaling $14218008.19 for the benefit of Moneynetint Ltd. Among the entities transferring money to Moneynetint was Borderless Commerce Limited a subsidiary of Payoneer Inc. On April 25 2016 the company sent one wire in the amount of $1000000.00 for the ultimate benefit of Moneynetint ltd. Since Moneynetint is itself a payments company the money was likely intended for one or more of its clients.

One of the reasons The Bank of New York Mellon submitted the SAR it said was because it could not determine whom the money sent to Moneynetint was meant for.

“The wires are primarily suspicious because many of them do not disclose the true beneficiary/ordering customer and/or some of Moneynetint’s counterparties are shell-like entities or forex/binary options traders” the SAR said.

Moneynetint was in fact a major processor of payments for Israel’s fraudulent binary options industry according to banking documents seen by The Times of Israel.

Additional FinCEN Files documents reveal that Moneynetint transacted with additional companies alleged to be scams.

These included Avilan Marketing LLC a company that sold male enhancement supplements and counterfeit luxury goods. In 2008 Cartier won close to $1 million in damages from the firm because it had sold counterfeit Cartier watches. A 2018 exposé in Germany’s Capital business magazine accused members of the Ben-Menachem family who owned the company of fraudulent advertising on Facebook. Another client of Moneynetint was Clicksure Payments an affiliate marketing company for the binary options industry.

Aviv Ben Menachem of Avilan Marketing did not respond to The Times of Israel’s request for comment.

Moneynetint sent the following response. “Moneynetint always keeps our client’s identity confidential. Like other leading and trustworthy financial institutions Moneynetint provides services to advanced fintech industries and clients. We are proud of our growing involvement and leadership in the financial arena. As per the ‘former clients’ of ours our involvement and facts described are incorrect. Moneynetint takes big pride in always keeping our true client’s confidentiality and security.”

Payoneer acknowledged using Moneynetint as part of its infrastructure in order to make local payments into its customers’ bank accounts but said it never received payments from the company.

Fintech and bad actors

Sources within the payments industry who spoke to The Times of Israel on condition of anonymity said that fintech companies in general will often transact with other payment providers in such a way that their compliance departments don’t always know who the end customer or beneficiary is.

Sources also told The Times of Israel that scams are so common in the online world of e-commerce that even a well-intentioned fintech company will struggle to terminate its relationship with all of the scam merchants.

Despite the difficulty of rooting out bad actors the onus is on money service businesses to try to do so said Beer the anti-money laundering analyst.

Payoneer’s name shows in 24 of the 2500 documents of FinCEN Files leak. In some of these documents the company’s name appears dozens of times.

“Is that damning?” said Beer. “Not necessarily but it really does raise questions about whether Payoneer has a robust anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance program in place. Did Payoneer file SARs with FinCEN on any of these transactions that are mentioned by other financial institutions?”

Payoneer did not indicate whether it had filed SARs about these specific clients but did say that it files SARs on a regular basis. Its spokesman told The Times of Israel that “Payoneer’s compliance program meets the highest industry standards including as it relates to the filing of confidential Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and is audited regularly by leading global auditors and financial regulators in multiple jurisdictions.”

Fraud as a growth industry

The 2500 documents that make up the FinCen Files were originally leaked to BuzzFeed News by former FinCEN employee Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards. On June 3 Edwards was sentenced to six months in federal prison for unlawfully leaking the documents.

In her sentencing memorandum Edwards said she leaked the files because she suspected corruption within the Treasury Department specifically that another unit was illegally gathering information on Americans’ financial records and that Treasury Department officials were failing to cooperate with the Congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections.

BuzzFeed used the leaked documents to write a series of articles in 2017 and 2018 about president Donald Trump his associates and their connections to Russian business and political figures.

Israeli individuals and companies appear in at least 450 of the 2500 leaked documents (which constitute a tiny fraction of the more than 12 million SARs filed between 2011 and 2017). Many of the Israelis named in these documents were suspected of being linked to the porn gambling forex or binary options industries as well as to companies involved in affiliate marketing or payment processing for those industries. Others Israeli and Israeli companies named in the leak are connected to Israeli weapons sales to the diamond industry and to individuals from the former Soviet Union who reside in Israel or have Israeli citizenship.

Mikhail Reider-Gordon an anti-money laundering expert with Affiliated Monitors and a professor at the International Anti-Corruption Academy in Austria said she has come across the constellation of porn gambling forex binary options and other internet scams in her investigations of Wirecard the collapsed German fintech being investigated by prosecutors in multiple countries for money laundering.

“The porn sector the binary options sector the offshore gambling sector a lot of these tie back into organized crime and state-sponsored actors who need to launder money from all manner of other illicit activities like human trafficking narcotics trafficking arms trafficking and the illegal wildlife trade” she said.

According to Reider-Gordon many of these illicit sectors of the economy both on- and offline are intertwined.

“If you need to clean Russian money evade sanctions against North Korea or Iran you’re going to run that money through these entities” she said.

Israel is widely described as a “Startup Nation.” It has the highest number of startups per capita in the world ranks sixth on Bloomberg’s 2020 list of the world’s most innovative economies and ranks first in the world in venture capital per capita.

But as The Times of Israel has documented there is an underbelly to the startup economy. A substantial minority of Israeli startups engage in fraudulent and/or unethical activity.

In 2012 an Israeli government-funded startup incubator known as TheTime published a report on the consumer internet industry in Israel featuring companies that had revenue of nearly 10 million dollars a year or higher. Among these were Payoneer as well as porn purveyor CoolVision several online gambling firms and a plethora of allegedly blatantly fraudulent forex and binary options companies.

These included 4XPlace whose CEO Yossi Herzog was indicted in 2019 by a US grand jury for alleged fraud Tradologic which is being investigated by Austrian law enforcement and SpotOption recently accused of massive fraud by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Not only did Israeli law enforcement never prosecute these entities a government-funded startup incubator in 2012 touted them as Israeli success stories. Spotoption was secretly given Israeli taxpayer funding to expand its operations abroad.

The 2012 report addressed the fact that many of these high-revenue companies also happened to be shady calling them “shadow companies.” A subsequent 2014 report optimistically predicted that the industry would eventually clean itself up through a natural evolutionary process.

Payoneer claims that to the extent that it served shady clients it did clean up its act. But documents from the FinCEN Files suggest that for much of the Israeli internet industry this did not happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Awards Daily looks at some of the crafts behind Showtime’s Your Honor to reveal some of the things you didn’t know about the making of the limited series.

In Your Honor Bryan Cranston stars as a respected New Orleans judge facing the ultimate moral dilemma—turn your son (Hunter Doohan) in for murder and face retaliation from the biggest mob boss (Michael Stuhlbarg) in town or keep quiet and violate the justice system you swore to uphold and protect. The Peter Moffat-created 10 part series is crafted like a dream marring together a gritty crime drama and a whip-smart legal thriller— all unfolding in pulse-pounding fashion.

We spoke to members of the Your Honor crafts team to find out how they brought it all together including:

Edward Berger Director

Volker Bertelmann Composer

James Friend Cinematographer

Lauren Grey Casting Director

Scott P. Murphy Production Designer

David Wyman Production Sound Mixer

Here are some of the best behind-the-scenes tidbits we discovered about Your Honor:

1. Michael Stuhlbarg was casting director Lauren Grey’s first choice for the role of Jimmy Baxter.

A common thread among Your Honor‘s crafts team was finding ways to subvert expectations.

“We were really cognizant from the beginning that if you leaned into the whole Italian thing it’s something you’ve seen a million times before said casting director Lauren Grey. It was much more interesting to go into a different pool of people.

To play Jimmy Baxter a grieving father and Cranston’s central foe they turned to veteran character actor Michael Stuhlbarg.

“He was the first person I thought of” says Grey. I just fell in love with the idea and luckily he was able to do it.”

Stuhlbarg’s reserved demeanor was perfect for the slow simmering tension director Edward Berger was looking for.

“Michael is a very quiet guy and he’s not very physically imposing but it felt like with this quiet menace he could present a very different kind of danger that we could all be frightened off” Berger said. “I think he has a very frightening look in his eyes that gives me chills.

2. Your Honor ‘s cast features a mix of A-Listers and fresh faces in prominent roles.

With Cranston Stuhlbarg and Hope Davis in lead roles and supporting appearances by the likes of Margo Martindale Carmen Ejogo Maura Tierney and others the casting team relied on newcomers and locals to fill out the remainder of the cast.

Peter Moffat’s writing so juicy and meaty and he doesn’t write characters that don’t drive the story forward. Even the small characters really need to be able to pull their weight” said Grey. “We got very lucky that we had a very talented local casting director Megan Lewis who really helped us fill out some of the smaller roles and make it feel very authentically New Orleans.”

Her favorite casting finds for the series include Andrene Ward-Hammond as crime boss Big Mo and Canadian actor Lamar Johnson in the pivotal role of Kofi Jones.

“I think we were successful and really weaving together a grounded real cast to support big-hitters like Bryan” Grey said.

3. The accident sequence at the end of the pilot was one of the most difficult of the whole series.

After suffering an asthma attack during a late-night drive Adam (Doohan) is involved in a hit-and-run with the Baxter family’s youngest son.

“I think it’s a page and a half or two in the script and ended up being like eight minutes long. We wanted to get every beat of that process” says Berger. The temptations of running away or staying and trying to get into Adam’s mind of ‘Am I going to help this person?’ It’s a lot of small beats that each need a shot. It seems to be like one scene but it was actually a massive scene to shoot.”

4. The accident scene also presented a challenge for composer Volker Bertelmann.

Fate was a central motif in the Academy Award nominee’s score for the series.

“It was a challenge to have a consistency over all the episodes and find musical themes that work over 10 episodes and where you don’t fall asleep after episode six” Bertelmann says with a laugh. “But I had the feeling that the show was much more about the inner process and also about fate in a way. It was more about describing the emotions and showing more restraint.”

Adam’s asthma is also a theme reflected in the music.

The biggest challenge was definitely the accident scene for me. I thought it was so realistically filmed that I felt every melody would destroy whole accident” Bertelmann said. I needed to find something that was in a way musical but at the same time wasn’t overtaking the scene. I worked a lot with breath instruments because I felt the inhaler and the breathing of Adam had to continue. I wanted it to feel claustrophobic.”

5. The Baxter house is a combination of two hotels located in New Orleans’ French Quarter.

Production designer Scott P. Murphy served as art director on HBO’s The Sopranos to create the Baxter’s inner lives; he knew he wanted to go a different route.

“Instead of doing that typical cliche mobster thing of spending a lot of money but with no taste I said these people should actually have some class and taste and some sophistication and refinement” Murphy said.”

Murphy said the crew was ‘very judicious’ about when and where to use the historic French Quarter neighborhood.

“We ended up using two different hotels one for exterior and lobby a different one for the restaurant. And then we built on stage a private room and what that allowed us to do for their home was find something really tasteful and grand.”

6. Louisiana weather was not kind to production.

Oscar-nominated production sound mixer David Wyman had his hands full experiencing the entire gamut of his craft from capturing audio of mild-mannered cast members delivering speeches to filming intense action sequences and everything in between.

“We treated it like it was a 10-hour movie. So we had to keep the consistency throughout; though the weather wasn’t cooperative that became part of our daily routine Wyman says. “We did some fun things too. Bryan Cranston was running. And I was on a bicycle recording with my whole rig chasing him down so I could keep the signals in range.”

7. But New Orleans did provide a stunning backdrop for the series.

Cinematographer James Friend draws his inspiration from natural places and shooting on location. The Big Easy provided an excellent visual playground.

“I had never been to New Orleans before. It was quite an overwhelming place visually. It’s culturally very rich and inspirational. And then at night it turns into a completely different world. It has a completely different palette where everything emits light. It’s almost like a weird mini Tokyo-type place” ” says Friend. “It’s quite extraordinary. It’s got a real kind of character and flavor. You can smell it almost taste it. It’s a remarkable place to shoot.

8. Production wanted to give audiences an authentic look at New Orleans.

“I went into the project pitching the idea that we really show the real New Orleans not the tourist version of New Orleans” Murphy says.

The positive feedback Murphy has received from life-long New Orleanians is the part of his work on Your Honor that he remains proudest of.

“People that I’ve talked to since the show has aired that are third or fourth-generation New Orleanians every single one of them has said this is the first time that a TV show or movie has really captured what New Orleans is like and what the real New Orleans is” Murphy said. ” To me that’s what I’m most proud of because that’s what we went in striving to do. And from everything I’ve heard from the people we succeeded.”

All 10 episodes of Your Honor are available now via Showtime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldm9ubGl2ZS5jb20vc3BvcnQvcnVnYnkvZXhldGVyLWNoaWVmcy0zOC1oYXJsZXF1aW5zLTQwLTU1NzkxNjnSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXZvbmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0L3J1Z2J5L2V4ZXRlci1jaGllZnMtMzgtaGFybGVxdWlucy00MC01NTc5MTY5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exeter Chiefs 38 Harlequins 40: Match report - Quins win highest-scoring Premiership final ever,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Exeter Chiefs came up agonisingly short in their defence of their Premiership title going down to an inspired Harlequins side in a breathless final.

In an epic match which saw both sides establish commanding leads it was a late Louis Lynagh double combined with two Marcus Smith conversions which eventually clinched it at a sun-drenched Twickenham.

Stuart Hog dotted down in the final moments to bring about a frantic finale but it was not enough on what was Harlequins' day in front of 10000 fans.

The Londoners had already served notice of what they could do by coming back from 28-0 down to win in their semi-final against Bristol.

And they played with the same ambition confidence and flair right from the off this time round to clinch a second Premiership title.

Exeter held a five-point advantage with just seven minutes remaining but in truth their lead was never comfortable.

Scores from Jonny Gray Alec Hepburn Ollie Devoto and Sam Simmonds plus a Joe Simmonds penalty looked to have taken Rob Baxter's side to a third Premiership crown.

But tries from Wilco Louw Alex Dombrandt Andre Esterhuizen and a penalty try combined with Linagh's late double was enough to take them over the line and secure a famous victory and the highest-scoring Premiership final ever.

Harlequins gave a signal of their intent with just five minutes on the clock with Smith turning down a kickable penalty in favour of a 5m lineout.

It paid off handsomely.

Harlequins won the lineout and drove forward before the maul was collapsed on the tryline. Matthew Carley may have been refereeing his first Premiership final but he showed no hesitation in immediately awarding a penalty try and showing Jonny Hill a yellow card.

Despite being a player down it was Exeter who dominated Sam Simmonds only being denied a 21st try of the season by a superb cover tackle from Lynagh.

But the Chiefs were not to be denied and with Hill back on the pitch they battered the Quins line until Gray Bundled his way over.

Joe Simmonds added the extras.

By this point the momentum was firmly with the Devon outfit and more heavy pressure soon saw them take the lead.

An error from Lynagh handed the Chiefs a lineout 5m out. Several phases and a penalty later Hepburn eventually drove over for a try awarded by TMO Ian Temptest.

Quins also saw key man Smith sent to the bin after repeated offside calls against the Londoners.

But much like Exe in the first half Quins rallied despite their numerical disadvantage.

They kept Exeter pinned back and grabbed a deserved try with just two minutes of the half remaining as Louw powered over. Marchant missed the conversion to keep the Chiefs ahead 14-12.

But that did not last long. Harlequins were rampant by this stage particularly at scrum time. And they made their dominance show by winning repeated penalties close to the Chiefs line before Dombrandt went over thanks to a slick passing move.

Smith added the extras to give Quins a 19-14 lead at the break.

And their momentum continued after the break. Not even five minutes were on the clock when a blistering attack with countless offloads eventually saw Esterhuizen dot down in the corner.

Smith landed a tough conversion to extend their lead to 12 points.

Exeter simply had to respond and respond they did - in the familiar shape of No. 8 Sam Simmonds. His fantastic pirouette and finish - coupled with brother Joe's conversion - made it 26-21 to Quins with 30 minutes left to play.

Harlequins tried to steady the ship but Exeter could smell blood - and they pressed home their advantage moments later.

A rapier-like thrust saw Joe Simmonds set centre Devoto free and the former Bath man ran in for a superb try which the fly-half converted to leave just two points in it.

Exeter extended their lead to five a rare Joe Simmonds penalty following a high tackle after a spell of Exeter pressure.

But Quins refused to lie down and another magnificent attack saw Lynagh swan dive over in the corner to level the scores.

Smith nailed a tricky conversion to sneak Quins into the lead with just seven minutes left.

Lynagh then squirmed over in the corner for another superb try but Hogg dotted won virtually straight from the restart to give the Chiefs hope.

But it was not to be as Quins won a penalty with the clock in the red securing their first Premiership crown since 2012.

One of the ways many people become successful is by approaching every crisis as an opportunity — to learn to invest to grow. Take billionaire business guru Warren Buffett.

He once famously advised investors to be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" He has come through the worst of the pandemic not only richer — his net worth passed the $100 billion mark in March even as he donates billions to charity — but with some valuable lessons for his fellow investors.

Even if you don't have the resources to work the market like the ""Oracle of Omaha"" these eight COVID-19 tips from Buffett can help strengthen your finances.

1. New to investing? Tap into the S&P 500

Joyseulay / Shutterstock

During the annual meeting of his company Berkshire Hathaway last month Buffett talked up his favorite investment — which has been a winner during the COVID crisis.

“I recommend the S&P 500 index fund and have for a long long time to people” Buffett said adding that upon his death 90% of the money he leaves his wife will go into an S&P 500 fund.

S&P 500 index funds are mutual funds or ETFs mimicking the familiar stock index that tracks 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. Despite the pandemic the S&P 500 surged 16% in 2020 and it has been hitting new highs in 2021.

""I like Berkshire but I think that a person who doesn’t know anything about stocks at all and doesn’t have any special feelings about Berkshire I think they ought to buy the S&P 500 index"" Buffett told shareholders at the meeting in Los Angeles.

Be like Buffett: Getting in on the S&P 500 through an ETF or mutual fund doesn’t require a store of cash. You can start building a diversified portfolio merely by investing your ""spare change.""

2. Be practical — even when the market's losing its mind

Though the stock market made millionaires out of people who clicked on the right Reddit thread during COVID lockdowns Buffett has advised his investors to take a long-term practical approach to the market rather than making ""30 or 40 trades a day to profit from what looks like a very easy game.""

During the meeting Buffett displayed a pair of slides that showed the 20 largest companies in the world by stock value today and in 1989. None of the companies on the list from ’89 was on the 2021 version. The lesson: things change and picking winners isn’t easy.

""If you just had a diversified group of equities U.S. equities that would be my preference but to hold over a 30-year period"" he said.

Story continues

Be like Buffett: Investors who do their homework and make informed choices have been rewarded this year as the stock market has marched to new record highs even amid the chaos of COVID-19.

A popular stock trading app helps you reduce your risk by diversifying your investments into exchange-trade funds and even fractional shares (pieces of individual stocks) — and you never have to pay any fees or commissions.

3. Don’t count on pensions

One of the more alarming trends Buffett dove into during the Berkshire meeting was the increasingly shaky status of many state pension funds an issue he said he'd had his eye on since 2013.

“The pension situation is terrible in a great many states” Buffett said. “It has not gotten better. It has not gotten better at all obviously.”

The pandemic has been murder on states’ finances and will only exacerbate a pension problem that currently has no long-term solution. Before the pandemic started state pension plans were already $1 trillion short of the funding they’d need to meet their future obligations to retirees according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

Be like Buffett: If you have a traditional pension plan you may not be able to count on it to provide for you in retirement. You’ll want to get a headstart on making up for whatever shortfalls might await you.

One solid long-term investment play is farmland. The average rate of return on farmland over the past 47 years has been better than 10%. That makes it a better performer than most stocks or other forms of real estate. With worldwide demand for food rising farmland will only grow more attractive as an asset.

4. Investors should stay wary of some investments

Buffett has gotten out of airline stocks because of COVID-19.

The coronavirus crisis has ravaged entire industries. Airlines survived with help from government support. Take that support away and you’d be looking at an entirely new kind of airplane disaster. The industry has months to go before anything resembling normal business — and normal profit margins — return.

“I still wouldn’t want to buy the airline business” Buffett told his Berkshire shareholders.

One of the carriers Berkshire dumped from its portfolio was Delta Air Lines whose shares lost more than half their value between March 1 and May 15 last year. That stock has since recovered along with those of other major U.S. airlines but Buffett has little confidence in the sector’s economic fundamentals.

Be like Buffett: Choosing the right stock out of thousands of potential options can make for a confusing entrance into the market. But several investing apps are available that can make the process a lot easier.

Find out which investing app is right for you and get in the game.

5. Stick to your long-term plan

Buffett says stay on target with your financial goals.

Buffett remains confident that the U.S. economy will bounce back from the COVID crisis but he told his shareholders that the future is far from certain.

“You can bet on America but you have to be careful about how you bet” he said later reiterating that the world can change in “very very dramatic ways.""

Buffett has never wavered from his belief that holding on to stocks long term is the right investment play for a stable financial future. During the Berkshire meeting he was even reminded that he once said holding on to a stock forever “was too short a time period.”

Be like Buffett: A financial planning service can help you sit tight and stay focused with your investments and using one is much more affordable and convenient than you might think.

Today you can connect with a certified financial planner online and inexpensively to keep you on track toward your long-term goals.

6. Take full advantage of low interest rates

1599686sv / Shutterstock

With interest rates falling Buffett says it's a great time to borrow.

Buffett sees fantastic opportunities for borrowers in 2021 thanks to the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keeping its key interest rate near zero.

“It’s a fascinating time” Buffett told investors adding that the low-rate environment ""is enormously pleasant.""

""The economy went off a cliff in March [2020]” Buffett said. “It was resurrected in an extraordinarily effective way by Federal Reserve actions.""

Be like Buffett: If you're a homebuyer or homeowner and have a solid credit score you can capitalize on today's dirt-cheap interest rates by getting an unbelievable deal on your mortgage.

Mortgage rates have inched up this year but they’re still low enough that you could save hundreds of dollars a month by refinancing your mortgage. Compare the best offers from several lenders to be sure you’re making an informed decision.

7. Credit card balances should be avoided

Buffett says if you're carrying credit card debt get rid of it

The pandemic with its business closures and layoffs has forced millions of Americans to rely on their credit cards to cover basic financial needs. It’s a fine survival strategy but the resulting balances and high interest can make for long-term financial stress.

During Berkshire's 2020 shareholders meeting which was held online he recalled the advice he gave a friend who came into a windfall and was wondering about the wisest way to spend it. She told Buffett she also had credit card debt — at 18% interest.

""If I owed any money at 18% the first thing I’d do with any money I had would be to pay it off"" Buffett remembered telling her. ""You can’t go through life borrowing money at those rates and be better off.""

Be like Buffett: If your credit card debt is affecting your finances experts say a good first step toward managing it is to roll it into a debt consolidation loan.

Not only will you simplify your life by reducing the number of bills you’ll be paying but you’ll also slash your interest costs and pay off your debt faster. Instead of 18% you might find yourself paying as little as 5.95% APR.

8. Always be ready for the worst

Buffett said a 'megacatastrophe' was coming.

They don't call Buffett an oracle for nothing. In 2019 he warned that the world was due for a ""megacatastrophe"" that would dwarf the chaos created by hurricanes Katrina and Michael. When the coronavirus first hit the U.S. the multibillionaire said during an interview ""I've always felt a pandemic would happen sometime.""

You’d expect that kind of foresight from someone so heavily invested in the insurance industry — Berkshire Hathaway owns Geico and several other insurers — where planning for the worst is a central part of the business model.

“We've seen some strange things happen in the world in the last 15 months” he told his investors this year. “And we always recognize the fact (that) stranger things are going to happen in the future.”

Be like Buffett: Prepare your family for whatever might come by buying life insurance. COVID-19 has shown how vital it can be to secure coverage for a family breadwinner.

In less than two minutes online you can find and compare multiple life insurance rates tailored to your family’s needs. Lining up $1 million in coverage can cost as little as $1 a day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbm94bmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1vZi10ZW5uZXNzZWUvb3RoZXItc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDYvMjYvdGVubmVzc2VlLXNvZnRiYWxsLWVudGVyLW5jYWEtdHJhbnNmZXItcG9ydGFsLWFsbHktc2hpcG1hbi1jYWxsaWUtdHVybmVyLzUzNTY5NjAwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two Tennessee softball players enter NCAA transfer portal,"Tennessee softball is losing two of its most experienced players.

Pitcher Callie Turner and catcher Ally Shipman have both entered the transfer portal.

""First off I'd like to thank both Ralph and Karen (Weekly) for the opportunity to be a Lady Vol"" Shipman wrote Friday on Twitter. ""This university this program and this fan base will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you to my teammates and support staff for the relationships we have developed over the past three years. After lots of thought and prayer I have decided to enter the transfer portal.

""This has not been an easy decision for me but I believe it is the right one. Love you all and always GBO.""

Shipman a junior from Valencia California has been in the starting lineup for each of her 98 career games at Tennessee since signing with the program in 2019.

She was fourth on the team in 2021 in batting average (.304) hitting eight home runs and 20 total extra base hits despite missing 14 days because of COVID-19.

Shipman started her Lady Vols career on a tear in 2019. She was hitting 328 with 21 hits and 20 RBIs in 22 games when she suffered a broken left wrist and a torn ACL in her right knee.

Turner joined the Lady Vols in 2020 from Land O'Lakes (Florida) High and quickly established herself as a reliable arm in the pitching rotation.

She was 10-3 with a 2.28 ERA with 17 starts this season.

Turner's career record is 18-10 with 33 starts and an ERA of 2.50.

Shipman will have two seasons of eligibility remaining while Turner will have three.",,,,,,

IPX4 certification also gives these beauties sweat and water-resistant protection.

The Powerbeats Pro comes with the same IPX4 certification and is built from most of the same materials. It does have a more matte soft-touch finish plus the multifunctional button is circular and flush compared to the Studio Buds’ elongated and protruding button. Size is vastly different with the Powerbeats Pro being longer and wider. You can choose from eight different bold and bright color options whereas the Studio Buds currently offers three.

Regarding the charging cases it's a case of which do you prefer: huge and highly protective or compact and convenient? One look at the photo above should have you leaning towards the latter because the Powerbeats Pro case is freaking massive and heavy. The Studio Buds case is a crossbreed of the AirPods Pro and Sony WF-SP800N cases and cooler to carry around not to mention lighter.

We only see one benefit to the Powerbeats Pro’s case: it can take beatings. The Studio Buds case will do its job powering and storing the buds but the magnet employed to keep the lid close is weak.

Beats Studio Buds vs. Beats Powerbeats Pro: Comfort and hit

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Tom's Guide)

If you’re someone who fears dropping their earbuds down a sewer grate the Powerbeats Pro offers you peace of mind. It’s all about the ear hooks a vital component of the Powerbeats series that was kept intact for this true wireless iteration and one that provides excellent stability no matter the activity. We’re talking about performing burpees and cartwheels with the buds remaining on your head. The angled sound port allows for easy insertion but also applies pressure to the concha causing some discomfort after workouts or within an hour of wear.

The Studio Buds design is comfortable too except it features a new ergonomically tilted acoustic nozzle with laser-cut micro-vent that decreases pressure on the eardrum. However when it comes to preventing slippage the standard in-ear design can't compete with the Powerbeats Pro’s much more secure wrap-around design.

Beats Studio Buds vs. Beats Powerbeats Pro: Controls

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

The Studio Buds' controls are more intelligible while the Powerbeats Pro’s controls are more practical. We favor the Studio Buds because of its dual voice activation. Saying “Hey Siri” or “Hey Google” will fire up either AI bot on their respective platform (iOS or Apple) getting you quick and accurate results. The mics do a fantastic job of registering commands and vocals. There's also a multifunction button on each bud to handle playback call management and listening modes and it's highly responsive to presses.

One thing the Powerbeats Pro has that the Studio Buds doesn’t is onboard volume controls. There are rockers located at the top of each bud to easily raise or lower volume. A multifunction button is available to perform the same functions as on the Studio Buds's MF button. “Hey Siri” performs equally well and while Google Assistant does work when using these buds with an Android device the “Hey Google” function doesn’t.

Beats Studio Buds vs. Beats Powerbeats Pro: Sound quality

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Music lovers seeking an adrenaline rush during workouts will prefer the Powerbeats Pro’s bass-forward signature which is nicely balanced and doesn’t distort sound like older Beats models. Lows are impactful and well represented when listening to tracks from contemporary music genres like EDM and hip-hop. These buds also produce prominent vocals on acoustic tracks. With lows being emphasized highs don’t receive much attention.

For critical listeners who want to hear imperfections and subtle nuances in recordings the Studio Buds are more sonically appetizing. The 8.2mm dual-element diaphragm driver and custom designed transducers help produce spacious and well-balanced audio while managing the complexities presented by active noise cancellation. That just means you’ll enjoy the same high-quality sound when listening with ANC on. You can expect some amazing clarity detail and range on most tracks.

Bass won’t hit as hard as it does on the Powerbeats Pro but there is enough to stimulate toe-taps or head-nods when vibing out to rhythmic selections.

As for spatial audio neither set of earbuds has the full head-tracking support that you'd get on the AirPods Pro. Still both can play 3D-like songs from Apple Music and will automatically enable the feature where Dolby Atmos-supporting music is available.

Beats Studio Buds vs. Beats Powerbeats Pro: Special features and apps

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

Beats went all out to stock the Studio Buds with premium features specifically active noise cancellation and ambient listening. Noise neutralization is adequate for use in moderately loud environments like shopping centers and train stations.

We estimate the buds are capable of silencing about 75% of ambient noise though high-frequency sounds do make their way onto the soundstage. Luckily they aren’t distracting enough to pull you away from whatever is playing on your smartphone. The Transparency mode needs a lot of work but it should suffice for quick and up-close interactions with people.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

The Studio Buds give you access to some well-known features tied to iOS but not all of them. Audio personalization can be achieved by going into the Settings and selecting from over 20 different presets. Download the System Equalizer Shortcut app and you will have a shortcut to do the same on Android. Headphone Accommodations is another iOS-centric feature that is available to tailor sound to your hearing.

Wireless is where the Studio Buds receives a major boost as Beats developed its own chipset to operate equally well on iOS and Android. These buds use Bluetooth 5.2 to deliver instant connectivity no matter the platform and offer a reliable range (40 feet) to enjoy wireless listening while your smartphone charges in the opposite room. This is also the first Beats release to support Find My in iOS and Find My Device on Android which use your last known location to find lost buds along with Google Fast Pair to expedite the pairing process on Android devices.

There are some people out there who may opt for the Powerbeats Pro’s exclusive software perks. With the H1 chip at the helm these buds grant you auto switching between iCloud-registered devices audio sharing between two Apple or Beats headphones and Siri Announce Notifications. Pairing to iOS/macOS machines is also a bit faster on the Powerbeats Pro.

Firmware updates can be pushed through on either set of buds and new features could be introduced to the Studio Buds and Powerbeats Pro via iOS 15; we just don’t know if they’ll be optimized for the H1 chip and Beats’ new processing architecture.

Beats Studio Buds vs. Beats Powerbeats Pro: Call quality

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Tom's Guide)

The Powerbeats Pro has always impressed us with its call quality nearly matching the AirPods Pro. Even without ANC technology the beamforming mics block out a good amount of ambient noise during calls. This allows for loud and clear conversations both indoors and outdoors. Wind resistance is the only true weakness; it becomes difficult to communicate in drafty conditions.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

It is shocking to see the Studio Buds underperform as a calling headset especially since Beats stuffed some strong specs into the model. We received complaints about muffling when taking calls outside. Voices sounded clearer when chatting in quiet environments but cutout was persistent no matter the location. Wind only made matters worse.

Beats Studio Buds vs. Beats Powerbeats Pro: Battery life

(Image credit: Future)

You’re getting sufficient playtimes with either product. Based on our testing and rated battery life the Powerbeats Pro is the longer-lasting option. A full charge earns you 9 hours of use which is really 8 hours when factoring in volume heavy streaming and calls. The Studio Buds are rated at 8 hours but that number drops to about 6.5 to 7 hours when taking those same variables into account; ANC decreases playtimes to about 4.5 to 5 hours.

An unsung feature on that is available on most AirPods and Beats models is Fast Fuel charging. The Studio Buds have a stronger version of it and can get you 1.5 hours of playback on a 5-minute charge while the Powerbeats Pro gets you 1 hour in the charge time. Optimized Battery Charging is also available on each model and learns your daily charging routine to preserve battery health.

(Image credit: Regan Coule/Future)

The charging cases hold the same battery life when fully charged: 24 hours. It decreases to 15 hours on the Studio Buds when ANC is enabled. Wireless charging meanwhile is MIA and remains exclusive to current AirPods models.

Winner: Beats Powerbeats Pro

Beats Studio Buds vs. Beats Powerbeats Pro: Overall winner

Beats knew it had to go in a different direction with the Studio Buds. The leaks and rumors suggested we were in for a treat but we didn’t expect this lower-cost pair to be better on the whole than its fitness-centric sibling.

To build an entirely new chipset for platform neutrality is an ambitious move that pays off giving both Android and iOS owners the same rewarding user experience. Even though the bass levels are toned down sound is spacious and detailed plus we like that you can still enjoy spatial audio despite no H1 chip. Noise cancellation is also tenable for blocking out common distractions and much better than we anticipated for the price.

Two years on the market and the Powerbeats Pro is still a go-to for avid exercisers. You’re getting signature Beats audio with emphasized bass that rattles your eardrums along with the ear hooks to keep each earpiece in place during workouts. Battery life still ranks highly even if it's no longer among the best in its class.

Unfortunately for the Powerbeats Pro it just isn't as suitable for casual listening due in large part to the lack of lasting comfort. With the newer smaller buds proving easier on the ear while making significant improvements in sound and platform support it's the Beats Studio Buds that can claim to be Beats' best true wireless earbuds overall."

Zach Weber finally got the upper hand against Ryan Crabtree in a playoff winning the Black Rock Championship on Sunday at Hagerstown’s Black Rock Golf Course.

After each player finished 36 holes at 142 No. 8 was the first destination for the playoff and Weber posted a par-4 to claim the title.

Weber held a four-stroke lead through 11 holes before Crabtree rallied closing the back nine with a 32 for a 69 including an eagle-3 on No. 12. Weber held off Crabtree with a 70.

The two golfers were locked in a playoff at a championship tournament for the third time in their careers with Crabtree having won the previous two — at the 2014 Coors Light and 2017 WACO.

First-round leader Trey Colliere finished third at 145 shooting a 74 on Sunday after his 71 on Saturday.

Other flight winners included Christ Wagner (first flight) Randy Barnes (seniors) and Tim Steiner (super seniors).

MUMBAI: Quality stocks have had a poor run as compared to value stocks in the stock market – at home as well as globally. So far in 2021 Nifty500 Value 50 index has trounced the Nifty200 Quality 30 index in terms of absolute returns.As a cyclical recovery took hold at home and globally from September investors have rapidly switched to value stocks and made astronomical returns in a short span. The Nifty500 Value 50 index is up 41 per cent from September. By comparison the Nifty200 Quality 30 index has risen merely 9 per cent.Yet after months of underperformance quality stocks are making a comeback. Over the past month quality stocks are showing signs of life as the Nifty200 Quality 30 index has returned nearly 5 per cent outperforming the value factor.“Economically sensitive cyclical stocks have had a very strong run year-to-date. We don’t think their full potential is exhausted but we do see an opportunity to also turn attention to quality stocks as the cycle’s next beneficiaries” Blackrock ’s Antonio DeSpirito said in a recent blog post.The world’s largest asset manager with over $8 trillion in managed assets believes quality stocks could become the leader of the next leg of the global equity bull market.The reason for Blackrock’s change in view rests on its belief that the global economy is now progressing from an early business cycle to mid-business cycle. With easy returns such as those seen over the past 14 months difficult to come by and investors increasingly wary of inflation running hot and central banks tightening leash on liquidity certainty of earnings and low volatility could become a dominant theme.“We see potential for quality to rerate higher. As the cycle evolves the market will look ahead to more normalized growth rates and investors are likely to grow more cautious amid concerns around taxes inflation and the timing of a Fed policy shift” DeSpirito said.While Blackrock’s view is largely centered around the US equity market it can be easily extended to Dalal Street. Back in November as major global asset managers started talking up cyclical stocks on announcement of COVID-19 vaccine approval Indian cyclical stocks started seeing strong inflows from foreign portfolio investors.If foreign asset managers rotate funds towards more low volatility and quality stocks going ahead the trend is likely to replicate in India said money managers. “Beyond the short-term tactical opportunity we also see a long-term structural case for maintaining a quality bias” DeSpirito said.Blackrock said that its analysis showed that quality stocks tended to outperform the broad market in long period and the “only time quality did not maintain its edge was in the early emergence from recession”.“This period also set the stage for an attractive entry point into an investment style that from here forward could lend some portfolio resilience as this unusual and potentially fast-moving economic and market cycle unfolds” DeSpirito said.",,,

Guest columnist

John Landry is a historian in Providence and a member of The Journal’s advisory board for “Our Hidden History.” A descendant of French Canadians by way of Louisiana he is writing a book on Rhode Island’s economic development. Contact him at johntlandry@icloud.com.

The conventional wisdom is that established Rhode Islanders first build up a flourishing economy then let in immigrants as cheap labor. But the process was actually interactive as Woonsocket shows.

The city was initially just a village in the town of Cumberland notable for one of the largest drops in the Blackstone River. But in the 1800s that 30-foot fall started powering dozens of textile mills.

Meanwhile farming in eastern Canada especially Quebec a few hundreds of miles to the north was in long-term decline. Farmers looked for opportunity in the fast-growing industrial towns.

They were especially interested in Rhode Island where French-speaking Huguenot refugees had settled (initially in East Greenwich’s Frenchtown section in 1686). With the mills’ recruiters easing the way nearly a million French Canadians came to New England after 1840 many of them here.

These immigrants soon dominated the mills of Woonsocket. They replaced their agricultural rhythms with industrial discipline and developed special skills in textile-making. French was more common than English in many of the city’s schools churches and shops. (The city’s Museum of Work and Culture describes this process in depth.)

In turn they gave Woonsocket an extra lease on life in the 20th century. By 1890 most of the state’s textile mills had begun a long-term decline including Woonsocket’s mammoth Social Mill. But an energetic young state representative Aram Pothier had other ideas.

Pothier a clerk at the Woonsocket Institute of Savings was himself a native of Quebec. He moved to the city at the age of 18 with his parents in 1872 settling in a house on Pond Street that he would never leave.

A term on the city’s School Committee got him noticed then his fluency in French gained him a crucial appointment as the state’s delegate to the 1889 Paris Trade Exposition.

In the late 1880s French and Belgian industrialists had developed new textile technology superior to methods used in the United States especially in woolens. But why should they risk their capital in such a foreign country?

Pothier offered two advantages: The first was the U.S. government’s steep tariff on textile imports. Unless the industrialists produced here they would lose most of that rapidly expanding market. But the second was that Woonsocket would be familiar territory as a textile center dominated by French culture and language. Pothier later added a 15-year exemption on property taxes to sweeten the deal.

He eventually won over Joseph Guerin Auguste Lepoutre and other entrepreneurs and together they built a new cluster of woolen mills in the city. Most important was Auguste’s son Jacques who moved here in 1920 and built a mansion near downtown. Jacques helped convince hundreds of skilled French and Belgian workers to immigrate as well further developing Woonsocket.

Pothier rode this success to further achievement becoming mayor in 1893 lieutenant governor in 1897 and then governor in 1908. He was the state’s first (and so far only) chief executive born in a non-English speaking home and he performed well enough to win several elections over 10 years. He paved the way for future leaders from immigrant political bases.

Thanks to its superior technology Woonsocket industry kept going into the 1950s even as its cotton mills closed. Southern woolen mills eventually caught up and the proud French-speaking workforce refused to accept drastic wage cuts to keep their jobs. All but the most specialized mills shut down.

By then however Woonsocket had a sizeable commercial base for diversifying its economy as well as solid institutions such as Mount St. Charles Academy.

But what about the rest of the major recruiters of MBA talent from these three business schools? If you want the answer to that question don’t go to the MBA employment reports published by the schools. All three business school giants keep the major employers of their MBAs under wraps.

Now for the first time an extensive analysis of MBA recruits by Menlo Coaching the premium MBA admissions consulting firm has pulled the curtain back on exactly which firms are hiring in a big way from these schools. Menlo Coaching’s research team analyzed 51991 student profiles on LinkedIn to get to the bottom of it. What does the analysis reveal?

SURPRISES SIMILARITIES & DIFFERENCES IN WHO HIRES MBA TALENT FROM HARVARD STANFORD & WHARTON

“Harvard Stanford and Wharton have some things in common: all of them placed strongly at McKinsey Bain BCG and Google” says David White a founding partner of Menlo Coaching. “At Harvard the vast majority of top employers were leading global brands whether in finance (KKR Blackstone Bain Capital) tech (yes all of FAANG were among their top employers) or even consumer products (Estée Lauder). The only emerging company to make the list of top recruiters at HBS was June Motherhood a startup that came out of the Rock Accelerator at HBS.

“On the other hand” he adds “around one third of the top employers at Stanford were startups or smaller companies including multiple companies started by Stanford GSB founders. Some of these startups were based outside the US such as Muni Tienda an ecommerce platform in Latin America. At Wharton there was a mix of everything. Although the leading consulting firms and investment banks were well-represented Wharton also placed well at exciting tech companies (TikTok DoorDash) in private equity (H.I.G. Capital hired numerous graduates) and in healthcare.”

How useful to applicants are these stats? They may very well have more entertainment value than anything else. As White notes “lists of top employers don’t reveal everything. At each of the programs there were also exciting employers that hired only one or two graduates in 2020.”

THE STATS REVEAL SEVERAL BIG TRENDS IN MBA HIRING OVER THE YEARS

Evident in the stats are some of the big trends in MBA hiring. The bulge bracket banks now employ fewer MBA graduates than they used to and have largely been replaced by several of the tech giants most notably Google Amazon Microsoft and the global consulting giants. Some 20 years ago Goldman Sachs was the number one financial recruiter at Wharton carting away 42 MBAs from the Class of 2000. Last year Goldman hired half a dozen less than Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Evercore or H.I.G. Capital. BofA/Merrill hired just eight Wharton MBAs in 2020 less than half of the 27 Merrill alone employed out of the Class of 2000.

Meantime MBB still displays a voracious appetite for MBA talent from Wharton. In fact Boston Consulting Group has more than doubled their hires from the school in the past 20 years bringing aboard 56 Wharton grads from the Class of 2020 up from a mere 22 in 2000. McKinsey’s hiring is roughly the same: 56 last year and 61 some 20 years ago. Ditto for Bain & Co. which employed 26 out of the Class of 2020 vs. 34 from the Class of 2000.

The days when a lot of firms hired MBAs by the boatload are long gone with only MBB left. Look back those 20 years at Wharton and it took ten hires from a single class to make the Top Ten major employers. Today a company need only hire a pair of Wharton grads to make its Top Ten list.

STANFORD MBAs HAVE A CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR STARTUPS EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES VC AND PE FIRMS

The other big trend goes to the ambitions of today’s MBA graduates. More than ever they want to graduate into roles that allow them to have immediate impact. That is why so many Stanford MBAs gravitate to startups and early-stage companies that provide greater responsibility off the bat and more opportunity to make a difference to the hiring organization. This trend is most pronounced at Stanford in part because so many entrepreneurially driven students are naturally attracted to the school and because they are surrounded by a startup culture and ecosystem that knows no peer.

Among the 24 major employers at Stanford last year more than a third–at least nine–qualify as startups or early-stage players that few would immediately know about. The include Rested DataFleets Muni Tienda Sagelink Stealth Startup Check FarmRaise and Juni Learning. And then there is DoorDash and Peloton. Compare that to the

the 28 largest employers at Wharton: only two would quality as startups or early-stage companies: DoorDash and TikTok. Of the 25 biggest hirers at Harvard there’s one startup but also Netflix and Lyft.

Often times smaller elite firms that crop up on these lists have founders who are alumni of the schools. Consider Owl Ventures a Silicon Valley-based venture capital fund that invests in the world’s leading education technology companies. Though Owl recruited only a pair of Stanford MBAs last year it puts the firm among the Top Ten tied with 14 other employers. But a Stanford MBA is nearly a prerequisite to work there. Co-founded by Stanford MBA Tory Patterson in 2014 all four of the VC fund’s managing directors and three of the five principals sport Stanford MBAs on their CVs. The one MBA interloper among the principals is a Harvard Business School grad.

DELOITTE NOT ALL THAT SUCCESSFUL IN HIRING Harvard MBAs OF LATE

No less interesting is who’s not on these lists. Who would have thought that Deloitte Consulting now among the top ten employers at Wharton and Stanford would have so little success at Harvard Business School. Last year more Harvard MBAs began employment at June Motherhood a digital health startup that offers virtual pregnancy and postpartum support for women than Deloitte which doesn’t make this list of Harvard’s top 28 employers of the Class of 2020. There’s a catch here of course. The startup was founded in 2020 by three Harvard MBAs so each of them qualifies as a co-founder of the company. By the way two of the three used to work for Deloitte.

Apple pops up at both Harvard Business School (4) and Stanford (3) but doesn’t make the list of major employers at Wharton though the company also recruits on the Philadelphia campus. Goldman Sachs hired at least six Wharton MBAs and five Harvard MBAs last year but was nowhere to be found among the major employers at Stanford.

The FAA is unwilling to certify the Boeing 777X. The regulatory agency has informed Boeing that it won’t give Boeing Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) for the 777-9 unless the airframer provides evidence that it has conclusively solved a number of software and hardware issues. The FAA had signaled this in a letter to Boeing on May 13 The Seattle Times and Reuters have reported on June 27.

Since January 25 2020 Boeing is busy testing and preparing certification of its biggest type the 777-9. According to the order book the 777X has a backlog of 309 orders but Boeing reported last February that it has revised the program accounting quantity from 350 to 191 aircraft that are expected to be actually sold. In January CEO David Calhoun confirmed during the 2020-results webcast that following consultation with regulators Boeing was to redesign the firmware and hardware of the Actuator Control Electronics (ACE). This system translates analog control inputs into digital signals to the surface control systems and is provided by Japanese company Nabtesco.

Most worries over Common Core System

The May 13-letter disclosed by The Seattle Times and Reuters today and seen by Airinsight reveals more issues with the 777X. The most critical is the Common Core System (CCS) referred to by the FAA as a “very complex and critical avionics system (…) that provides a set of computing networking and input/output resources to support the computing and system interface needs for multiple airplane systems. The CCS also provides the means for hosted functions of all criticalities of safely to share the same physical resources.” The letter identifies 56 different hosted functions by the system which on the 777X is of a completely different design from the 777-300ER.

In letters dated April 12 and May 7 Boeing’s Organization Designation Authorization Lead Administrator Tom Galantowicsz asked the FAA approval for the 777X entering phase 1 of Type Inspection Authorization despite acknowledging that software of the CCS was still incomplete as was data for the Design Assurance Review (DAR).



In the May 13-reply the FAA says it “considers that the aircraft is not yet ready for TIA even if it is a phased TIA of limited scope with small number of Certification Flight Test Plans proposed. The technical data required for the type certification has not reached a point where it appears the aircraft type design is mature and can be expected to meet the applicable regulations.” Only the first phase of DAR has been completed but phases 2 and 3 have yet to follow. Without this the FAA has difficulty determining if the CCS is mature enough. The FAA adds that Boeing and the agency have been discussing TIA criteria for nine months and that DAR dates have continuously slipped.

No evidence that the 777-9 meets safety assessment

Nor has Boeing been able to provide evidence that the 777-9 meets the Preliminary Safety Assessment which means that Boeing doesn’t meet its own TIA criteria. There is insufficient and inadequate data available to file the Certification Flight Test Plans for this phase of TIA. An assessment of CCS concluded that “data is not yet mature enough to show compliance lists many open problems against safety documentation assessments and requirements” especially as the GE Aviation system will have a few software updates soon that will address previous shortfalls. It also notes that the analysis included incorrect use of data from the Boeing 787.

The letter by FAA’s Ian Won says that the software update will also fix a serious issue that happened to the second of four 777-9 test aircraft (N779XX) on December 8 2020. Without disclosing further details the aircraft experienced an un-commanded pitch event in which it either pitched up or down. The FAA says it has “yet to see how Boeing fully implements all the corrective actions identified by the root cause investigation including system requirement and tracing robust verification process supplier communication systems integration validation and verification and airplane level verification to ensure the ‘maturity’ and safety/airworthiness of the aircraft.”

“We also expecting Boeing to complete comprehensive validation verification reviews and document the process improvements and lessons learned identified by the root cause investigation and implement a robust process so similar escape will not happen in the future and this is not a systemic issue.”

The letter to Boeing also reveals that the update of the Actuator Control Electronics that Calhoun mentioned in January is still not complete. The FAA says that it is Europe’s EASA that hasn’t agreed “on a way forward with the 777-9” while the FAA is worried that a redesign might introduce new inadvertent failures.

Certification not before late 2023

With the FAA unwilling to certify the 777X the 777-9 will realistically receive its amended type certificate not until mid or late 2023 at the earliest. While this is in line with what David Calhoun has said in January it is evident from the FAA letter that even this date is subject to confirmation. First deliveries are likely to be pushed into early 2024 which is four years behind the program schedule.

The letter also confirms the position of Emirates whose President and CEO Sir Tim Clark has been saying in numerous interviews recently that he has no visibility on the 777X program status and deliveries to his airline. “This could be 2023 2024 or even 2025” Clark said in one interview. Qatar Airways’ Akbar Al Baker on the contrary said recently that he has been given specific information on his delivery position.

How Boeing has responded to the May 13 letter isn’t known. The airframer told The Seattle Times that it remains fully focused on safety as our highest priority.”

Boeing (BA 0.50%) has been building the 767 for four decades: an incredibly long time for a single generation of a commercial jet. In theory it ought to be obsolete: Boeing and top rival Airbus have each introduced multiple new wide-body jet models since the 767 entered service in 1982. Yet despite the model's age the 767 is still going strong with a steady stream of orders and deliveries. Indeed it has become an increasingly important contributor to Boeing's financial results lately. Let's take a look.

An unlikely recovery

Boeing began developing the 767 nearly half a century ago. The model sold well during the 1980s and 1990s but demand plunged after the 9/11 attacks decimated the global airline industry. The launch of the 787 Dreamliner a few years later caused demand to erode further.

Indeed whereas Boeing booked 242 gross orders for 767s between 1997 and 2001 the 767 family brought in just 55 orders between 2002 and 2006. Meanwhile 767 deliveries plunged from an average of more than 40 per year between 1997 and 2001 to an average of just 11 annually from to 2004 to 2010. The 767 appeared to be well past its prime and nearing the end of production.

Yet the aging 767 has experienced a renaissance of sorts over the past decade. First in early 2011 the U.S. Air Force selected Boeing's KC-46 Pegasus tanker -- a modified 767 -- to replace 179 of its KC-135 tankers. Second FedEx and (to a much lesser extent) other cargo airlines ordered a slew of 767-300F freighters mainly to replace older out-of-production models. Between 2011 and 2020 FedEx alone placed firm orders for 130 767-300Fs.

To meet this demand Boeing has gradually increased 767 production in recent years. In 2015 it was building 767s at a rate of 1.5 per month and delivering them at an even slower pace. By 2020 Boeing had doubled its 767 output building three per month. And in recent years 767 deliveries have roughly matched official production rates.

A steady contributor

Between 2018 and 2020 Boeing delivered 100 767s: an average of 33 per year. United Parcel Service took 10 of those with the other 90 split about evenly between FedEx and the Air Force. Having steady customers for the 767 has been invaluable as Boeing's passenger jet models have all run into trouble over the past few years.

Five years ago Boeing was building more than eight 777s and 12 787s per month compared to just two 767s. But a sharp drop in demand for passenger wide-body jets has forced the industrial giant to slash the 777 and 787 production rates to just two and five per month respectively. Moreover Boeing 737 deliveries slowed dramatically in 2019 and 2020 due to the 737 MAX grounding. That makes the 767 Boeing's only commercial jet program to increase its production relative to 2016.

Boeing should be able to maintain its current 767 production pace for at least a few more years. It still has more than 130 KC-46 tankers in the pipeline all of which should be delivered by 2028. That translates to annual output of about 18 767s. Boeing has also captured a handful of international orders for the KC-46. Finally FedEx has 50 767-300Fs on order for delivery over the next four years after exercising options to buy another 20 earlier this month.

All good things must come to an end

The Boeing 767 still has a few good years in front of it. But after 2028 its future becomes murky.

For one thing Boeing will finish building the 179 KC-46 tankers ordered by the U.S. Air Force around then. Perhaps the Air Force will order more or big international orders will finally start rolling in -- but there are no guarantees. Meanwhile the 767-300F does not comply with new emissions standards promulgated by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Barring a change in the rules that means production must cease before Jan. 1 2028.

Unless Boeing gets a lot more KC-46 orders it will likely sunset 767 production by 2030. Even in a best-case scenario it would probably need to slow production compared to the current rate of three per month. But no matter what the future holds the Boeing 767 will go down in history as a highly successful model with remarkable longevity."

In this instalment senior journalist Wong Pei Ting speaks to Mr Tony Fernandes the chief executive officer of AirAsia Group which in March launched a food delivery service in Singapore as part of ambitions to become Asia’s next “super app” to rival Grab and Gojek.

In June the Malaysian budget airline made a call for interested fresh produce and grocery merchants to join the platform as it also wants to go into grocery delivery.

These moves generated curiosity as many airlines dealing with the impact of grounded flights during the Covid-19 crisis have taken temporary measures to cut losses. Why did this airline imagine it could break into the delivery sector? Still AirAsia may prove to be a trailblazer. Another airline Cathay Pacific has just unveiled plans to sell products other than air tickets to its customers in an effort to generate fresh revenue.

Speaking to TODAY over video conferencing platform Zoom from his office at Wisma Tune in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on Tuesday (June 22) Mr Fernandes 57 talks about why he is not daunted by the challenge and how he managed to convince his board that it would work.

Excerpts of the interview are edited for length and clarity.

Pei Ting: How have you been coping with the ups and downs of managing the airline business in the last year and a half?

Tony: We are still alive and that's already a victory I suppose. We haven't got a big benefactor like Temasek (Holdings the parent company of Singapore Airlines) or people like that so it's a commendable effort. Number two we know that the end is in sight — in a matter of months we are going to start seeing travel resume.

So yeah I'm okay. I've taken the positives out of Covid. We've been able to spend more quality time at home. I've lost some weight. I have re-engaged with my body and tried to look after it better. I have had more time to think. Strategically we have pivoted our business. I'm a better human for sure.

Pei Ting: What did you do differently this season?

Tony: I can’t say I read a book. I’ve picked up a book read a few pages and put it down unlike you who have a lot of books behind you. Your books are all over the place. I have a little bit of a disease — OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) where your bookshelf would drive me nuts.

Pei Ting: No wonder your bookshelf is so neat (read: empty).

Tony: I was not going to read much anyway but I think I am more reflective. I’ve had time to read — I read a lot just not books — and I watched more documentaries than I’d ever had before and I'm more learned as a person. I'm more patient as a person.

Pei Ting: Let’s talk about the new territory that AirAsia is moving into. An airline going into food delivery is unheard of...

Tony: I always thought we were more than an airline. I always said that. But now I'm officially saying it that AirAsia Group is no more just an airline.

We have an engineering company we have a joint venture with SATS which is an aviation services group called GTR. We have a restaurant and food group called Santan which will soon be opening in Singapore. We have three digital companies: AirAsia super app; a fantastic logistics business called Teleport and finally BigPay.

So while our roots were in an airline we are now a digital lifestyle company. I’ve just named our new tagline as “A way of life” as opposed to AirAsia aviation which is “Now everyone can fly”.

Pei Ting: Can you tell us more about how the idea came about and how it gained steam?

Tony: The roots of this idea is in my first or second job with Richard Branson at Virgin Group. AirAsia was actually going to be called Tune Air. And Tune was gonna be my brand builder — Tune Hotel Tune Talk Tune Insurance et cetera. Virgin started with Virgin Records but started owning an airline gyms and spacecrafts. That's the genesis. It was always in my mind. The biggest decision I had to make was naming the airline AirAsia. Now AirAsia is such a big brand that I'm dropping Tune and everything became ‘AirAsia’. It's harder because the word ‘Air’ is in there. But you know there’s Air Jordans so we can create a lifestyle from ‘Air’. (Laughs)

So that’s the genesis. And now we’re the first super app that’s underpinned by travel as opposed to being underpinned by food or ride hailing.

Now I was really ahead of the game if I can praise myself one second. We were the first digital company in reality online commerce. The genesis of this has been in my mind for a long time and now Covid has allowed us to really focus.

When you have 240 planes on the ground then you begin to think and move your strategy faster.

Pei Ting: Can you give us a sneak peek into the boardroom conversations? On the one hand AirAsia like many other airlines announced workforce cuts and struggled as planes were grounded. On the other hand we are talking about creating a super app which comes at a cost.

Tony: Yeah you can stand still and die or you can use cash wisely.

We have been very frugal. We've used our underlying assets which is our data and our brand to go build these other businesses. I think your question is how did you persuade the board to make these investment decisions when cash was limited. Quite easy because if you're just an airline you're less sexy right? But if you have businesses that have potential to be bigger than the airline then the paradigm shifts. It's not easy to persuade a board to do that but I'm lucky that I have a visionary board.

Pei Ting: What made you believe that an airline would be able to succeed in this endeavour? I read about your “rich database” of 60 million customers. How does that give you an upper hand?

Tony: We're good at brand building. We're a brand that people like. I mean not everyone loves me or loves our brand but we're more lovable than any of those digital brands that don't understand humans.

And we have the beautiful position of not having to build anything. I didn’t invent food hailing so we save a lot of money by emulating all of them. We don’t have to spend the hundreds of millions that they took to develop all of this because the tech is out there already. We add our own unique AirAsia sauce to it.

And I dare say we have better data than all of them because when you fly on a plane you’re spending a bit more money. Our rewards programme is hence slightly different. We built 19 years of loyalty. On ride hailing I think you can make up your name. You don't even know if it's a real person. There’s a slightly different data profile there.

Pei Ting: Is the goal for the superapp to be a long-term strategy for AirAsia or is it a stopgap measure to tide over the pandemic?

Tony: This is a long term relationship. This isn’t something just because the airline business is down we decided to go build a digital business. It was always in my plan that we were more than an airline and Covid has accelerated that. And I dare say not Covid as much but great companies such as Grab Foodpanda Expedia and Agoda have given us confidence to go and do that.

Pei Ting: So is AirAsia going into ride-hailing as well?

Tony: For sure.

Pei Ting: What are your priorities now?

Tony: Travel. Can we compete with Booking.com and Expedia? 100 per cent. I own the flight they don't. By building all these ancillary services you're going to open my app more.

Travel is my number one. Two is the delivery business. Three is financial services – serving the underserved – giving you decent loans giving you the ability to invest. Four is health – integrating online health solutions keeping medical records in one place online pharmacy for example. Five is education. We've been educating our staff all these years. We're training cabin crew to become data scientists now. We took dispatch boys to become pilots. And then finally content.

Pei Ting: I wonder how sustainable is unlimited free delivery and one-cent meal promotions which are the app’s main draw currently.

Tony: Oh I had been giving free seats for 19 years. Ask Amazon how sustainable Amazon Prime is. Pretty sustainable. Ask Netflix – all you can watch for S$12. Pretty sustainable.

Pei Ting: What’s the secret then? The business cost would have to go somewhere.

Tony: When I retire come to my Harvard Business School lectures for a small fee. (Laughs) I ain’t gonna tell TODAY. Otherwise tomorrow Cathay will be announcing the same thing and Singapore Airlines will become an Amazon super app. They are all trying to do it right? Everyone has got their rewards programme. But culture plays a big part.

Pei Ting: How and why was Singapore picked as the next stop for AirAsia Food outside of Klang Valley?

Tony: I love it. It took me eight years (to start flying from Singapore). It’s my biggest challenge in life. Is it love from a romantic standpoint or is it love from a challenge standpoint? I leave you to guess. But for eight years I couldn’t fly in Singapore and I never gave up.

Is it the biggest market? No. Is it better to go somewhere else like Bangkok first? Maybe. The question is asked by my staff ‘Why Singapore?’ And I say it is because if we can succeed in Singapore we can succeed anywhere.

You’re the most developed of any Asean country from a technological standpoint. You’re the most demanding consumer. You're never happy because you've been spoiled. Everything is provided for you on a platter because the Government spoils you. I love it because you're tough. You want the best and you don’t want to pay for it. That’s the school of hard knocks.

And Singapore is a home of Asia media. Anything that happens in Singapore gets reported around the world. It's the United Kingdom for Europe — a story in the UK is going to be more syndicated worldwide than a story in Germany. So what we do in Singapore gets replicated everywhere.

Pei Ting: It has been close to four months since AirAsia Food’s foray into Singapore and more than a year since its entry into Kuala Lumpur. Has the gamble paid off?

Tony: In Singapore we’re doing 500 orders a day. That’s incredible for us. We haven’t spent a cent. We’re just building it organically. We have hundreds and hundreds of restaurants signing up with us so it has paid off.

Pei Ting: If the commission you charge is far lower than the dominant players – GrabFood Foodpanda and Deliveroo – why haven’t more merchants come on board?

Tony: We don’t want thousands of merchants. Why don’t I do business class and first class and everything? Because I want focus. Why don’t I have six girlfriends or just one wife? Harder to focus right? So let me get the right number of restaurants that deliver good quality to them. For my delivery model I’d rather go to one restaurant and pick up 20 orders than take one order from 35 restaurants. Quality not quantity is what we're after.

And getting the system right. It's about efficiency. I actually do ride and deliver so I understand the business. So work with less deliver more business to them and have standardised processes. I know very clearly that the model is an AirAsia model: Less is more. Consistency is what we are after.

Pei Ting: Turning back to aviation what is your prognosis for the industry in the next year or two? What else can airlines do to stem losses and prepare for the eventual return of air travel?

Tony: What will recover faster? Domestic travel. I am already in a much better position than a full service airline that relies on business traffic. Business traffic is going to be changed forever. I don't think it will recover to the levels they had. Package holidays are going to change forever. Do you want to be on a bus with 50 strangers? I don't think so anymore. I think there will be much fewer conventions. Travelling distances will be shorter. I think you are more likely to go to Phuket than you are to Los Angeles.

And so as an airline low cost carriers will become stronger. At the upper end I think private jets are going to grow dramatically. There will be a new category of above first class travel – 20 in a smaller jet flying not flying to the big Changi airport but flying to Seletar.

So I think airlines that rely on business traffic and airlines that rely on long haul travel will struggle for a while. They will have to right-size.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now the booming Navy Yard’s only fully public-accessible section is poised to begin welcoming even more visitors from the neighborhood and beyond.

The giant 75000 square-foot high-end Wegmans supermarket is the anchor retail tenant of a six-building complex controlled by development company Steiner NYC in a section known as Admirals Row — but which might be dubbed Navy Yard Square.

Now after five years of construction and painstaking restoration developer Doug Steiner has begun marketing a total of 80000 square feet of store space and 5200 square feet of community-use space in four different buildings arrayed around the gourmet market’s parking lot.

3 The 19th-century Captains House will be dedicated to community/nonprofit use.

Two of the buildings are restorations of historic more than century-old structures. The Captains House — a three-story mansion dating from 1850 — is destined for community/non-profit use after an $8 million restoration.

A few steps away the 1853-vintage Timber Shed building — where ships’ masts were made for more than a half-century — has 7100 square feet of column-free retail space under a spectacular 37-degree pitched-roof ceiling resembling that of a church nave. Oversized arched wooden windows with cedar shutters open onto a tree-lined plaza.

The atmospheric structure had collapsed and had to be entirely rebuilt using materials salvaged from the original.

The rest of the new retail space is contained in two new ground-up buildings known as 3 Flushing Ave. and 25 Navy St. Admirals Row is also home to 365000 square feet of light industrial space that Steiner leases back to the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corp. and a four-story garage in what’s designated as Building 303.

3 An architectural detail from the Captains House.

Steiner’s name looms large at the Yard for his Steiner Studios a 780000 square-foot complex of ultramodern film and television production facilities that are the largest east of Hollywood. “Boardwalk Empire” “Sex and the City” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” are a few of the projects that have shot there.

But he’s also spending $300 million on the Admirals Row project. He said “The Navy Yard wanted a supermarket in that location for 15 or 20 years. Wegman[s] is the dream supermarket.

“For us the more open the Navy Yard is the better. The Yards has reached a level of brand awareness it didn’t have until recently. It’s a true hub for the city’s creative economy — and it’s also cool thanks to its concentration of wonderful old buildings.”

Steiner is confident that the retail space will prove just as successful as Wegmans which is drawing 50000 customers a week in addition to supporting a thriving home-delivery service. Shoppers can enter the Admirals Row area at Sands and Navy streets and at Flushing Avenue. Ripco’s Jason Pennington is the leasing agent.

Meanwhile the Navy Yard’s proposed $2.5 billion master plans for expansion aims to raise the total number of employees on site from 12000 today to 20000 in the next few years.

Last year the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corp. reported signing more than 160000 square feet of commercial leases despite the pandemic.

3 The Timber Shed building offers 7100 square feet for retail use.

The Yard where mighty World War II battleships were launched is today home to a few dry docks that echo its maritime origins but mainly to companies that make everything from body armor to modular apartment-building components to organic vegetables grown on the world’s largest rooftop farm

Dock 72 a 675000 square-foot office tower developed by Rudin and Boston Properties is the Yard’s newest landmark at the recently opened NYC Ferry terminal.

Steiner also plans to eventually convert an 18-acre section of the Yard known as the Navy Annex — a cluster of haunted-seeming early 20th-century buildings once used as hospitals and propaganda film-making facilities — into a modern educational and media complex.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L2JlbG1vbnQtaG9tZS1saXN0ZWQtZm9yLTYtNW0tbmlja25hbWVkLXRoZS1jYXN0bGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Belmont home nicknamed 'The Castle' is listed for $6.5M - Boston Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2021/06/26/belmont-home-listed-for-6-5m-nicknamed-the-castle.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L2JlbG1vbnQtaG9tZS1saXN0ZWQtZm9yLTYtNW0tbmlja25hbWVkLXRoZS1jYXN0bGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

A state appellate court ruled Thursday that Tianle Li 51 who is serving a life sentence at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility in Hunterdon County was not entitled to post-conviction relief in the murder of her husband Xiaoye Wang.

Li was convicted on July 9 2013 by a jury sitting in New Brunswick of the 2011 murder of her husband a 39-year-old computer software engineer and for hindering her apprehension and prosecution by attempting to flee the country.

The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office argued that she killed her husband by thallium poisoning and that she had access to the highly toxic metal through her work at Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Li will not be eligible for parole until Oct. 27 2074 when she would be 104.

The prosecution showed that Li had administered the substance to her husband between Nov. 16 2010 and Jan. 26 2011.

After becoming ill with apparent flu-like symptoms Wang admitted himself to a hospital on Jan. 14 2011 for treatment. A series of tests determined that he had been poisoned with thallium and Wang died 12 days later.

CRIME:East Brunswick man charged with baseball bat murder

COURTS:Former UFC fighter's $27 million doping judgment reduced by NJ appellate panel

Other evidence presented at the trial showed that Li ordered thallium bottles at work which were then returned with less content though records showed she never used thallium at work; she ordered one-way flights to China for her and her son and testimony from her cellmate that she had poisoned her husband with thallium.

Li has maintained that her husband was killed by medical malpractice. Wang's estate had filed a malpractice suit against the hospital and his doctors.

An appellate court first rejected the appeal of her conviction in 2018.

In the latest appeal Li argued she did not get a fair trial because her lawyer did not call a medical expert to testify in support of the allegation that the hospital and doctors had failed to order ""heavy metal"" tests on her husband.

""While the snippets of trial testimony from the (prosecution's) medical experts in the light most favorable to (Li) may establish delayed diagnosis of thallium poisoning they do not alter that Wang died as a direct consequence of that poisoning"" the appellate court wrote.

The appellate court dismissed Li's claims as ""meritless"" that her lawyer was ineffective.

Li's appeal in federal court has also be rejected.

Investigational bulevirtide (Hepcludex) was effective and well tolerated in patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) a researcher reported.

In an interim analysis of the ongoing phase III MYR301 study the proportion of people with HDV achieving the combined virological and biochemical response was 36.7% with bulevirtide 2 mg 28% in participants receiving bulevirtide 10 mg and 0% in participants currently under observation who have not received antiviral treatment to date reported Heiner Wedemeyer MD of Hannover Medical Hospital in Germany.

Treatment for 24 weeks with bulevirtide 2 mg or 10 mg had a superior response (P<0.001) to the no treatment group with bulevirtide 2 mg for 24 weeks having a numerically higher response rate compared with bulevirtide 10 mg. Also rapid alanine aminotransferase reduction and normalization was seen in >50% of patients in the bulevirtide 2-mg group versus the 10-mg group or no treatment groups Wedemeyer reported in a presentation at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) virtual meeting.

Bulevirtide monotherapy at 24 weeks demonstrated no serious adverse events (AEs) no symptomatic elevations in bile salts or AEs leading to discontinuation related to the study drug.

""Hepatitis D virus is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and occurs only as a coinfection in individuals who have hepatitis B virus [HBV]"" Wedemeyer explained adding that at least 12 million people worldwide are likely experiencing HBV-HDV coinfection.

""Until now people with HDV have had very limited treatment options and a poor prognosis"" he noted.

Bulevirtide is ""a peptide derived from the [HBV] surface antigen [that is] slightly modified and which you can inject in patients"" Wedemeyer explained. It is a first-in-class entry inhibitor for the treatment of chronic HDV and a 2-mg dose has conditional marketing authorization in the E.U. The agent will most likely be submitted to the FDA later in 2021 according to Wedemeyer.

He highlighted the fact that bulevirtide therapy was tied to a rapid reduction in liver enzymes. ""We are talking...about a very severe liver disease"" he said. The ""'D' stands for 'devil'... causing a high risk to develop liver cancer and cirrhosis. For many years we only used pegylated interferon which helps roughly one-quarter to one-third of patients.""

In another study the phase IIb MYR204 trial 175 people with chronic HDV were randomly allocated to four treatment arms groups: peginterferon alfa-2a; bulevirtide 2 mg plus peginterferon alfa-2a; bulevirtide 10 mg plus peginterferon alfa-2a; and bulevirtide 10 mg. In that study the proportion of participants who achieved a combined response after 24 weeks of treatment was higher in those treated with bulevirtide with the highest response rate seen in the monotherapy group. Treatment with bulevirtide both as monotherapy or in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a was well-tolerated with mostly mild or moderate AEs and no reported serious AEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of bulevirtide according to another EASL presentation.

EASL press conference Tobias Böttler MD of the Universitätsklinikum Freiberg in Germany commented that bulevirtide ""is the best drug we have today to treat this disease"" but he cautioned that ""We do need more data on how long to treat. We might need combination therapies in the future...but we're really in a desperate situation when we're looking at treatment of patients with hepatitis delta with active disease.""

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYnJvd25iZWFycy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvNy9mb290YmFsbC13ZWxjb21lcy0yOC10by10aGUtaW5jb21pbmctY2xhc3Mtb2YtMjAyONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Football Welcomes 28 to the Incoming Class of 2028,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2VhdGhlci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9uYXR1cmUvdmlkZW8vYnJvd24tYmVhci1jaGFyZ2VzLWF0LWNhci1pbi1qYXBhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Bear Charges At Car In Japan - Videos from The Weather Channel,"Weather in your inbox

After she became the NCAA's all-time scorer Brown was among those to send congratulations to the Hawkeyes sharpshooter but it came in a strange way.

""Congrats to Caitlin Clark on becoming all-time leading scorer"" he wrote in a message on X accompanied by a GIF of actor Mel Gibson with long flowing hair.

Brown later called the former Iowa Hawkeyes star the ""Cracker of the Day"" after he revealed to his followers on X that she blocked him on the social media platform. It appeared that one lewd attack after another finally crossed the line for Clark.

Well the former NFL receiver went on Jason Whitlock's podcast to discuss their social media beef.

""Caitlin Clark we love you. There's no drama here. I'm excited about what you're going to do for women's basketball. You're an amazing player. I love to watch your game. You bring a lot of excitement and energy"" Brown said.

Brown later said his made-up network CTESPN ""would love to have you talk express what you deal with your traumas your adversities how you continue to be great"" saying his comments about Clark were ""all in fun and games.""

""Continue to be great continue to keep focus on being the best athlete you want to be. Continue to lead women's sports and pioneering it the way you want to pioneer it. I have a daughter they look up to you and look up to everything you guys are doing. So shout out to you Caitlin Clark.""

It was a nice message from Brown at first. But then he couldn't help but throw in one more crude comment.

""If it's hairy don't worry about it"" Brown concluded.

It's tough to imagine that Clark will be unblocking Brown any time soon after that.

The comment resulted in a sigh and little chuckle from Whitlock.

Bizarre interactions with Clark from IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel resulted in him no longer covering the WNBA for the outlet.

Clark scored 21 points in her first preseason game with the Indiana Fever last week after they selected her with the first overall pick in April. Her official WNBA debut will be next Tuesday against the Connecticut Sun.

Behind the mask of optimism defensively England were more dogged than Crufts and one stalemate in the group stage was pure stodge.

Instead of expansive innovative football the manager's preference for compactness was not widely acclaimed as a blueprint for entertainment and a Tottenham Hotspur goal machine suffered from the poor service.

But this was 1966 the year England won the World Cup. And the prolific Spurs striker feeding on scraps was Jimmy Greaves not Harry Kane. Nobody complains now about Sir Alf Ramsey's wingless wonders or the pragmatism of their cautious passage into the knockout phase.

Perhaps Gareth Southgate's most militant critics will wait until after Tuesday's date with a familiar nemesis before deciding whether his biggest strategic mistake was to dispense with the waistcoat or something more fundamental.

Either way it is 21 years since England beat the old enemy in Der Klassiker at a major tournament – in Charleroi a profoundly disappointing Belgian provincial city an hour south of Brussels.

Sol Campbell played in that Euro 2000 tie – probably the high-water mark of Kevin Keegan's 18-month reign as a Three Lions coach brimming with good intentions but bankrupt of tactical nous.

And the defender who explored both sides of the north London divide with Tottenham and Arsenal approves of England's efficiency so far.

“The lads have started well and clean sheets all the way so far bodes well for the knockout stages” said Campbell whose 73 caps were spread across 11 years.

Will England defeat Germany? Comment below

“You can't win major tournaments just by defending your own box - but you can sure lose them if you don't give yourself a solid foundation at the back.

“When England won the World Cup in 1966 we didn't concede a goal until the semi-finals and we didn't fall behind until the final so there is a lot to be said for keeping it tight.

“But to win knockout games we might need to be a bit braver. That means you have to frighten opponents by making them commit two or three defenders to keep one player quiet and that creates space for others.”

Does that mean Jack Grealish? “He causes a commotion” said Campbell. “But whether we pick him against Germany is not my call.”

Campbell's place in England's tournament history could have been very different if his extra-time 'goals' against Argentina at the 1998 World Cup and versus hosts Portugal six years later had been allowed to stand.

On both occasions the goalkeeper was adjudged to have been fouled in aerial combat – and not by Campbell.

So the great Sulzeer (his real Christian name) will have to be content for now with helping England to a win which was quickly devalued by 3-2 defeats against Portugal and Romania on either side eliminating Keegan's men from the tournament.

It had been a conspicuously bad midsummer weekend in June 2000 with hooligans rearranging the furniture in Charleroi England's cricketers hammered inside three days by West Indies at the Edgbaston Test and S Club 7 topping the charts when the Three Lions delivered some light relief.

“From memory it had been a hot day the build-up had been a bit lively and I think we had a bit of luck along the way” said Campbell now 46.

“Although it was a group match we were under pressure after losing our opening game against Portugal and 1-0 was enough to get the job done. You see? Another clean sheet makes the difference.

“When Becks (David Beckham) whipped a free-kick into the box the Germans held a high line and they allowed it to bounce across the goalmouth which is not ideal when (Alan) Shearer is lurking at the far post.

“I didn't realise it was the first time we had beaten the Germans at a major tournament since 1966 so it shows you have to take these opportunities when they come around.

“In my experience games against Germany were only made bigger by the result – triumph or disaster – and the importance is magnified when you win or lose.

“As a player you don't feel the pain more if you lose to Germany but somehow the inquest is more intense if it goes wrong. And the deeper you go into a tournament you don't want to live with the regrets if you miss out.”

Keegan's starting XI in Charleroi 21 years ago incidentally was the stuff of pub quiz tie-breakers: Seaman G. Neville P. Neville Campbell Keown Beckham Scholes (Barmby 72) Shearer Owen (Gerrard 61) Ince Wise.

His last game in charge was 112 days later when Keegan's gamble on playing an accomplished central defender as a holding midfielder backfired horribly in the teeming rain and the Germans won 1-0.

Biden has proposed raising the capital gains tax rate to 39.6% from 20% for millionaires; coupled with an existing Medicare surcharge federal tax rates for the wealthy could climb as high as 43.4% – pushing the levy on returns to one of the highest in the developed world according to a new analysis published by the Tax Foundation .

Ireland – with a 51% tax on dividends – would be the only developed nation to impose a higher tax on investment income. On average nations in the 38-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development levy a marginal tax rate of 24.4% on dividend income.

WHAT BIDEN'S CAPITAL GAINS TAX PROPOSAL COULD MEAN FOR YOUR WALLET

Unlike the U.S. many OECD nations differentiate how they tax dividends and capital gains.

As far as capital gains tax rates the U.S. would have the highest capital gains tax rate among OECD nations under Biden's proposal. Currently Denmark has the highest rate of 42% followed by Chile at 40% and Finland and France each at 34%.

Roughly one-fourth of all OECD countries do not impose a capital gains tax on the sale of long-held shares including Belgium the Czech Republic South Korea Luxembourg New Zealand Slovakia Slovenia Switzerland and Turkey.

The average capital gains tax rate among OECD members is about 19.1% according to Tax Foundation data.

Taxes on long-term capital gains – generally classified as an asset that's held for more than one year – currently range from 0% to 20% in the U.S. depending on a person's income. Wealthier investors are also subject to an additional 3.8% tax on long- and short-term capital gains that's used to fund ObamaCare. Short-term capital gains on assets sold within a year are typically taxed as ordinary income.

BIDEN'S PROPOSED 39.6% TAX HIKE WOULD HIT THESE INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES

The top long-term capital-gains tax rate is currently paid by single taxpayers earning more than $445850 this year (and $501600 for married couples filing a joint tax return).

Capital gains are taxed favorably when compared to wage and salary income; under existing law the richest Americans pay a top tax rate of 37% on ordinary income while the top tax rate on capital gains is 23.8%.

Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for rich Americans.

But a recent analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model a nonpartisan group at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School suggests that rich Americans would employ techniques to avoid the rate increase. Tax avoidance most of it legal would cut about $900 billion of the estimated $1 trillion that a capital gains tax increase could generate for the federal government over the next decade the researchers said.

""Even with stepped-up basis eliminated several avenues for tax avoidance remain"" the researchers wrote.

For instance they said taxpayers would likely realize more gains in years when taxable incomes fall below the threshold. They also suggested that an increased share of business incomes would be organized via pass-through interests instead of C-corporations in order to avoid the second layer of shareholder tax.

""A large body of empirical research shows that when taxes on capital gains increase realizations of capital gains fall"" the researchers wrote.

Of the nearly 1200 passengers who arrived at Fort Lauderdale's Port Everglades on Saturday to board Celebrity Cruises' Celebrity Edge 99% were fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and came ready to show proof according to the line.

That's well over the 95% threshold that Celebrity needed for Celebrity Edge to sail on Saturday under terms set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And it may be a sign that all the Sturm und Drang over how Florida's vaccine law would affect cruise departures out of the state as cruising restarts might have been much ado about nothing.

Celebrity is just the first of several lines that plan to restart cruises out of Florida and other U.S. ports over the coming weeks as big-ship cruising finally resumes in U.S. waters.

With the exception of a handful of very small cruise vessels that operate on U.S. rivers and intracoastal waterways cruising out of U.S. ports has been completely shut down since the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic in March 2020.

Showing my vaccine card -- voluntarily

To recap Celebrity initially wanted to require all passengers over the age of 16 on sailings out of Florida to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccine. That would have ensured that the line met the 95%-of-passengers-vaccinated threshold wanted by the CDC. But Florida's new vaccine law prohibits businesses in the state from requiring customers to show such proof.

At first this seemed to create a conundrum: How could Celebrity ensure 95% or more of passengers were vaccinated if it couldn't require them to prove it?

Celebrity's late-in-the-game solution was to make it voluntary for passengers to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccine but to add on very heavy incentives to do so. The line earlier this week said passengers who didn't show proof of a COVID-19 vaccine would be considered unvaccinated and subject to repeated COVID-19 testing before and during sailings at their own expense (the price tag is a hefty $178 per person).

In addition the line said passengers not showing proof of a COVID-19 vaccination would have to wear masks at all times on board (something vaccinated passengers would not have to do) and might be restricted to designated seating areas in some parts of the ship. They also might not be able to disembark in some ports.

That seems to have done the trick. As I was boarding the ship on Saturday I didn't see a single passenger balking when asked to show a vaccine card. I pulled mine out along with my passport during the check-in process and it took all of 15 seconds for a port staffer to check it and scan it into an iPad-like device.

A high-level Celebrity executive told me later that there only were about two dozen passengers out of 1195 scheduled to board on Saturday who were unable to show a COVID-19 vaccine card. And nearly all of these were children under the age of 12 who currently are not eligible for vaccination.

The issue of passengers who were old enough to be vaccinated arriving without a vaccine card or refusing to show their vaccine card simply did not materialize.

A smooth and quick boarding process

Two weeks ago I wrote about the hour-long process to get aboard the first Royal Caribbean cruise in the Caribbean in 15 months -- a cruise that departed out of Nassau in the Bahamas. It was a lengthy process mostly because everyone boarding was tested for COVID-19 at a hotel before proceeding to the pier where the ship was docked.

The boarding process for Celebrity Edge was much quicker and so uneventful that there's really not much to say about it. Other than being asked to show my COVID-19 vaccine card which as noted took all of 15 seconds it was a cruise check-in like any other I have experienced in recent years. I had done most of the check-in on the Celebrity app in advance of arriving at the pier and it just took a minute at a check-in desk to get everything finalized before I went through the metal detectors at port security and headed toward the gangway.

From the moment I started the process to the moment I was on board fewer than 15 minutes passed. There was no COVID-19 testing and no temperature checks.

In short don't expect anything out of the ordinary if you're heading to a Celebrity cruise out of Florida in the coming weeks.

A celebratory atmosphere

What was different at the pier on Saturday was the very noticeable mood of excitement and celebration. From the check-in and security staff at the port which is located within Florida's Broward County to the crew on Celebrity Edge as well as Celebrity executives on hand everyone was all smiles.

As Michael Udine the vice mayor of Broward County noted during a press conference in advance of the start to boarding the 15-month-long shutdown of cruising directly affected 6000 jobs in the area related to the cruise industry. The wider hospitality and tourism industries in the county employ 84000 locals he said.

""The cruise industry is critical to Broward County's tourism economy and our workforce has suffered since the cruise lines voluntarily suspended operations"" Udine said.

As passengers boarded Celebrity Edge during the day the ship's social media-famous captain Kate McCue and crew members cheered them on from the top of the gangway.

Earlier in the day at the same press conference where Udine spoke McCue -- known on social media as Captain Kate -- said it was a day she had been dreaming about for more than 15 months.

""I don't just speak for myself but also the entire crew when I say that sailing and traveling worldwide by sea is our passion"" McCue said. ""You can truly feel the palpable sense of excitement and energy among the (crew) as we prepare for our welcome and our first guests.""

McCue added that she had ""never honestly seen a group so excited to get back to work.""

Moments later McCue choked back tears as she recounted how Celebrity Edge had blown its horn each day while anchored offshore during the pandemic with other idled cruise vessels. They did it to let everyone know that they ""were safe healthy and happy and wishing the same for everyone that was around us these other ships"" she said.

""From this day forward when you hear the ship's horn I hope it reminds you that through any hardship with hope you can -- and will -- rise again"" McCue added.

McCue then ordered the ship to blow its final horn salute of the pandemic.

Earlier at the same press conference Richard Fain the chairman and CEO of Celebrity's parent company Royal Caribbean Group spent much of his time on the podium praising Celebrity Edge's crew who he said had been ""getting ready for the guests with such an amazing level of passion.""

In a moment of levity he also broke out into song singing the opening lines of Jimmy Cliff's 1993 version of ""I can see clearly now"" which he said the day's events brought to mind.

""I can see clearly now the rain is gone. I can see all obstacles in my way"" he sang drawing laughter and applause and prompting some in attendance to sing along. ""It's gonna be a bright bright bright bright shiny day.""

It’s an unpopular cause and likely to lead to an attorney being shunned by colleagues or worse and the defendants for the most part can’t afford to pay legal fees.

But Joseph McBride is one of the heroic few attorneys who has stood up in the name of equal justice for the most reviled people in the nation. As a former Manhattan public defender it’s what he always has done.

McBride’s client today is the most reviled of the reviled: Richard “Bigo” Barnett 60 the window installer from Arkansas who put his feet up on a desk in Nancy Pelosi’s office and has come to symbolize the “insurrection” that wasn’t.

“I made my bones at Manhattan Legal Aid and the Innocence Project” says McBride.

“None of my colleagues from those places have supported my representing Bigo in any way. This is because … they fear being canceled by their own group more than anything.”

After Barnett spent almost four months in solitary confinement without trial in a DC jail McBride managed to secure his pretrial release. He is back home now under house arrest in Gravette Ark. and must do battle with an adversary with infinite resources and a vested interest in maintaining the fiction that the Capitol Hill riot was an insurrection.

Not one of 510 people arrested over the Capitol riot has been charged with insurrection says McBride.

He spoke up in court about the inhumanity of jail conditions endured by his client and other January Sixers. He called it “torture” and said they were “political prisoners.”

“The guards want to hurt them and … feel like they have a green light from the government to do whatever they like.”

Barnett complained that he was bashed by guards. He blew the whistle on physical abuse of other inmates including one beaten so badly he went blind in one eye and started to suffer seizures an incident the FBI reportedly is investigating. Barnett said the man’s face looked like “chopped meat.”

No one deserves that no matter how heinous their crime.

For McBride 43 preventing such injustices has been his life’s work. It’s why he became an attorney.

He was raised in Brooklyn in the violent 1980s and ’90s. “I was lucky to have two good Catholic God-fearing parents … but everybody I grew up with — except for a handful — is dead or in jail.”

His Irish father was from Flatbush and worked at Con Edison and his mom was Puerto Rican from Spanish Harlem. They fostered about 20 children “the most damaged ones” and ended up adopting a mentally disabled 6-year-old boy who had been born addicted to heroin.

McBride saw his vulnerable adopted brother railroaded by the justice system threatened into pleading guilty and spending 10 years in jail for a crime McBride said he didn’t commit.

“It changed my world. I dropped everything to become a lawyer … to try to get him out.”

By the time he graduated his brother had been released a broken man. But McBride vowed to beat a rigged system working for six years as a Legal Aid attorney in Manhattan defending mainly black and Hispanic defendants. More than 98 percent of people charged with a felony in New York City at that time pleaded guilty and never went to trial because they knew they couldn’t win a sure sign the system is rigged he says.

“I learned when defending people who weren’t able to afford representation that the rules of the game were changed to disadvantage them … They were threatened with jail sentences so large they could take a plea for five years or risk going to jail for 50. Defendants made an informed decision that ‘this isn’t going to work out for me.’ ”

That’s what happened to his brother and it’s what he sees happening to the January Sixers.

In Barnett’s case prosecutors offered seven years in jail in exchange for a guilty plea which Barnett rejected.

The charges he faces include obstructing Congress entering the Capitol while armed with a stun gun and stealing an envelope which could see him jailed for more than 10 years if convicted.

On the charge of possessing a “deadly weapon” McBride says the stun gun which doubled as a flashlight and walking cane was “disarmed” because there were no batteries in it.

Barnett had been with friends in a DC bar the previous evening showing off the new gadget and had worn out the batteries which he threw in the trash. He never replaced them before going into the Capitol as evidenced says McBride by the fact that a white indicator light which should be visible on the device if it is charged was absent from every photo of his client taken that day.

Barnett maintains he was pushed inside the Capitol in the second wave of protesters well after the initial violent breach.

He went into Pelosi’s office through an open door looking for a bathroom because Mayor Muriel Bowser had ordered all porta potties removed from DC.

An AFP photographer asked him to pose at the desk which he stupidly did. A cut on his finger bled on an envelope so he left a quarter to pay for it and a rude note for Pelosi.

No one condones Barnett’s actions that day.

But he committed no violence and seven years in jail is disproportionate punishment in any language.

The FBI circulated a notice labeling him a “Tier One” terrorist — the worst category.

How then should we describe someone who kills thousands of people by flying a plane into a building or plants a bomb at the Boston Marathon?

Last summer’s rioters were treated with kid gloves although more than two dozen people were killed.

The terrorism label is just used to dehumanize Barnett and his ilk and make it acceptable to shun them and everyone associated with them.

“Before I took this case I counted the cost” says McBride. “I knew it would be difficult and that I would make enemies. That is OK. I know deep in my soul that we are on the right side.”

United States pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay up to $230m to resolve claims the company helped drive an opioid crisis the New York state attorney general said on Saturday.

Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that “the opioid epidemic has wreaked havoc on countless communities across New York state and the rest of the nation leaving millions still addicted to dangerous and deadly opioids.

“Johnson & Johnson helped fuel this fire but today they’re committing to leaving the opioid business – not only in New York but across the entire country. Opioids will no longer be manufactured or sold in the United States by J&J” James said.

“We are also delivering up to $230 million to fund opioid prevention treatment and education efforts across New York state.”

The deal involves a lawsuit brought by James in 2019 and removes Johnson & Johnson from a trial that is slated to begin next week on Long Island.

It is part of a slew of litigation over an epidemic linked to nearly 500000 deaths during the last twenty years.

“So effectively by paying the settlement money [Johnson & Johnson] has removed itself from a trial that is utterly unprecedented in terms of its scope” Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna reported from Washington DC. Hanna added that the upcoming trial will be by jury – something that has “never happened before in this type of case”.

In its own statement on Saturday Johnson & Johnson downplayed the attorney general’s announcement. It said the settlement involved two prescription painkillers – developed by a subsidiary and accounting for less than 1 percent of the market – that are already no longer sold in the US.

The settlement was “not an admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company” Johnson & Johnson said. It added that its actions “relating to the marketing and promotion of important prescription pain medications were appropriate and responsible”.

The company also said the settlements were consistent with its prior agreement to pay $5bn to settle opioid claims by states cities counties and tribal governments nationwide.

The healthcare company and the largest US drug distributors – AmerisourceBergen Corp Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp – have proposed paying a combined $26bn to end thousands of opioid lawsuits.

Tuesday’s opioids trial is one of several scheduled for this year with others under way in California and West Virginia.

West Virginia has the nation’s highest fatal opioid overdose rate. Overdoses have surged since the early 2000s when producers of prescription drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone ramped up sales through pharmacies and doctors with few controls.

She was one of the most renowned and influential opera singers of the 20th century. Many critics praised her bel canto technique wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations. Her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto operas of Donizetti Bellini and Rossini and further to the works of Verdi and Puccini; and in her early career to the music dramas of Wagner. Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as La Divina .

Born in East Harlem to Greek immigrant parents she was raised by an overbearing mother who had wanted a son. Maria received her musical education in Greece at age 13 and later established her career in Italy. Forced to deal with the exigencies of 1940s wartime poverty and with near-sightedness that left her nearly blind onstage she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career. She turned herself from a heavy woman into a svelte and glamorous one after a mid-career weight loss which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career.

The press exulted in publicizing Callas’s temperamental behavior her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi and her love affair with Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Although her dramatic life and personal tragedy have often overshadowed Callas the artist in the popular press her artistic achievements were such that Leonard Bernstein called her “the Bible of opera” and her influence so enduring that in 2006 Opera News wrote of her: “Nearly thirty years after her death she’s still the definition of the diva as artist—and still one of classical music’s best-selling vocalists.”

Early life

Family life childhood and move to Greece

The name on Callas’s New York birth certificate is Sophie Cecilia Kalos. She was born at Flower Hospital (now the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center) to Greek parents George Kalogeropoulos (c. 1881–1972) and Elmina Evangelia “Litsa” née Demes originally Dimitriadou (c. 1894–1982) although she was christened Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos. Callas’s father had shortened the surname Kalogeropoulos first to “Kalos” and subsequently to “Callas” to make it more manageable.

George and Litsa Callas were an ill-matched couple from the beginning. George was easy-going and unambitious with no interest in the arts while Litsa was vivacious and socially ambitious and had dreamed of a life in the arts which her middle-class parents had stifled in her childhood and youth. Litsa’s father Petros Dimitriadis (1852–1916) was in failing health when Litsa introduced George to her family. Petros distrustful of George had warned his daughter “You will never be happy with him. If you marry this man I will never be able to help you”. Litsa had ignored his warning but soon realized that her father was right. The situation was aggravated by George’s philandering and was improved neither by the birth of a daughter named Yakinthi (later called “Jackie”) in 1917 nor the birth of a son named Vassilis in 1920. Vassilis’s death from meningitis in the summer of 1922 dealt another blow to the marriage. In 1923 after realizing that Litsa was pregnant again George made the decision to move his family to the United States a decision which Yakinthi recalled was greeted with Litsa “shouting hysterically” followed by George “slamming doors”. The family left for New York in July 1923 moving first into an apartment in the heavily ethnic Greek neighborhood of Astoria Queens.

Litsa was convinced that her third child would be a boy; her disappointment at the birth of another daughter was so great that she refused to even look at her new baby for four days. Maria was christened three years later at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in 1926. When Maria was 4 George Callas opened his own pharmacy settling the family in Manhattan on 192nd Street in Washington Heights where Callas grew up. Around the age of three Maria’s musical talent began to manifest itself and after Litsa discovered that her youngest daughter also had a voice she began pressing “Mary” to sing. Callas later recalled “I was made to sing when I was only five and I hated it.” George was unhappy with his wife favoring their elder daughter as well as the pressure put upon young Mary to sing and perform while Litsa was in turn increasingly embittered with George and his absences and infidelity and often violently reviled him in front of their children. The marriage continued to deteriorate and in 1937 Litsa decided to return to Athens with her two daughters.

Deteriorating relationship with her mother

Callas’s relationship with her mother continued to erode during the years in Greece and in the prime of her career it became a matter of great public interest especially after a 1956 cover story in Time magazine which focused on this relationship and later by Litsa’s book My Daughter Maria Callas (1960). In public Callas blamed the strained relationship with Litsa on her unhappy childhood spent singing and working at her mother’s insistence saying

My sister was slim and beautiful and friendly and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted… I’ll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.

In 1957 she told Chicago radio host Norman Ross Jr. “There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.”

Biographer Nicholas Petsalis-Diomidis [el] asserts that Litsa’s hateful treatment of George in front of their young children led to resentment and dislike on Callas’s part.According to both Callas’s husband and her close friend Giulietta Simionato Callas related to them that her mother who did not work pressed her to “go out with various men” mainly Italian and German soldiers to bring home money and food during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Simionato was convinced that Callas “managed to remain untouched” but Callas never forgave her mother for what she perceived as a kind of prostitution forced on her by her mother. Litsa herself beginning in New York and continuing in Athens had adopted a questionable lifestyle that included not only pushing her daughters into degrading situations to support her financially but also entertaining Italian and German soldiers herself during the Axis occupation. In an attempt to patch things up with her mother Callas took Litsa along on her first visit to Mexico in 1950 but this only reawakened the old frictions and resentments and after leaving Mexico the two never met again. After a series of angry and accusatory letters from Litsa lambasting Callas’s father and husband Callas ceased communication with her mother altogether.

Education

Callas received her musical education in Athens. Initially her mother tried to enroll her at the prestigious Athens Conservatoire without success. At the audition her voice still untrained failed to impress while the conservatoire’s director Filoktitis Oikonomidis [el] refused to accept her without her satisfying the theoretic prerequisites (solfege). In the summer of 1937 her mother visited Maria Trivella at the younger Greek National Conservatoire asking her to take Mary as she was then called as a student for a modest fee. In 1957 Trivella recalled her impression of “Mary a very plump young girl wearing big glasses for her myopia”:

The tone of the voice was warm lyrical intense; it swirled and flared like a flame and filled the air with melodious reverberations like a carillon. It was by any standards an amazing phenomenon or rather it was a great talent that needed control technical training and strict discipline in order to shine with all its brilliance.

Trivella agreed to tutor Callas completely waiving her tuition fees but no sooner had Callas started her formal lessons and vocal exercises than Trivella began to feel that Callas was not a contralto as she had been told but a dramatic soprano. Subsequently they began working on raising the tessitura of her voice and to lighten its timbre.

Trivella recalled Callas as:

A model student. Fanatical uncompromising dedicated to her studies heart and soul. Her progress was phenomenal. She studied five or six hours a day. …Within six months she was singing the most difficult arias in the international opera repertoire with the utmost musicality.

On April 11 1938 in her public debut Callas ended the recital of Trivella’s class at the Parnassos music hall with a duet from Tosca. Callas recalled that Trivella:

had a French method which was placing the voice in the nose rather nasal… and I had the problem of not having low chest tones which is essential in bel canto… And that’s where I learned my chest tones.

However when interviewed by Pierre Desgraupes [fr] on the French program L’invitée du dimanche Callas attributed the development of her chest voice not to Trivella but to her next teacher the Spanish coloratura soprano Elvira de Hidalgo.

Callas studied with Trivella for two years before her mother secured another audition at the Athens Conservatoire with de Hidalgo. Callas auditioned with “Ocean Thou Mighty Monster” from Weber’s Oberon. De Hidalgo recalled hearing “tempestuous extravagant cascades of sounds as yet uncontrolled but full of drama and emotion”. She agreed to take her as a pupil immediately but Callas’s mother asked de Hidalgo to wait for a year as Callas would be graduating from the National Conservatoire and could begin working. On April 2 1939 Callas undertook the part of Santuzza in a student production of Mascagni’s Cavalleria rusticana at the Greek National Opera at the Olympia Theatre and in the fall of the same year she enrolled at the Athens Conservatoire in Elvira de Hidalgo’s class.

In 1968 Callas told Lord Harewood

De Hildalgo had the real great training maybe even the last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms meaning that I learned the secrets the ways of this bel canto which of course as you well know is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it is a sort of a strait-jacket that you’re supposed to put on whether you like it or not. You have to learn to read to write to form your sentences how far you can go fall hurt yourself put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method which was the real bel canto way where no matter how heavy a voice it should always be kept light it should always be worked on in a flexible way never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound but penetrating. And teaching the scales trills all the bel canto embellishments which is a whole vast language of its own.

De Hidalgo later recalled Callas as “a phenomenon… She would listen to all my students sopranos mezzos tenors… She could do it all.” Callas herself said that she would go to “the conservatoire at 10 in the morning and leave with the last pupil … devouring music” for 10 hours a day. When asked by her teacher why she did this her answer was that even “with the least talented pupil he can teach you something that you the most talented might not be able to do.”

Early operatic career in Greece

After several appearances as a student Callas began appearing in secondary roles at the Greek National Opera. De Hidalgo was instrumental in securing roles for her allowing Callas to earn a small salary which helped her and her family get through the difficult war years.

Callas made her professional debut in February 1941 in the small role of Beatrice in Franz von Suppé’s Boccaccio. Soprano Galatea Amaxopoulou who sang in the chorus later recalled “Even in rehearsal Maria’s fantastic performing ability had been obvious and from then on the others started trying ways of preventing her from appearing.” Fellow singer Maria Alkeou similarly recalled that the established sopranos Nafsika Galanou and Anna (Zozó) Remmoundou “used to stand in the wings while [Callas] was singing and make remarks about her muttering laughing and point their fingers at her”.

Despite these hostilities Callas managed to continue and made her debut in a leading role in August 1942 as Tosca going on to sing the role of Marta in Eugen d’Albert’s Tiefland at the Olympia Theatre. Callas’s performance as Marta received glowing reviews. Critic Spanoudi declared Callas “an extremely dynamic artist possessing the rarest dramatic and musical gifts” and Vangelis Mangliveras evaluated Callas’s performance for the weekly To Radiophonon:

The singer who took the part of Marta that new star in the Greek firmament with a matchless depth of feeling gave a theatrical interpretation well up to the standard of a tragic actress. About her exceptional voice with its astonishing natural fluency I do not wish to add anything to the words of Alexandra Lalaouni: ‘Kalogeropoulou is one of those God-given talents that one can only marvel at.’

Following these performances even Callas’s detractors began to refer to her as “The God-Given”. Some time later watching Callas rehearse Beethoven’s Fidelio erstwhile rival soprano Anna Remoundou asked a colleague “Could it be that there is something divine and we haven’t realized it?” Following Tiefland Callas sang the role of Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana again and followed it with O Protomastoras [el] (Manolis Kalomiris) at the ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus theatre at the foot of the Acropolis.

During August and September 1944 Callas performed the role of Leonore in a Greek language production of Fidelio again at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. German critic Friedrich Herzog who witnessed the performances declared Leonore Callas’s “greatest triumph”:

When Maria Kaloyeropoulou’s Leonore let her soprano soar out radiantly in the untrammelled jubilation of the duet she rose to the most sublime heights. … Here she gave bud blossom and fruit to that harmony of sound that also ennobled the art of the prima donne.

After the liberation of Greece de Hidalgo advised Callas to establish herself in Italy. Callas proceeded to give a series of concerts around Greece and then against her teacher’s advice she returned to America to see her father and to further pursue her career. When she left Greece on September 14 1945 two months short of her 22nd birthday Callas had given 56 performances in seven operas and had appeared in around 20 recitals. Callas considered her Greek career as the foundation of her musical and dramatic upbringing saying “When I got to the big career there were no surprises for me.”

Main operatic career

After returning to the United States and reuniting with her father in September 1945 Callas made the round of auditions. In December of that year she auditioned for Edward Johnson general manager of the Metropolitan Opera and was favorably received: “Exceptional voice—ought to be heard very soon on stage”.

Callas maintained that the Met offered her Madama Butterfly and Fidelio to be performed in Philadelphia and sung in English both of which she declined feeling she was too fat for Butterfly and did not like the idea of opera in English. Although no written evidence of this offer exists in the Met’s records in a 1958 interview with the New York Post Johnson corroborated Callas’s story: “We offered her a contract but she didn’t like it—because of the contract not because of the roles. She was right in turning it down—it was frankly a beginner’s contract.”

Italy Meneghini and Serafin

In 1946 Callas was engaged to re-open the opera house in Chicago as Turandot but the company folded before opening. Basso Nicola Rossi-Lemeni who also was to star in this opera was aware that Tullio Serafin was looking for a dramatic soprano to cast as La Gioconda at the Arena di Verona. He later recalled the young Callas as being “amazing—so strong physically and spiritually; so certain of her future. I knew in a big outdoor theatre like Verona’s this girl with her courage and huge voice would make a tremendous impact.” Subsequently he recommended Callas to retired tenor and impresario Giovanni Zenatello. During her audition Zenatello became so excited that he jumped up and joined Callas in the act 4 duet. It was in this role that Callas made her Italian debut. Upon her arrival in Verona Callas met Giovanni Battista Meneghini [it] an older wealthy industrialist who began courting her. They married in 1949 and he assumed control of her career until 1959 when the marriage dissolved. It was Meneghini’s love and support that gave Callas the time needed to establish herself in Italy and throughout the prime of her career she went by the name of Maria Meneghini Callas.

After La Gioconda Callas had no further offers and when Serafin looking for someone to sing Isolde called on her she told him that she already knew the score even though she had looked at only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory. She sight-read the opera’s second act for Serafin who praised her for knowing the role so well whereupon she admitted to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas’s mentor and supporter.

According to Lord Harewood “Very few Italian conductors have had a more distinguished career than Tullio Serafin and perhaps none apart from Toscanini more influence”. In 1968 Callas recalled that working with Serafin was the “really lucky” opportunity of her career because “he taught me that there must be an expression; that there must be a justification. He taught me the depth of music the justification of music. That’s where I really really drank all I could from this man”.

I puritani and path to bel canto

The great turning point in Callas’s career occurred in Venice in 1949. She was engaged to sing the role of Brünnhilde in Die Walküre at the Teatro la Fenice when Margherita Carosio who was engaged to sing Elvira in I puritani in the same theatre fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio Serafin told Callas that she would be singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role but also had three more Brünnhildes to sing he told her “I guarantee that you can.”. Michael Scott’s words “the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner’s Brünnhilde and Bellini’s Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like folie de grandeur”. Before the performance actually took place one incredulous critic snorted “We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct I puritani with a dramatic soprano … When can we expect a new edition of La traviata with [baritone] Gino Bechi’s Violetta?” After the performance one critic wrote “Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished… the flexibility of her limpid beautifully poised voice and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile pellucid coldness of other Elviras.” Franco Zeffirelli recalled “What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the size of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills who is one of the great coloratura sopranos of our time.”

Scott asserts that “Of all the many roles Callas undertook it is doubtful if any had a more far-reaching effect.” This initial foray into the bel canto repertoire changed the course of Callas’s career and set her on a path leading to Lucia di Lammermoor La traviata Armida La sonnambula Il pirata Il turco in Italia Medea and Anna Bolena and reawakened interest in the long-neglected operas of Cherubini Bellini Donizetti and Rossini.

In the words of soprano Montserrat Caballé:

She opened a new door for us for all the singers in the world a door that had been closed. Behind it was sleeping not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has given us the chance those who follow her to do things that were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.

As with I puritani Callas learned and performed Cherubini’s Medea Giordano’s Andrea Chénier and Rossini’s Armida on a few days’ notice. Throughout her career Callas displayed her vocal versatility in recitals that pitched dramatic soprano arias alongside coloratura pieces including in a 1952 RAI recital in which she opened with Lady Macbeth’s “letter scene” followed by the “Mad Scene” from Lucia di Lammermoor then Abigaille’s treacherous recitative and aria from Nabucco finishing with the “Bell Song” from Lakmé capped by a ringing high E in alt (E6).

Important debuts

Although by 1951 Callas had sung at all the major theatres in Italy she had not yet made her official debut at Italy’s most prestigious opera house Teatro alla Scala in Milan. According to composer Gian Carlo Menotti Callas had substituted for Renata Tebaldi in the role of Aida in 1950 and La Scala’s general manager Antonio Ghiringhelli had taken an immediate dislike to Callas.

Menotti recalls that Ghiringhelli had promised him any singer he wanted for the premiere of The Consul but when he suggested Callas Ghiringhelli said that he would never have Callas at La Scala except as a guest artist. However as Callas’s fame grew and especially after her great success in I vespri siciliani in Florence Ghiringhelli had to relent: Callas made her official debut at La Scala in Verdi’s I vespri siciliani on opening night in December 1951 and this theatre became her artistic home throughout the 1950s. La Scala mounted many new productions specially for Callas by directors such as Herbert von Karajan Margherita Wallmann Franco Zeffirelli and most importantly Luchino Visconti. Visconti stated later that he began directing opera only because of Callas and he directed her in lavish new productions of La vestale La traviata La sonnambula Anna Bolena and Iphigénie en Tauride. Callas was notably instrumental in arranging Franco Corelli’s debut at La Scala in 1954 where he sang Licinio in Spontini’s La vestale opposite Callas’s Julia. The two had sung together for the first time the year previously in Rome in a production of Norma. Anthony Tommasini wrote that Corelli had “earned great respect from the fearsomely demanding Callas who in Mr Corelli finally had someone with whom she could act.” The two collaborated several more times at La Scala singing opposite each other in productions of Fedora (1956) Il pirata (1958) and Poliuto (1960). Their partnership continued throughout the rest of Callas’s career.

The night of the day she married Meneghini in Verona she sailed for Argentina to sing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. Callas made her South American debut in Buenos Aires on May 20 1949 during the European summer opera recess. Aida Turandot and Norma roles were directed by Serafin supported by Mario Del Monaco Fedora Barbieri and Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. It was her only appearance on this world-renowned stage. Her debut in the United States was five years later in Chicago in 1954 and “with the Callas Norma Lyric Opera of Chicago was born.”

Her Metropolitan Opera debut opening the Met’s seventy-second season on October 29 1956 was again with Norma but was preceded with an unflattering cover story in Time magazine which rehashed all of the Callas clichés including her temper her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi and especially her difficult relationship with her mother. As she had done with Lyric Opera of Chicago on November 21 1957 Callas gave a concert to inaugurate what then was billed as the Dallas Civic Opera and helped establish that company with her friends from Chicago Lawrence Kelly and Nicola Rescigno. She further consolidated this company’s standing when in 1958 she gave “a towering performance as Violetta in La traviata and that same year in her only American performances of Medea gave an interpretation of the title role worthy of Euripides.”

In 1958 a feud with Rudolf Bing led to Callas’s Metropolitan Opera contract being cancelled. Impresario Allen Oxenburg realised that this situation provided him with an opportunity for his own company the American Opera Society and he accordingly approached her with a contract to perform Imogene in Il pirata. She accepted and sang the role in a January 1959 performance that according to opera critic Allan Kozinn “quickly became legendary in operatic circles”. Bing and Callas later reconciled their differences and she returned to the house in 1965 to sing the title role in two performances as Tosca opposite Franco Corelli as Cavaradossi for one performance (March 19 1965) and Richard Tucker (March 25 1965) with Tito Gobbi as Scarpia for her final performances at the Met.

In 1952 she made her London debut at the Royal Opera House in Norma with veteran mezzo-soprano Ebe Stignani as Adalgisa a performance which survives on record and also features the young Joan Sutherland in the small role of Clotilde. Callas and the London public had what she herself called “a love affair” and she returned to the Royal Opera House in 1953 1957 1958 1959 and 1964 to 1965. It was at the Royal Opera House where on July 5 1965 Callas ended her stage career in the role of Tosca in a production designed and mounted for her by Franco Zeffirelli and featuring her friend and colleague Tito Gobbi.

Weight loss

In the early years of her career Callas was a heavy woman; in her own words “Heavy—one can say—yes I was; but I’m also a tall woman 5′ ​8 1⁄2″ (1.74 m) and I used to weigh no more than 200 pounds (91 kilograms).” Tito Gobbi relates that during a lunch break while recording Lucia in Florence Serafin commented to Callas that she was eating too much and allowing her weight to become a problem. When she protested that she wasn’t so heavy Gobbi suggested she should “put the matter to test” by stepping on the weighing machine outside the restaurant. The result was “somewhat dismaying and she became rather silent.” In 1968 Callas told Edward Downes that during her initial performances in Cherubini’s Medea in May 1953 she realized that she needed a leaner face and figure to do dramatic justice to this as well as the other roles she was undertaking. She adds

I was getting so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself I was perspiring too much and I was really working too hard. And I wasn’t really well as in health; I couldn’t move freely. And then I was tired of playing a game for instance playing this beautiful young woman and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case it was uncomfortable and I didn’t like it. So I felt now if I’m going to do things right—I’ve studied all my life to put things right musically so why don’t I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I’m presentable.

During 1953 and early 1954 she lost almost 80 pounds (36 kg) turning herself into what Rescigno called “possibly the most beautiful lady on the stage”. Sir Rudolf Bing who remembered Callas as being “monstrously fat” in 1951 stated that after the weight loss Callas was an “astonishing svelte striking woman” who “showed none of the signs one usually finds in a fat woman who has lost weight: she looked as though she had been born to that slender and graceful figure and had always moved with that elegance.” Various rumors spread regarding her weight loss method; one had her swallowing a tapeworm while Rome’s Panatella Mills pasta company claimed she lost weight by eating their “physiologic pasta” prompting Callas to file a lawsuit. Callas stated that she lost the weight by eating a sensible low-calorie diet of mainly salads and chicken.

Some believe that the loss of body mass made it more difficult for her to support her voice triggering the vocal strain that became apparent later in the decade while others believed the weight loss effected a newfound softness and femininity in her voice as well as a greater confidence as a person and performer. Tito Gobbi said

Now she was not only supremely gifted both musically and dramatically—she was a beauty too. And her awareness of this invested with fresh magic every role she undertook. What it eventually did to her vocal and nervous stamina I am not prepared to say. I only assert that she blossomed into an artist unique in her generation and outstanding in the whole range of vocal history.

Voice

The Callas sound

Callas’s voice was and remains controversial; it bothered and disturbed as many as it thrilled and inspired. Walter Legge stated that Callas possessed that most essential ingredient for a great singer: an instantly recognizable voice.

During “The Callas Debate” Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated “The timbre of Callas’s voice considered purely as sound was essentially ugly: it was a thick sound which gave the impression of dryness of aridity. It lacked those elements which in a singer’s jargon are described as velvet and varnish… yet I really believe that part of her appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish velvet and richness this voice could acquire such distinctive colors and timbres as to be unforgettable.” However in his review of Callas’s 1951 live recording of I vespri siciliani Ira Siff writes “Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed even early on a flawed voice unattractive by conventional standards—an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich spinning sound ravishing by any standard capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble chest tones unforced and the middle register displays none of the “bottled” quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured.”

Nicola Rossi-Lemeni relates that Callas’s mentor Serafin used to refer to her as Una grande vociaccia; he continues “Vociaccia is a little bit pejorative—it means an ugly voice—but grande means a big voice a great voice. A great ugly voice in a way.” Callas herself did not like the sound of her own voice; in one of her last interviews answering whether or not she was able to listen to her own voice she replies

Yes but I don’t like it. I have to do it but I don’t like it at all because I don’t like the kind of voice I have. I really hate listening to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything to give up singing… Also now even though I don’t like my voice I’ve become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say “Oh that was really well sung” or “It was nearly perfect.”

Carlo Maria Giulini has described the appeal of Callas’s voice:

It is very difficult to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin viola cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes when you get used to when you become friends with this kind of sound then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.

Vocal category

Callas’s voice has been difficult to place in the modern vocal classification or Fach system especially since in her prime her repertoire contained the heaviest dramatic soprano roles as well as roles usually undertaken by the highest lightest and most agile coloratura sopranos. Regarding this versatility Serafin said “This woman can sing anything written for the female voice”. Michael Scott argues that Callas’s voice was a natural high soprano and going by evidence of Callas’s early recordings Rosa Ponselle likewise felt that “At that stage of its development her voice was a pure but sizable dramatic coloratura—that is to say a sizable coloratura voice with dramatic capabilities not the other way around.” On the other hand music critic John Ardoin has argued that Callas was the reincarnation of the 19th-century soprano sfogato or “unlimited soprano” a throwback to Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta for whom many of the famous bel canto operas were written. He avers that like Pasta and Malibran Callas was a natural mezzo-soprano whose range was extended through training and willpower resulting in a voice which “lacked the homogeneous color and evenness of scale once so prized in singing. There were unruly sections of their voices never fully under control. Many who heard Pasta for example remarked that her uppermost notes seemed produced by ventriloquism a charge which would later be made against Callas”. Ardoin points to the writings of Henry Chorley about Pasta which bear an uncanny resemblance to descriptions of Callas:

There was a portion of the scale which differed from the rest in quality and remained to the last ‘under a veil.’ …out of these uncouth materials she had to compose her instrument and then to give it flexibility. Her studies to acquire execution must have been tremendous; but the volubility and brilliancy when acquired gained a character of their own… There were a breadth an expressiveness in her roulades an evenness and solidity in her shake which imparted to every passage a significance totally beyond the reach of lighter and more spontaneous singers… The best of her audience were held in thrall without being able to analyze what made up the spell what produced the effect—as soon as she opened her lips.

Callas herself appears to have been in agreement not only with Ardoin’s assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957 she described her early voice as: “The timbre was dark almost black—when I think of it I think of thick molasses” and in 1968 she added “They say I was not a true soprano I was rather toward a mezzo”. Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles she told James Fleetwood

It’s study; it’s Nature. I’m doing nothing special you know. Even Lucia Anna Bolena Puritani all these operas were created for one type of soprano the type that sang Norma Fidelio which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century… So I’m really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn’t ask a pianist not to be able to play everything; he has to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher the old kind of teaching methods… I was a very heavy voice that is my nature a dark voice shall we call it and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.

Vocal size and range

Regarding the sheer size of Callas’s instrument Rodolfo Celletti says “Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it frequently contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium.” Celletti wrote that Callas had “a voluminous penetrating and dark voice” (una voce voluminosa squillante e di timbro scuro).[51] After her first performance of Medea in 1953 the critic for Musical Courier wrote that “she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience.” In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge Bonynge stated “But before she slimmed down I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her the way Flagstad’s did…. Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma at the bottom of the range you could barely tell who was who … Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top.” In his book Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas’s pre-1954 voice was a “dramatic soprano with an exceptional top” after the weight loss it became as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia a “huge soprano leggiero”.

In performance Callas’s vocal range was just short of three octaves from F-sharp (F♯3) below middle C (C4) heard in “Arrigo! Ah parli a un core” from I vespri siciliani to E-natural (E6) above high C (C6) heard in the aria “Mercè dilette amiche” in the final act of the same opera as well as in Rossini’s Armida and Lakmé’s Bell Song. Whether or not Callas ever sang a high F-natural in performance has been open to debate. After her June 11 1951 concert in Florence Rock Ferris of Musical Courier said “Her high E’s and F’s are taken full voice.”[30] Although no definite recording of Callas singing high Fs has surfaced the presumed E-natural at the end of Rossini’s Armida—a poor-quality bootleg recording of uncertain pitch—has been referred to as a high F by Italian musicologists and critics Eugenio Gara and Rodolfo Celletti. Callas expert Dr. Robert Seletsky however stated that since the finale of Armida is in the key of E the final note could not have been an F as it would have been dissonant. Author Eve Ruggieri has referred to the penultimate note in “Mercè dilette amiche” from the 1951 Florence performances of I vespri siciliani as a high F; however this claim is refuted by John Ardoin’s review of the live recording of the performance as well as by the review of the recording in Opera News both of which refer to the note as a high E-natural.

In a 1969 French television interview with Pierre Desgraupes [fr] on the program L’invitée du dimanche Francesco Siciliani [it] speaks of Callas’s voice going to high F (he also talked about her lower register extending to C3) but within the same program Callas’s teacher Elvira de Hidalgo speaks of the voice soaring to a high E-natural but does not mention a high F; meanwhile Callas herself remains silent on the subject neither agreeing nor disagreeing with either claim.

Vocal registers

Callas’s voice was noted for its three distinct registers: Her low or chest register was extremely dark and almost baritonal in power and she used this part of her voice for dramatic effect often going into this register much higher on the scale than most sopranos. Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound—”part oboe part clarinet” as Claudia Cassidy described it—and was noted for its veiled or “bottled” sound as if she were singing into a jug. Walter Legge husband of diva Elisabeth Schwarzkopf attributed this sound to the “extraordinary formation of her upper palate shaped like a Gothic arch not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth”.

The upper register was ample and bright with an impressive extension above high C which—in contrast to the light flute-like sound of the typical coloratura “she would attack these notes with more vehemence and power—quite differently therefore from the very delicate cautious ‘white’ approach of the light sopranos.” Legge adds “Even in the most difficult fioriture there were no musical or technical difficulties in this part of the voice which she could not execute with astonishing unostentatious ease. Her chromatic runs particularly downwards were beautifully smooth and staccatos almost unfailingly accurate even in the trickiest intervals. There is hardly a bar in the whole range of nineteenth-century music for high soprano that seriously tested her powers.” And as she demonstrated in the finale of La sonnambula on the commercial EMI set and the live recording from Cologne she was able to execute a diminuendo on the stratospheric high E-flat which Scott describes as “a feat unrivaled in the history of the gramophone.”

Regarding Callas’s soft singing Celletti says “In these soft passages Callas seemed to use another voice altogether because it acquired a great sweetness. Whether in her florid singing or in her canto spianato that is in long held notes without ornamentation her mezza-voce could achieve such moving sweetness that the sound seemed to come from on high … I don’t know it seemed to come from the skylight of La Scala.”

This combination of size weight range and agility was a source of amazement to Callas’s own contemporaries. One of the choristers present at her La Scala debut in I vespri siciliani recalled “My God! She came on stage sounding like our deepest contralto Cloe Elmo. And before the evening was over she took a high E-flat. And it was twice as strong as Toti Dal Monte’s!” In the same vein mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato said: “The first time we sang together was in Mexico in 1950 where she sang the top E-flat in the second-act finale of Aida. I can still remember the effect of that note in the opera house—it was like a star!” For Italian soprano Renata Tebaldi “the most fantastic thing was the possibility for her to sing the soprano coloratura with this big voice! This was something really special. Fantastic absolutely!”

Maria Callas sings “Casta Diva” (Bellini: Norma Act 1)

Callas’s vocal registers however were not seamlessly joined; Walter Legge writes “Unfortunately it was only in quick music particularly descending scales that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole but until about 1960 she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill.” Rodolfo Celletti states

In certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano’s voice—for instance where the lower and middle registers merge between G and A. I would go so far as to say that here her voice had such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist … or else the voice could sound as though it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot … between the middle and upper registers. Here too around the treble F and G there was often something in the sound itself which was not quite right as though the voice were not functioning properly.

As to whether these troublesome spots were due to the nature of the voice itself or to technical deficiencies Celletti says: “Even if when passing from one register to another Callas produced an unpleasant sound the technique she used for these transitions was perfect.” Musicologist and critic Fedele D’Amico [it] adds “Callas’s ‘faults’ were in the voice and not in the singer; they are so to speak faults of departure but not of arrival. This is precisely Celletti’s distinction between the natural quality of the voice and the technique.” In 2005 Ewa Podleś said of Callas “Maybe she had three voices maybe she had three ranges I don’t know—I am a professional singer. Nothing disturbed me nothing! I bought everything that she offered me. Why? Because all of her voices her registers she used how they should be used—just to tell us something!”

Eugenio Gara states “Much has been said about her voice and no doubt the discussion will continue. Certainly no one could in honesty deny the harsh or “squashed” sounds nor the wobble on the very high notes. These and others were precisely the accusations made at the time against Pasta and Malibran two geniuses of song (as they were then called) sublime yet imperfect. Both were brought to trial in their day. … Yet few singers have made history in the annals of opera as these two did.”

Artistry

Callas’s own thoughts regarding music and singing can be found at Wikiquote.

The musician

Though adored by many opera enthusiasts Callas was a controversial artist. While Callas was the great singer often dismissed simply as an actress she considered herself foremost a musician that is the first instrument of the orchestra.” Grace Bumbry has stated “If I followed the musical score when she was singing I would see every tempo marking every dynamic marking everything being adhered to and at the same time it was not antiseptic; it was something that was very beautiful and moving.” Victor de Sabata confided to Walter Legge “If the public could understand as we do how deeply and utterly musical Callas is they would be stunned” and Serafin assessed Callas’s musicality as “extraordinary almost frightening.” Callas possessed an innate architectural sense of line-proportion and an uncanny feel for timing and for what one of her colleagues described as “a sense of the rhythm within the rhythm”.

Regarding Callas’s technical prowess Celletti says “We must not forget that she could tackle the whole gamut of ornamentation: staccato trills half-trills gruppetti scales etc.” D’Amico adds “The essential virtue of Callas’s technique consists of supreme mastery of an extraordinarily rich range of tone color (that is the fusion of dynamic range and timbre). And such mastery means total freedom of choice in its use: not being a slave to one’s abilities but rather being able to use them at will as a means to an end.” While reviewing the many recorded versions of “perhaps Verdi’s ultimate challenge” the aria “D’amor sull’ali rosee” from Il trovatore Richard Dyer writes

Callas articulates all of the trills and she binds them into the line more expressively than anyone else; they are not an ornament but a form of intensification. Part of the wonder in this performance is the chiaroscuro through her tone—the other side of not singing full-out all the way through. One of the vocal devices that create that chiaroscuro is a varying rate of vibrato; another is her portamento the way she connects the voice from note to note phrase to phrase lifting and gliding. This is never a sloppy swoop because its intention is as musically precise as it is in great string playing. In this aria Callas uses more portamento and in greater variety than any other singer … Callas is not creating “effects” as even her greatest rivals do. She sees the aria as a whole “as if in an aerial view” as Sviatoslav Richter’s teacher observed of his most famous pupil; simultaneously she is on earth standing in the courtyard of the palace of Aliaferia floating her voice to the tower where her lover lies imprisoned.

In addition to her musical skills Callas had a particular gift for language and the use of language in music. In recitatives she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes “If we listen attentively we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text.” Technically not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states “What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something—it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art.” Walter Legge states that

Most admirable of all her qualities however were her taste elegance and deeply musical use of ornamentation in all its forms and complications the weighting and length of every appoggiatura the smooth incorporation of the turn in melodic lines the accuracy and pacing of her trills the seemingly inevitable timing of her portamentos varying their curve with enchanting grace and meaning. There were innumerable exquisite felicities—minuscule portamentos from one note to its nearest neighbor or over widespread intervals—and changes of color that were pure magic. In these aspects of bel canto she was supreme mistress of that art.

The actress

Regarding Callas’s acting ability vocal coach and music critic Ira Siff remarked “When I saw the final two Toscas she did in the old [Met] I felt like I was watching the actual story on which the opera had later been based.” Callas was not however a realistic or verismo style actress: her physical acting was merely “subsidiary to the heavy Kunst of developing the psychology of the roles under the supervision of the music of singing the acting… Suffering delight humility hubris despair rhapsody—all this was musically appointed through her use of the voice flying the text upon the notes.” Seconding this opinion verismo specialist soprano Augusta Oltrabella said “Despite what everyone says [Callas] was an actress in the expression of the music and not vice versa.”

Matthew Gurewitsch adds

In fact the essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a performer whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl growl whine and shriek. Callas was not one of them. She found all she needed in the notes.

Ewa Podleś likewise stated that “It’s enough to hear her I’m positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! I can imagine everything I can see everything in front of my eye.” Opera director Sandro Sequi who witnessed many Callas performances close-up states “For me she was extremely stylized and classic yet at the same time human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all opera is the least realistic of theater forms… She was wasted in verismo roles even Tosca no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles.” Scott adds “Early nineteenth-century opera… is not merely the antithesis of reality it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance.”

In regard to Callas’s physical acting style Nicola Rescigno states “Maria had a way of even transforming her body for the exigencies of a role which is a great triumph. In La traviata everything would slope down; everything indicated sickness fatigue softness. Her arms would move as if they had no bones like the great ballerinas. In Medea everything was angular. She’d never make a soft gesture; even the walk she used was like a tiger’s walk.” Sandro Sequi recalls “She was never in a hurry. Everything was very paced proportioned classical precise… She was extremely powerful but extremely stylized. Her gestures were not many… I don’t think she did more than 20 gestures in a performance. But she was capable of standing 10 minutes without moving a hand or finger compelling everyone to look at her.” Edward Downes recalled Callas watching and observing her colleagues with such intensity and concentration as to make it seem that the drama was all unfolding in her head. Sir Rudolf Bing similarly recalled that in Il trovatore in Chicago “it was Callas’s quiet listening rather than Björling’s singing that made the dramatic impact… He didn’t know what he was singing but she knew.”

Callas herself stated that in opera acting must be based on the music quoting Serafin’s advice to her:

When one wants to find a gesture when you want to find how to act onstage all you have to do is listen to the music. The composer has already seen to that. If you take the trouble to really listen with your Soul and with your Ears—and I say ‘Soul’ and ‘Ears’ because the Mind must work but not too much also—you will find every gesture there.

The artist

Callas’s most distinguishing quality was her ability to breathe life into the characters she portrayed or in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch “Most mysterious among her many gifts Callas had the genius to translate the minute particulars of a life into tone of voice.” Italian critic Eugenio Gara adds:

Her secret is in her ability to transfer to the musical plane the suffering of the character she plays the nostalgic longing for lost happiness the anxious fluctuation between hope and despair between pride and supplication between irony and generosity which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments cruel deceptions ambitious desires burning tenderness grievous sacrifices all the torments of the heart acquire in her singing that mysterious truth I would like to say that psychological sonority which is the primary attraction of opera.

Ethan Mordden writes “It was a flawed voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity and within her system the flaws feed the feeling the sour plangency and the strident defiance becoming aspects of the canto. They were literally defects of her voice; she bent them into advantages of her singing.” Giulini believes “If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words music and action it is impossible to imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas.” He recalls that during Callas’s performances of La traviata “reality was onstage. What stood behind me the audience auditorium La Scala itself seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth life itself.” Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments:

Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can’t really distinguish it—in a part it was very hard to enjoy any other artist no matter how great afterwards because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of her hand was more than another artist could do in a whole act.

To Antonino Votto Callas was

The last great artist. When you think this woman was nearly blind and often sang standing a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed she was so precise already note-perfect… She was not just a singer but a complete artist. It’s foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music drama movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.

Alleged Callas–Tebaldi rivalry

During the early 1950s an alleged rivalry arose between Callas and Renata Tebaldi an Italian lyrico spinto soprano. The contrast between Callas’s often unconventional vocal qualities and Tebaldi’s classically beautiful sound resurrected an argument as old as opera itself namely beauty of sound versus the expressive use of sound.

In 1951 Tebaldi and Maria Callas were jointly booked for a vocal recital in Rio de Janeiro Brazil. Although the singers agreed that neither would perform encores Tebaldi took two and Callas was reportedly incensed. This incident began the rivalry which reached a fever pitch in the mid-1950s at times even engulfing the two women themselves who were said by their more fanatical followers to have engaged in verbal barbs in each other’s direction. Tebaldi was quoted as saying “I have one thing that Callas doesn’t have: a heart” while Callas was quoted in Time magazine as saying that comparing her with Tebaldi was like “comparing Champagne with Cognac. No with Coca Cola.” However witnesses to the interview stated that Callas only said “champagne with cognac” and it was a bystander who quipped “No with Coca-Cola” but the Time reporter attributed the latter comment to Callas.

According to John Ardoin however these two singers should never have been compared. Tebaldi was trained by Carmen Melis a noted verismo specialist and she was rooted in the early 20th-century Italian school of singing just as firmly as Callas was rooted in 19th-century bel canto. Callas was a dramatic soprano whereas Tebaldi considered herself essentially a lyric soprano. Callas and Tebaldi generally sang a different repertoire: in the early years of her career Callas concentrated on the heavy dramatic soprano roles and later in her career on the bel canto repertoire whereas Tebaldi concentrated on late Verdi and verismo roles where her limited upper extension and her lack of a florid technique were not issues. They shared a few roles including Tosca in Puccini’s opera and La Gioconda which Tebaldi performed only late in her career.

The alleged rivalry aside Callas made remarks appreciative of Tebaldi and vice versa. During an interview with Norman Ross Jr. in Chicago Callas said “I admire Tebaldi’s tone; it’s beautiful—also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes I actually wish I had her voice.” Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of La Gioconda in order to help her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry he recommended Zinka Milanov’s version. A few days later he went to visit Tebaldi only to find her sitting by the speakers listening intently to Callas’s recording. She then looked up at him and asked “Why didn’t you tell me Maria’s was the best?”

Callas visited Tebaldi after a performance of Adriana Lecouvreur at the Met in 1968 and the two were reunited. In 1978 Tebaldi spoke warmly of her late colleague and summarized this rivalry:

This rivality [sic] was really building from the people of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don’t know why they put this kind of rivality [sic] because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.

Vocal decline

In the opinion of several singers the heavy roles undertaken in her early years damaged Callas’s voice. The mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato Callas’s close friend and frequent colleague stated that she told Callas that she felt that the early heavy roles led to a weakness in the diaphragm and subsequent difficulty in controlling the upper register.

Louise Caselotti who worked with Callas in 1946 and 1947 prior to her Italian debut felt that it was not the heavy roles that hurt Callas’s voice but the lighter ones. Several singers have suggested that Callas’s heavy use of the chest voice led to stridency and unsteadiness with the high notes. In his book Callas’s husband Meneghini wrote that Callas suffered an unusually early onset of menopause which could have affected her voice. Soprano Carol Neblett once said “A woman sings with her ovaries—you’re only as good as your hormones.”

Critic Henry Pleasants has stated that it was a loss of physical strength and breath-support that led to Callas’s vocal problems saying

Singing and especially opera singing requires physical strength. Without it the singer’s respiratory functions can no longer support the steady emissions of breath essential to sustaining the production of focused tone. The breath escapes but it is no longer the power behind the tone or is only partially and intermittently. The result is a breathy sound—tolerable but hardly beautiful—when the singer sings lightly and a voice spread and squally when under pressure.

In the same vein Joan Sutherland who heard Callas throughout the 1950s said in a BBC interview

[Hearing Callas in Norma in 1952] was a shock a wonderful shock. You just got shivers up and down the spine. It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances before she lost weight. I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of “fatness” of the sound which she had when she was as fat as she was. But when she lost the weight she couldn’t seem to sustain the great sound that she had made and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don’t think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.

Michael Scott has proposed that Callas’s loss of strength and breath support was directly caused by her rapid and progressive weight loss something that was noted even in her prime. Of her 1958 recital in Chicago Robert Detmer wrote “There were sounds fearfully uncontrolled forced beyond the too-slim singer’s present capacity to support or sustain.”

Photos and videos of Callas during her heavy era show a very upright posture with the shoulders relaxed and held back. Of a television broadcast from May 1960 of a recital in Hamburg The Opera Quarterly noted “[W]e [can] watch … the constantly sinking depressed chest and hear the resulting deterioration”. This continual change in posture has been cited as visual proof of a progressive loss of breath support.

Commercial and bootleg recordings of Callas from the late 1940s to 1953—the period during which she sang the heaviest dramatic soprano roles—show no decline in the fabric of the voice no loss in volume and no unsteadiness or shrinkage in the upper register. Of her December 1952 Lady Macbeth—coming after five years of singing the most strenuous dramatic soprano repertoire—Peter Dragadze wrote for Opera “Callas’s voice since last season has improved a great deal the second passagio on the high B-natural and C has now completely cleared giving her an equally colored scale from top to bottom.” And of her performance of Medea a year later John Ardoin writes “The performance displays Callas in as secure and free a voice as she will be found at any point in her career. The many top B’s have a brilliant ring and she handles the treacherous tessitura like an eager thoroughbred.”

In recordings from 1954 (immediately after her 80-pound weight loss) and thereafter “not only would the instrument lose its warmth and become thin and acidulous but the altitudinous passages would to her no longer come easily.” It was at this time that unsteady top notes first begin to appear. Walter Legge who produced nearly all of Callas’s EMI/Angel recordings states that Callas “ran into a patch of vocal difficulties as early as 1954”: during the recording of La forza del destino done immediately after the weight loss the “wobble had become so pronounced” that he told Callas they “would have to give away seasickness pills with every side”.

There were others however who felt that the voice had benefitted from the weight loss. Of her performance of Norma in Chicago in 1954 Claudia Cassidy wrote that “there is a slight unsteadiness in some of the sustained upper notes but to me her voice is more beautiful in color more even through the range than it used to be”. And at her performance of the same opera in London in 1957 (her first performance at Covent Garden after the weight loss) critics again felt her voice had changed for the better that it had now supposedly become a more precise instrument with a new focus. Many of her most critically acclaimed appearances are from 1954–58 (Norma La traviata Sonnambula and Lucia of 1955 Anna Bolena of 1957 Medea of 1958 among others).

Callas’s close friend and colleague Tito Gobbi thought that her vocal problems all stemmed from her state of mind:

I don’t think anything happened to her voice. I think she only lost confidence. She was at the top of a career that a human being could desire and she felt enormous responsibility. She was obliged to give her best every night and maybe she felt she wasn’t [able] any more and she lost confidence. I think this was the beginning of the end of this career.

In support of Gobbi’s assertion a bootleg recording of Calla rehearsing Beethoven’s aria “Ah! perfido” and parts of Verdi’s La forza del destino shortly before her death shows her voice to be in much better shape than much of her 1960s recordings and far healthier than the 1970s concerts with Giuseppe Di Stefano.

Soprano Renée Fleming posited that videos of Callas in the late 1950s and early 1960s reveal a posture that betrays breath-support problems:

I have a theory about what caused her vocal decline but it’s more from watching her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It’s not the weight loss per se—you know Deborah Voigt has lost a lot of weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support and then it’s suddenly gone and one doesn’t develop another musculature for support it can be very hard on the voice. And you can’t estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told by somebody who knew her well that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [allowed her] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire the stuff that requires the most stamina the most strength.

However writing about dramatic soprano Deborah Voigt in 2006 shortly after her 135-pound weight loss after gastric bypass surgery music critic Peter G. Davis brings up comparisons with Callas and notes an increasing acidity and thinning in Voigt’s voice that recall the changes in Callas’s voice after her weight loss:

A change has also come over Voigt’s voice lately though it’s hard to tell if it’s from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas’s drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet exhibits any of Callas’s technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable however—earlier this season in Verdi’s La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality at the very center of the instrument together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off especially at the top.

Voigt herself explained how her dramatic weight loss affected her breathing and breath support:

Much of what I did with my weight was very natural vocally. Now I’ve got a different body—there’s not as much of me around. My diaphragm function the way my throat feels is not compromised in any way. But I do have to think about it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn’t do that. If I don’t remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles the breath starts stacking and that’s when you can’t get your phrase you crack high notes.

Callas herself attributed her problems to a loss of confidence brought about by a loss of breath support even though she does not make the connection between her weight and her breath support. In an April 1977 interview with journalist Philippe Caloni [fr] she stated

My best recordings were made when I was skinny and I say skinny not slim because I worked a lot and couldn’t gain weight back; I became even too skinny … I had my greatest successes — Lucia Sonnambula Medea Anna Bolena — when I was skinny as a nail. Even for my first time here in Paris in 1958 when the show was broadcast through Eurovision I was skinny. Really skinny.”

And shortly before her death Callas confided her own thoughts on her vocal problems to Peter Dragadze:

I never lost my voice but I lost strength in my diaphragm. … Because of those organic complaints I lost my courage and boldness. My vocal cords were and still are in excellent condition but my ‘sound boxes’ have not been working well even though I have been to all the doctors. The result was that I overstrained my voice and that caused it to wobble. (Gente October 1 1977)

Whether Callas’s vocal decline was due to ill health early menopause over-use and abuse of her voice loss of breath-support loss of confidence or weight loss will continue to be debated. Whatever the cause may have been her singing career was effectively over by age 40 and even at the time of her death at age 53 according to Walter Legge “she ought still to have been singing magnificently”.

Fussi and Paolillo report

A 2010 study by Italian vocal researchers Franco Fussi and Nico Paolillo revealed Callas was very ill at the time of her death and her illness was related to her vocal deterioration. According to their findings presented at the University of Bologna in 2010 Callas had dermatomyositis a rare connective tissue disease that causes a failure of the muscles and ligaments including the larynx. They believe she was showing signs of this disease as early as the 1960s. Fussi and Paolillo cite an initial report by physician Mario Giacovazzo who in 2002 revealed he had diagnosed Callas with dermatomyositis in 1975. Treatment included corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents which affect heart function.

At an event hosted by the journal Il Saggiatore Musicale Fussi and Paolillo presented documentation showing when and how her voice changed over time. Using modern audio technology they analyzed live Callas studio recordings from the 1950s through the 1970s looking for signs of deterioration. Spectrographic analysis showed that she was losing the top half of her range. Fussi observed video recordings in which Callas’s posture seemed strained and weakened. He felt that her drastic weight loss in 1954 further contributed to reduced physical support of her voice.

Fussi and Paolillo also examined restored footage of the infamous 1958 Norma “walkout” in Rome which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control. She really did have the bronchitis and tracheitis she claimed and the dermatomyositis was already causing her muscles to deteriorate.

The latter half of Callas’s career was marked by a number of scandals. Following a performance of Madama Butterfly in Chicago in 1955 Callas was confronted by a process server who handed her papers about a lawsuit brought by Eddy Bagarozy who claimed he was her agent. Callas was photographed with her mouth turned in a furious snarl. The photo was sent around the world and gave rise to the myth of Callas as a temperamental prima donna and a “Tigress”. In the same year just before her debut at the Metropolitan Opera Time ran a damaging cover story about Callas with special attention paid to her difficult relationship with her mother and some unpleasant exchanges between the two.

In 1957 Callas was starring as Amina in La sonnambula at the Edinburgh International Festival with the forces of La Scala. Her contract was for four performances but due to the great success of the series La Scala decided to put on a fifth performance. Callas told the La Scala officials that she was physically exhausted and that she had already committed to a previous engagement a party thrown for her by her friend Elsa Maxwell in Venice. Despite this La Scala announced a fifth performance with Callas billed as Amina. Callas refused to stay and went on to Venice. Despite the fact that she had fulfilled her contract she was accused of walking out on La Scala and the festival. La Scala officials did not defend Callas or inform the press that the additional performance was not approved by Callas. Renata Scotto took over the part which was the start of her international career.

In January 1958 Callas was to open the Rome Opera House season with Norma with Italy’s president Giovanni Gronchi in attendance. The day before the opening night Callas alerted the management that she was not well and that they should have a standby ready. She was told “No one can double Callas”. After being treated by doctors she felt better on the day of performance and decided to go ahead with the opera.[21] A surviving bootleg recording of the first act reveals Callas sounding ill. Feeling that her voice was slipping away she felt that she could not complete the performance and consequently she cancelled after the first act. She was accused of walking out on the president of Italy in a fit of temperament and pandemonium broke out. Doctors confirmed that Maria had bronchitis and tracheitis and the President’s wife called to tell her they knew she was sick. However they made no statements to the media and the endless stream of press coverage aggravated the situation.

A newsreel included file footage of Callas from 1955 sounding well intimating the footage was of rehearsals for the Rome Norma with the voiceover narration “Here she is in rehearsal sounding perfectly healthy” followed by “If you want to hear Callas don’t get all dressed up. Just go to a rehearsal; she usually stays to the end of those.”

Callas’s relationship with La Scala had also started to become strained after the Edinburgh incident and this effectively severed her major ties with her artistic home. Later in 1958 Callas and Rudolf Bing were in discussion about her season at the Met. She was scheduled to perform in Verdi’s La traviata and in Macbeth two very different operas which almost require totally different singers. Callas and the Met could not reach an agreement and before the opening of Medea in Dallas Bing sent a telegram to Callas terminating her contract. Headlines of “Bing Fires Callas” appeared in newspapers around the world. Nicola Rescigno later recalled “That night she came to the theater looking like an empress: she wore an ermine thing that draped to the floor and she had every piece of jewellery she ever owned. And she said ‘You all know what’s happened. Tonight for me is a very difficult night and I will need the help of every one of you.’ Well she proceeded to give a performance [of Medea] that was historical.”

Bing later said that Callas was the most difficult artist he ever worked with “because she was so much more intelligent. Other artists you could get around. But Callas you could not get around. She knew exactly what she wanted and why she wanted it.” Despite this Bing’s admiration for Callas never wavered and in September 1959 he sneaked into La Scala in order to listen to Callas record La Gioconda for EMI. Callas and Bing reconciled in the mid 1960s and Callas returned to the Met for two performances of Tosca with her friend Tito Gobbi.

In her final years as a singer she sang in Medea Norma and Tosca most notably her Paris New York and London Toscas of January–February 1964 and her last performance on stage on July 5 1965 at Covent Garden. A live television transmission of act 2 of the Covent Garden Tosca of 1964 was broadcast in Britain on February 9 1964 giving a rare view of Callas in performance and specifically of her on-stage collaboration with Tito Gobbi. This has now been preserved on DVD.

In 1969 the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini cast Callas in her only non-operatic acting role as the Greek mythological character of Medea in his film by that name. The production was grueling and according to the account in Ardoin’s Callas the Art and the Life Callas is said to have fainted after a day of strenuous running back and forth on a mudflat in the sun. The film was not a commercial success but as Callas’s only film appearance it documents her stage presence.

From October 1971 to March 1972 Callas gave a series of masterclasses at the Juilliard School in New York. These classes later formed the basis of Terrence McNally’s 1995 play Master Class. Callas staged a series of joint recitals in Europe in 1973 and in the U.S. South Korea and Japan in 1974 with the tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano. Critically this was a musical disaster owing to both performers’ worn-out voices. However the tour was an enormous popular success. Audiences thronged to hear the two performers who had so often appeared together in their prime. Her final public performance was on November 11 1974 in Sapporo Japan.

Onassis final years and death

In 1957 while still married to husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini Callas was introduced to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis at a party given in her honor by Elsa Maxwell after a performance in Donizetti’s Anna Bolena.[21] The affair that followed received much publicity in the popular press and in November 1959 Callas left her husband. Michael Scott asserts that Onassis was not why Callas largely abandoned her career but that he offered her a way out of a career that was made increasingly difficult by scandals and by vocal resources that were diminishing at an alarming rate. Franco Zeffirelli on the other hand recalls asking Callas in 1963 why she had not practiced her singing and Callas responding that “I have been trying to fulfill my life as a woman.” According to one of her biographers Nicholas Gage Callas and Onassis had a child a boy who died hours after he was born on March 30 1960. In his book about his wife Meneghini states categorically that Maria Callas was unable to bear children. Various sources also dismiss Gage’s claim as they note that the birth certificates Gage used to prove this “secret child” were issued in 1998 twenty-one years after Callas’s death. Still other sources claim that Callas had at least one abortion while involved with Onassis. In 1966 Callas renounced her U.S. citizenship at the American Embassy in Paris to facilitate the end of her marriage to Meneghini. This was because after her renunciation she was only a Greek citizen and under Greek law a Greek could only legally marry in a Greek Orthodox church. As she had married in a Roman Catholic church this divorced her in every country except Italy. The renunciation also helped her finances as she no longer had to pay U.S. taxes on her income. The relationship ended two years later in 1968 when Onassis left Callas in favor of Jacqueline Kennedy. However the Onassis family’s private secretary Kiki writes in her memoir that even while Aristotle was with Jackie he frequently met with Maria in Paris where they resumed what had now become a clandestine affair.

Callas spent her last years living largely in isolation in Paris and died of a heart attack at age 53 on September 16 1977.

A funerary liturgy was held at St. Stephen’s Greek Orthodox Cathedral on rue Georges-Bizet Paris on September 20 1977. She was later cremated at the Père Lachaise Cemetery and her ashes were placed in the columbarium there. After being stolen and later recovered they were scattered over the Aegean Sea off the coast of Greece according to her wish in the spring of 1979.

During a 1978 interview upon being asked “Was it worth it to Maria Callas? She was a lonely unhappy often difficult woman” music critic and Callas’s friend John Ardoin replied:

That’s such a difficult question. There are times you know when there are people – certain people who are blessed and cursed with an extraordinary gift in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. And Callas was one of these people. It was almost as if her wishes her life her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible incredible gift that she was given this gift that reached out and taught us all – taught us things about music we knew very well but showed us new things things we never thought about new possibilities. I think that’s why singers admire her so; I think that’s why conductors admire her so; I know that’s why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don’t think she always understood what she did or why she did. She knew she had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something that she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her “It must be very enviable to be Maria Callas.” And she said “No it’s a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas because it’s a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand.” Because she couldn’t explain what she did – it was all done by instinct; it was something incredibly embedded deep within her.

Estate

According to several Callas biographers Vasso Devetzi a female Greek pianist near the same age as Callas insinuated herself into Callas’s trust during her last years and acted virtually as her agent. This claim is corroborated by Iakintha (Jackie) Callas in her 1990 book Sisters wherein she asserts that Devetzi conned Maria out of control of half of her estate while promising to establish the Maria Callas Foundation to provide scholarships for young singers; after hundreds of thousands of dollars had allegedly vanished Devetzi finally did establish the foundation.

On September 16 1977 at the age of 55 Maria Callas collapsed and died suddenly and mysteriously in her Paris home.

“I am not an angel and do not pretend to be. That is not one of my roles. But I am not the devil either. I am a woman and a serious artist and I would like so to be judged.”

New Delhi: Used-car retailer CarMax Inc topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and revenue as people used their stimulus checks to buy personal vehicles with public transport losing favour due to pandemic-driven health concerns.Shares of the company were up 7.2% at $128 in morning trade on Friday after it said retail used-unit sales doubled to 270799 units in the first quarter.Low-interest rates government stimulus and a preference for private vehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic have bolstered demand at auto retailers.Earlier in the month the company said it would hire 1800 employees by summer-end to boost production through reconditioning and preparing vehicles for sale.""We benefited from the backdrop of a strong demand environment enhanced by the impact of the most recent round of government stimulus payments"" Chief Executive Bill Nash said on a post-earnings call.Comparable store units rose 99.1% from a year ago partly helped by a shift in the timing of customer tax refunds.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note that while online car seller Carvana remains the preferred used-car name the brokerage thinks CarMax has the network capability to be a strong challenger to Carvana over the long run.""We are very bullish about our future given the strength and trajectory of our current business and the opportunities to expand into the broader used-auto ecosystem"" Chief Financial Officer Enrique Mayor-Mora said.Net income rose to $436.8 million or $2.63 per share in the quarter ended May 31 from $4.98 million or 3 cents per share a year ago.Analysts on average expected the company to report earnings of $1.63 per share according to Refinitiv data.Total revenue rose 138% to $7.70 billion above estimates of $6.24 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Donald Arnold said Americans are desperate to return to Carnival Corp's cruises.

""We have far more demand than we have ships available to supply right now"" he told Fox Business.

He added that the chance of a COVID-19 outbreak onboard is ""very low"" but can't be ruled out.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The CEO of Carnival Corp the world's biggest cruise company said that demand across its nine cruise lines is soaring and that Americans are raring to get back on the water.

""Honestly people are champing at the bit to cruise again"" Donald Arnold told Fox Business Friday.

Its first US cruise the Vista by Carnival Cruise Line its biggest brand is setting sail from Galveston to the western Caribbean on July 3.

Arnold said that people were confident in the safety of cruises as the vaccine rollout continues across the US and that the shots were a ""huge game-changer.""

Bookings were ""robust"" and among the highest in the company's history according to Arnold.

He said: ""We do not have an issue with being able to fill the ships. People are ready to sail. In fact we have far more demand than we have ships available to supply right now.""

In a second-quarter business update Thursday the company said that booking volumes for future cruises were 45% higher than during the first quarter. It added that advance bookings for 2022 were already higher than in 2019 thanks to pent-up demand.

People are spending a lot of money on board too. The CEO of Celebrity Cruises said travelers are eager to shell out extra cash on casinos massages and luxury meals.

Arnold told Fox Business that some of Carnival's cruise lines including Costa had been sailing out of Europe during the pandemic. Many of these passengers were unvaccinated but the company implemented universal testing social distancing mask-wearing and enhanced medical screenings he said.

There were less than 50 reported coronavirus cases out of around 400000 guests on board according to Arnold who added that guest satisfaction scores were ""sky high.""

Arnold said that there would be some unvaccinated guests on its cruises in the US but that these passengers would have to take regular COVID-19 tests and wear masks.







Celebrity Cruises last week unveiled new regulations subjecting unvaccinated passengers – or those unwilling to show proof of the vaccine – to onboard restrictions extra COVID-19 tests and additional costs.

But being fully vaccinated doesn't completely prevent the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

""If the virus is in the community on land … then of course you can get it on board despite all the things we do"" Arnold told Fox Business.

""We can't guarantee there will never be a case on board but the chance of an outbreak is very low"" he added.

And on a ""fully vaccinated"" Royal Caribbean cruise sailing from the Bahamas two passengers aboard tested positive for COVID-19. Both were under the age of 16 meaning they were exempted from the vaccine mandate.

Carnival said that at least 52% of its ship capacity would be sailing by the end of November and expected to have its full fleet back in operation by spring 2022.

Arnold told Fox Business that Carnival was selling or had sold 19 ships during the pandemic reducing its total capacity by 13% but that the company was buying more ships and would grow its capacity by around 2.5% through 2025.

He added that its newest ship the Mardi Gras was setting sail from Port Canaveral to the eastern and western Caribbean on July 31. Carnvial Corp said that the ship is the first in the world to have a rollercoaster on board as well as the first in North America to be powered by liquefied natural gas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY3Jldy1jZW50ZXIuY29tL2NyZXctaW50ZXJuZXQtd2hhdC1mcmVlLWFuZC13aGF0LWF2YWlsYWJsZS1kdXJpbmctcmVzdGFydNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crew Internet: What is free and what is available during the restart?,"No doubt the internet is one of the most important things for crew working onboard the cruise ships. The net is the window to the outside world connecting the crew with their loved ones back home.

Each day crew members are joining the ships as more countries reopen the borders allowing cruise ships to sail. And while guests can go out in ports crew members are unfortunately not allowed ashore yet or have limited access. Before the pandemic many of the crew use to go out in ports to get free internet access at the nearby bars restaurants or beach resorts and chat with their family and friends. With the current restrictions many of the cruise lines are now offering free internet for the crew. In order to find out more about what is free and how much the cruise lines are charging for additional services I spoke with my fellow crew members onboard. Here’s what they said.

Carnival Cruise Line

A crew member onboard one of the Carnival cruise ships getting ready to start cruising said they have unlimited free internet access to all apps except YouTube.

“We have two vouchers per week of 450min each and free unlimited social media (Facebook Instagram WhatsApp Messenger LinkedIn and Snapchat). If you ask they will give you more vouchers. But so far I got 6 vouchers and I only used 20 min of the first one ” said the crew member

The crew are rushing to get the ships ready so they have little time to chat or browse the net this is not only the case on the Carnival ships but all cruise lines as well. Housekeeping restaurant and technicians are especially busy during the restert. When asked if the crew will have the same internet privileges once guests arrive the crew member said “We have free internet until the start of cruises. After that nobody knows but it will probably go back to what it was before”

Royal Caribbean Group

The crew onboard Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises ships have 24/7 access to WhatsApp and one hour of free internet per day which needs to be used at the same time when they log in.

“Here in Royal we have pretty much the same as Celebrity. We have unlimited WhatsApp 24/7 (text only) and 1 hour free per day.” said Royal Caribbean crew member. “We are super busy at the moment but once we get on track everything will be fine. When we're at CocoCay we have free internet on the island and it’s a good speed though.”

Costa Cruises

A crew member working for Costa Cruises said the crew receive a voucher for free internet of 250 MB once they embark on the ship.

“When you embark you’ll be in quarantine 7 days hard and after 7 days soft. On embarking you’ll get a voucher for full internet of 250MB. So this is the voucher crew received on embarkation day and needed to last for 2 weeks during the quarantine. Since 2 weeks after reopening the Costa Crew has in general the CrewWifi for free use of WhatsApp - No pics No Voice just Text - for free but at least is for free 24/7

If you don’t want you can pay: on port 3 cents each minute or at sea 5 cents each minute. They have as well packages: 1GB €15 - 5GB €45 for 30 valid not used will disappear after 30 days. ""

Norwegian Cruise Line

So far NCL has opted not to charge crew for internet until the first guest steps onboard. Ncl hasn’t decided yet for when guests sail. According to our source they said it will be paid packages again.

Viking Ocean Cruises

Viking has free unlimited internet for the crew even as the guests started sailing on the Viking Ships. All apps are enabled the speed is great and the crew can even watch YouTube but sometimes the videos need more time to upload.

MSC Cruises

A crew member onboard MSC Virtuosa said that the company has free WhatsApp for text messaging only and the crew can use Facebook Messenger to make video or audio calls. The crew can also purchase internet packages such as the monthly internet package 50 euro of 3GB. One thing we noticed is that this package in 2019 was 45 euros for the crew. So there is an increase in the prices but the crew said at least they are giving free WiFi which was not offered before by the company.

Onboard there are 18 UK and US F35B jets which is the largest number to ever be deployed on a single ship nevertheless as part of an international force according to a statement by the UK Defense Ministry. "" The aircraft are next generation multi-role combat aircraft equipped with advanced sensors mission systems and stealth technology"" the Ministry said. The jets can land from a vertical position which allow them to operate from smaller aircraft carriers.""The ability to operate from the sea with the most advanced fighter jets ever created is a significant moment in our history"" said UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. ""The Carrier Strike Group is... a show of international military strength that will deter anyone who seeks to undermine global security.""The last time US aircraft had flown combat missions from a British foreign aircraft carrier was during a campaign in the South Pacific in 1943 stationed aboard the HMS Victorious in the heat of World War II.It is also the first time the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force have flown a maritime strike operation since participating in a NATO-led campaign in Libya during its civil war about a decade ago.""HMS Queen Elizabeth’s first missions against Daesh (ISIS) will be remembered as a significant moment in the 50-year lifespan of this ship"" said Commodore Steve Moorehouse Commander of the UK Carrier Strike Group. ""It also marks a new phase of our current deployment.""To date we have delivered diplomatic influence on behalf of the UK through a series of exercises and engagements with our partners - now we are ready to deliver the hard punch of maritime-based air power against a shared enemy.""""The involvement of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her Air Wing in this campaign also sends a wider message"" Moorhouse concluded. ""It demonstrates the speed and agility with which a UK-led Carrier Strike Group can inject fifth generation combat power into any operation anywhere in the world thereby offering the British Government and our allies true military and political choice.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5kZW1vY3JhY3kubmV0L2VuL29wZW5kZW1vY3JhY3l1ay9uby1tYXR0ZXItaG93LWZhci1obXMtcXVlZW4tZWxpemFiZXRoLXNhaWxzLWl0LXdvbnQtbWFrZS1icml0YWluLWdyZWF0LWFnYWluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No matter how far HMS Queen Elizabeth sails it won't make Britain great again,"The UK’s new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is a few weeks into its deployment to Japan and back which is expected to last more than seven months and include a transiting of the South China Sea through areas claimed by China. The operation is considered to be an opportunity to show that post-Brexit Britain has entered a glorious new era of military strength so that it can be seen once again as a great power.

It is true that a naval deployment on this scale – the most powerful since the Falklands/Malvinas war nearly 40 years ago – will be a prominent opportunity to show off the huge carrier its accompanying warships and their weapons.

This exercise will be welcomed by the arms corporations that have built and equipped the ships and will be a valuable aid to the future commercial success of the relevant military-industrial complexes – even more so because the contingent is joined by US and Dutch warships including F-35B aircraft.

The British component of the strike group is made up of the aircraft carrier itself escorted by two air defence destroyers two anti-submarine warfare frigates a nuclear-powered attack submarine a tanker and a supplies ship. Added to this are Dutch and US destroyers and quite possibly a US attack submarine.

Poking the bear

The foray was originally mooted as a high-profile ‘showing the flag’ operation but it is already clear that it goes well beyond that. A few days ago one of the UK destroyers HMS Defender detached from the strike force and went through the Bosphorus into the Black Sea visited a Ukrainian port and then returned briefly entering disputed waters claimed by Russia to the annoyance of the Kremlin. Fortunately for the Boris Johnson government the HMS Defender happened to have a BBC TV camera crew and a Daily Mail reporter on board ensuring that brave Britain was seen to be standing up to the ‘Russian Bear’.

However this provocation caused considerable annoyance in the EU where member states especially Germany have been engaged in delicate discussions with the Russian government to improve relations. It also turned out to be trickier than expected for the UK as the speed and force of the Russian reaction including the firing of warning shots came as a nasty shock. British officials later admitted that they were taken by surprise.

Also this week American and British strike aircraft from the carrier took part in airstrikes against Isis paramilitaries in Iraq. Such an operation could have been more easily undertaken from the RAF airbase in Akrotiri Cyprus or indeed bases in Qatar or Kuwait so this was another demonstration of the carrier’s potential force rather than a necessity.

The strike was claimed to be against Isis ‘remnants’ in Iraq the implication being that the war against Isis is virtually over. That stance is difficult to maintain at the same time as the top US general in Africa warned of a “wildfire of terrorism” on the march across northern Africa from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean involving groups linked to Isis and al-Qaida and a report confirming a powerful and growing Isis presence in Eastern and Central Africa as well as across the Sahel.

In the next couple of weeks the strike group will transit through the Suez Canal and into the Indian Ocean calling at the new Duqm naval base in Oman and then head East. Before getting to Duqm carrier-based aircraft may carry out airstrikes in Somalia and after Duqm there could be bombing operations in Afghanistan where the security situation worsens by the day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTA2LzEyMjcyMTYuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facing arrogant London Buenos Aires should push back on Malvinas,"Illustration: Liu Rui/GT

Some British politicians' mentality is obviously still mired in the colonial era. While continuing to occupy colonies illegally they are also pointing fingers at the affairs of their former colony. Britain also sent aircraft carrier to waters faraway from its territory in order to flex muscles. However developing countries' anti-colonial struggles have never stopped but have accelerated instead.Once also a victim of colonialism China understands well the hardship of anti-colonial struggles. Geng Shuang China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations (UN) on Thursday expounded China's position on the Malvinas Islands also known as the Falklands Islands and called for international efforts to put an end to colonialism there one and for all.China has held consistent position on the Malvinas Islands issue.Today some new backgrounds have emerged in the Malvinas Islands dispute. ""On the one hand there has been a rise in power politics in the international community harming international rules. On the other hand the UK will hold a stronger position on some historical issues after Brexit"" Cui Hongjian director of the Department of European Studies China Institute of International Studies told the Global Times on Sunday.For example the UN Special Committee on Decolonization in February unanimously ratified its ""support for the resumption of negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom to find a peaceful solution to the controversy of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands."" But the UK ignored it. British media express.co.uk even declared that ""The UK has always stood firm against the UN's resolutions that propose a dialogue between the two countries.""Given London's de facto control over the Malvinas Islands the UK will not give a formal response to Argentina's request. In this context the UK has pushed the problem to a point where it seems that it can only be resolved by strength Cui said.Cui emphasized that London often claims countries should abide by international law and follow the rules-based order. Yet in reality it believes more in power politics.But the UK does not have such strength to hold to results of colonial era. According to the government website of the Falkland Islands Britain registered a formal protest in 1829 to assert its ""own sovereignty over the Falkland Islands."" At that time the British Empire was in its heyday as the only industrialized power worldwide. Expanding on a global scale the UK once had colonies all over the world. But now it seems that the ""empire on which the sun never sets"" has returned to its original point facing the chaos and difficulties after Brexit.The UK has emphasized that the Malvinas islanders' right to ""self-determination."" But this is not the case. About 70 percent of the islands' population are of British descent primarily as a result of Scottish and Welsh migration to the islands. As then Argentine ambassador to the UK Alicia Castro said in 2012 ""This is a special case that involves a colonial territory not a colonized population; its inhabitants are not the original people of the islands. It is a population installed by Britain after 1833.""The UN General Assembly Resolution 2065 adopted in December 1965 recognized that the case of the Malvinas is framed in a colonial situation which should be solved by taking into consideration those expressed in the UN General Assembly Resolution 1514 where the goal of eliminating all forms of colonialism was established. As one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council will the UK comply with UN resolutions and the rule-based order?Facing such an attitude of the UK Argentina should add more strings to its bow. Cui believed that first of all Argentina should keep putting forward this issue with both the international community and at the UN level.It cannot allow the Malvinas Islands issue to become one that should maintain the status quo. It should be one that must be changed. Argentina must constantly exert public opinion pressure on the UK in the international society and make the Malvinas Islands issue an international focus.Second Cui said that Argentina should take precautions against the UK's next moves. After Brexit Britain may take risky actions such as increasing the number of troops stationed on the Malvinas Islands or making provocative moves against Argentina so Argentina must keep vigilant.In today's 21st century long gone are the days when Western colonialists had free rein. However the UK still insists on its colonial mentality and policies which are inconsistent with the times. This year marks the first year of the Fourth International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism (2021-30). Eradicating colonialism is a long-term battle that needs the international community's unwavering support. All countries concerned need to stick to the right direction to form more consensuses. Only in this way can we carry the anti-colonial struggles to the end.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHA6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jbi9lbmdsaXNoLzIwMjEtMDYvMjcvY18xMzEwMDMwNzY4Lmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(Hello Africa) Feature: Recycling creating income opportunities in Zambia - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-06-27 19:10:22|Editor: huaxia

As recycling becomes a global trend a growing number of people in Zambia are creating income on products they are making from pre-used items.

LUSAKA June 27 (Xinhua) -- As recycling becomes a global trend a growing number of people in Zambia are creating income on products they are making from pre-used items.

While many are only beginning to appreciate the economic rewards of recycling 40-year-old Florence Chileshe a resident of Lusaka the capital of Zambia has benefited substantially from selling custom-made handbags purses as well as pouches for phones using used plastic carrier bags.

Aside from a few local clients Chileshe a widow with four children boasts of a large number of local and international customers many of whom purchase her products through a woman's cooperative she belongs to.

""I earn more from handbags which cost between 200 and 500 Zambian Kwacha (approximately 9 and 22 U.S. dollars) apiece. This is something that I have been doing for over 10 years and it has enabled me to provide for all of my children's needs"" she said.

Another Lusaka-based recycling enthusiast Jessy Zulu-Kamuyuwa is among a growing number of individuals that are maximizing opportunities presented by an array of recyclable products.

Zulu-Kamuyuwa aged 37 collects used wine bottles old vehicle tires and towels fabrics from which she makes ornaments and seats among other things something that she has been doing for close to two years now.

""I make flower pots using old bath towels. I also make coffee tables and lounge seats using old vehicle tires. And I use old wine bottles to make decor"" she explained.

She also revealed that she earns some substantial income from the said items whose prices vary but range from 100 to 1000 Zambian Kwacha with lounge chairs costing more than the rest of the items.

Apart from making and selling products made from pre-used items Zulu-Kamuyuwa also actively participates in raising awareness about environmental sustainability activities in her community.

And 18-year-old Marthar Phiri of Kalingalinga compound in Lusaka who at the time of speaking to her had just learned how to make necklaces earrings and wristbands using old hard copy newspapers and magazines said recycling ventures can help to reduce unemployment levels among young people in Zambia.

Recycling is said to be a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the ""Reduce Reuse and Recycle"" waste hierarchy.

It can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials thereby reducing energy usage air pollution from burning waste and water contamination through landfills and improper waste disposal.

Experts note that recycling if properly managed can not only help to rid communities of waste materials but also provide alternative employment opportunities. ■",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc3RyYXRlZ3kva2lyYW5hLWxpbmtlZC1zdXBlci1haXItamV0LXNlY3VyZXMtaW5kb25lc2lhbi1hb2MvMTQ0MzQ0LmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kirana-linked Super Air Jet secures Indonesian AOC,"A new Indonesian airline with close links to Lion Group founder Rusdi Kirana has received its AOC.

Start-up carrier Super Air Jet (SAJ) was awarded an AOC on 25 June according to Indonesia’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

SAJ is cleared to start operations with three Airbus A320 aircraft.

“We have carried out the certification process for the issuance of the [AOC] based on an application letter from the SAJ since September 30 2020 the certification process refers to ICAO provisions and applicable aviation regulations in Indonesia which is carried out through five stages or phases” says DGCA director-general Novie Riyanto.

The stages are pre-application formal application document compliance demonstration & inspection and certification.

The DGCA adds that the new carrier will conduct maintenance operations at PT Batam Technic the Lion Group’s MRO facility.

Super Air Jet’s ownership structure is nebulous but it appears to have lose links to Rusdi Kirana’s troubled Lion Group which comprises carriers such as Lion Air Malaysia’s Malindo and Thai Lion.

In May Lion’s communications team responded to a FlightGlobal query about the new carrier. A spokesman sent a statement about the new airline making no mention of Lion itself. Reuters has reported that the new carrier is to be run by Ari Azhari formerly a general manager in Lion Group.

Kirana himself has yet to publicly comment on the new carrier having kept an extremely low profile of since early 2020 as the airline group grapples with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic including tough discussions with lessors.

Some lessors regard Super Air Jet with scepticism seeing it as a way for Kirana to gain leverage over them.

Cirium fleets data shows that Super Air Jet has three A320s managed by three separate lessors: CDB Aviation Orix Aviation and ICBC Leasing.

As for Lion the carrier has 90 aircraft in service and 53 in storage. It also has firm orders for 426 aircraft mainly A320neo family jets and Boeing 737 Maxes. The 737 Max remains grounded in Indonesia."

They're in the middle of an outbreak that set records last year and could again this year. (Oliver Walters/CBC - image credit)

A species of invasive moth caterpillars is stripping trees bare and raining down feces from the canopy across much of southern Ontario and Quebec amid a record outbreak. Here's why their population has exploded and what can be done about them.

What are these moths and what do the adults and caterpillars look like?

The moths are known as the ""LDD"" moth because of their scientific name Lymantria dispar dispar. LDD moth is the name preferred by Ontario's invading species program which says its original common name of ""gypsy moth"" is derived from a culturally offensive slur.

The caterpillars grow up to six centimetres long. They're hairy and can be identified by the five pairs of blue dots and six pairs of red dots on their backs.

The adult male moths are brown and fly around. The adult females are larger white and can't fly.

Emily Chung/CBC

Where are they found?

At this point they're found throughout much of southern Canada.

They're native to Europe and Asia but were introduced to the U.S. near Boston in the 1860s by astronomer and amateur entomologist Étienne Trouvelot who wanted to test their potential for manufacturing silk. They escaped and became an invasive species

They first reached southern Canada in 1969 according to David Dutkiewicz entomology technician at the Invasive Species Centre a non-profit organization based in Sault Ste. Marie Ont. a conservation organization focused on preventing detecting responding to and controlling invasive species in Canada.

The current population explosion is mostly in southern Ontario although Quebec reports outbreaks in the Montérégie region and near Montreal (Boucherville L'Île-Perrot parc national du Mont-Saint-Bruno) as well as in the Outaouais region along with smaller populations in the Mauricie region and near Quebec City.

What kind of damage do these moths do?

These moth caterpillars have voracious appetites and eat a wide range of food including oak birch poplar willow and maple unlike many other caterpillars that are pickier eaters. They also feed for a period of the year about twice as long as many native caterpillars said Joel Harrison-Off a forest health-care inspector with the City of Toronto. And while they're eaten by some birds and mammals none of them consume enough to really put a dent in the population.

When there's an outbreak they can completely strip trees bare of leaves as they've done to the oak trees in Toronto's High Park.

Oliver Walters/CBC

Generally trees can recover. But some tree species such as oak have a harder time regenerating foliage.

Harrison-Off said the stress that puts on the trees and the energy that requires especially if climate conditions such as drought are also stressful makes it harder for them to defend against pathogens.

""These trees some of them will start to die back in the next few years as a result of being defoliated.""

How bad is this year's outbreak?

These moth outbreaks are cyclical leading to an outbreak or infestation every decade or so and lasting one to three years. Numbers rise in years when weather conditions are good then decline due to fungal or viral infections that spread through the population. Previous outbreaks have happened in 1985 1991 and 2002.

The current outbreak in Ontario started in 2019 and the next year the moth caterpillars defoliated more than 580000 hectares — a record. ""You're looking at the size of Prince Edward Island basically that was defoliated last year"" said Dutkiewicz.

He said this year's final tally won't be out until August and right now we're on track to see a similar amount of defoliation and ""another record-breaking year or close to a record-breaking year.""

WATCH | 'To many people the trees look like they've died':

In comparison 1985 the worst previous outbreak topped out at 350000 hectares of defoliation.

Harrison-Off said this year LDD moths have been seen in parts of Toronto where they haven't been seen before including people's properties: ""We're getting a lot of reaction and people are trying to deal with and learn about [LDD] moths.""

Why is it so bad?

Partly it's due to the natural cycle. But this year's weather conditions were also ideal Dutkiewicz said — a warm winter followed by a dry spring.

The moths can't survive below –20 C for long which is why they're restricted to southern Canada. And a wet spring helps grow a fungus that kills them.

""We haven't had those types of natural events ... in order to knock back the population"" he said. ""It really has been the perfect series of events of beautiful weather.""

Will climate change make it worse?

David Featherstone senior ecologist at the Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority about 100 kilometres north of Toronto predicts that the moths will start spreading north into central Ontario.

Droughts and extreme storms can also put stress on trees and forests that can make trees less able to withstand being stripped of their leaves by the LDD moths and having to regrow them again he added.

WATCH | Climate change makes invasive caterpillars a bigger problem

What can be done about LDD moth infestations?

Some Ontario municipalities such as London Ont. spray a bacterial insecticide call BTK to control outbreaks. Dutkiewicz said some conservation authorities also do targeted spraying to protect ""high-value trees."" But Ontario Parks says it is letting nature take its course.

Oliver Walters/CBC

Harrison-Off said BTK has the potential to kill a lot of beneficial and native caterpillars in environmentally sensitive areas like High Park.

Instead the City of Toronto does targeted spot treatments.

""We scraped off literally millions of eggs using vacuum cleaners"" he recalled. Some trees such as oaks were injected with pesticides or sprayed individually. The city also mailed out 40000 pamphlets about the pest as part of a public education campaign.

He noted that the moths are mostly spread by people as they don't fly well (and females don't fly at all). For example people may get eggs attached to their car while visiting city parks and those might hatch at their cottage or somewhere else.

Can you do anything about them on your property?

Dutkiewicz recommends that people dealing with the moths on a small number of trees on their own property can also use a technique that involves tying a band of burlap around the tree trunks at about chest height. The caterpillars which are around until the middle of July like the shade and hide under there. Afterward they can be picked off and dumped into a bucket of soapy water.

WATCH | Volunteers work to thwart invasive moth caterpillars in Ottawa's Hampton Park:

After Labour Day when the adults are done laying eggs you can also find their egg masses and use a butter knife or painter's scraper to scrape them into soapy water. Dutkiewicz said they are brown with a texture that resembles the skin of a tennis ball and can be found under branches or in the crevices of trees.

But the biologists who spoke to CBC News for the article noted that because these moths don't typically kill trees they're actually less harmful than many other invasive species and are a species we're going to have to live with.

""They're not going away any time soon"" Featherstone said. ""And we just have to adapt as people and as ecosystems.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS8zMTY2MDg4L2JlYXV0aWNpYW4tc2xhbW1lZC1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1leWVsYXNoLWV4dGVuc2lvbnMv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlLzMxNjYwODgvYmVhdXRpY2lhbi1zbGFtbWVkLWNhdGVycGlsbGFyLWV5ZWxhc2gtZXh0ZW5zaW9ucy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beautician boasts she’s only one ‘brave’ enough to give client lashes – but gets savaged for ‘caterpillar’...,"IF you've ever had eyelash extensions then you'll know that the treatment requires enough natural lashes for your beautician to work with.

So after being repeatedly turned away from beauty professionals one woman was about to give up the game completely - until she came across Victoria Ramirez on social media.

The TikTok star decided to take on the client - who had been told her lashes were thick enough to support the weight of extensions - at her salon The Lash Addict Boutique in California.

In a viral video Victoria blasted the ""boring b****"" beauticians who said they couldn't give the woman the results she wanted.

She wrote: ""My lash client told me she can't find anyone to make her lashes full enough for her.""

Victoria then zoomed in on her client's sparse lashes before unveiling her VERY dramatic extensions.

3 People said her lashes looked like 'caterpillars'

She added: ""THEN SHE MET ME.""

Addressing her beautician peers Victoria teased in the caption: ""If you a boring b**** & can’t do dramatic lashes just say that!""

Although the video has racked up over 900000 ""likes"" people in the comments argued that the technician had gone overboard.

""Now she has caterpillars on her eyelids"" one wrote.

My lash client told me she can't find anyone to make her lashes full enough for her. THEN SHE MET ME.

Another added: ""I could have used [those lashes] to sweep my floor. Damn!""

""Poor thing probably thinks this looks good"" a third commented.

Jumping to Victoria's defence a fourth pointed out that she was just doing her job.

""You're all forgetting that it's her job to do lash styles the client likes"" they wrote. ""It's not about anyone else's preference but the client.""

For more beauty horror stories people are using MAGIC ERASERS to whiten their teeth on TikTok – but experts warn it’s incredibly dangerous.

This week’s column is about gypsy moths. More precisely it’s about the caterpillar stage of the gypsy moth’s life cycle. In short I don’t like them not even one tiny bit. However begrudgingly I do admire them as they are survivors.

I have no doubt that many readers have had to deal with these crawling nuisances for the last few weeks either sweeping off patios or wrapping tree trunks in burlap. And you have all reached the same conclusion I have: It just does not seem to be making a dent in their population.

So I guess it’s time to discuss this clash of natural events with the intersection of human nature. First the natural events.

These moths were brought to North America about 150 years ago as part of a commercial venture to find an alternative to the cotton industry. Could these caterpillars be harvested of their bristly hair and the material spun into fabric gold? Nope. Didn’t happen. And so the beasts were released into the wild and our backs were collectively turned.

The moths went “Whee we’re free!” and started on a steady and unfettered increase to their overall population. For the first few decades humanity shrugged this off with a big “so what?” Who’s sorry now?

Before I get to the human reaction part of this column let’s take a quick look at the usual life cycle of these creepy-crawlies. It’s pretty straightforward as far as moths go — eggs caterpillars cocoons adults eggs again.

The problem lies within that one stage the caterpillar. Many moth species do not eat in the adult stage so enough energy and protein must be assimilated prior to that miraculous metamorphic change that takes place with the cocoon the changing of all the body cells from a solid to a fluid and then back to a solid but in a much different configuration. This is like saying you and I can eat all we want from age 10 to 18 but then that’s it for the rest of our lives. So glad I’m not a caterpillar.

As the caterpillar grows it keeps shedding its constrictive outer skin sometimes five times. (Each stage is called an instar.) Not only is it now bigger but the colour and adornments change too. And the bigger it gets the more food it eats in a sitting (and the larger the caterpillar poo gets on your patio).

Then it’s a quick snooze inside a cocoon until out comes the adult moth either male or female. The males can fly and do so; the females cannot so they begin the long trek back up the tree to find a suitable site to attract a male and lay their eggs. Once the mating is done and the eggs are laid both male and female moths drop dead. So glad I’m not a moth.

Now here’s the twist: As gypsy moths are introduced to North America they have no natural controls on their populations. No predators plus abundant food makes for an ever-increasing population. However in time something has to give. When 1.2 bajillion caterpillars start feeding on a forest that has only enough leaves for 0.5 kajillion (not sure of my accuracy but you get the drift) it boils down to simple supply and demand.

Without enough food to go around part of the population gets sick and does not develop well maybe not even getting to the cocoon or mating stages. Indeed with enough sick and weak caterpillars out there viruses can spread like wildfire and start picking them off one by one a thousand by a thousand. Sucks to be them but to the survivors it means that next year there will be enough to go round.

This drastic collapse is called a population crash and it happens quite often in Nature. Not all the critters are killed just a huge proportion of them. The survivors survive and start reproducing to build up their numbers and in 10 years or so. Here we go again.

Which at long last brings me to the second part of this dissertation human behaviours. Full transparency here: I am a human and I do not react well toward gypsy moth caterpillars.

We humans like things which we can control such as where to plant the landscape trees and which species are to go where. When something starts to get out of our control mild panic sets in. We seem to be hard-wired that when a situation occurs that’s out of the norm our brain sends out a message: “Somebody Needs To Do Something. Now!”

And this is where I spring into action. Totally ignoring the much larger ecological world of fact and natural unfolding I grab the blow torch. “Die you miserable invading hairy bits of uninvited filth!” After several days of barbecuing caterpillars yet seeing no reduction in the harm being done to my beautiful oak trees I notice my Good Wife’s bemused grin.

Good Wife is a trained entomologist (a studier of insects) and has an annoyingly large amount of common sense. She points out (as she did last year as well if I recall correctly) that I am not killing all the caterpillars just the hapless ones that rest on the tree trunk at blow torch level. The canopy still has thousands of caterpillars each looking down and laughing at me as they finish off another oak leaf.

So what I’m really doing is easing the competition so that the survivors have lots of food and will grow big and healthy and go into the cocoon stage in good health and later emerge to make lots and lots of egg masses.

This kind of thinking I do not want to hear as another propane bottle fizzles empty.

If and this is a big if we all just stood back and let Nature take its course the caterpillars would die back due to overpopulation the trees would rebound next year just as Nature has programmed them to do and all this wringing of hands and bemoaning of events could perhaps be redirected to something that actually matters.

But I am human and there are colonies of big fat juicy caterpillars staring me in the face so it’s off to the hardware store I go for another bottle of propane. “Leave them alone? Let Nature take its course?” Ha I laugh in your face! My mind is set. Futile effort is my middle name."

During the Making Progress program live-streamed June 24 on the city's Facebook page Sullivan and Comery had a casual conversation at a table in City Hall.

Comery previously served as principal of Lowery Middle School. He was instrumental in starting the annual alumni round-up event and also founded the Product of Donaldsonville campaign back in 2014 in response to violence in the community.

The idea sparked from a T-shirt design Comery produced with Lionel Asberry who ran a graphics and photography business on Railroad Avenue. Comery's brother Shannon posted a photo of it on Facebook and the idea took off as a way to promote positivity.

Comery said he and his brother grew up outside of Louisiana. He was born in Texas while Shannon was born in Georgia. He said he found his identity when he moved home to Donaldsonville at age seven.

""The atmosphere for everybody was community"" Sullivan said explaining how families knew each other and looked out for young people.

""When we were coming up there was no way you would pass by someone and not speak"" Sullivan added.

Comery said the community was so close and loving he did not realize he was in poverty until he grew up. When he went to Grambling State he saw the difference.

""I have teachers all the time say they have kids who never crossed the Sunshine Bridge"" Comery said.

Sullivan recalled how he would want seconds at dinner time growing up and his father would give him the food in his plate.

""He sacrificed what he was going to eat for me"" he said. ""You appreciated those things. Not everything was perfect when we were coming up but I'm thankful now for the things that were done.""

They also discussed the possibility of transforming the former West Ascension School campus into an early-education facility and the COVID-19 figures for Ascension Parish.

The mayor also touted the benefits of signing up for Everbridge which alerts residents of announcements from government entities.

Weeks ago the siren at CF Industries was malfunctioning. Donaldsonville Fire Department Chief Adam Gautreaux was able to send out an alert to inform residents through Everbridge.

Toward the end of the discussion they addressed violence in the community.

""The answer is right here in the community. Just like you stepped up I stepped up. There are people out there in the community"" Comery said.

""If there wouldn't have been somebody to pull my coat tail to help me when I fell I wouldn't have been able to do the things I'm doing now"" Sullivan said.

Comery added he has been working with a diverse group from the east side of the parish.

""They're white and black and one thing I'm starting to realize we have in common is that we love our families and want what's best for our communities"" Comery said.

""We will get through this as a community"" he said at the conclusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

213800 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s doubling of the child tax credit.

Every income group in every Connecticut congressional district received a tax cut. Nationwide a typical family of four received a $2000 annual tax cut and a single parent with one child received a $1300 annual tax cut.

1028380 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s doubling of the standard deduction. Thanks to the tax cuts nine out of ten households take the standard deduction which provides tax relief and simplifies the tax filing process.

45200 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s elimination of the Obamacare individual mandate tax. Most households hit with this tax made less than $50000 per year.

Lower utility bills: As a direct result of the TCJA’s corporate tax rate cut Connecticut residents are saving money on utility bills. Lower electric water and gas bills help households and small businesses operating on tight margins. For example at least eight Connecticut utilities reduced their customers’ bills (see below).

Thanks to the tax cuts Connecticut businesses of all sizes are hiring expanding raising pay and increasing employee benefits:

Charter Communications Inc. (Stamford Connecticut) – Base wage raised to $15 per hour; commitment to hire over 20000 employees by 2020:

With the resources and investment confidence resulting from historic tax reform legislation and the FCC’s removal of the 1930’s era regulatory framework for internet service Charter is increasing our investment in our workforce by ensuring all employees are paid a minimum wage of at least $15 per hour including target commissions within the next year.

In addition the reforms in Washington are allowing Charter to increase its capital investment including in its broadband network.

Thomas Hooker Brewery (Bloomfield Connecticut) – The brewery used savings from the tax cut to expand the business and create new jobs:

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says a federal tax credit for small-scale breweries distilleries and wineries has helped create jobs in Connecticut.

The tax credit for small scale alcohol producers was initially part of the 2017 Trump tax cut. It’s been extended in the bipartisan federal budget passed by Congress last month. Blumenthal says he opposed Trump’s tax cuts to big business but this particular tax cut is for small businesses and is a job creator.

“These craft breweries put the savings back into their businesses. They create jobs. They produce more beer. They meet demand. And they provide good value.”

Blumenthal spoke at Thomas Hooker Brewery in Bloomfield. Brewery owner Curt Cameron agrees that he’s putting 100% of his tax cut back into his business “in our case a brand-new pizza kitchen which is an offshoot of our existing business. It will create at least seven jobs immediately.”

If the tax break had not been extended craft breweries like Thomas Hooker would have faced a federal excise tax increase of 400% this year. – Dec. 31 2019 WSHU article.

Shortway Brewing Co. (Newport Connecticut) — Increasing wages and hiring new employees:

Mr. Shortway said the new tax plan along with the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act also passed last year have already helped the brewery save money. The craft beverage act greatly reduced excise taxes on small-scale brewers and the tax plan has additional provisions designed to help small businesses.

Mr. Shortway said he was able to give his employees a small raise and hire more workers as a result of the tax savings. He said although it is a bit early to know what the long-term impact of the tax plan will be he expects it will keep helping going forward.

“Growth is picking up” he said. – May 11 2018 News-Times article excerpt

The Travelers Companies Inc. (Hartford Connecticut) — $1000 bonuses for 14000 employees with a base salary less than $75000:

Today comprehensive U.S. tax reform has been signed into law. One objective of the legislation is to spur economic growth and therefore the U.S. economy.

In addition to benefiting from economic growth Travelers will benefit directly from the legislation in two important ways. First like all companies our corporate tax rate will decrease from 35% to 21%. Second the legislation will level the playing field for U.S. insurers by eliminating a loophole that foreign insurers have used to our disadvantage for decades to move their U.S. profits offshore to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.

One of the opportunities all of these benefits create for us is to make additional investments in our business. I shared at a recent all-employee meeting that our vision as it relates to investment and innovation is to strengthen our competitive advantages with two goals in mind: be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers.

The leadership team decided that given our confidence in our business and the way we are successfully positioned for the opportunities ahead we should start making additional investments immediately. We also came to the conclusion that we should use the opportunity to make our first investment in our most valuable asset and greatest competitive advantage — our people.

I’m pleased to announce that we will be giving approximately 14000 employees with a base salary of $75000 per year or less and who meet our performance expectations a special one-time bonus of $1000. The bonus will be paid in January to then current employees. Eligible employees will hear more shortly.

In addition while we have only a small number of U.S.-based employees making less than $15 an hour we will increase their hourly wage to $15. – The Travelers Companies Inc. note to employees

Their shared ties run deep as they established themselves as model franchises in their respective sports. These days NBA legend Magic Johnson is a Dodgers part-owner while the team’s CMO Lon Rosen started his career working for the NBA’s Lakers and NHL’s Kings. The franchises are the reigning NBA and MLB world champions having won titles a mere 16 days apart in October.

On Friday the relationship went to the next level with news that Philip Anschutz was selling his 27% personal stake in the purple-and-gold and the buyers are Dodgers co-owners Mark Walter and Todd Boehly. The deal values the Lakers at roughly $5 billion—close to Sportico’s valuation of the Lakers at $5.14 billion in January third highest in the NBA behind the Knicks ($5.42 billion) and Warriors ($5.21 billion). Jeanie Buss will continue to run the Lakers through her family’s trust which owns 66% of the team.

The Lakers and Dodgers are two of the eight most valuable sports franchises in North America. Shared ownership could take both clubs to even greater heights off the court and field as they tackle the shifting climates in broadcasting venue experience and sponsorships.

“Great teams in a great market is a pretty unbeatable combination” said media consultant Ed Desser.

The deal is additive to the Lakers in that they are gaining successful sports team owners and entrepreneurs while also continuing their relationship with Anschutz through his AEG sports empire which owns and operates the Staples Center home to the Lakers as well as the LA Kings which are also owned by AEG.

The Lakers extended their lease at the downtown arena last month with AEG. The $375 million venue opened in 1999. “From the very beginning AEG proved to be more than just the best arena operators in our industry and on a daily basis they continue demonstrating why they are the best partner an organization could ask for” Buss said in a statement announcing the lease extension.

The minority stake sale still needs approval from the NBA Board of Governors but the Lakers should get an accomplished pair of new owners. Boehly and Walters bought the Dodgers out of bankruptcy in 2012 for $2.15 billion and have turned the club into a juggernaut on and off the field. The team’s $250 million payroll this season is $50 million higher than any other club and they’ve rattled off eight straight division titles and appeared in three of the past four World Series.

“Mark Walters and Todd Boehly have shown that not only are they real savvy sports team operators but in the case of Todd entertainment and media as well” Marc Ganis president of sports business consulting firm Sportscorp said in an interview. “The Lakers also now have two people who are at the forefront of capitalization in sports and entertainment.”

Boehly is the founder of Greenwich Connecticut-based investment firm Eldridge Industries and is currently behind four SPACs including one closing a deal for ticket reseller Vivid Seats. Another Boehly-backed blank check company walked away this month from a deal for sports data provider Sportradar.

Content is king right now in sports and it is hard to beat the Lakers and Dodgers in basketball and baseball. Both were signed with Time Warner Cable re-branded as Spectrum after its sale to Charter Communications and the teams rank among the top two or three annually for local TV viewership nationwide—and they have the blockbuster contracts to show for it. The Dodgers 25-year $8.35 billion TV deal kicked off in 2013 while the Lakers agreement signed in 2011 is worth an estimated $4 billion over 20 years.

The teams are locked into those deals so any kind of combined rights or change in approach is a “long-term proposition” according to Desser who consulted for the Lakers for their 2011 blockbuster Time Warner deal and on the Time Warner side for their pact with the Dodgers.

No doubt the ownership groups of these two storied franchises are playing the long game and that means streaming. The Dodgers are a national brand and the Lakers are one of the NBA’s most popular exports. “These two teams in the second-largest market in the country can be a very powerful combination” Ganis said.",,,,,,,,,

MUSEUM FUN: The Discovery Cube children’s scientific museum in Los Angeles on opening day.

By Laurie Hanson

Future-forward initiatives inspire educators students and all committed to lifelong learning at the Discovery Cube children’s science museums in Sylmar and Santa Ana.

For more than 35 years they have offered Southern California’s families and kids’ hands-on scientific education through four core initiatives including STEM proficiency early childhood education healthy living and environmental stewardship.

“We are really excited about our newest exhibits that debuted for the first-time last month like Festivals of STEM at Discovery Cube Los Angeles” said V.P. of Marketing Erin Warady who has been with them since 2020. “Sponsored by the Chevron Corporation Festival of STEM features five STEM-themed areas and 10+ hands-on activities and adventures highlighting the invention and inspiration of STEM-based innovators and industries.”

At the height of the pandemic in spring 2020 they launched the Discovery Cube Connect an interactive web-based STEM platform which connects parents educators and students with hands-on STEM activities and resources.

“All content on the Discovery Cube Connect site has been rated and reviewed by parents and educators available free of charge for young learners at home or in the classroom” Warady added.

During the pandemic both museums in Los Angeles and Orange County have undergone extensive renovations including new health and safety measures plus adoption of COVID-safe guidelines and protocols according to Warady.

“Each campus location has several new ‘safe science’ installations including a MERV13 HVAC filtration system with UV lights hands-free restrooms onsite cleaning crews contactless ticketing system and upgrades to the paint carpet and much more” she said. “Both museum locations underwent extensive interior and exterior renovations totaling more than $10 million which were unveiled during our reopening in May 2021. Part of reopening highlights include several new state-of-the-art STEM exhibits immersive science adventures and interactive gameplay for kids K-6 grade.”

The Orange County campus has four new STEM-themed areas with more than 15 new interactive exhibits while Los Angeles debuted five new themed areas and 10+ new interactive exhibits. Both locations also feature many of the STEM favorites as before including Inspector Training Course Early Learners Planetary Research Station and more according to Warady.

Popular exhibits in Santa Ana’s location include the Physics Lab which features hands on wooden race cars on a track the Science of Hockey Lab which explores what it’s scientifically like to be on ice the Organic’s Waste Lab (OWL) which demonstrates the environmentally conscious usefulness of compost for plant growth the Dino Quest exhibit with life-sized outdoor dinosaur and skeleton models for up close explorations and the Early Learner’s exhibit which allows young children hands on exploration activities such as rock climbing and telescope viewing.

Upcoming events at Discovery Cube in Santa Ana include Camp Discovery running from June 28 to August 6 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. offered both in person and virtually this year. At this camp kids learn about animals dinosaurs outer space and all things STEAM (science technology engineering art and math). Back by popular demand is the Code Constructors Camp a full-week virtual camp which demonstrates what it is like to learn code and be a programmer. Also a family-friendly event offered is The Mega Bubblefest and Laser Show held July 2 at 10 a.m. to July 18 at 5 p.m. at the Santa Ana location.

Something unique the Discovery Cube is offering families and groups are onsite sleepovers which includes access to exhibits interactive activities 3D movie snack and continental breakfast with complimentary access to the Cube the following day.

Science is also brought to life through field trips or offered on location in classrooms at schools throughout Southern California through the Discovery Cube’s educational outreach programs which offer scientific problem-solving and exploratory learning opportunities. Their unique Environmental Program in partnership with Orange County Waste and Recycling offers a free on school site assembly for 5th and 6th graders educating on the importance of going “Green.”

Children under age 5 are not left out either. As part of the Discovery Cube’s early childhood educational efforts parents are given tips to help their little ones learn grow and play in scientific ways.

Both the Los Angeles County and Orange County museums are currently open Thursdays thru Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Due to limited capacity patrons are encouraged to purchase tickets in advance online at www.discoverycube.org.

The community can support the Discovery Cube and the Discovery Science Foundation in through family memberships volunteering online store purchases or public and private donations.

So Powell was asked yesterday if he sees the possibility of 1970’s style inflation. He of course said no but his problem and that of the Fed takes place if we just see 1980’s and 1990’s inflation. In the 1980’s core CPI averaged 6.1%. In the 1990’s it averaged 3.2% only to ‘slow’ further to 2.2% in the aughts. By the way core inflation averaged 6.4% in the 1970’s where the high print was 11.7% in 1975 and the peak in the cycle was 13.6% in June 1980.

Zero short rates QE running at a $1.4 Trillion annualized pace and a 1.47% 10 yr yield does not mix well with a 3% inflation rate on any consistent basis. At least a level of 2% the markets have been trained like a dog by the Fed but even at 2% the Fed’s current policy is way off sides relative to rates are now. If we had a fed funds rate of 3-4% and a 10 yr yield just above that we’d at least have a market shock absorber to any inflation surprise. That no longer exists globally.

Those that think that the excessive rise in inflation is just a temporary thing seem to be relying on used car prices and lumber missing what is going on everywhere else where every day there seems to be more stories about price increases. If you didn’t see in yesterday’s WSJ “The global chip shortage is pushing up prices of items such as laptops and printers and is threatening to do the same to other top selling devices including smartphones. Price increases are snowballing their way through suppliers and key materials in chip making.”

“A laptop geared toward videogamers – made by Taiwanese manufacturer ASUSTek Computer Inc – that Amazon lists as its bestseller rose from $900 to $950 this month according to Keepa a site that tracks prices. The cost of a popular HP Inc. Chromebook rose to $250 from $220 at the beginning of June. HP has raised consumer PC prices by 8% and printer prices by more than 20% in a year according to Bernstein Research…Digi-Key Electronics one of the US’s largest electronic component distributors has raised prices of semi related components by roughly 15% this year…Certain components now cost as much as 40% more.”

There is a story on BN today saying “US restaurants faced with higher food and labor costs are raising menu prices at a much faster pace than historical rates insistent on preserving profits after an arduous year. From local restaurants to national chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill owners have boosted prices by as much as 5% in the past few weeks alone. Even at fast food companies that were locked in price wars just a couple of years ago to win over cost conscious customers increases aren’t taboo anymore.” They interviewed Andrew Koumi an owner of 6 Green Market Cafe’s in Tampa Florida and he said he “isn’t too worried about standing out with his price increases because ‘everyone’s doing it. Some people are doing it really drastically.”

The inflation breakeven in the 5 yr TIPS has rebounded by 9 bps in just the past two days after last week’s FOMC meeting induced drop as people this week question the resolve of the Fed to remove its extreme policy in a timely fashion relative to the economic realities.

Shifting to the June global PMI’s ahead of the US one in a few hrs Japan’s manufacturing and services index fell 1 pt m/o/m with manufacturing slipping by 1.5 pts while services rose .7 pts but is still below 50 at 47.2 in response to the still uneven reopenings. Markit said “Panel members commonly associated disruption to operating conditions to ongoing Covid restrictions coupled with severe supply chain pressures notably for manufacturers.” Businesses though became more optimistic “that business conditions would improve in the year ahead and to a greater extent than that seen in May” as the vaccine rollout ramps up and more restrictions are eased.

In Australia their composite index fell 2 pts m/o/m with both components lower. Markit said similar to the Japan commentary “Renewed movement restrictions in the Victorian state and supply constraints stood out as two key reasons weighing on the growth momentum for Australia.” Stagflationary situations are global.

In the Eurozone its manufacturing and services PMI composite index rose to 59.2 from 57.1 and was all led by services as the manufacturing component was unchanged m/o/m but still a growth driver. Services was helped by “the easing of virus fighting measures in many eurozone member states notably in hospitality.” Here were the comments on inflation: “Average input prices rose at a rate exceeded only once (in September 2000) over the 23 yr survey history. A record increase in manufacturers’ material prices was accompanied by the steepest increase in service costs since July 2008 the latter reflecting widespread reports of higher supplier prices increased fuel and transport costs plus rising wage pressures.” As for the ability to pass this on? “Average prices charged for goods and services meanwhile rose at by far the fastest pace since comparable data for both sectors were first available in 2002 with prices rising in each sector at rates not exceeded for approximately two decades.” And the ECB is still conducting emergency QE on top of regular QE on top of negative rate policy.

In the UK its composite index fell 1.2 pts m/o/m with both components lower m/o/m although the index is still above 60 at 61.7. Optimism remained about the outlook but did moderate to a 5 month low. As for prices “The rate of input cost inflation accelerated for the 5th month running and was the joint-fastest on record equal with that seen in June 2008. While inflation continued to be led by the manufacturing sector service providers also posted a marked increase in input prices. In turn the rate of output price inflation hit a fresh record high for the 2nd month running.” The Bank of England meets tomorrow.

Inflation breakevens are bouncing too in Europe in response and I will say this I’m amazed at the broad level of nonchalance on inflation and that just magically in the face of the most widespread inflation pressures being seen in 40+ years that it is just going to all of a sudden flame out back to pre Covid trends.

Finally mortgage apps were up slightly w/o/w but remain sharply lower y/o/y. With the 7 bps increase in the average 30 yr mortgage rate to 3.18% purchases rose .6% w/o/w but are still down 14.2% y/o/y. Refi’s were up by 2.8% w/o/w but down 9.4% y/o/y. We know crystal clear what is going on in the housing market so I’m not going to pontificate again here ahead of new home sales later today.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWF0dC1jaGFuZGxlci1yZWZsZWN0cy1vbi1ncmFjZS1oZS1yZWNlaXZlZC1hZnRlci1jb250cm92ZXJzeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy,"Home News Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy

Matt Chandler has opened up about what he learned about grace and accountability after being restored to the pulpit following a tumultuous period in 2022 in which he took a leave of absence from teaching and preaching at The Village Church in Flower Mound Texas.

In August 2022 Chandler announced to The Village Church congregation which he has led since 2002 that he had an inappropriate online relationship with a woman and would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from preaching and teaching.

Though the relationship was not sexual or romantic Chandler said church elders deemed the messages exchanged over Instagram ""unguarded and unwise"" and ""revealed something unhealthy in me.""

""We cannot be a church where anyone is above the scriptures and above the high heavenly call into Christ Jesus"" Chandler said adding he agreed with the elder's assessment. ""The Word of God holds me to a certain standard. And I fell short.""

He was restored to the pulpit a little over three months later following a ""profound time of healing.""

In an interview with The Christian Post the 49-year-old husband and father-of-three reflected on that time and said that when he ""stumbled"" he was instantly met with grace and accountability from those around him.

""The thing about [2022] in particular was that the kind of culture we had tried to build here — one of accountability and a higher standard for a person in public ministry — held strong"" Chandler explained. ""When I stumbled I was met with both grace and accountability.""

For Chandler — who has made messages on God's grace a hallmark of his ministry — the experience solidified the notion that grace is not an abstract concept but a tangible force that exists alongside the weight of accountability.

He credited his church's transparent handling of the controversy with allowing his congregation to witness the reality of both concepts in action; they saw firsthand he said that while grace offers forgiveness there is often a price for missteps.

In the aftermath Chandler observed that the church community became more willing to confess their struggles taking proactive steps to address what he described as ""little lions"" or small issues that could grow into significant problems if left unchecked.

""What that produced in our congregation is another visible picture that that grace is real and that there is still at times a payment for stumbling that is costly in other areas"" he said.

""We have seen since people are more apt to confess more quickly … we have seen a tremendous amount of trust in the processes we have in place to deal with those kinds of things in the lives of people. And so that's been the fruit of that.""

Reflecting on the unique pressures of pastoral ministry Chandler who also serves as executive director of the church-planting network Acts 29 spoke candidly about the loneliness and mental health challenges often faced by spiritual leaders.

Chandler previously served as president of Acts 29 replacing Mark Driscoll who was later disqualified from leadership due to ""ungodly and disqualifying behavior.""

""I think I'm an outlier on this but I've never bought into that a pastor can't be close friends with the guys that he does ministry with"" he said.

Though acknowledging that stories of betrayal and sabotage from within the Church aren't uncommon Chandler said that throughout his ministry he's chosen to cultivate meaningful relationships with those around him.

""I've been involved at the highest level with church planning stuff the number of stories of men being betrayed and sabotaged by other people in the church or other staff members in the church is a very real thing. I'm just not built personality wise to want to do this by myself.""

At The Village Church — a Southern Baptist congregation — Chandler is one of three lead pastors. While his influence might be more visible due to his pulpit presence he emphasized that he has no greater vote in decision-making.

""I have done life deeply with a group of five guys that are on staff with me"" he said. ""Two of those relationships are over 15 years going now and the other ones are right at a decade. I have chosen to not give in to the 'I'm going to carry this thing by myself.' I'm going to invite guys into my life.""

For Chandler this network of trust has been critical particularly when it comes to the ups and downs of the ministry.

""I would encourage guys as best they can to create a strong circle of trust where they don't have to be the hero but can be human. And I say that because they are human"" he advised.

The pastor recently released his first book since returning to the pulpit The Overcomers highlighting how Revelation can help Christians find their ""identity and purpose in God's plan."" He cautioned against creating a culture where pastors are seen as infallible.

""If you create a world where you're the Messiah where you have all the answers you're making an already difficult situation impossible"" he stressed. ""I would encourage any pastor … to begin to create slowly but surely a circle of trust for him that's deeply honest and vulnerable for the good of his own soul.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9hZHZpY2UvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9jYXJvbHluLWhheC1pbi1sYXdzLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWNodXJjaC1hdHRlbmRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advice | Carolyn Hax: In-laws stalk the live stream to check couple's attendance at church,"Hi Carolyn: Our church started streaming its services online during the pandemic and this continues today.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them.

Jessie Danielson it’s just “shameful.”

Companies large and small have been barring workers in Colorado from applying for remote work positions in what appear to be efforts to bypass a state law mandating companies provide salary ranges when posting job openings in the state.

“This is a remote job except that it is not eligible to be performed in Colorado” a listing for an account manager position with short-term vacation rental giant Airbnb says.

“We are seeking applicants from the Boston area and from any state except Colorado” reads another recent job listing this one from Denver-based tech education and shared office space provider Galvanize.

The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act took effect Jan. 1. The purpose of the legislation is to combat gender-based pay gaps in the workplace in part by providing workers with hard numbers about who is making what for the work they are doing.

“The companies that are fighting to avoid this pay transparency are simply working very hard to avoid this Colorado law so they can continue to underpay women” said Danielson one of the bill’s four primary sponsors.

An Airbnb representative did not return an email seeking comment Thursday. A Galvanize spokesperson provided the following statement from the company:

“That posting verbiage was an error. The job is actually a Boston-based role and therefore the candidate would need to be physically in the office.”

When it comes to future job postings for remote work Galvanize’s policy is under review the spokesperson said.

Danielson’s strong criticism comes after a Reddit post last month slammed the Colorado shunning practice and urged naming and shaming companies that are doing it in their listings.

That thread helped inspire Aaron Batilo a software engineer who lives in Commerce City to launch a website dedicated to cataloging such postings. As of Thursday afternoon ColoradoExcluded.com had links to 193 job listings for remote work positions from 98 companies.

Batilo has been a remote worker since before the COVID-19 pandemic something that has afforded him better pay from companies based in Seattle and the San Francisco area. He noted worker demand for remote positions is reaching new heights in the wake of the virus.

“I do think it is kind of taking advantage of the opportunity because you might have someone living in a lower cost of living state and you might be expecting to pay them less” Batilo said of companies leaving salary ranges off their online postings. “I am personally of the opinion that with remote work you should not do location-based pay.”

Increased awareness has boosted the number of listings pouring into Batilo’s submission-based site. 9News first covered the job posting practice in late May speaking to Batilo. He was also featured in a Wall Street Journal story last week. At the time his site featured listings from 46 companies.

“These companies are already aware of their salary range. They already have a budget. I would prefer that they would share that” Batilo said.

The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act does outline penalties for companies that don’t share salary ranges or violate the law in other ways such as by not notifying all of their employees about internal job openings.

The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment has a complaint form that can be accessed online. Companies found to be in violation can be fined $500 to $10000 per offense.

The labor department has one active investigation into a company accused of excluding Coloradans from remote job openings said Scott Moss the director of the labor department’s division of labor standards and statistics. A decision is expected to be issued in that case shortly.

The department has fielded dozens of additional complaints but none of those have risen to the level of a full investigation yet. With a relatively new law the department’s approach is to focus on educating employers first before resorting to fines. An employer-focused fact sheet is available at coloradolaborlaw.gov.

“Where we have found a violation we give the employer a period to bring the posting into compliance and if they do we waive the fine” Moss said. “We have a 100% success rate when finding a violation of the company promptly fixing it.”

Moss emphasizes that despite the media attention the labor department’s internal research shows that remote work ads barring Colorado applicants are relatively rare. After tracking a random sample of 203 job posts on Indeed covering both companies based in Colorado and those headquartered outside the state the department found just one using language barring Colorado applicants.

Moss said that among the 50 largest employers in the state compliance has been impressive and improved every month so far in 2021.

The labor department’s powers have limits. Companies with no physical presence in Colorado — meaning no employees currently working in the state — aren’t subject to the law Moss said. With that in mind listings that bar Colorado applicants are “puzzling and self-defeating” Moss said.

“They are just undercutting their own talent base to their own detriment by excluding a high-skill labor force state” he said.

For Oisin Hanrahan CEO of Denver-based home services marketplace company Angi combating the gender pay gap has been and remains an important goal. The idea of writing job posting to specifically exclude Colorado workers in an effort to obscure pay data is something he said his company would never do. Angi has roughly 4500 employees across the country including 1600 in Colorado. The company is giving many of its employees the option to work remotely even after it reopens offices.

“I think that it’s unfortunate that this measure has essentially got some pretty poor unintended consequences and I think it’s a poor workaround by companies that are deciding that’s the approach they want to take” Hanrahan said. “I think the more we can do to shine a light on areas where we have a problem the more likely it is that we’ll fix that.”

The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act has already overcome a legal challenge from the Rocky Mountain Association of Recruiters Danielson noted. She maintains that the law does not constitute an undue burden on employers and in fact she has heard from companies that say that listing salary ranges is helping them attract better-qualified candidates.

“The public was demanding and still is demanding that the legislature in Colorado do everything possible to stop discriminatory practices that lead to gender gaps in pay” she said. “I’m open to ideas on working with the (labor) department) on more options for enforcement.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jYW5uZXMtbGlvbnMtMjAyMS1hbGwtdGhlLWFwYWMtd2lubmVycy80NzA1MDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cannes Lions 2021: All the APAC winners | Advertising,"The fifth and final release of Cannes Lions 2021 winners Friday evening saw Ogilvy Pakistan and Telenor add a Gold Lion to their collection of Grand Prix awards from earlier in the week while two APAC markets Indonesia and Bangladesh won their first metal of the festival.

“The sky’s the limit” she said on the growth of this new volunteer program. “If we can get a couple of dozen that would be such a positive thing to have that in our parks.”

There are nearly 30 parks in the city’s portfolio totaling nearly 1000 acres of land. The largest of its parks is the 200-plus-acre Harbin Park which is in the process of being renovated. But there are only six maintenance laborers that help maintain the parks so the ambassadors help make sure park properties are cleaned up but also report immediate needs like broken equipment.

The volunteer job is “pretty simple” said Bruner. He walks around the parks picks up trash if he sees it checks for issues and talks with people.

“It’s giving back” he said. “It’s only two to three hours a week I’m actually at the parks doing stuff.”

Last fall Kim Kent retired after being self-employed doing senior care for the past 10 years. The 62-year-old wanted to volunteer in some fashion then she read about the Parks Ambassador program in one of the city’s publications and thought “This was perfect. This is what I’m going to do.”

She focuses a lot of her time helping at FurField ― she adopted a dog last July and lives a two-minute drive from the dog park. And socializing is what she enjoys and believes helps out the parks program the most.

“I socialize every time I’m there. You meet someone new and talk to them” Kent said. “There’s nothing really super required of you. It’s fun and you meet a lot of people. I meet new people every single time I go. I really love the socialization of it.”

She said a lot of people come from outside the city and she references them to the FurField Facebook page.

Mays said the department has a “very robust and well-established” volunteer program and the city has added new park land in recent years. These volunteers are everyday users of the parks and are “our eyes and ears” she said.

“They’re proud users of our parks. They take ownership of what we do” she said. “We definitely have to embrace the people that our advocates and put them in that role where we give them that for us.”

The Park Ambassador program is managed by the city’s volunteer coordinator Brittany Theilman. She can be reached at 513-896-8439 or btheilman@fairfieldoh.gov.

Klik untuk follow WhatsApp Channel & Google News

Disukai dan dicintai seseorang dengan tulus adalah suatu hal yang patut disyukuri karena segala perhatian dan kepeduliannya memang tulus dari dasar hati dan tak berniat jahat. Akan tetapi beda ceritanya kalau perasaan cinta itu sudah berubah menjadi obsesi. Yang tadinya nyaman malah berubah menjadi mengganggu dan menakutkan karena obsesinya untuk memiliki.

Maka dari itu kali ini kita akan membahas beberapa tandanya supaya jangan sampai kamu terobsesi dan menakuti orang yang kamu cintai. Simak baik-baik ya!

1. Kamu stalking semua media sosialnya setiap hari Ilustrasi menggunakan HP(pexels.com/Andrea Piacquadio) Tanda pertama yang perlu kamu waspadai bahwa cintamu berubah menjadi obsesi ialah jika kamu stalking semua akun media sosialnya setiap hari. Sesekali ingin tahu kabar terbarunya dari media sosial orang yang kita suka merupakan suatu hal yang wajar akan tetapi kalau melakukannya setiap hari maka sudah jelas kalau itu bentuk dari obsesi. Karena kamu ingin tahu segala detail tentang kehidupannya dengan stalking.

2. Ingin benar-benar dekat dengannya memakai cara apapun yang kamu bisa Ilustrasi melirik(pexels.com/Budgeron Bach) Jika rasa cintamu sudah sampai pada tahap ingin dekat dengannya bagaimanapun caranya maka ini juga bisa jadi merupakan tanda kalau cintamu telah berubah menjadi obsesi untuk memiliki. Karena kamu ingin selalu menempel dan bersamanya sepanjang waktu. Bahkan mungkin tak peduli lagi pada harga dirimu sendiri dan secara terang-terangan ingin masuk ke dalam circle pertemanannya supaya bisa dekat dia.

4. Terang-terangan bersikap posesif Ilustrasi pemaksaan(pexels.com/Alex Green) Misalnya kamu dengan blak-blakan tidak mau kalau dia diantar oleh orang lain selain dirimu lalu tidak senang jika dia dekat dengan yang lain ketika ada kamu di sampingnya. Jika seperti ini maka perasaan cintamu padanya sudah tidak tulus seperti dulu lagi karena yang tulus gak bakal posesif malahan kamu terobsesi agar dia selalu bersamamu dan menjadi milikmu.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2t1cGFuZy50cmlidW5uZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L2R1Z2Fhbi1wZW1idW51aGFuLWRpLWthYnVwYXRlbi1yb3RlLW5kYW8taXN0cmktcGVsYWt1LXRpZHVyaS1rb3JiYW4tY2ludGEtc2VnaXRpZ2EtYmVydWp1bmctbWF1dNIBjQFodHRwczovL2t1cGFuZy50cmlidW5uZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wNi8yNi9kdWdhYW4tcGVtYnVudWhhbi1kaS1rYWJ1cGF0ZW4tcm90ZS1uZGFvLWlzdHJpLXBlbGFrdS10aWR1cmkta29yYmFuLWNpbnRhLXNlZ2l0aWdhLWJlcnVqdW5nLW1hdXQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dugaan Pembunuhan di Kabupaten Rote Ndao Istri Pelaku Tiduri Korban Cinta Segitiga Berujung Maut,"Proses reka ulang kasus dugaan pembunuhan di kabupaten Rote Ndao.

This Cisco ASA vulnerability is cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that is tracked as CVE-2020-3580.

Cisco first disclosed the vulnerability and issued a fix in October 2020. However the initial patch for CVE-2020-3580 was incomplete and a further fix was released in April 2021.

This vulnerability can allow an unauthenticated threat actor to send targeted phishing emails or malicious links to a user of a Cisco ASA device to execute JavaScript commands in the user's browser.

""A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information"" says Cisco's advisory.

Hackers exploit recently published PoC exploit

After a vulnerability has been fixed and enough time has been given for devices to be upgraded security researchers commonly publish proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to share how organizations detect and prevent associated attacks.

On Thursday researchers from Positive Technologies Offensive Team published a PoC exploit for the Cisco ASA CVE-2020-3580 vulnerability on Twitter.

The released exploit will display a JavaScript alert in the user's browser when they visit a specially crafted malicious webpage. However the malicious webpage could have executed other JavaScript commands to perform malicious activity.

Soon after the PoC was released Tenable reported that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerability on affected devices but did not disclose what malicious activity was being performed.

""Tenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild"" said Tenable.

As threat actors are now actively exploiting the vulnerability it is crucial for administrators to immediately patch vulnerable Cisco ASA devices so threat actors cannot exploit them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcndpY2hidWxsZXRpbi5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNi8yNi9yZXllcy1ib3hpbmctZ3ltLW9wZW5zLWRvd250b3duLW5vcndpY2gvNTM1NTMzNTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTO GALLERY Reyes Boxing Gym opens in downtown Norwich,"NEWS

Tenable experts published an alert about the availability of the PoC exploit for the XSS they said that after Positive Technologies published it other researchers are chasing bug bounties for this issue. Tenable also warned of attacks in the wild exploiting the CVE-2020-3580 flaw.

“Shortly after Mikhail Klyuchnikov a researcher at Positive Technologies also tweeted that other researchers are chasing bug bounties for this vulnerability. Tenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild.” reads the alert published by Tenable. alert. “With this new information Tenable recommends that organizations prioritize patching CVE-2020-3580.”

Tenable researchers explained that successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the interface and access sensitive information.

Researchers pointed out that in a real attack scenario successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to trick an administrative user to login and navigate to the webpage where he implanted the malicious code.

“To exploit any of these vulnerabilities an attacker would need to convince “a user of the interface” to click on a specially crafted link. Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the interface and access sensitive browser-based information.” continues Tenable.

Organizations have to install security updates that address the flaw to prevent attacks exploiting the issue.

The ad wars in the New York City mayor’s race are officially on.

The city comptroller Scott M. Stringer is kicking off his first television ad campaign this week marking the beginning of a new intense and expensive phase of the race eight weeks out from the June 22 primary that is likely to determine the next mayor of New York.

While other lower-profile Democratic candidates — Shaun Donovan the former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Raymond J. McGuire a former Citigroup executive — have already been advertising on television Mr. Stringer’s new buy will be the most significant on-air expenditure of any of the top-polling candidates to date.

After months of campaigning by Zoom and increasingly at in-person events the candidates are moving toward pricey on-air advertising signaling the start of an aggressive chapter in the race designed to capture the attention of voters who have yet to tune in to the most consequential mayoral contest in a generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaughan Jr. was a senior atmospheric scientist at NASA during the space race and later an accomplished academic but as with so many aging Americans time and technology had sapped him of some of his savvy especially online.

Computers made him feel “like a duck out of water” his son Steve Vaughan said. So when Steve was sorting through the elder Mr. Vaughan’s papers after his death at 90 in December he was unsettled by what he found on his father’s final credit card bill.

The first item was familiar: $11.82 at the local Chick-fil-A in Huntsville Ala. But every other charge on the first page and there were dozens of them was to the firm that processes online Republican campaign contributions WinRed. Over four months last year Mr. Vaughan had made 400 donations totaling nearly $11500 — to Donald J. Trump Mitch McConnell Tim Scott Steve Scalise and many others.

The sum was far beyond the realm of his financial ability his son said and sure enough he soon discovered handwritten notes outlining what appeared to be his father’s call disputing the charges with his credit card company. He is still seething at the avalanche of charges and “what they did to a 90-year-old” just before his death.",,,,,,,,,

The United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County is collecting school supplies so teachers and students can kick off the school year ready for success.

The Write Start Project started on June 21 and continues until July 30.

“We know that teachers are the backbone to education here in our community” said Brandyn Moore-Rodriguez with United Way. “We also know that teachers spent a lot of their own personal dollars each year to fund their classrooms by supporting our students and whatnot. So we thought it was a unique opportunity to provide a back to school project that supported our teachers as well as our students.”

The collected school supplies will go to teachers in San Antonio ISD and Schertz Cibolo Universal City ISD.

Moore-Rodriguez said the wish list includes classroom necessities like pens pencils and paper but also items teachers need like dry-erase markers Clorox wipes and Ziploc bags.

United Way has six drop-off locations throughout the county.

They also need volunteers to help organize and distribute supplies in August.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Michigan Department of Transportation late Sunday issued a notice saying I-94 the last freeway still shuttered after storms Friday and Saturday overwhelmed pump stations was closed in Dearborn and Detroit between Greenfield and Interstate 75.

""While temporary generators are working at three of the pump houses on I-94 the water flows back onto the freeway as the local creeks and rivers are cresting and there is nowhere for additional water to go"" MDOT said in a statement.

MDOT cameras Monday morning revealed lower water levels along the highway though I-94 at Lonyo remained water covered at mid-morning with personnel towing vehicles.

Spokeswoman Diane Cross said the freeway is beginning to dry up because the rain has stayed away and the water levels of the creeks and rivers that take in the interstate's storm water have fallen.

""Since we didn't get much more rain the local rivers and creeks are starting to subside a little bit and that has helped by giving us a place to send the water"" she said. ""The Ecorse Creek and the lower Rouge River just couldn't take any more water but now they've subsided a little we're able to pump more water off.""

Cross said the process to get the freeway reopened has multiple steps and will take some time. She also said it won't be done all at once but in sections of I-94.

""As the water starts to recede on the freeway we have to get all of the stranded vehicles towed and we have to get all of the debris cleaned up"" she said. There were more than two dozen vehicles that had to be towed by Michigan State Police in most recent section to be cleared Cross said.

""Then we'll have to have the roadway inspected because that water has been sitting there (since Friday night) and we have to see if there's been any damage"" she said. "" They'll have to determine whether any repairs will have to be made before it opens.""

Currently eastbound I-94 is closed between Greenfield and West Grand Boulevard on the Dearborn-Detroit border and westbound I-94 is closed from Interstate 96 to Greenfield she said.

Michigan State Police tweeted Sunday that drivers who abandoned cars along the freeway can call the Metro South Post at (734) 287-5000 for help locating their vehicle.

The risk for heavy rain continues Monday and Tuesday.

The weather service on Sunday issued a flood warning from Monday afternoon to Thursday morning for the Grand River near Comstock in west Michigan. The river was at 108 feet; flood stage is 12 feet and the river was expected to rise about that late Monday evening and crest at 12.4 feet Tuesday evening the weather service said. Minor flooding was expected.

Meanwhile a hazardous weather outlook is in effect for much of lower Michigan. Scattered storms are expected especially south of Interstate 96 and flooding could occur near rivers and smaller creeks and streams as runoff continued from the earlier storms.

Rainfall up to 6.5 inches Friday night into Saturday in Metro Detroit overwhelmed the city of Detroit's water and sewage operations leading to widespread flooding. Abandoned vehicles littered the freeways homes and businesses flooded and thousands were without power. No fatalities or injuries have been reported from the flooding according to Michigan State Police.

""Any extra additional rainfall will likely make any current flooding that is happening worse"" said Megan Varcie meteorologist for the National Weather Service in White Lake Township.

More: Michigan cities with the most rainfall

""It's hard to determine where they will be just because the thunderstorms can develop anywhere across southeast Michigan"" Varcie said. ""All we can expect is some thunderstorm activity that is localized and where heavier amounts will be.""

That includes more powerful wind gusts than earlier this weekend that could go up to 60 miles per hour Varcie said.

Monday morning more than 17000 DTE Energy Co. customers were without power including in Dearborn Detroit and Downriver according to the company's outage map. CMS Energy Co.'s Consumers Energy reported outages affecting about 1000 people.

That included the branch office for the Secretary of State in Dearborn.

Rangan Banerjee teaches energy science and engineering at IIT Bombay . Speaking to he discusses major changes taking place across Indian industries aiming to achieve energy efficiency:A. There are plenty of possibilities. In oil and gas the actual refining accounts for only a small percentage of emissions — these could be offset. Next in terms of understanding the total Co2 generated from an industry Co2 per unit of energy is multiplied by energy per unit of output — this can be made more efficient by reducing the energy per unit of output. Also Co2 per unit of energy can be made zero by using renewables — any industrial process needs heat and electricity. If that comes from solar photovoltaic wind or hydropower it becomes zero carbon. Another option is to segregate and capture the Co2 and store it. Globally oil companies are trying this approach — a project in Norway’s Leitner is segregating carbon which is being used for enhanced oil recovery in old oil wells. It’s a positive development that companies are setting net zero targets and exploring all the options towards these. Global oil groups like British Petroleum (BP) are studying the possibilities of biofuels biorefineries solar energy etc. The interesting question is the scope of change.A. In terms of energy per unit of output India is higher than the US but lower than China. The US has saturated much of its demand for steel cement and aluminium. Most of its GDP comes from the services sector. India shows a similar trend. China is different as it provides most of the world’s industrial output.India actually has some of the world’s most energy efficient industries. For example we have some of the most efficient cement plants globally — the Indian average in energy intensity in cement is much lower than the world average. In chemicals and fertilisers too India has some of the world’s most efficient plants.It’s helpful that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency has started a Perform Achieve and Trade scheme — all the large industries are tagged with their specific energy consumption. They aim to reduce this over a set duration. This process is tracked while the Bureau also awards the most efficient industries.A. Almost every sector should do this. Cement is doing well. But even here many plants are lower than the global and Indian average. In terms of Co2 emissions steel cement aluminium and chemicals should adopt sustainable changes. So should textiles and pulp and paper. It makes sense for them to have zero carbon processes. This will bring competitive advantage — demand is changing now with conscious consumers looking at eco-labels. Secondly the European Union and other export markets are changing their emissions benchmarks. There are also real possibilities underway for changing the process in many of these industries — Elysis set up by Alcoa and Rio Tinto is working on a process for zero carbon aluminium by 2024.These transitions involve major investments. They need a consortium of industries and governments. But given that India has a significant presence in many energy-intensive sectors it makes sense for our industries to see the future and start process modifications. Tata Steel has a process called Hisarna which is more energy efficient and less carbonintensive. This is at a relatively small scale now but they are working towards a prototype.India’s fertiliser industry has some plants performing carbon capture and utilisation for urea production. Indian Oil will also begin a large-scale carbon capture project in one of their refineries soon. Alongside we’re seeing more dematerial isation. I f the Ei f fel Tower was constructed today with nanotechnology we’d use much less steel to achieve the same strength.Decarbonisation will be accomplished thus by changing industrial processes integrating with renewables and carbon capture. This movement needs more investment planning and R&D.A. We should be — there are challenges though. There is for instance a lock-in with large centralised operations. We’ve been used to mega-sized power plants and so we want to do solar energy in the same way when we actually need decentralised solutions. We should design small distributed solar units connected to a large grid. But that’s not how this is developing. However in conventional coal oil and gas energy engineering and technology are evolving — there is new vision and the rules of the game are changing.(Views expressed are personal)",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harish Shankar promises vintage Pawan Kalyan for #PSPK28: Let’s witness this energy again,While the team of #PSPK28 made it clear there will be no updates or first-look come Ugadi director Harish Shankar has surely found a way to keep Pawan Kalyan ’s fans engaged.Even before kick-starting shooting for the yet-to-be-titled film the director shared a compilation of clips from the star’s old films and wrote “Let’s witness this energy again.” Now fans can’t help but reshare the video excited to see a vintage Pawan Kalyan in his full glory.The video sees clips from Badri and few other films and now fans wait in anticipation for his next film.The Gabbar Singh director is busy penning a powerful script for the actor.

Yasmin Ingham & Banzai Du Loir at Bicton

Yasmin Ingham (24) from Greeba who was recently crowned IOM Sportswoman of the Year is within sight of her first senior Team position having been added to the GB longlist.

The ‘longlist’ comprises of 21 riders of which 6 will be selected to represent Great Britain at this years European Eventing Championships in Switzerland.

Ingham already has an impressive numbers of titles to her name which started in 2013 with a double gold win at the Pony European Champs and was British Champion in the same year. This was to the first of four British titles she has won and is so far the only person to hold the record of winning all four youth titles.

It was Ingham’s recent performance at Bicton Horse Trials which has earned her a place on the list. Bicton is a 4 star event which is the sports second highest level and Ingham was consistently in the top 4 on her horse Banzai Du Loir owned by Sue Davies and Janette Chinn.

The final selection trials will take place in July and August with the squad of 6 to be announced in mid August.

On her selection to the Longlist Ingham commented:

""I am absolutely delighted and thrilled to be taking this next step towards selection for Senior Teams. After representing Great Britain successfully at Pony and Young Rider level it has always been my goal to break into the Senior championship Teams and with the Paris 2024 Olympics in three years I know I have a horse in Banzai who could get me there I'm so grateful to Sue Davies for purchasing him two years ago for me to produce for the top levels"""

With enough popular demand Wendy’s can make changes to its menu. Whether it is bringing back spicy chicken nuggets or adding a show-themed product Wendy’s occasionally holds special promotions. Recently the restaurant chain teamed up with Adult Swim’s Rick and Morty.

Season five of Rick and Morty is here and fans can view the upcoming episodes on Hulu and HBO Max. A while ago Wendy’s created two new drinks that are inspired by the show. So what is inside each of the two menu items exactly?

‘Rick and Morty’-styled drinks at Wendy’s

Wendy's and Adult Swim are celebrating Season 5 of Rick and Morty by launching two new Coca-Cola drinks inspired by the hit animated series.https://t.co/0KbKbsMaDo pic.twitter.com/1hKGRsTeUk — Comic Book Resources (@CBR) June 16 2021

It would seem Rick and Morty have a habit of influencing the menu of fast-food chains. Many people remember when the show mentioned Szechuan sauce. McDonald’s stopped serving it in 1998 but they brought it back due to the demand of fans. It got a little out of hand to say the least.

Now Wendy’s is reaching out to Rick and Morty fans everywhere for new promotion. While they are not resurrecting an old menu item the company is collaborating with the series. According to CNET Wendy’s has released two new drinks that got inspired by Rick and Morty.

The new menu items were to promote the premiere of the fifth season. Fans can look for “Mello Yello Berry Jerryboree” and “Mello Yello Portal Time Lemon Lime” the next time they visit the restaurant. However the drinks only are available at over 5000 locations.

It is not the first time Wendy’s teamed up with the show. The company once added limited-time products to the breakfast menu. Fans may have found that the flavor of Szechuan sauce left much to be desired. The orange and lime-green-colored sodas may leave people more satisfied after a meal.

What do Wendy’s ‘Rick and Morty’ drinks contain?

Some fans want to know what is inside a Portal Time Lemon Lime or Berry Jerryboree before they head to their local Wendy’s. As the names suggest the drinks contain the popular soda brand Mello Yello. The ingredient list for Berry Jerryboree includes multiple flavors of Mello Yello. The flavors are orange strawberry cherry and limeade.

For Portal Time Lemon Lime the concoction is a combination of Mello Yello limeade and a citrus twist. Sugar is in both of the drinks but they come in zero-sugar alternatives as well. People who love Rick and Morty and Mello Yello are going to be in for a treat.

Some fans may come to the conclusion that the drinks taste like candy specifically SweetTarts. It is unsurprising since the contents include fruity flavors and a lot of sugar. Portal Time Lemon Lime will obviously taste more like lemon and lime.

How do the drinks tie into the show?

As mentioned before the drinks got added to the menu to hype up the release of Rick and Morty season five. The first episode premiered on June 20 2021 and fans can expect the season to have 10 episodes total. How do Berry Jerryboree and Portal Time Lemon Lime tie into the show?

Portal Time Lemon Lime is referencing the portals from Rick’s gun due to the green color. The portal gun allows the main characters to travel to different dimensions or alternate realities.

An identical claim was also shared here and here on Twitter; here and here on Facebook; and here on YouTube.

These posts reference a popular trend on TikTok where users in the Philippines post videos -- for example here here and here -- showing them dissolving paracetamol in Coca-Cola.

TikTok videos viewed more than 600000 times since May 2021 recommend the mixture as a way to ease anxiety and depression

However these posts are misleading according to multiple health experts.

Not approved

Paracetamol and Coke separately do not contain ingredients that help with anxiety or depression Charibel Escandalor president of the non-profit organisation Philippine College of Psychopharmacology told AFP on June 16 2021.

""[Paracetamol] is a pain reliever and is taken for fever. There is no other approved use for paracetamol"" Escandalor said. ""If you check the clinical practice guidelines for depression and anxiety you won't see paracetamol in any list.""

""Caffeine is a stimulant"" Escandalor added. ""[People with anxiety and depression] are not going to do very well if they keep caffeinating themselves.""

Consuming paracetamol beyond its recommended daily allowance is dangerous Robert Buenaventura a member of the Philippine Psychiatric Association told AFP on June 7.

Self-medication is not advised for people with symptoms of anxiety and depression Jose Mari Iborac an official at the Philippines National Center for Mental Health told AFP on June 15.

""Before taking any medication we need to seek advice from medical professionals"" Iborac said.

Cristiano Ronaldo has always been very particular about what he eats to keep the impressive physique he has mustered.

The Portugal international keeps himself in incredible shape and is part of the football legend's ongoing status as one of the best to ever play the game.

Despite being at the ripe old age of 36 Ronaldo continues to dominate headlines with his performances.

His most recent record was drawing level with Ali Daei to become the all-time highest international goalscorer.

The Juventus star's brace against France took him to 109 goals for Portugal and it would take a hardy gambler to bet against him taking the record outright by the end of Euro 2020.

Away from the pitch Ronaldo remains as relevant as ever and caused a stir when he removed two Coca Cola bottles from his press conference.

""Drink water"" the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said a gesture towards UEFA's sponsorship deals with businesses that are not actually aligned to football.

His actions saw an incredible loss to the company's stock as well worth around $4m.

It also gave an insight into how Ronaldo keeps in shape sticking to a strict diet complete without any fizzy drinks.

And that has been backed up by his Juventus teammate Daouda Peeters who has gone into detail over how the former Real Madrid man stays healthy.

Asked by AS what Ronaldo has for his dinner Peeters replied: ""Always the same. Broccoli chicken and rice. With litres of water and no Coca-Cola of course.""

It is not exciting it is not even particularly tasty - but those are the lengths the five-time Champions League winner will go to in order to remain the best of the best.

As a result the veteran forward has just seven per cent body fat and the man himself has insisted he could play until he is 40.

Peeters added: ""Cristiano wants to win always and everywhere. I went to the gym for a while and of course Cristiano was also there.

""I was impressed. Cristiano has the perfect body for a footballer. And although I am also quite muscular that day I thought; there’s still work to be done. But hey he’s been doing it maniacally for so many years.”"

The most notable difference was going to be the title sponsor and how they would change the look of the car from pink to green.

However some didn’t like the direction the British team took; one of them is the CEO of BWT Andreas Weißenbacher who still has his company’s logo on the car.

He feels that the title sponsor Cognizant would have gotten much higher recognition value if they had stuck with pink instead of opting for British green. Weißenbacher further revealed that team owner Lawrence Stroll understands his pain and knows how he feels about the change.

As quoted by Speedweek Andreas said “Aston Martin boss Lawrence Stroll understands that my heart is bleeding. If the Aston Martin were pink title sponsor Cognizant would also have more fun because the recognition value would be much higher.

The team looked optimistic for the 2021 season as they had finished in fourth place last year. However it hasn’t gone quite their way so far this campaign; they have struggled to make an impact in the constructors’ standings currently in sixth place with forty points under their belt.

All things aside the Silverstone based-squad have had their fair share of good moments starting with Monaco where they placed fifth in the race courtesy of Sebastian Vettel. He then shone at the next race in Baku where the German came second giving Aston Martin their first ever podium.

While you may know Rebecca Black from her 2011 cultural hit “Friday” the singer wants you to know she’s more than just a viral YouTube video. This year Black released “Girlfriend” the first track offering from her project “Rebecca Black Was Here.” Black is also a strong advocate for anti-bullying mental health initiatives and the LGBTQ+ community who has partnered with the AdCouncil GLAAD and Best Buddies in recent campaigns. “I feel it’s important that as queer people we are just as cognizant to the work that still needs to be done to provide equity freedom and support to all aspects of our community especially to its most vulnerable members including Black trans women and homeless LGBTQ+ youth” Black tells GO. “Whatever means or resources we have to help provide support to those is vital to the health of our community as a whole.” Now as she is preparing to head out on her Rebecca Black Was Here tour early next year Black continues to work for the community and is glad to see that like her others are being accepted and welcomed for their identity. “As the queer community grows every year I am so happy and proud to see more and more queer people feeling comfortable sharing their stories feeling confident in who they are and encouraging others to do the same.” —IL",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2dvbGYvMjAyMS8wNi8yNy90aGlzLWh1Z2UtdG9wLWJsYWNrLXByby1hbWF0ZXVycy1zYXktZ29sZi1uZWVkcy1tb3JlLWJhcnJpZXItYnJlYWtlcnMtbGlrZS1zaGlwcGVuLzUzNjE1NTIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'This is huge': Top Black pro amateurs say golf needs more barrier-breakers like Shippen,"Detroit — Shasta Averyhardt started playing golf at around age 7 quickly began working with an instructor and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Jackson State a historically Black university in Mississippi.

She also understands all the barriers that exist and all the opportunities that often don't for Black golfers. She never played in an American Junior Golf Association tournament because her family couldn't afford it with all the entry fees and travel costs.

Averyhardt 35 of Flint who played on the LPGA Tour in 2011 and 2013 is one of 12 women and 20 men who are competing in the inaugural John Shippen tournament at Detroit Golf Club playing for exemptions into LPGA Tour and PGA Tour events. The women's winning two-player team will earn a spot in next month's Great Lakes Bay Invitational in Midland and the men's individual winner will get an exemption into this week's Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit.

The 36-hole tournament created to open up opportunities for Black professional and amateur golfers is Sunday and Monday. It's the first of its kind on the LPGA and PGA tours.

""There are two current (Black) women on the LPGA Tour right now and there are about five to seven women on the LPGA Symetra (development) Tour"" Averyhardt said. ""There's definitely a bigger number of us out there. Having an opportunity like this it doesn't happen very often.

""We know how to play golf we have instruction we have the experience. It's just nice to be able to play at the highest level at Detroit Golf Club a couple days before the PGA Tour comes in.""

The John Shippen named after the nation's first Black golf professional also will award an exemption into the LPGA Tour's Cognizant Founders Cup in October. The four players who make up the second- and third-place teams in the Shippen will participate in a three-hole shootout after Monday's final round of play the winning individual earning that exemption.

Averyhardt is one of four players with Michigan ties to receive invitations to the Shippen along with recent Michigan State golfers Andrew Walker (Battle Creek) 22 and Troy Taylor II (Columbus Ohio) 21 and Wayne State alumnus Joseph Hooks 28.

The fields feature 21 professionals and 11 amateurs ranging from ages 16 to 35. A committee was created by marketing firm Intersport and the Woods and Watts Effect to target the best candidates to play. Rocket Companies paid all player expenses including travel lodging and food to remove barriers.

""It's awesome. There's nothing to describe it other than it's awesome"" said Walker a three-time Mr. Michigan Golf out of Battle Creek Lakeview where for all four years he was the only Black player on his high school team and one of the few in his entire southwest region of the state. He has status on the Mackenzie Tour (PGA Tour Canada) which restarts play in late July after a lengthy COVID-19 shutdown. ""Our game definitely needs this. ... Black people historically have had a very tough time getting access to the game.

""This definitely shows some of the steps that need to be taken. It's not as simple as young Black kids saying 'Hey I want to play golf.' There are a lot of barriers.""

The game of golf is a lot more inclusive than it was in its early days in America; the game has major racist roots. Even at the host club for the Shippen before the PGA Tour came to town the most prestigious event held there was the Horton Smith Invitational named after the former Masters champion club pro and PGA president who pushed for the exclusion of Blacks on the PGA Tour. The club stripped his name off the invitational (it's now the Michigan Medal Play) and apparently removed his picture from the clubhouse.

A major spike in Blacks playing the game is attributed to the Tiger Woods effect in the late 1990s. Still there are just four current players on the PGA Tour who are Black — two Harold Varner III and Cameron Champ who will play in the Rocket Mortgage Classic — and fewer than 1% of PGA of America club pros are Black.

As part of The John Shippen officials are hosting a business summit virtual this year for upcoming or recent high school and college graduates who are interested in getting into the $84-billion golf industry.

That Detroit is the first place on the PGA Tour or LPGA Tour to offer such an opportunity isn't an accident. Detroit is the Blackest city in the nation and one of the poorest. Other PGA Tour tournaments have diversity-focused initiatives including Los Angeles' Genesis Invitational the Woods-hosted event that every year hands out the Charlie Sifford Memorial Exemption. This year Woods gave it to Flint's Willie Mack III a regular on the diversity-promoting Advocates Professional Golf Association founded in 2008.

Mack was planning to participate in the Shippen this week but Rocket Mortgage Classic officials instead gave him one of its four sponsor's exemptions.

""This is huge"" said Taylor Mr. Ohio Golf his senior year of high school who went into golf rather than the family business — his dad played basketball at Ohio State in the 1980s. ""You don't see too many African-Americans out on the Tour and I don't think it's a skill-level point. It's having the right chance the right opportunity. African-American golfers we don't get too many of those opportunities as others.

""I was hoping to be a part of this.""

Walker and Taylor consider themselves fortunate. They got into the game at a young age and didn't experience many of the roadblocks others have. Mack and Averyhardt friends bound by their age and Flint connection had more struggles. Mack whose story has been well-told this year has been grinding on the mini-tours for years was homeless for more than a year and has told stories of having to borrow $20 here and $20 there from his dad just to eat McDonald's. Averyhardt said she relied heavily on parents Greg Averyhardt and Maria Espinoza particularly in college for food and rent and still relies on them. ""I'll be in debt to them forever"" she said.

The cost of competitive golf goes beyond just the best equipment teachers and access to courses. It's access to tournaments too and that can be expensive. Often on the mini-tours you need to win or finish runner-up to make any profit after factoring in entry fees. Fees for a pre-qualifier on the PGA Tour can run $200. If you advance out of that you head to the Monday qualifier which can cost up to $400. If you advance out of that you're in that week's PGA Tour tournament where you then need to make the cut just to earn a paycheck that week.

Golf's an expensive sport and there are White professional golfers who struggle to pay the bills too. A video of Justin Thomas went viral earlier this year when he slipped a struggling player a check to put toward golf endeavors. This week a Korn Ferry Tour player talked to media about how he doesn't have the money for Q School this fall. But Averyhardt points to the wealth gap in America when making the case for the importance of events and opportunities for Black golfers like the Shippen. According to Survey of Consumer Finances in 2019 the median White household income was between seven and eight times greater than Black households and the gap has grown wider amid the pandemic.

""I know a lot of people say 'Well other ethnicities struggle financially' but if you dive deeper into the history of our country ... there's a huge wealth gap"" said Averyhardt who in 2010 became just the fourth Black member of the LPGA Tour and now plays on the Symetra Tour. ""Some people get it some people won't.

""I really love that they created this event.""

XPO Logistics (CCJ Top 250 No. 6) has appointed Meagan Fitzsimmons to the leadership team of GXO Logistics Inc. the intended spin-off of XPO’s logistics business. Fitzsimmons currently serves as XPO’s chief compliance officer for the logistics segment. She will be responsible for GXO’s global ethics and compliance infrastructure when the planned spin-off is complete.

Fitzsimmons has 14 years of senior experience with premier global corporations and law firms. Prior to XPO she served as chief compliance officer and assistant general counsel for Revlon Inc. and as senior compliance counsel with the Colgate-Palmolive Company. Earlier she was an attorney with Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP and with Williams & Connolly LLP. She holds a juris doctorate degree from Georgetown University Law Center and a bachelor of arts degree from Northwestern University.

As previously announced XPO expects to spin off its logistics business as a separate publicly traded company in the third quarter of 2021. As the second largest contract logistics provider in the world GXO will be well-positioned to capitalize on the big three secular tailwinds of e-commerce growth customer demand for logistics automation and the burgeoning trend toward supply chain outsourcing. The business currently includes approximately 885 logistics locations in 27 countries.

Former Coyote executive joins Flock Freight

Chris Pickett has joined trucking technology startup Flock Freight as its chief strategy officer. Pickett brings more that 14 years experience from Coyote Logistics to the shared-truckload freight matching platform.

“As I have gotten to know the Flock Freight team I’ve been blown away by the technology solution they have brought to market the talent they have assembled across every corner of the organization and the mission that aligns it all. I know how difficult it is to execute shared truckload at scale – both mathematically and operationally and Flock Freight has solved it period” said Pickett chief strategy officer at Flock Freight. “The tech not only works but it works better and better every day. I couldn’t be more fired up about this team and this opportunity to help create a more sustainable and more efficient transportation ecosystem for everyone.”

After spending his early career in distribution network design and software development and implementation Pickett joined the early leadership team at Coyote Logistics soon after the organization’s inception in 2006. Chris was a contributor to Coyote’s legendary rise to $2 billion in global revenue before acquisition by UPS in 2015 as well as its subsequent doubling in size to become the second-largest U.S. truckload (TL) freight broker by 2020.

As chief strategy officer over much of that period Pickett also conceived of and scaled Coyote's Collaborative Transportation Management service offering and developed an original U.S. truckload market forecasting methodology known to many as the Pickett Curve. This method is widely used in the industry for understanding market dynamics and projecting long-term directional spot and contract pricing behavior. Along the way he also earned degrees in Industrial Engineering Logistics and Business Administration from Virginia Tech MIT and Georgia Tech respectively.

Few stories of the Covid year were stranger or sadder than Ron Meyer’s abrupt exit from NBCUniversal last August. A Hollywood fixture for five decades a founder of CAA and a top Universal exec for a whopping 25 years Meyer was fired after disclosing to the company that he was being extorted by associates of an actress with whom he’d had a brief affair.

When I saw those initial headlines I immediately had a guess who the actress must be. Meyer’s name had popped up in messages and conversations around Charlotte Kirk’s relationship with Warner Bros. C.E.O. Kevin Tsujihara back in early 2018 when I was editing the investigation by my former THR colleagues Tatiana Siegel and Kim Masters that led to Tsujihara stepping down. Meyer wasn’t in the tawdry inner circle of Kirk Tsujihara James Packer and Brett Ratner but it was pretty clear she knew him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3Blbm5jYXBpdGFsLXN0YXIuY29tL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvaG93LWRvLXdlLXN0b3AtYS1zbGlkZS1pbnRvLWF1dG9jcmFjeS1ieS1hbHdheXMtcmVtZW1iZXJpbmctdGhhdC1mYWN0cy1tYXR0ZXItcmF5LWUtbGFuZGlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How do we stop a slide into autocracy? By always remembering that facts matter | Ray E. Landis • Pennsylvania Capital ...,"Amy Poehler has developed a new career as a spokesperson for Comcast and we see her on numerous commercials for a wide range of products. One particular television advertisement in which she stars however says more about the state of the country than it says about any technology service.

The commercial begins with a family surfing the internet on their various devices. Amy mentions the need for on-line security with so many people attempting to steal personal information.

The scene shifts slightly to show the family’s snooping neighbor listening through the thin walls. After exchanging pleasantries with the neighbor Amy points out how many people might be observing your computer activity through malware. The nosy neighbor interrupts to say that it is “mall-ware.” Amy confirms is it malware and points out you can look it up. The commercial ends with the neighbor sputtering “agree to disagree!”

First malware (and it is malware) is a dangerous problem for everyone using a computer and is an example of the scams and frauds so prevalent in technology today.

As concerning as this type of fraud is however the most disturbing aspect of this advertisement may be the attitude of the creepy neighbor.

It is perfectly acceptable for someone to not know something and this portrayal shows her lack of knowledge about malware. But when presented with evidence her understanding of how to pronounce this harmful computer activity is incorrect this character does not admit her mistake. Instead she snarkily asserts that facts do not matter and she will go on believing what she wants to believe.

Does the attitude of this character remind you of anyone who was in the public eye quite a bit over the past few years? The problem we face in our country is not that ex-President Donald Trump’s personality is so similar to the stubborn fool in a television commercial however. The true concern is many people both in and out of positions of influence and power share the attitude that facts and truth are whatever an individual decides they should be.

The ever-developing narrative among some on the far-right about the events of January 6 at the United States Capitol is an example.

Scenes of rioters smashing windows and using barricades as weapons are being ignored by those who now try to claim this “incident” was simply citizens exercising their Constitutional right to protest. Arizona Representative Paul Gosar has gone so far as to accuse the Capitol Police of “assassinating” one protestor who was violently attempting to break into the House Chamber.

Accusations of lying come fast and furious in the political world. A quick trip through Twitter shows former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley accusing the left of lying about the reasons for the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and both sides in the debate about legislation to change voting procedures maintaining their opponents are lying about aspects of the bills.

Many of these accusations are really differences of opinion about policy. Opponents of requirements to show ID at the polls say this will decrease voter turnout while proponents say it will prevent fraud. Implying either statement is a lie is not accurate. The actual debate is whether a miniscule increase in fraud prevention is sufficient reason to deny individuals without an ID the opportunity to vote.

While we should hold our leaders to higher standards distortions of the impact of policy changes or parsing words in a press statement have become time-honored American political traditions. But agreeing to disagree about factual information goes far beyond simply seeking to gain an advantage in an issue debate.

Autocratic governments use lies and propaganda to brainwash their citizens and perpetuate their rule.

Just last week we have seen Vladimir Putin laugh off accusations of being a killer and shamelessly lie about Russian involvement in cyber-warfare.

There is a growing bent in American politics that has echoes of the strongman rule of Francisco Franco in Spain in the mid-20th century or some of the South American dictators of the 1970s and 1980s. Facts do not matter to this group which relies on the Fox News model of convincing people the opinions of commentators are unbiased news.

Unfortunately too many ordinary Americans have fallen victim to this type of propaganda. The neighbor in the Comcast commercial may seem like a harmless ill-informed busybody. But in an age of information when facts and truth are more widely available than ever before the attitude of “agree to disagree” on matters far more important than the pronunciation of a word is growing more prevalent – and more dangerous.

Investing.com – GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) were both in the red in Monday’s premarket trading as the dust settled over the rebalancing of the Russell indices.

Both stocks were down close to 1%. GameStop has moved to the Russell 1000 index while AMC stayed in the Russell 2000 benchmark. The changes in indices are effective today.

While the progress of the video game retailer to the larger index was a near certainty there were still doubts over the inclusion of the multiplex chain owner.

GameStop which is trying to reinvent itself as a digital-first distributor of games and related equipment is the original meme stock. AMC another stock challenged by changing consumer behavior patterns joined it in a market frenzy that added billions of dollars in their market cap in the first half of the year. While AMC was badly hit by the closure of its theaters during the pandemic its outlook has brightened as the U.S. has gradually lifted restrictions on public gatherings. Action movie ""F9"" starring Vin Diesel- and Charlize Theron generated $70 million in box office sales at the weekend the best movie debut since the start of the pandemic. F9 was made by Universal a Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) subsidiary collected $70 million over the weekend.

Investment managers and institutional investors use Russell indexes as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Approximately $10.6 trillion in assets are benchmarked against Russell’s U.S. indexes. Russell indexes are part of FTSE Russell a leading global index provider.

Pierce: Utahn and her dog surprise the competition on A&E's 'America's Top Dog',"Dayna Winter-Nolte loves to take her dog Theo to competitions — just for the surprise factor. The Utah woman isn’t the one who’s surprised her fellow competitors and the spectators are.

“It’s so much fun because I do these competitions and you see those Belgian Malinois and German Shepherds and I walk out of the field and I get kind of a chuckle” she said. “And then he blows everyone’s expectations out of the water.”

Theo is a 7½ year old border collie-poodle mix — a medium size dogs who’s cute and kind of fluffy. He does not look like a dog who’s going to zip through obstacles and blow people’s minds.

But he is. And Theo and Winter-Nolte compete on a really big stage on Tuesday in the second season premiere of A&E’s “America’s Top Dog” (7 p.m. Dish and DirecTV; 9 p.m Comcast).

“He’s different than a lot of dogs that are on the show” Winter-Nolte said. “I like to kind of come out with him and prove that just because dogs don’t look like the typical dog that does that kind work that they can still really excel. Especially with that good relationship you can build with them.

“I’m really really excited to have a lot of people see how we do on this show. It’s really just a laugh.”

“America’s Top Dog” (Tuesday 8 p.m. A&E) features a huge obstacle course that tests the dogs’ speed agility and how well they work with their trainers. In the first round of competition pairs of dogs in three different categories — working dogs police K9s and “underdogs” — compete to be the fastest. The winners advance to the finals where they compete against each other.

The winner gets $10000 and another $5000 to donate to the animal charity of their choice. And the weekly winners return in the season finale competing for an additional $25000.

Sportscast Curt Menefee and comedian David Koechner are the hosts; sportscaster Rachel Bonnetta is the “sideline reporter.” They try hard but they take a decided back seat to the dogs and their trainers.

Winter-Nolte shares a bit of her background with viewers and it’s enough to make them stop and take notice. When she was 18 years old the South Salt Lake woman was “bitten really badly by a friend’s German shepherd.” Although it was “a pure accident” she had to go to the hospital and get 30 stitches. “I never blamed the dog. Honestly the dog in that situation was doing its job of protecting its property. It was managed poorly and he made a bad decision unfortunately.

“I was OK. But mentally recovering from that was really really difficult” Winter-Nolte said.

Her family had a dog at the time and she was fine with her. “But German shepherds and bigger dogs in general were really intimidating to me up until I started working with Theo.”

Theo it turns out is a handful. He’s the first dog she ever owned by herself.

Winter-Nolte was in grad school “and I thought ‘I want a dog! And I got this cute little puppy. … The doodles were all the rage and I thought I was getting this really easy low-key cute fluffy dog just to be my buddy. And he just turned out to be a lot more intense than I had anticipated” she said with a laugh. “He had a lot of energy that needed to be channeled in certain ways.”

So she found a trainer to work with Theo and with her — and the trainer had a German shepherd.

“I eventually started shadowing at the training company that I was working with and just getting to know more and more about these working type dogs. And I was able to kind of get over my fear through working with Theo.

“So now I own three German shepherds” she said with a laugh. Three is a lot but I make it work. They’re amazing. I do sports with all of them.”

But Theo is the dog she’s spent the most time training.

“The relationship I have with Theo is very different. He’s been around the longest. I’m not saying he’s my favorite but we just have more of an in-depth relationship — kind of because of the struggles that I’ve had to go through with him. Having to troubleshoot working issues out with him.”

And working with a trainer inspired Winter-Nolte to become a trainer herself. “It definitely wasn’t something that I was planning for” she said with a laugh.

Having been severely bitten herself she’s now working with aggressive dogs of all sizes — including “quite a few German shepherds.”

“Working as a trainer allows me to prevent people from having an experience like I did by helping people learn how to communicate with their dogs and set boundaries” Winter-Nolte said.

“I remember teaching my childhood dog how to roll over in my bedroom and do tricks like that. It was a blast” she said. And when the path emerged to turn dog training into a career she said “I kind of dove into it head first.”

Baddoo was assigned to rookie ball in his first two seasons and performed above average for his age and experience. In 2019  Baddoo played 29 games before requiring Tommy John surgery on his left elbow. There is not much to speak of for Baddoo in the Twins organization just the fact that they gave up on him and was an after thought.

Akil Baddoo is an interesting player that can play any outfield position with good readability of the field. That with his above average speed he makes for a good defender for this roster. Baddoo who is only 22 years old has the ability to drive up his walk percentage due to his power. He is young and can harness that Major League bat at times.

A home in Detroit

Baddoo was selected third to the Detroit Tigers in the Rule 5 Draft. Akil was selected in the Rule 5 Draft because Minnesota had too many young players on their roster. He played in spring training and impressed AJ Hinch enough to be called up to the Opening Day roster.

In Akil’s first pitch seen he hit a monster home run. The very next day he hit a grand slam in exciting fashion. In his third career MLB game he hit a walk-off hit scoring a run to win the game in the 10th inning. This was an incredible week for the rookie and fans were hopping on board to support the 22-year old.

Rookie struggles

The coming out party for Akil Baddoo was short lived and he struggled from mid April through May. In that stretch Baddoo had 100 plate appearances with only 14 hits posting a abysmal .140 batting average. Baddoo struggled with strikeouts and that was his weakness through that stretch of games.

Finally Baddoo overcame his struggles and as of June 21st he has 11 hits in his last 14 games with 5 homeruns and 20 RBIs. The Tigers managers have been committed to helping Baddoo with his swing. He has been a lot better going deeper in counts and drawing walks. He has brought down the strikeouts and looks like a completely new hitter. Baddoo has brought his batting average up to .272 with a OBP of .367.

This is one of the most impressive turnarounds from a rookie that I have seen. The pop and the speed is the most impressive attributes I have seen from this kid along with the ability to read the strike zone at such a young age. The MLB can be a hard place to develop and it looks like the Tigers organization has set Akil Baddoo on the right track and for years to come.

Kasey Tyndall’s first song Saturday evening got one of the most rousing receptions you’re apt to hear from an arriving concert crowd.

That was a certainly a testament to the rising Tyndall who opened a bill with headliner Jamey Johnson and support artist Whiskey Myers at Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre — the first full-capacity concert at a major metro Detroit venue since the onset of the pandemic. Her smart spirited set of rock-inflected country music including that opening number “Getaway Truck” was plenty worthy on its own.

But the boisterous audience response also felt like one big gush of pent-up energy and relief: Thank heavens concerts are back.

The special moment wasn’t lost on the rising singer-songwriter after her set.

“People are like sponges right now” said the North Carolina-born Tyndall who’s been on the road with Johnson and company for several weeks. “They’re just soaking it all in.”

Saturday in Sterling Heights was jubilant all around: The tailgating out in the parking lots. The bustling concession lines. The upbeat ushers happily welcoming fans down their aisles as the crowd of about 5000 settled in at the 7700-capacity venue.

Even the amphitheater’s lawn seemed greener — and frankly with nearly two years to have recouped from its last summer battering it probably was.

And then there was the music. Johnson the first amphitheater headline performer here in 21 months delivered two hours of dependably satisfying country sincerity transforming the venue into his “own little honky-tonk” just as he had promised early on.

The maverick Alabaman has a knack for the sort of honest well-sculpted song storytelling that makes him a favorite of classic-country fans and his no-frills baritone is the ideal vehicle for delivering them. At Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre Johnson and his musicians including a three-piece horn section melded a devotion to the old school with the fluidness of a jam band.

“Keeping Up With the Jonesin’” has been a regular set starter for Johnson over the years. But on Saturday the evening the amps crackled back to life after all the silent nights it took on shades of new meaning: “I miss getting high and staying out all night / With all my old friends.”

You don’t get much motion onstage at a Jamey Johnson concert — ain't no place for ""smoke and mirrors"" as he said at one point. But you do get plenty of musical flight provided Saturday via the improv jams and instrumental breakdowns that came with songs such as “Heartache” “Can’t Cash My Checks” and “Macon.”

His signature 2008 ballad “In Color” was a requisite lighters-and-cell-phones moment while “That Lonesome Song” had the crowd in full voice. And Johnson served up a generous helping of red-blooded country cover songs taking on vintage works by Merle Haggard Johnny Paycheck Waylon Jennings Don Williams and others — along with a highlight performance that married Billy Joe Shaver’s “Live Forever” and Tom T. Hall’s “Faster Horses (The Cowboy and the Poet).”

And Johnson had one last card up his sleeve as he wrapped up for the Detroit crowd: In a nod to Bob Seger and the recently departed saxophonist Alto Reed he performed “Turn the Page.”

The band Whiskey Myers had preceded Johnson with a blast of Texas-fried country-rock a set peppered with gritty guitar solos and gutsy crowd pleasers such as “Early Morning Shakes” and “Ballad of a Southern Man.”

For the venue staffers and local production crews — who greeted each other Saturday with lots of welcome-back smiles and backslapping — the show was really a tune-up: It won’t be until late July that the concert action comes hot and heavy as tours return in full force.

Still watching fans stream in steadily filling the seats it was like seeing a world returning from hibernation. We’d all been locked away from each other during 15 months of pain and loss. And now here we were again together bonded in escape — back for that strangely beautiful fleeting moment of community only a concert can provide.

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards has formed a task force of elected officials city agencies and community leaders to address quality of life issues in College Point.

The group met for the first time earlier this month to discuss matters including an ongoing sewer construction project in the neighborhood which residents say has been very disruptive for road users in recent years.

The $113 million project began in 2017 and involves upgrades to streets and infrastructure as well as the installation of more than four miles of new storm sewers on more than 80 blocks in College Point according to the Department of Design and Construction (DDC) which is overseeing the work. Originally scheduled to be completed this year the job is now expected to conclude in 2023.

College Point civic leaders and residents said the sewer project has made driving on local streets difficult – if not hazardous created difficulties for people with disabilities and taken away sought-after parking spots. The poor road conditions have also led to vehicles being damaged.

“People are replacing tires every six months their suspension systems” said Jennifer Shannon president of A Better College Point Civic Association. “The roads are absolutely horrible.”

Shannon said she attended a recent virtual task force meeting with civic board members Sheryl Klaven and Mirjana Karcic. Prior to that she did a driving tour of the project area with the borough president so he could see the issues firsthand.

A Better College Point Civic Association is one of three community groups on the task force – along with the College Point Civic and Taxpayers Association and Community Board 7 according to the borough president’s office.

College Point Civic and Taxpayers Association Treasurer Brock Weiner also complained about the condition of neighborhood streets.

“A tremendous amount of our roads are like driving on the moon” he said.

Weiner said that representatives of his civic group were not at the meeting earlier this month but plan to be involved in future discussions.

The task force also includes elected officials Con Edison and relevant city agencies – including the DDC the Department of Transportation the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Small Business Services.

The DDC in a statement said that work being done by Con Edison has delayed the sewer project.

“Because of this interference with our project our contractor has had difficulty scheduling his work efficiently and has stored materials on the street in several different areas as he tries to find places to work away from Con Edison” DDC Executive Director of Public Information Ian Michaels said.

Shannon Weiner and Memoli said that construction materials have been left in the roadways for long periods of time – sometimes for months and even years – taking up parking spaces which Shannon described as a hot commodity.

“People in College Point are at their wits’ end” Weiner said.

Another resident Susan Memoli said the uneven roads have also made it difficult for her to get around with her adult son who is in a wheelchair. Her son had gotten a new wheelchair in June 2020 but the wheels have already worn down and need to be replaced soon which she blamed on the uneven streets.

Memoli said she also tripped and fell while crossing 14th Avenue in September and needed stitches.

“What does a person do with a walker?” she asked rhetorically pointing to the rough road at 14th Avenue and 121st Street.

Richards agreed in a statement that the “seemingly endless work” has caused “a great deal of hardship for local residents and businesses.”

He said that he is working with various officials to rectify the situation.

“We will work together to fix the quality-of-life issues in the area and to bring this sewer project to an environmentally conscious speedy and successful conclusion” he said.

In a statement provided Friday the DDC said it also plans to address the residents’ complaints.

“Following a walkthrough of the site with BP Richards we have instructed the contractor to begin restoration work on 10 blocks and to consolidate his street storage areas for the community’s use” Michaels said.

“We are also cooperating with the Borough President’s task force and welcome its suggestions for how to move the project along more quickly and with less impact on the community” his statement continued.

The task force will convene monthly – except in August a spokesperson for the borough president said. For now the meetings will be held virtually.

Several elected officials who represent the area and are part of the group – state Sen. John Liu Assemblymember Daniel Rosenthal and Councilmember Paul Vallone – thanked the borough president for forming the group. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also a member.

“Each year we call upon the city to complete total reconstruction of College Point roadways only to have it fall on deaf ears” Vallone said in a statement. “I applaud Borough President Richards for undertaking this endeavor as the city must prioritize northeast Queens.”

Liu praised the group as a bridge between residents and government officials.

“The biggest complaint that College Point residents have constantly brought up for the last several years is lack of communication with the government agencies” he said in a statement.

For Memoli the ongoing work has been so frustrating that she has considered moving. When asked how long she has been in the neighborhood she simply said “too long.”

Weiner said he expected the sewer project to go on a while longer – but hoped that the task force would help to speed up the process.

“We are hoping we will see the end of it within the next few years …. But I’m not going to hold my breath” Weiner said.

Meanwhile Shannon said she has seen a slight improvement in work sites since the task force meeting and lauded the borough president for getting the ball rolling.

“I’m going to have faith that they are going to do what they said they would” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Shifting Retail Sales Landscape

Overall retail sales have experienced a tremendous rebound since the COVID-19 outbreak. By most measures we are back to pre-pandemic levels. However the retail landscape is ever-shifting and being redefined by a “new norm.”

Consumers return to restaurants in droves

As vaccination efforts accelerated restaurants welcomed back customers. Sales for Food Services and Drinking Places surged 68.5% YoY surpassing pre-pandemic levels. In particular Limited-Service restaurant sales grew at the highest rate since the end of 2019. For details on food sub-categories go to Food Institute Economic Benchmarking.

Balancing big-ticket items and discounts

Cars were among the top big-ticket items that Americans purchased this year. Concerns about the pandemic drove many consumers away from public transportation and toward used-car lots. Rental companies also boosted car sales by replenishing their fleets. Auto dealership sales peaked in April with 44.6% increase YoY. Car sales decelerated in May but many dealerships still expect strong demand as employees go back to work on-site.

At the same time price-conscious consumers are gravitating towards online discounts. Amazon Prime Day 2021 sales surpassed $11 billion >6% increase from last year. Many of the most popular items are everyday essentials.

Global supply crunch and retail outlook

Current supply and demand conditions are highly unusual and shouldn’t persist over the long term for a number of reasons:

The effect of fiscal stimulus is fading. Consumers are unlikely to spend more on big-ticket items. Pandemic regulations and cyberattacks presented new challenges to the global supply chain. Though carriers have deployed more ships than at any time in history the effective capacity is 25% less than what’s actually deployed because so many vessels are caught up in record bottlenecks at ports . This is likely to last for months not years. Current demand is outpacing supply.

In both April and May overall retail sales fell short of market expectations. Looking forward 12 months most economists expect retail sales growth to return to a “normal” range.

Depending on the budget one could land a barely-driven SL 65for around €200000 or an SL 400 for about four times less. Those into extreme stuff however should check out this Copart listing which advertises a burnt pile of rubble that used to be a 2017 Mercedes-AMG SL 63 The ad claims that it has 0 miles on the odo and gives an unrealistic estimated retail value of $88500. The wreck is located in Albuquerque New Mexico and is part of an upcoming lot that will be auctioned off online.Needless to say that the AMG roadster is beyond salvageable. The fire destroyed literally everything and if it wasn’t for the easily-recognizable rear three-quarter design then it would have been almost impossible to tell what ride this was just by looking at the pics. So the only realistic usage that we could think of is perhaps art-related though you will need a lot of imagination for that too.When it left the factory floor it was finished in white and had a twin turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 engine under that long hood capable of pumping out 577(585 PS / 430) at 5500 rpm and 664 lb-ft (900 Nm) of torque at 2250-3750 rpm. Mercedes-AMG claimed that the nought to 62 mph (0-100 kph) is dealt with in 4.1 seconds and flat out it could do 155 mph (250 kph).U.S. pricing used to start at more than $150000 while in Germany the 2017 SL 63 retailed for over €160000.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary of advantages

Samsung Galaxy M32:

• Larger battery capacity (6000mAh)

• More powerful charging rate (25W)

• Dedicated microSD slot

Samsung Galaxy A32:

• Higher macro camera resolution (5MP)

• Higher depth camera resolution (5MP)

Display

Both smartphones sport a 6.4-inch FHD+ (2040 x 1800) Super AMOLED screen. With this you can expect immersive viewing experiences with rich colors and deep blacks on both devices. The smartphones also got a 90Hz refresh rate for some smooth animations and transitions.

What’s more both are equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for protection against damage from drops. According to Corning Gorilla Glass 5 survives up to 1.2-meter waist-high drops onto hard rough surfaces.

CPU and GPU

Powering both smartphones are the same MediaTek Helio G80 CPU and ARM Mali-G52 GPU so we can expect the same level of performance on both. However do note that we can only determine the extent of their performance and thermals once we have both units for a review.

RAM and Storage

Both Galaxy M32 and Galaxy A32 come with an 8GB + 128GB configuration. However the Galaxy M32 features a dedicated microSD card slot for easy expansion without sparing its dual-SIM capabilities.

Cameras

For the camera department both phones consist of quad rear cameras with main ultrawide macro and depth sensors. They’ve got the same 64MP (main) and 8MP (ultrawide) sensors. However the Samsung Galaxy A32 is equipped with a better macro and depth camera resolution at 5MP while the Galaxy M32’s macro and depth camera are at 2MP.

Upfront both have the same 20MP selfie camera so both could be equally great for selfies.

Take note though that these numbers don’t always equate to quality. We will provide proof of which camera is better once we test both units for comparison.

Connectivity & Other Features

As for connectivity the two are powered with the same specs such as 4G LTE WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Bluetooth 5.0 and dual-SIM. For security however both sport fingerprint scanner and face recognition. Both smartphones also come with a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack.

Battery

Both Samsung Galaxy M32 and A32 have huge batteries. The Galaxy M32 however comes with a larger 6000mAh battery with 25W fast charging whereas the Galaxy A32 has a 5000mAh battery with 15W fast charging. This means the Galaxy M32 carries a larger battery that also replenishes juice quicker.

Price

The Samsung Galaxy M32 is slightly cheaper at PHP 13490 while the Galaxy A32 retails at PHP 13999.

Which one to get?

As we pin them side-by-side we noticed that the two smartphones have only a few differences other than their designs. Now that you know each smartphone’s advantages you better pick which carries the perks you need more.

The newly unveiled Samsung Galaxy M32 comes with a larger battery capacity with a faster charging speed meaning it offers more prolonged usage and less charging time. It is also suitable for those who wish to take advantage of dual-SIM capabilities and still want to expand the phone’s storage via a dedicated microSD slot.

On the flip side the Samsung Galaxy A32 nails the camera department so those who love taking photos would enjoy its higher macro and depth camera resolution.

This is the first Phantom smartphone as a standalone sub-brand for premium mid-range smartphones and you can see the quality upfront by just how well built it is. Unlike the predecessor you have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back of the smartphone and not a glasstic or glossy finish.

You can tell the Phantom X is the beginning of a new chapter in the premium series foray as an independent brand. Without further ado these are the key features you have on the smartphone.

Phantom X Specs and Features at a Glance

6.7-inches Super AMOLED 90HZ display with 1080 x 2340 pixels

Android 11 (HiOS 7.6)

Octa-core Mediatek Helio G95 processor with Mali-G76 MC4 GPU

8G RAM and 256GB internal storage

Triple 50MP + 13MP + 8MP rear camera and 48MP + 8MP selfie camera

In-display fingerprint scanner

4 700mAh Li-Po batter

Design

You can tell this Phantom stands out from the rest starting with the design. As mentioned earlier the Phantom X is covered in glass front and back with the display spilling over the side as it is blended into the side of the smartphone. The cameras are arranged vertically at the center on the back and that’s about it on the back giving it a clean look. Not to forget you have the fingerprint scanner built into the screen in line with the latest trend.

Display

As far as making use of space goes the display on the smartphone covers most of the front leaving little in the way of bezels at the top and bottom. The screen is Super AMOLED which means you enjoy deep black and a nice contrast with a Full HD resolution to help. The 3D borderless display is curved at the side blending into the side of the smartphone quite nicely.

In addition there is a 90Hz refresh rate to make navigations smooth and seamless. In that regard there is a fingerprint scanner at the lower part of the screen that unlocks your phone in 0.4s according to Tecno.

Camera

The smartphone has a lot of cameras on it all of which combines for a total of 148MP featuring two front cameras and three back cameras. The rear combination has a wide-angle 50MP main sensor a 13MP telephoto and an 8MP 120o angle ultrawide camera. This is capable of shooting 4k videos at up to 60fps and 30fps with the main sensor having Dual Pixel and Laser autofocus. In addition there is a quad-LED flash lined up beside the rear cameras as well for more visibility.

Furthermore there are two cameras punched into the left side of the screen with a 48MP primary camera and an 8MP 105o angle ultra-wide camera joined by a dual-LED flash.

Hardware and Battery

For performance the Phantom X has a mediocre 12nm octa-core MediaTek Helio G95 processor equipped with a Mali-G76 MC4 GPU. Compensating for this is an 8GB RAM and 256GB storage space built-in and a vapour chamber cooling system for heat dissipation.

On the other hand the smartphone draws power from an ample 4 700mAh battery which is good enough for a standard ‘a day’ use. That’s not all you also get to enjoy 33W fast charging which is said to give 70% in 30 minutes.

Pricing and Availability

The Phantom X will be available for pre-order starting June 28 and it goes for 228 000 Naira in Nigeria and about GHS 3 240 in Ghana. To pre-order you can make a down payment of GHS 500 in Ghana and 5 000 Naira in Nigeria.",,,,,,,,,

Michael Brown

Jupiter Florida based My State MLS a nationwide multiple listing service recently adopted what3words a free app that makes it easier to guide users to an exact location. Millions from around the world use the app to find and share precise locations. What3words enables My State MLS members to easily navigate to hard-to-find properties.

Examples of how what3words can help My State MLS members include:

Vacant land real estate agents can easily direct other agents to a property that does not have a street address.

Agents working with city properties that may have multiple or confusing addresses can direct potential buyers to the correct entrance with minimal frustration.

In situations where parking is separate from the actual property (such as apartments) it’s easy to specify precisely where to park.

What3words divides the world into 57 trillion squares each measuring 10 feet by 10 feet. Each square has a unique randomly assigned 3-word address.

For example ///fires.rested.amused is the what3words address for a 10-foot square at an entrance to the Empire State Building. Anyone can enter these three words into the free what3words app and tap “Navigate” to get directions with their favorite navigation app.

If a listing is difficult to find a My State MLS member can simply type the address into what3words receive the what3words 3-word address for the exact meeting point and then share it with their client. The client can then input the 3-word address into the what3words app and easily navigate to the exact viewing location from a navigation app. Members and clients can arrive hassle-free and ready to see the property.

“At My State MLS we are always looking for ways to help our members become even more successful” said Dawn Pfaff founder and president of My State MLS. “By adopting the what3words app we are helping our members solve a lot of direction problems. There’s nothing more frustrating than a potential purchaser getting lost because street addresses aren’t accurate enough and missing out on viewings or arriving stressed.”

How is this different from Google Maps?

Google Maps is a tool for navigation public transportation and for looking up addresses and points-of-interest. What3words has a very different function – it’s an easy way to communicate exact locations within 10 feet whether that’s spoken over the phone or into a car voice navigation system or typed into a taxi app or a website checkout page.

In addition dropping a pin on to Google Maps isn’t useful if you’d like to revisit or share that location weeks after you see it if you need to share it with someone over a phone call or enter it into an address field.

What3words is a really quick and simple way to find share and save exact locations within 10 feet. The system converts GPS coordinates into 3 word addresses.

Although you can’t yet enter a 3 word address directly into Google Maps you can find a 3 word address on the what3words app or website and navigate their via Google Maps.

Browse what3words

You can also browse the 10-foot squares and see what three words are used for each one. In Manhattan in NY City on 5th Ave. across from Central Park every square already has a three word label. Here’s an example up on a deck overlooking the park [///deck.plan.meal]:

Imagine wanting to meet a client in Central Park to show them the building exterior first. There is no address in Central Park. You’ve never met and have no idea what they look like. You can give them the exact spot to meet you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdGluZ3dlbGwuY29tL2FydGljbGUvNzkwODI1MS9uZXZlci1nby10by1jb3N0Y28tYnV0LW1ha2UtYW4tZXhjZXB0aW9uLWZvci10aGlzLWl0ZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Never Go To Costco But I Make an Exception for This Item,"Welcome to Thrifty. A weekly column where assistant nutrition editor and registered dietitian Jessica Ball keeps it real on how to grocery shop on a budget make healthy meals for one or two and make earth-friendly choices without overhauling your entire life.

Alright let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat: I don't like going to Costco. Similar to my feelings about Trader Joe's I am pretty sure I'm in the minority on this one. But Costco anxiety is a very real thing that keeps some of us avoiding it. Between the crowds the lines and the seemingly endless aisles towering with boxes the whole shopping experience isn't my jam. That is not to say Costco is a ""bad"" store and you shouldn't shop there. They have everything from healthy snacks to great deals on house plants. Before you get too angry with me I admit that there is one section of Costco that can't be beat in my eyes—the meat poultry and fish department of the store.

Even though I try to limit my Costco trips for my own sanity I always make an exception when it comes to meat. I live alone and usually cook for two so you may be wondering why I'm getting my protein in bulk. Well buying meat poultry and fish in bulk at Costco definitely saves me money. They typically carry higher quality products for a fraction of the per-pound price at standard grocery stores. They also carry cuts of meat I can't find anywhere else for super affordable rates like their lamb shoulder for $7 per pound compared to almost $16 per pound at Walmart (which is one of my dinner party go-tos).

Even though I live alone I have a foolproof way of making my Costco meat haul last. Once I get home I split up the raw meat fish or poultry into individual portions and freeze it until I'm ready to use it. I will even do this for ground meat like beef and turkey since I usually only use half of a package at a time. This helps me take advantage of the discount prices without wasting the larger portions. Plus I always have proteins on hand so I can get creative with dinners based on the vegetables that are in season and what I'm in the mood for.

Let me be clear I do not think you're a bad person if you have a laundry list for Costco every week (here are EatingWell's recommendations for the best healthy foods to stock up on at Costco). I concede that they have incredible deals and numerous eye-catching snacks. For me as a person living alone on a budget buying most of my food in Costco sizes doesn't make sense. Plus the experience of shopping there is anxiety inducing (thinking about the parking lot in particular). That said I always buy my meat poultry and fish at Costco because it's more affordable better quality and reliably stocked.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZWZpbmRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy93b3JzdC10aGluZy10by1idXktYXQtY29zdGNvL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZWZpbmRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy93b3JzdC10aGluZy10by1idXktYXQtY29zdGNvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Worst Thing To Put In Your Cart At Costco According To Health Experts,"This is an archived article and the information in the story may be outdated. Please check the time stamp on the story to see when it was updated last.

Superstore Costco is beloved for its bulk items and great deals-after all where else can you buy a varied assortment of products for such low prices?!

But as much as customers love hitting up Costco for their family-sized grocery needs health experts warn that you shouldn’t buy everything in bulk. That’s because you might think you’re saving money in the moment but you’re actually losing it in the long run. Why? Those gallons of olive oil and 16-packs of canned produce you’re buying will go bad before you ever have the chance to eat them. So keeping this info in mind what’s the worst thing you can put in your cart when you’re shopping at the members-only store?

Fresh Produce

How could you pass up the chance to buy a giant package of lettuce or a bag of avocados for something like just $5? Fresh produce is best eaten...well fresh-and chances are your fresh produce will lose its nutritional potency or rot before you're able to consume it.

""Costco produce is always sold in bulk"" explains Kelsey Pezzuti MS RD retail dietitian and nutrition expert. ""The 4lb box of tomatoes may seem like a bargain but if you don't have a big household you probably won't use all of them before they start going bad. You can try removing any large pieces of stem and storing the tomatoes stem-side down on a flat surface to buy a few days.""

Additionally a normal family is likely never going to get through the quantity of food that Costco offers especially for things like fresh produce.

If you live by yourself opting to buy Costco's 1-pound container of fresh spinach doesn't make sense-even though it's a total steal at under $5! Even when stored properly fresh spinach doesn't last much longer than a week and this holds true for other popular fresh produce items such as blueberries avocados broccoli and cucumbers.

Unless you gorge yourself on fruits and veggies you'll end up throwing out the bulk of what you just bought.

Shutterstock

On the flip side of things buying something unhealthy at Costco means ""you'll be stuck with ALOT of it and this can make it tempting to eat it all even if you shouldn't"" warns Heather Hanks a nutritionist with Life Insurance Star.

This might include something like a Costco-sized supply of Jif peanut butter which equals two jars (48 oz). ""The problem with Jif peanut butter is that it contains sugar molasses and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil which are three inflammatory ingredients that can lead to weight gain blood sugar problems hormonal imbalances and more"" Heather adds.

The bottom line? Watch what you're buying in bulk and when it comes to fresh produce maybe just think through what you need for the week ahead of you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3NsdGFibGV0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzI3L25ldy1idXNpbmVzc2VzLWNvbWluZy10by1jbGVybW9udC1vbi1zci01MC1jb3N0Y28tb24taHd5LTI3LXNvbmljLWRyaXZlLWluLWluLWRvd250b3duLWNsZXJtb250LWFwYXJ0bWVudC1hbmQtb2ZmaWNlLXVzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Businesses Coming To Clermont: On SR 50 (Costco) On Hwy 27 (Sonic Drive-In) In Downtown Clermont ...,"Downtown Clermont – Graff Building – Clermont City Council approved the rezoning to a Planned Unit Development (PUD) to redevelop a parcel into a three-story mixed-use project consisting of 10 residential apartments and office use.

Costco Japan is a melting pot of American and Japanese food and shopping cultures. You’ll find the chain’s U.S. staples like rotisserie chickens and blueberry muffins just a few steps from an entire row of sake and freezers full of frozen takoyaki octopus dumplings.

So when our Japanese-language reporter Mr. Sato heard that Costco Japan sells a jumbo-sized purin the Japanese custard pudding that’s near and dear to his heart he wanted it in his stomach. His desire grew even stronger when he also learned that they usually only sell it for a very limited time just one or two months out of the year.

There was just one problem: he doesn’t have a Costco membership.

Luckily a solution presented itself. A store called Stockmart recently opened up in Tokyo’s Shimokitazawa neighborhood and it’s stocked with all sorts of Costco products. You don’t need a membership to shop there either. So when Mr. Sato stopped by Stockmart he was thrilled to see they had this for sale.

At 1864 yen (US$18) this wasn’t the cheapest purin Mr. Sato had ever seen but it was the biggest. It might be lower-priced at Costco than at Stockmart but still this was a luxury he had to splurge on.

The purin was so big that he had trouble carrying it on the crowded trains and through the busy stations on his way to SoraNews24 headquarters but eventually he managed to make it to the taste-testing sanctuary.

A quick measurement showed the purin to be roughly 23 centimeters in diameter. In alternate units that converts to 9.1 inches or approximately one Sato face.

▼ “Gonna eat youuuuu!”

When in the presence of such gastronomic decadence the human mind reacts in one of two ways. Either your psyche will compel you to voraciously dig into the whole thing or the jumbo food’s majesty will instill a sense of reverence that demands you eat it in the most civilized manner possible. It was the latter on this occasion for Mr. Sato so he carefully cut himself a 1/12 slice.

Lifting the spoon to his mouth Mr. Sato almost shed a tear at the sheer volume of purin he possessed. It was a veritable continent of purin! So he was pretty startled when…

…it didn’t really taste very much like purin. “Sure the caramel sauce reminds me of eating purin” he says “but the pudding itself doesn’t have the sweetness you expect from purin and there’s actually a lot of cream cheese flavor.”

Sure enough a quick Internet search revealed that a lot of other people who’ve bought the dessert at Costco Japan think the strong cream cheese flavor is the biggest impression it leaves. That’s not necessarily a bad thing but it’s also not something usually associated with purin. “I’m not sure if I should actually call this purin or not” mused Mr. Sato and it turns out there’s actually a pretty good case for “not.”

Let’s go back to how the dessert looked in the store.

Neither the shelf placard nor the package label says プリン/purin. Instead they both say フラン or “flan.”

Flan is a baked custard dessert popular in Europe and Latin America and while it has a lot of similarities to Japanese-style purin they’re not necessarily one and the same. Primarily Japanese purin tends to be sweeter and creamier with the most prized varieties having strong eggy notes to their flavor. Flan on the other hand tends to be less overtly sweet and often uses cream cheese an ingredient rarely found in Japanese purin.

So in the end it seems like our purin-powered reporter was tripped up by chatter among sweets enthusiasts in Japan who looked at Costco’s flan and said “Yep that’s purin!” without entirely appreciating the difference. Still any time you end up with a dessert as big as your head you can’t really complain and Mr. Sato is liking the Costco flan’s mix of sweet and tart flavors for their own merits meaning he’s now both a purin proponent and a flan fan.

Due to its attention to details in following actual historical events ‘The Crown’ has raised questions about the accuracy and validity of its storyline. The amount of attention the television series had garnered caused viewers to believe that everything portrayed in the episodes was historically accurate. This article discusses the different narrative aspects of ‘The Crown’ as a television series and how these features have successfully blurred the line between what can be considered truth and fiction.

Netflix’s very own monarchs

‘The Crown’ is a 4-season historical television series written by Peter Morgan for Netflix (BBC 2014). It is based on Queen Elizabeth II’s life and covers important time periods for the British Royal Family. The television series ran for 4 seasons from 2016 until 2020 with the fifth season expected to be released in the future. Not only does the television series portray the Family’s daily activities and historical timeline but it also includes major historical turning points for the United Kingdom.

Starting with the (then) Princess Elizabeth’s marriage to Prince Philip the television series progresses to recount Queen Elizabeth’s ascension to the throne Princess Margaret’s relationship issues up until Prince Charles’ marriage to Lady Diana Spencer. The first 2 seasons were played by a different set of actors from the last 2 seasons as the characters were played by younger actors to show the Family’s earlier stages of life.

Although there has never been an official public mention of the Queen having ever watched ‘The Crown’ The Sunday Express (2020) reported that according to a senior Royal source the Queen’s youngest son Prince Edward and his wife organise viewing weekends for the family to watch the television series. Olivia Colman actress of Queen Elizabeth in seasons 3 and 4 expressed that Prince William had told her that he had not watched the television series (Sewell 2020).

On the contrary in James Corden’s interview with Prince Harry he expressed how ‘The Crown’ does not “pretend to be news” and that it is “fictional but it is loosely based on the truth” (The Late Late Show with James Corden 2021). Following this statement from a member of the Royal Family ‘The Crown’ raises questions about how much of its content can be regarded as fiction and how its viewers can distinguish between which information is fictional and which is based on reality ‘as it was’.

But then what is fiction?

According to Cohn (1999) there are various definitions of ‘fiction’ but they all have one commonality: fiction is something invented. She further suggests that fiction has the property of being non-referential meaning that a work of fiction can refer to the real world outside of the text but is not required to do so.

Fiction as a non-referential narrative can be related to two identifying characteristics. Firstly the references to the real world are not obliged to be accurate and secondly the work of fiction does not exclusively relate to the real world. Upon being included in fictional texts references to the real world are fictionalised and “contaminated from within” (Cohn 1999) the fictional text.

According to Cohn the narratives that can be debated in light of whether they represent the truth or not are historical works biographies journalistic accounts and autobiographies. That is because these forms of narratives tend to have blurry distinctions between truth and fiction since they try to include and represent historical events that happened in the past. Consumers of fiction should ideally be able to recognise that it is only an ‘as if’ representation of the real world.

In the case of ‘The Crown’ its similarity to a biography allows for the television series to be judged for the accuracy of its content. In fact if the television series includes too much fictional content it places the Royal Family as mere characters of the television series meaning that the television series is not valid to be cited when talking about the Royal Family’s history. Even though the television series is roughly based on the United Kingdom’s real history and Royal Family smaller details such as what the characters say what they do and the design of the set may not be 100% accurate. Therefore using Cohn’s idea of fiction as being non-referential ‘The Crown’ does not solely refer to the real world and thus is not obliged to portray full accuracy in its details hence this makes ‘The Crown’ a work of fiction.

In Figure 2 above we can see the re-enacted wedding rehearsal scene in ‘The Crown’. Although what the actors were wearing seem closely similar to what Prince Charles and Princess Diana were actually wearing we can clearly see the differences between the design and colour of outfits. It is useful for actors to use outfits as similar as possible to the actual outfits to help viewers of the television series recognise the event being referred to and feel some sort of familiarity with both the event and characters.

Of course it is beneficial for the television series to have highly similar sets or outfits but the television series is not obliged to refer to the real world for various reasons. Some outfits may have been specifically made for the Royal Family making it a one-of-a-kind item. It is also prohibited to film in the Family’s private premises such as the Queen’s bedroom so designers of ‘The Crown’ have to design their own sets. In the details of the television series there are suggestions of reality: most likely from photographs past events reportages and outfits.

So what do we categorise ‘The Crown’ as?

One of the ways we can refer to ‘The Crown’ is by calling it a ‘docudrama’. Docudramas are produced in the form of motion pictures (films TV shows etc) that intentionally contain both documentary and fictional content functioning as either dramatisation or re-enactment of historical events (Rhodes & Springer 2006). This means that docudramas blur the boundary between their fictional and documentary (factual) content making it harder to have a clear distinction between fictional and non-fictional facts in film and media.

The attempt of docudramas to recreate factual events involves the use of cinematic methods. Its narrative is arranged in particular manners with “visual compositions that facilitate audience identification with the “characters”” (Rhodes & Springer 2006). Thus docudramas are differentiated from documentaries: documentaries aim to show the real world objectively while docudramas do not. Docudramas use techniques and aesthetics of narrative fiction to represent their narrative and “the careers of significant national/international figures” (Lipkin Paget Roscoe 2006).

There are various ways in which docudramas try to connect the factual events to the re-enactments described by Rhodes & Springer (2006). One way is by constructing resemblances of actors’ appearances settings and event timeline to make the re-enactment feel more true and real. ‘The Crown’ tries to imitate the Royal Family with its choice of actors (see Figure 3 below) their accents body language and mannerisms. The television series has its own dialect coach with whom the actors learnt to imitate the Royal Family’s accents. For example Claire Foy who played Queen Elizabeth in the first two seasons practised shortening her ‘thank you’s' to be ‘thenk yu’s' (Laneri 2017) adhering to the Queen's idiolect that is how she pronounces her words.

Another way of re-enacting the real events is by the interaction between actual and re-created elements such as filming at the actual location where the event originally took place. In the case of ‘The Crown’ most filming locations were indeed different from where the event actually took place but on sites similar-looking to the real locations. Scenes of Buckingham Palace were filmed in different locations- Lancaster House and the Greenwich Naval College- instead of Buckingham Palace.

But the television series has also integrated original filming locations. See Prince Charles’ investiture scene of season 3 episode 6 in Figure 4 below. It was filmed in Caernarfon Castle in Wales- the actual place of the coronation (Roberts & Mackelden 2020). This adds another layer of authenticity to the television series as it is invested in showing viewers facts and scenes as close to the truth as possible.

One element mentioned by Rhodes and Springer (2006) that was not included in ‘The Crown’ is alternating between using re-created and actual footage. In scenes where the characters of the show are watching television such as the Duke of Windsor watching Queen Elizabeth’s coronation footage in the television seems to highly resemble actual footage that aired in real life. There is no explanation from the writers of ‘The Crown’ about whether the television footage was real-life footage or a re-enactment.

Instead of actual footage the television series included accurate re-enactments of speeches script-wise. An example is shown in the comparison video below. This example of an authentic dialogue again portrays the television series’ attempt at authenticity and verisimilitude. Verisimilitude can be defined as “the quality of resembling reality” (Literary Terms n.d.). Something can be regarded to have verisimilitude when they resemble reality. The usage of verisimilitude is important as it helps the television series bring its viewers further into the world of ‘The Crown’ and eventually affect viewers to have an emotional attachment to the television series.

Filmmakers use the elements mentioned in this section- and sometimes even more- to minimise the differences between truth and fiction. With casts that resemble the original characters and speak or act similarly viewers are invited to imagine the actors to be the real members of the Royal Family and make them think that whatever the actors are doing or saying are true. Similarly using actual footage or filming in the actual location where the event occurred provides viewers with a sense of originality and authenticity of the television series given that historical events cannot be duplicated. But this is not always possible in the sense that some filming locations are not for public use such as Buckingham Palace.

‘The Crown’ had portrayed another feature of docudramas: it illustrates events or issues to its viewers to initiate discourses about them (Lipkin Paget Roscoe 2006). By being as similar as possible to the actual events and characters motion pictures such as ‘The Crown’ makes it arguably harder for viewers to figure out where the narrative strays away from the actual truth. This results in viewers wanting to follow the television series’ storyline know more about the actual events and motivates them to do their research.‘The Crown’ also motivates discourses about history and lets viewers be reminded of them.

Untangling The Crown’s narrative

Other than being a docudrama ‘The Crown’ can also be considered as a mix of ‘serial’ and ‘series’. In a serial the storyline does not conclude after each episode but continues throughout the season. On the contrary storylines in a series conclude at the end of each episode (Nannicelli 2009). ‘The Crown’ is composed of both properties of ‘serial’ and ‘series’ where some storylines conclude at the end of an episode but others conclude at the end of a season. This mixture of ‘The Crown’ being both ‘serial’ and ‘series’ results in what is called narrative complexity.

Narrative complexity consists of a balance between ‘serial’ and ‘series’. It rejects the idea of having to conclude a narrative within one episode and by making the narrative more complex. ‘The Crown’ becomes an example of a show provoking its viewers to be engaged in the television series. Narrative complexity also requires viewers to pay attention to the storyline by using different strategies.

As previously mentioned ‘The Crown’ currently has 4 seasons with the fifth season forthcoming. This long narrative allows the television series’ writers to focus on smaller details of the whole narrative such as Prince Philip’s struggle to adapt to the Royal ways of living in season 1 and Princess Diana’s battle with bulimia in season 4. By inserting details that mirror “everydayness” in their plot that other motion pictures leave out ‘The Crown’ is able to assure people of the depth of knowledge the writers have about the Royal Family and that the story they produce in these episodes is closest to the truth because of the amount of detail included.

The second strategy is multi-threading of their narrative. This means that there are “multiple layering of narrative threads within and across episodes and series” (Nannicelli 2009). Each season in ‘The Crown’ is made of multiple plots intertwined together allowing writers to focus on different historical events realistically “without giving viewers the sense that the major storyline has been interrupted” (Nannicelli 2009). Multi-threading also seems more authentic because realistically there is always more than one issue to be solved.

As a result of the layering of narratives viewers are expected to stay attentive while watching and actively engage in the plot. Sometimes it is required for viewers to make their own interpretations and connections between the plots especially regarding why a character is acting a certain way which affects the outcome of one narrative. Without staying engaged viewers will fail to fully understand the storyline and eventually lose interest in the television series.

One other reason why viewers have to be attentive to the storyline is because of the many characters coming and going in each season. The character of Tommy Lascelles initially appeared in nine of the ten episodes of the first season but had only appeared in one episode of season 3 (The Crown Wiki n.d.). Other characters such as the Prime Ministers also come and go and without paying attention to the storyline viewers will fail to recognize these characters.

Moreover ‘The Crown’ does not utilise recapping devices (“previously on…”) as a way to further engage its viewers. As storylines get picked up and resume in different episodes viewers have to be active to remember and connect the storylines themselves.

‘The Crown’ is fiction

Sometimes it becomes rather challenging for people to distinguish between facts that are true and facts that are fiction when facts begin to resemble what they think is true (Viner 2016). The fastest way for ‘The Crown’ viewers to factcheck whether something shownon the television series is made up or not is through the Internet.

In this article we have discussed how ‘The Crown’ had challenged the notion of ‘truth’ to fulfil its role as a work of ‘fiction’. We have also seen the different strategies used by docudramas like ‘The Crown' that enables it to blur the boundary between truth and fiction and the different features of narrative complexity that keep its viewers engaged.

We can conclude that ‘The Crown’ falls under the category of both docudramas and a mixture of series and serial. Through narrative complexity ‘The Crown’ has allowed viewers to know more about the British Royal family. Although authenticity bleeds through one’s screen as they watch ‘The Crown’ in the end it is a hybrid work of fiction.

Elected crown guard Zsigmond Perényi Báró said the following:

""Your Excellency the President Gentlemen! Deeply t. Parliament! (Let's hear! Let's hear!) With deep respect I thank my fellow Crown Guard and myself for the supreme decision of His Excellency the Lord Governor for deigning to nominate us for the dignity of Crown Guard. And we gratefully thank both Houses of the National Assembly assembled for the honor of electing us. Nowadays the guarding of the Crown is not as important as it was in the past when our ancestors guarded and defended it in castles during hostile wars. But we still do not consider the guarding of the Crown to be a mere formality an ornament that does not mean an obligation. We want to preserve and nurture those sacred noble traditions that are linked to the Holy Crown (Correction) the great idea of ​​national unity and belonging.

Even under the Árpáds the main accessory of the royal power was the Holy Crown and only the one who was crowned with the Crown was considered a legitimate king. From this the specific Hungarian public law concept arose voluntarily that the Holy Crown was the true source and symbol of the reign the supreme power and right the possession of the entire territory of the country (It is so! It is so!) and that the whole donating nobility was a member of the Holy For a crown. This formed the flow of his whole body: totum corpus sacrae coronae. Now in our time all Hungarians are equally members of the Crown (That's right! That's right!) with the same rights regardless of origin wealth or religion. (That's right! That's right!) The only difference between us is in our obligations (That's right! That's right!) because we want more from those who are stronger and richer. (That's right! That's right!)

Deeply t. Parliament! Throughout the centuries of Hungarian history the Holy Crown was surrounded by a deep religious grace Christian legends and chronicles proclaimed it and believers believed with strong faith that the Crown was miraculously bestowed by the apostolic head of the church by divine inspiration and angelic intervention. We still believe the Crown is sacred. A dwarf people who do not look up to noble ideals with respect who disregard their past (That's right! That's right!) and thus degrade themselves their race. (That's right! That's right!) But a happy nation is and only that nation has a future which preserves the traditions and ideals of the past even in the midst of the storms of fate. (That's right! That's right!) Because the past is the solid foundation on which to build and ideals encourage work struggle and sacrifice. The Holy Crown proclaims agreement community and peace among Hungarians. And when the time comes in the spirit of our constitution without external influence or coercion by putting party and private interests aside the universal nation will be called to realize the historic vocation of the Holy Crown. (Lively cheers.)

Deeply t. Parliament! Today both houses of the National Assembly wore festive decorations this decoration means deep respect for the Holy Crown but it does not mean joy and celebration. Hungarians used to have a holiday of joy and today we don't have a holiday either (That's right! That's right!) because suffering and pain pervade this country. But we are not discouraged because we trust in the just God (It is so! It is so!) and we know and believe that pain forges strong souls and great deeds. And if a new Hungarian life arises from the strong souls then everything that today is a prayer a desire and a will will come true and blossom again in its old glory the happy and glorious country of St. Stephen's crown. (Prolonged lively cheering and applause.)

László Almásy : T. Parliament! The ceremonial inauguration of the newly elected crown guards will take place this afternoon at 12:45 in the royal palace. I invite the upper house members and representatives assembled in the parliament to deign to march to this ceremony as a body.""

This is how the last peacetime crown guard election took place. The next and last one happened already in 1942 during the World War...

In 1938 during the commemorative year of St. Stephen's jubilee the Holy Crown was put on public display.

""As a symbol of the kingdom the Holy Crown was last exhibited to the public in 1938 on the occasion of the commemorative year of Saint Stephen. At 8:30 a.m. on August 16 the head of Horthy's cabinet office the prime minister the state secretary of the prime minister's office the secretary of the council of ministers and the two crown guards appeared in the crown guard guard room next to the armory. The crown guard lined up the commander and sub-commander of the crown guard appeared. After the report was made the armory was opened then the chest containing the crown and insignia was taken to the marble hall of the Castle Palace and placed on an ornate platform. The two crown guards sat in the armchairs placed on the platform behind them stood the commander and deputy commander of the crown guard. Three members of the Crown Guard in full regalia stood guard on both sides of the platform. The public inspection lasted from 8 am to 8 pm on August 16-17 and from 9 am to 6 pm on the 19th. (It was paused on August 18 as the Crown Guards participated in the festive session of the Parliament in Székesfehérvár.)

During the three days of the public viewing 88000 people saw the crown. It was seen by the German and Italian military delegation staying in Budapest Faruk of Egypt with her two daughters; Cardinal Pacelli prayed before him  the later XII. Pope Pius too. During the public inspection the researchers could also conduct a shorter examination but they were not allowed to use artificial light for photography and they were not allowed to touch the crown with their hands. At the same time the competent specialists also took measurements for the production of the new crown case and cases.

István Petrás took photographs of our national relic. At 6:00 p.m. on August 19 1938 the crown and the coronation badges were returned to their safekeeping places by the same people who were present at the exception three days earlier. The silk tapestry covering the casket was sealed with the seals of the governor the prime minister the two crown guards and the secretary of the council of ministers. The iron chest and the chest containing the coronation robes were then returned to the vault. The crown guard saluted with weapons and the prime minister and the two crown guards closed the chamber.""

It is famous for its impressive enclosed castle walls and for exhibiting an original copy of the Magna Carta but less people may be aware that Lincoln Castle also has its own prison on the grounds.

There are two prison buildings close to the East Gate of the castle one dating back to the Georgian era and one more recently to the Victorians.

The castle was used as a secure site to build the earlier Georgian prison building which dates to 1787 and was used as debtors prison.

Those thrown in cells here had to raise the money they owed to be let back out and the prison was then run as a private enterprise meaning beds and extra food came at an added costs to prisoners.

Madeleine Hawkins duty manager at Lincoln Castle said: ""It meant prisoners ran further into debt because everything was charged.

""The front wing of the building is where we now have school visits the cafe and the shop. There was a small wing here for felons when it was used but that was not big enough and eventually the Victorian prison was built.

""The Victorian prison used the separate system which was not very long-lived in this country. The criminals were not allowed to mix - essentially to stop them becoming better criminals so they couldn't associate with each other.

""It was mainly one person to a cell for 23 hours a day and they were not allowed to speak to anyone.""

The thinking behind the separate system was essentially that time spent alone could help prisoners reflect on their decisions and become better citizens.

The Victorian prison - which has separate wings for women and men - was used from 1848 to 1878 and coincided with the establishment of the neighbouring Lincoln Crown Court at the castle in 1823.

It also features the only original remaining separate system prison chapel in the world.

While the prison was closed in 1878 and replaced by HMP Lincoln which opened six years earlier the Crown Court still operates at Lincoln Castle today.

The prison's capacity is shown to vary during its use. At times as many as four prisoners were kept in cells - effectively making the separate system void - and at other periods there were as little as four prisoners in the whole facility.

It was used to film scenes in earlier episodes of Downton Abbey and also in Call the Midwife.

A notorious felon who stayed at the prison is Joseph Ralph who is the only man who is recorded as having been chained while serving a punishment in the dark room.

He escaped from the prison twice - including an ingenious attempt where he lifted a key of a card and imprinted it in bread to make a mould.

Lincolnshire Live recently visited the prison to take a look inside. Take a look at the images below for a glimpse at how prisoners from previous centuries lived.

The city agreed to preserve the structure — the last remaining train station on the lower Virginia Peninsula from the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad’s expansion into Warwick County — and has spent more than 20 years transforming it into a space that would tell the story of the railroad and the county.

It took 10 years to navigate the red tape and raise funds to move the depot 165 feet to the other side of the train tracks.

But moving the depot was just the first stop in the city’s journey to transform the former train station into a place where people could come to learn about the history of the railroad and its role in changing rural Warwick County into the modern city of Newport News.

The depot was moved over the course of three days during the summer of 2009 and the city and Lee Hall Train Station Foundation switched their focus to restoring the outside of the building followed by upgrades to the interior.

The current phase is creating exhibits where the community can come to learn about the railroad and Lee Hall village.

“The focus of that space is to help people understand the importance of rail service to a community” said Mary Kayaselcuk the historic site coordinator. “It’s an American story — throughout the country whenever rail service arrived it changed a rural landscape or an environment.”

The inside renovations to make the space comfortable and functional are finished and about 60% of the exhibits are complete.

Grants offered the project $2.27 million and the city provided $737899.88. With no additional grant funding available money for the exhibits has come through donations.

“We’re working to get our fundraising back on track because the pandemic stopped all of that and we weren’t able to have public meetings” said Kenneth L. Jones president of the Lee Hall Train Station Foundation. “When that happened we lost a lot of momentum so we’re trying to get the momentum and interest built back.”

The ticket office welcomes visitors at the Lee Hall Depot the 1880s Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad hub has been restored and is open to the public with new interactive displays. As seen Tuesday June 15 2021.

The city hosted a soft-opening for the gallery June 5 and offered free admission every Saturday in June. An official grand opening is anticipated in late summer or early fall.

The Lee Hall Station — built in the 1880s — was one of five stations in Warwick County as part of the C&O Railroad’s effort to connect the Ohio River Valley with the sea. The station was built on Warwick Road now known as Warwick Boulevard and it connected the Warwick Courthouse with Williamsburg and Yorktown.

Kayaselcuk said she and the team have never seen photographs of the inside of the station when it was in operation. They’ve relied on pictures from and visits to other C&O stations to keep the interpretations accurate.

All of the artifacts are from C&O railroad — the station wasn’t used by any other company — and Kayaselcuk said it was important to her to keep exhibits authentic.

CSX formerly C&O Railroad left behind a few waiting room benches and tools but the city and Lee Hall Train Station Foundation have spent years acquiring the other artifacts. Some were donated by people in the community others had to be purchased.

One of the items — an old telephone — came from someone who picked it up as a boy when CSX was giving things from the old station away Kayaselcuk said.

The boy a newspaper carrier rode his bicycle with a friend from downtown Newport News to Lee Hall and carried the phone back in a basket on his bike.

“People have waited 20 years for this project so they’re excited that it’s finally come to fruition and it’s going to be a resource for the community to use and enjoy” Kayaselcuk said.

The depot also features a model of the Railway Express office which was the precursor to FedEx and UPS.

“When the Railway Express was in operation you didn’t have superhighways you didn’t have airplanes” Jones said. “If you wanted to move anything you weren’t going to get it very far in a horse and wagon so people put things on trains.”

Trains carried everything from money to livestock to household goods for people.

“Railroads were the length that built this country” Jones said. “When the automobile came in it was the next step up in the evolutionary process of transportation and it allowed more freedom.”

The Railway Express lost its popularity as new ways to move goods emerged.

One of the things that made the Lee Hall Depot unique was that it offered living quarters for the station master and his family — if he had one. Station masters usually were single men.

“It was unusual but this was a rural station and an active one. It was probably one of the most active ones within the county” Kayaselcuk said.

The second floor remodel features interpretations of the kitchen and parlor where he would have lived.

The upstairs parlor at the Lee Hall Depot the 1880s Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad hub has been restored and is open to the public with new interactive displays. As seen Tuesday June 15 2021.

A third room upstairs which is not yet complete will interpret the village of Lee Hall around 1920 and compare it to the area today.

“The village of Lee Hall was never super large but nonetheless the families of Warwick County are notable” Kayaselcuk said.

The depot tells the story of village enterprises including H.M. Clements General Merchandise which offered items such as dry goods hardware equipment that could be rented for farming.

“He mentioned in some of his correspondence that he did so well serving the soldiers and the local people that after the first World War he built himself a fine new brick home on Yorktown Road” Kayaselcuk said. “If you look out the room where we’re interpreting this you can see his house a couple hundred yards away.”

The railroad played a part in transporting troops from World War I to the Vietnam era. Clements made his riches as more than 100000 soldiers passed through the area during World War II on their way to Fort Eustis and from the citizens that would ride through the area.

Kayaselcuk is working to create a replica of what his store might have looked like with items that would have been found in general stores from 1900-1930s such as boxed goods laundry items advertising signs a ledger book and feed flour peanut sacks and ham bags.

One of the completed elements is a children’s room — Chessie’s Place — named for the C&O Railroad’s mascot a cat named Chessie. The feline first appeared in advertisements in 1933 saying the ride was so smooth passengers would “sleep like a kitten.”

The room features a Chessie train car as well as a cutout of the kitten. It has interactive activities for children including books toy trains puzzles books music and crafts. There’s also an overhead elevated railway with trains.

“It’s an excellent place to bring young kids school-aged kids especially because this virtual stuff isn’t as effective as actually seeing and putting your hands on something” Jones said. “It’s a chance to see how people had to operate before the present time — back when they didn’t have cellphones or computers.”

A waiting room built in 1918 will be repurposed to tell the story of the five original stations in Warwick County and introduce visitors to the people who lived in Warwick County and how the rail service changed their lives.

“There are lots and lots of great stories — very rich stories — to share with visitors that will help them understand the significance of each of these stations and how rail service came not only to be important to Warwick County but how it impacted our community to such an extent that a very rural agricultural area eventually transitioned into the modern city of Newport News” Kayaselcuk said.

The project will incorporate several audio and visual elements expected to take a few more years to complete and more donations to fund it.

The Lee Hall Station Foundation has spent the past few years restoring a caboose built in 1980 that they found that was slated to be scrapped. They’re hoping to have the train on the model tracks outside the depot later this summer.

But the Ram wasn’t alone the team pinned it against the 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD Crew Cab 4×4 with a 6.6-liter Duramax V8 turbodiesel under the hood.

While both pickups feature 3/4-ton capacity and turbodiesel engine they are very much different as they are alike. The 2021 Ram 2500 Limited Night Edition’s 6.7-liter Cummins inline-six turbodiesel delivers 370 horsepower and 850 lb.-ft. of torque and is mated to the highly questionable 6-speed 68RFE automatic transmission. The combination is good for 20000 lbs. of towing and a 2000 lbs. of payload.

Chevrolet’s Silverado 2500HD Z-71 Sport Edition’s 6.6-liter Duramax turbodiesel produces more horsepower and torque respectfully. The Duramax pumps out 445 horsepower and 910 lb.-ft. of torque and is paired with a 10-speed Alison automatic transmission. The specific truck that the TFLTruck team has is rated to tow 18500 lbs. and has a payload of over 3000 lbs.

The Ike Gauntlet involves both a downhill decent testing braking capabilities as well as a grueling climb with elevations in excess of 11153 feet a 7% increasing grade up an 8-mile stretch of I-70 near Denver Colorado. But how do both trucks hold up on the “Ike Gauntlet” TFLTruck’s signature towing stress test?

That said one would be hard-pressed to fill up a job vacancy with requirements seeking a female mechanic that doubles as a content creator. Enter the Cummins Cowgirl who is precisely that and about as close as it gets to a career paradox. However not only has she succeeded in balancing both extremes but she has done so with an additional dash of flair.

Chloe Yonker popularly known on social media as The Cummins Cowgirl is a social media influencer content creator and heavy-duty diesel mechanic. It certainly has not been simply a bed of roses for the trucks and engines connoisseur. The transition from a regular 9-to-5 job to an industry that is not usually associated with females was difficult. Additionally she had to overcome a lot of internal struggles and naysayers to stick with her dream.

Chloe began from scratch wrenching on semi-trucks for a living while she learned all she could through sweat and tears; and now she owns her own shop and works on her own vehicles. Beneath her charming smile and easygoing personality lies a steely resolve that makes her take on any challenge head-on. “I wanted to be independent without working for another company so I could have more freedom of where I go who I work with and just build my own brand.”

She was also inspired by the successes of other female entrepreneurs and mechanics on social media. It was the fusion of both ideas that brought about the next phase of her evolution.

Chloe lives by a mantra “Work hard. Then work even harder.” And for her it boils down to getting creative with a niche and exploring different ways to monetize it. Social media paved the way and it was not long before the Cummins Cowgirl started gaining traction for her captivating videos and pictures and rapidly amassed a following of almost a million people across all of her platforms.

Although she has never worked internationally her growing popularity has transcended borders and it was but a natural progression to begin selling merchandise to buyers in Mexico Australia Turkey Sweden and a host of other countries.

With her sizable and ever-increasing following coupled with creativity and ingenuity she has attracted the attention of multiple brands across the globe. This was where she made another leap in her evolution by becoming a partner with various brands lining up marketing/advertising content.

At this stage in her journey she deftly embodies beauty brains and business brawn and has made herself into a household name.

Through all her successes The Cummins Cowgirl has always had one thing going—her unwavering authenticity. She makes it her mission to be a light and to positively impact everyone she meets. “I think being 100% genuine is the biggest thing. So much of social media is fake and it is a breath of fresh air when someone is just real and genuine and that is what I strive to be. It costs zero dollars to be a good person.”

In the coming years Chloe hopes to own a full automotive customization shop working on vehicles from multiple customers especially vintage cars and custom builds. She hopes to impact the younger generation of ladies and inspire them to achieve their dreams while still being a “badass babe” every day.

His New Book Keeps Its Stories Alive,"The town of Earle Ark. is disappearing.

Or at least that's what it looked like to photographer Eugene Richards.

/ Eugene Richards / Eugene Richards Joseph Perry on a farm in Marianna Ark. ""I was raised up on a segregated system. I got 'Colored' on my goddamn birth certificate right now"" Perry told Richards.

In the postscript of his new book the day i was born Richards writes about returning to the area in 2019 after years away and noticing the overwhelming presence of absence:

No men and women picking cotton. No old folks on the porch staring out at you. No children running and jumping around. The sharecropper shacks that were here 50 years ago have vanished. Once there were four or five of them every couple of miles — tin roofs plastic sheeting over the windows front yards rutted with tire tracks littered with rusted-out cars bed springs things that once meant a lot to someone but didn't any longer.

/ Eugene Richards / Eugene Richards Earle Ark. is about 30 miles northwest of Memphis Tenn. In addition to working in cotton fields and mills many people in the Delta worked in manufacturing jobs producing everything from Christmas ornaments to truck tires. But as commercial soybean farms overtook small cotton farms and manufacturing jobs moved overseas people in the Delta had to go elsewhere for work.

In the book that epilogue is the only time we hear Richards' voice. The rest of the text to accompany his photos are the first-hand accounts of six people all of whom are Black over 50 and most have lived in Earle for much of their lives: Joseph Perry Jr. Stacy Abram Lovell Davis Jackie Greer Timothy Way and Jessie Mae Maples. The photos capture daily life for these six as well as other Earle residents in addition to the stark and impoverished landscape of the Delta.

/ Eugene Richards / Eugene Richards Eugene Richards photographed Cummins Prison Farm in Grady Ark. in 1970.

Though the town may look to Richards like it's fading its history is very much alive. In preserving them in the day i was born Richards ensures that these stories — of racism and segregation of voter suppression of homophobia of poverty of gun violence and police brutality — won't also disappear.

""I was walking down the street one day and [Abram] pulled up gave that job to me"" Way said in the day i was born. ""I mean he thought I was totally weird the clothing and all. 'Yeah you'll paint the freedom fighters on my walls those against discrimination.' And we started from there.""

Richards' relationship with the Arkansas Delta goes back decades. He first arrived in the Delta in 1969 as a VISTA volunteer. VISTA which stands for Volunteers in Service to America was designed to be the domestic version of the Peace Corps. Richards who is white spent three years in the Delta working in predominantly Black communities as a social worker and a photographer and also running a small community newspaper. He looks back on that time not in a self-congratulatory way but as a matter of course. In an interview with NPR he remembered ""because of the Vietnam War happening and Dr. King happening and the assassinations all happening all the time you took the admonitions to get involved quite seriously. And that was it. So it isn't something that you think about later. It became kind of natural.""

/ Eugene Richards / Eugene Richards ""My mom told me that before I came out of her womb I woke my dad up. I was crying inside of her. He asked her 'What that hollering?' She said 'It's the baby.' So he gotten up about 1:00 got the midwife and they delivered me"" Abram told Richards.

the day i was born almost came about as an accident. In 2019 Richards was working on a project about abandoned houses for a large newspaper and went back to the Delta for material. Then he said ""I drifted over into Earle because I was curious about what the towns look like today that I remembered from a long time ago."" Following Main Street he came to an appliance store covered in paintings of people like Huey P. Newton Angela Davis Malcolm X and Tupac Shakur.

When Richards entered the store a couple days later he was greeted by owner Stacy Abram and the two struck up a conversation. Richards had a recorder and he turned it on while Abram told him about a childhood with an imprisoned father a job as a teenager at the cotton gin and the first days of schools integrating. Soon Lovell Davis entered the store and told Richards about growing up as best friends with Abram about going to school hungry about his own time in prison after robbing a bank. Timothy Way an eccentric gay man who painted the freedom fighter portraits on the store also showed up and shared his life stories with Richards. ""So it wasn't like I searched people out"" Richards said. ""I never thought about any kind of book at the time. But the storytelling was so direct and compelling.""

When he returned home to New York City and turned in the photographs and the interviews to the newspaper he'd been working for he never heard any response. ""You have to create your own narrative when you don't hear from anybody"" Richards said. He figured his dispatch from Earle had fallen flat with his editors. ""So the narrative was everything sucked and I didn't think it did. I knew there were stories there.""

/ Eugene Richards / Eugene Richards Pastor Oglesby Shiloh MB Church in Crawfordsville Ark. 10 miles from Earle.

He decided to make a book of the work. ""I kind of went overboard"" he said. ""It could've been a tiny book. But the [subjects] deserve a really nice book.""

The stories are all too familiar today mirroring incidents that have sparked national conversations and worldwide demonstrations. ""It's not only this town it's the world."" says Lovell Davis in the book's epigraph.

/ Eugene Richards / Eugene Richards U.S. Marine Hughes Arkansas 1970

In 1970 a group of about 150 Black residents — including Jackie Greer and Jessie Mae Maples — marched to city hall to protest the continued segregation of the schools. A group of about 30 white people showed up supported by local police with clubs and guns and descended on the protestors. They fired shots grazing Greer's head and critically injuring Maples. No charges were ever filed against the white assailants but Greer's husband — the Rev. Ezra Greer who was beaten by the mob and suffered a broken arm — was charged with inciting a riot.

/ Eugene Richards / Eugene Richards ""My mom and my father [farmed]"" Jackie Greer said in the day i was born. ""And later on my mother was a maid housekeeper babysitter you name it. And from that my mother and father sent me to school.""

""In these little towns people rose up without any support"" Richards said. ""I mean nobody was coming in from other places. It wasn't like protests now when people come from all over. All these people stood up in their little towns all by themselves.""

""The march it's mostly forgotten"" Greer says later in the book. ""Earle is nothing but a little out-of-the-way place that most people haven't heard anything about. We never did really get much news coverage. We're too far from Little Rock. And in Memphis unless there's a murder they hardly holler didn't bother about coming.""

/ Eugene Richards / Eugene Richards Eugene Richards titled this photograph of Timothy Way ""the real me."" In the day i was born Way says ""In every community they do things tradition-wise use religion to cover up all the heartaches the slavery and poverty that they went through. And the church makes them the Black community reject homosexuality what they feel God says is sin.""

the day i was born provides more than just coverage; it's an oral history straight from those who lived through it and live through it still.

""What people went through before was not at all dissimilar. But how brave they were to be doing it all by themselves"" Richards said.

United States pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay up to $230m to resolve claims the company helped drive an opioid crisis the New York state attorney general said on Saturday.

Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that “the opioid epidemic has wreaked havoc on countless communities across New York state and the rest of the nation leaving millions still addicted to dangerous and deadly opioids.

“Johnson & Johnson helped fuel this fire but today they’re committing to leaving the opioid business – not only in New York but across the entire country. Opioids will no longer be manufactured or sold in the United States by J&J” James said.

“We are also delivering up to $230 million to fund opioid prevention treatment and education efforts across New York state.”

The deal involves a lawsuit brought by James in 2019 and removes Johnson & Johnson from a trial that is slated to begin next week on Long Island.

It is part of a slew of litigation over an epidemic linked to nearly 500000 deaths during the last twenty years.

“So effectively by paying the settlement money [Johnson & Johnson] has removed itself from a trial that is utterly unprecedented in terms of its scope” Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna reported from Washington DC. Hanna added that the upcoming trial will be by jury – something that has “never happened before in this type of case”.

In its own statement on Saturday Johnson & Johnson downplayed the attorney general’s announcement. It said the settlement involved two prescription painkillers – developed by a subsidiary and accounting for less than 1 percent of the market – that are already no longer sold in the US.

The settlement was “not an admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company” Johnson & Johnson said. It added that its actions “relating to the marketing and promotion of important prescription pain medications were appropriate and responsible”.

The company also said the settlements were consistent with its prior agreement to pay $5bn to settle opioid claims by states cities counties and tribal governments nationwide.

The healthcare company and the largest US drug distributors – AmerisourceBergen Corp Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp – have proposed paying a combined $26bn to end thousands of opioid lawsuits.

Tuesday’s opioids trial is one of several scheduled for this year with others under way in California and West Virginia.

West Virginia has the nation’s highest fatal opioid overdose rate. Overdoses have surged since the early 2000s when producers of prescription drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone ramped up sales through pharmacies and doctors with few controls.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said nearly 500000 people died from opioid overdoses from 1999 to 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9qai1yZWFjaGVzLTIzMC1tbG4tb3Bpb2lkLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1uZXcteW9yay1zdGF0ZS0yMDIxLTA2LTI2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J&J to pay $263 mln in New York opioid settlements avoids trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-reaches-230-mln-opioid-settlement-with-new-york-state-2021-06-26/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9qai1yZWFjaGVzLTIzMC1tbG4tb3Bpb2lkLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1uZXcteW9yay1zdGF0ZS0yMDIxLTA2LTI2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5yZGMub3JnL2Jpby9taXJpYW0tcm90a2luLWVsbG1hbi9mbGVhLWNvbGxhci1jaGVtaWNhbHMtYXJlLXBvaXNvbmluZy1raWRzLWFuZC1wZXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flea Collar Chemicals Are Poisoning Kids and Pets,"All of us want to keep our children and pets safe. So what do we do when EPA allows the sale of products that jeopardize the health of our kids and pets across the country?

Nearly two-thirds of people in the U.S. own pets and 95% of pet owners consider their pets to be members of the family. So it’s no surprise that consumers were shocked in March when they learned that nearly 1700 pets had died from exposure to pesticides in Seresto flea collars which are sold across the country. The EPA received 75000 incident reports documenting pet harms associated with the collars according to documents uncovered in a USA Today study with the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting yet did nothing to protect pets. Unfortunately Seresto collars aren’t the only dangerous flea collars.

But here’s some good news: some retailers are protecting pets and their families. Petsmart (the nation's largest pet retailer) under pressure from NRDC has stopped selling products containing another dangerous pesticide tetrachlorvinphos (TCVP) in its retail stores and on its website. And Petco the nation's second-largest pet retailer has followed suit. Petco officially ended all sales of flea collars containing TCVP in March.

But the danger to consumers and pets still lurks in other major outlets including Walmart and Target grocers including Kroger Albertsons & Giant pharmacies including CVS Health and Rite Aid and online retailers like Amazon which all continue to sell flea collars containing tetrachlorvinphos where these collars are sold under the brand names Hartz Zodiac and Adams.

When used as intended these products are designed to leave pesticide residue on a pet’s fur to kill fleas and ticks. However that residue can rub off on anyone who pets the animal and objects the pet comes into contact with such as furniture and bedding. And young children whose developing brains are most at risk from TCVP can absorb the pesticide not only through their skin but by ingesting it since they put their hands in their mouths a lot. A 2009 NRDC report and EPA’s own assessment under the Obama administration in 2016 found that normal use of a TCVP collar left enough residue on pets’ fur to pose neurological risks to toddlers’ developing brains.

Organophosphates are a particularly dangerous family of pesticides. They’re known to damage the developing brains and nervous systems of young children toddlers and fetuses. The use of TCVP in pet flea collars is the last remaining residential use of this toxic family of chemicals; six other dangerous organophosphates once used in pet products have been removed from the market.

It is time for the EPA to stop allowing a pesticide that threatens the health of kids on pets. And while we continue to hold EPA accountable to the science through the courts responsible retailers need to follow the lead of PetSmart and Petco and remove these dangerous products from their store shelves and their websites.

We haven’t waited for courts to act or for the EPA to do its job and protect consumers. NRDC has launched market campaigns to educate major retailers about the dangers associated with TCVP and to inform the public about the hazards to children and pets that are lurking in the flea collars sold on store shelves and retail websites.

Parents and pet owners cannot wait another decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9rb3VydG5leS1rYXJkYXNoaWFuLXNpdHMtdHJhdmlzLWJhcmtlcnMtMTcyNjQwMjk1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kourtney Kardashian Sits in Travis Barker's Lap While Showing Off Her Vampire Fangs,"Getty (2) Kourtney Kardashian Travis Barker

Where's Help For Them?,"Five months after her husband died of COVID-19 Valerie Villegas can see how grief has wounded her children.

Nicholas the baby who was 1 and almost weaned when his father died now wants to nurse at all hours and calls every tall dark-haired man “Dada” the only word he knows. Robert 3 regularly collapses into furious tantrums stopped using the big-boy potty and frets about sick people giving him germs. Ayden 5 recently announced it’s his job to “be strong” and protect his mom and brothers.

Her older kids — Kai Flores 13 Andrew Vaiz 16 and Alexis Vaiz 18 — are often quiet and sad or angry and sad depending on the day. The two eldest gripped by anxiety that makes it difficult to concentrate or sleep were prescribed antidepressants soon after losing their stepfather.

“I spend half the nights crying” said Villegas 41 a hospice nurse from Portland Texas. She became a widow on Jan. 25 just three weeks after Robert Villegas 45 a strong healthy truck driver and jiujitsu expert tested positive for the virus.

“My kids they’re my primary concern” she said. “And there’s help that we need.”

But in a nation where researchers calculate that more than 46000 children have lost one or both parents to COVID since February 2020 Villegas and other survivors say finding basic services for their bereaved kids — counseling peer support groups financial assistance — has been difficult if not impossible.

“They say it’s out there” Villegas said. “But trying to get it has been a nightmare.”

Interviews with nearly two dozen researchers therapists and other experts on loss and grief as well as families whose loved ones died of COVID reveal the extent to which access to grief groups and therapists grew scarce during the pandemic. Providers scrambled to switch from in-person to virtual visits and waiting lists swelled often leaving bereft children and their surviving parents to cope on their own.

“Losing a parent is devastating to a child” said Alyssa Label a San Diego therapist and program manager with SmartCare Behavioral Health Consultation Services. “Losing a parent during a pandemic is a special form of torture.”

Children can receive survivor benefits when a parent dies if that parent worked long enough in a job that required payment of Social Security taxes. During the pandemic the number of minor children of deceased workers who received new benefits has surged reaching nearly 200000 in 2020 up from an average of 180000 in the previous three years. Social Security Administration officials don’t track cause of death but the latest figures marked the most awards granted since 1994. Covid deaths “undoubtedly” fueled that spike according to the SSA’s Office of the Chief Actuary.

And the number of children eligible for those benefits is surely higher. Only about half of the 2 million children in the U.S. who have lost a parent as of 2014 received the Social Security benefits to which they were entitled according to a 2019 analysis by David Weaver of the Congressional Budget Office.

Counselors said they find many families have no idea that children qualify for benefits when a working parent dies or don’t know how to sign up.

Scott Stephen Ball / The Florida Channel Leon County Judge John Cooper on June 30 2022 in a screen grab from The Florida Channel.

In a country that showered philanthropic and government aid on the 3000 children who lost parents to the 9/11 terror attacks there’s been no organized effort to identify track or support the tens of thousands of kids left bereaved by COVID-19.

“I’m not aware of any group working on this” said Joyal Mulheron the founder of Evermore a nonprofit foundation that focuses on public policy related to bereavement. “Because the scale of the problem is so huge the scale of the solution needs to match it.”

Covid has claimed more than 600000 lives in the U.S. and researchers writing in the journal JAMA Pediatrics calculated that for every 13 deaths caused by the virus one child under 18 has lost a parent. As of June 15 that would translate into more than 46000 kids researchers estimated. Three-quarters of the children are adolescents; the others are under age 10. About 20% of the children who’ve lost parents are Black though they make up 14% of the population.

“There’s this shadow pandemic” said Rachel Kidman an associate professor at Stony Brook University in New York who was part of the team that found a way to calculate the impact of COVID deaths. “There’s a huge amount of children who have been bereaved.”

The Biden administration which launched a program to help pay funeral costs for COVID victims did not respond to questions about offering targeted services for families with children.

Failing to address the growing cohort of bereaved children whether in a single family or in the U.S. at large could have long-lasting effects researchers said. The loss of a parent in childhood has been linked to higher risks of substance use mental health problems poor performance in school lower college attendance lower employment and early death.

“Bereavement is the most common stress and the most stressful thing people go through in their lives” said clinical psychologist Christopher Layne of the UCLA/Duke University National Center for Child Traumatic Stress. “It merits our care and concern.”

Perhaps 10% to 15% of children and others bereaved by COVID might meet the criteria of a new diagnosis prolonged grief disorder which can occur when people have specific long-lasting responses to the death of a loved one. That could mean thousands of children with symptoms that warrant clinical care. “This is literally a national very public health emergency” Layne said.

Still Villegas and others say they have been left largely on their own to navigate a confusing patchwork of community services for their children even as they struggle with their own grief.

“I called the counselor at school. She gave me a few little resources on books and stuff” Villegas said. “I called some crisis hotline. I called counseling places but they couldn’t help because they had waiting lists and needed insurance. My kids lost their insurance when their dad died.”

Valerie Villegas / The Florida Channel Leon County Judge John Cooper on June 30 2022 in a screen grab from The Florida Channel.

The social disruption and isolation caused by the pandemic overwhelmed grief care providers too. Across the U.S. nonprofit agencies that specialize in childhood grief said they have scrambled to meet the need and to switch from in-person to virtual engagement.

“It was a huge challenge; it was very foreign to the way we work” said Vicki Jay CEO of the National Alliance for Grieving Children. “Grief work is based on relationships and it’s very hard to get a relationship with a piece of machinery.”

At Experience Camps which each year offers free weeklong camps to about 1000 bereaved kids across the country the waiting list has grown more than 100% since 2020 said Talya Bosch an Experience Camps associate. “It is something that we are concerned about — a lot of kids are not getting the support they need” she said.

Private counselors too have been swamped. Jill Johnson-Young co-owner of Central Counseling Services in Riverside California said her nearly three dozen therapists have been booked solid for months. “I don’t know a therapist in the area who isn’t full right now” she said.

Dr. Sandra McGowan-Watts 47 a family practice doctor in Chicago lost her husband Steven to COVID in May 2020. She feels fortunate to have found an online therapist for her daughter Justise who helped explain why the 12-year-old was suddenly so sad in the mornings: “My husband was the one who woke her up for school. He helped her get ready for school.”

Justise was also able to get a spot at an Experience Camps session this summer. “I am nervous about going to camp but I am excited about meeting new kids who have also lost someone close in their life” she said.

Jamie Stacy 42 of San Jose California was connected with an online counselor for her daughter Grace 8 and twin sons Liam and Colm 6 after their father Ed Stacy died of COVID in March 2020 at age 52. Only then did she learn that children can grieve differently than adults. They tend to focus on concrete concerns such as where they’ll live and whether their favorite toys or pets will be there. They often alternate periods of play with sadness cycling rapidly between confronting and avoiding their feelings of loss.

“The boys will be playing Legos having a great time and all of a sudden drop a bomb on you: ‘I know how I can see Daddy again. I just have to die and I’ll see Daddy again’” she said. “And then they’re back to playing Legos.”

Stacy said counseling has been crucial in helping her family navigate a world where many people are marking the end of the pandemic. “We can’t escape the topic of COVID-19 even for one day” she said. “It’s always in our face wherever we go a reminder of our painful loss.”

Villegas in Texas has returned to her work in hospice care and is starting to reassemble her life. But she thinks there should be formal aid and grief support for families like hers whose lives have been indelibly scarred by the deadly virus.

“Now everybody’s lives are going back to normal” she said. “They can get back to their lives. And I’m thinking my life will never be normal again.”

The Shifting Retail Sales Landscape

Overall retail sales have experienced a tremendous rebound since the COVID-19 outbreak. By most measures we are back to pre-pandemic levels. However the retail landscape is ever-shifting and being redefined by a “new norm.”

Consumers return to restaurants in droves

As vaccination efforts accelerated restaurants welcomed back customers. Sales for Food Services and Drinking Places surged 68.5% YoY surpassing pre-pandemic levels. In particular Limited-Service restaurant sales grew at the highest rate since the end of 2019. For details on food sub-categories go to Food Institute Economic Benchmarking.

Balancing big-ticket items and discounts

Cars were among the top big-ticket items that Americans purchased this year. Concerns about the pandemic drove many consumers away from public transportation and toward used-car lots. Rental companies also boosted car sales by replenishing their fleets. Auto dealership sales peaked in April with 44.6% increase YoY. Car sales decelerated in May but many dealerships still expect strong demand as employees go back to work on-site.

At the same time price-conscious consumers are gravitating towards online discounts. Amazon Prime Day 2021 sales surpassed $11 billion >6% increase from last year. Many of the most popular items are everyday essentials.

Global supply crunch and retail outlook

Current supply and demand conditions are highly unusual and shouldn’t persist over the long term for a number of reasons:

The effect of fiscal stimulus is fading. Consumers are unlikely to spend more on big-ticket items. Pandemic regulations and cyberattacks presented new challenges to the global supply chain. Though carriers have deployed more ships than at any time in history the effective capacity is 25% less than what’s actually deployed because so many vessels are caught up in record bottlenecks at ports . This is likely to last for months not years. Current demand is outpacing supply.

In both April and May overall retail sales fell short of market expectations. Looking forward 12 months most economists expect retail sales growth to return to a “normal” range.

Kyle Richard H. ""Sarge"" Passed away peacefully on June 22 2021 surrounded by loving family and having been visited in recent weeks by numerous good friends and former colleagues. He was 84. Sarge was born in St. Paul MN on April 30 1937 to Richard Erwin Kyle and Geraldine House Kyle and was a lifelong resident of White Bear Lake MN. After attending St. Paul Academy and Williams College Sarge earned his B.A. with honors from the University of Minnesota and his L.L.B. from the University of Minnesota Law School where he served as President of the Minnesota Law Review and was a member of the Order of the Coif. After law school Sarge served as law clerk to his mentor the late Hon. Edward J. Devitt on the United States District Court. Sarge subsequently joined the St. Paul law firm of Briggs and Morgan where except for a two-year stint as Minnesota Solicitor General he practiced continuously until 1992 when he was nominated by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed as Minnesota's 27th United States District Judge. He assumed senior status in 2005 and continued to carry a full caseload until he retired from active service in 2017. Sarge was a master of judicial administration. His hearings started on time his cases moved swiftly and his orders were clear and to the point. He presided over many trials during his nearly 30 years on the bench. He mentored dozens of law clerks and enjoyed walking the halls of the federal courthouse and downtown skyway system greeting colleagues lawyers and friends when court was not in session. Off the bench Sarge was a member of the Committee on Model Jury Instructions for the Eighth Circuit and a former member of the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure. He also oversaw the District's remodeling of the Warren E. Burger Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in St. Paul. At home Sarge presided over a large and boisterous family. By his children he will be remembered for guarding the house while they attended church with Jane; for anxiously and sometimes impatiently pacing the sidelines during high school sporting events; for early morning breakfasts at his favorite cafes; and for drive-through-the-night family car trips to Colorado and Florida. By his grandchildren he will be remembered for rides on his John Deere lawn mower; for crushing handshakes until they cried uncle; for whisker burns; and for early Saturday morning Kowalski donut deliveries. He is survived by his loving wife of 61 years Jane Foley Kyle and five children: the Hon. Richard H. (Elizabeth Wittenberg) Kyle Jr. Michael F. (Sara) Kyle D'Arcy Kyle Patrick G. (Susannah) Kyle and the Rev. Kathleen (Paul) Brusco. He was blessed with ten grandchildren and one great-grandson: Peter and Joseph Kyle; Laura (Ryan) Thilquist and Helen Kyle; Ruby and Bug Kyle; Kyle Maureen Allison and Norah Brusco; and Gavin Michael Thilquist as well as two sisters Sheila Kyle Cunningham and Geraldine (Bob) Kyle Bullard and one sister-in-law Kay (Jonathan) Cook.

In lieu of flowers the family asks that donations be made to the Alzheimer's Association Minnesota-North Dakota Chapter the University of Minnesota Law School or the Minnesota State Bar Foundation in Sarge's name.

To avoid losing the proper timing of the baler simply rotate the machine until the chain is loaded on the opposite side of the idler. Then change the links as needed on the loose side of the chain and you will not lose your timing.

One more thing: That little clip that many master links use today -- always install it with the closed end in the direction of travel.

One of the most common service calls on a square baler is ""The baler is beginning to shear flywheel pins for no reason."" ""No reason"" means the operator the hay haulers and the neighbor have all worked on it and have not been able to fix it. Most of the time the plunger stop protecting the needles is hit by the plunger or plunger crank. It saves the needles but shears the flywheel pin.

There are generally a couple of explanations. One is the needle brake is too loose allowing the needles to ""drift"" into the bale case before or when the baler trips to tie but before it begins to tie. The second probable cause is loose chains that directly or indirectly drive the knotter or twister stack. As these chains and sprockets wear the needle timing slows forcing the needles back home slower. This leaves the plunger stop in the bale case or closer to the crank on the transmission longer. The needles return slower but the plunger location never changes because it is driven directly by the gear case gears.

Adjust these chains and check the plunger clearance of the plunger stop by tripping the tying system and rolling the baler over by manually turning the flywheel while looking for clearance of the plunger stop. It should be out of the way by a couple of inches before the plunger or the crank gets to it. To check the needle brake grab the needle frame (after tripping it to tie) and swing the needle frame back and forth. It should swing with a snug drag.

Belts are easier to deal with because most of the time they will not affect timing and can actually absorb shock and slip when necessary. When they have worn enough that the bottom of the belt is rubbing on the center of the sheave it's time to replace the belt -- and maybe the sheave. A belt that is ""bottomed out"" has very little driving force; that driving force comes from contact with the sides of the belt against the sheave. When replacing multiple belts always replace them in a set. Never overtighten a belt. You can usually tell if you have it adjusted correctly (or not) by the smoke and the smell of a burning belt.

One more little thing: During the winter it is better to release the tension on belts using spring tension for traction. I even open the gate on my round baler a couple of feet during the winter.

BALER SHEAR PINS AND SLIP CLUTCHES

Installing the wrong grade of shear pins or failing to check slip clutches can lead to catastrophic failure. Baler engineers design a machine around load protection. If you are shearing pins getting a harder pin is not the right answer. Buy shear pins only from an authorized dealer for your baler.

Always check slip clutches after the baler has been stored especially if stored outside. Removing spring tension and separating clutch linings from the pressure plate is the key to making sure the clutches are not stuck. I've seen stuck clutches and incorrect shear protection twist a driveline like braided hair and blow up gear cases.

You know that gauge wheel on a John Deere square-baler pickup? If you've ever wondered why it is always bent out (along with the outside band) it's because that small bolt and nut that holds it on is actually a John Deere shear pin with a part number. It is very soft and will snap off when (not if) the gauge wheel hits a gatepost or tree without any damage to it or the baler.

THE LAST BALE

The first thing to remember about keeping a hay baler in good working condition is the last thing you did with it. So many times after the last bale of the season the baler in not cleaned up -- including the bale chamber and underneath the tying system -- for the winter. Worse than that it is left outside in the weather.

A hay baler has a film of grit all over it not to mention the hay tucked into all those tight and tiny locations. If this crud is not cleaned off the metal the acid from the soil will eat up the metal. Moisture is worse. Snow on a baler makes for a beautiful winter picture but trouble next spring.

If the baler must be left outside blow it off wash it off and store the wire or twine inside. Smear grease on the twine discs billhooks twister hooks and twister shafts and spray the chains with a chain lube. Rusty wire and bad twine will give your baler a stomachache.

Just like anything else baling hay gets easier as you get familiar with what a baler can do and what a baler cannot do. Remember two things when you are out there in the field: The first is that the weather is in control of your hay crop.

And the second? Never brag on a hay baler. Oh and stay good friends with your neighbor. You never know when you may need to borrow his baler.

DAL,Delta Air Lines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTIvdXMvZGVsdGEtZmxpZ2h0LWRpdmVydGVkLW9rbGFob21hLWNpdHktZmJpLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Off-Duty Flight Attendant Is Detained After an In-Flight Struggle Delta Says (Published 2021),"An off-duty flight attendant took control of the public address system and then fought with passengers and crew members on board a Delta Air Lines flight on Friday in the latest outburst of violent behavior by airline passengers the airline said.

Delta said that Flight 1730 which had been headed to Atlanta from Los Angeles landed in Oklahoma City after the off-duty flight attendant grabbed the public address system and made an announcement about oxygen masks setting off a struggle with passengers and crew members who subdued him.

Video from the flight showed a violent confrontation near the front of the plane involving several people who wrestled the man to the floor while someone said: “Get him down. Keep him down.”

“The aircraft landed without incident and the passenger was removed by law enforcement” Delta said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for the delay and any additional inconvenience this caused.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGNibWFnLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtZXhlY3V0aXZlLW5hbWVkLWNvby1vZi1jYXRob2xpYy1hcmNoZGlvY2VzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Executive Named COO of Catholic Archdiocese,"Bill Lentsch a veteran leader at Delta and Northwest airlines will take on a new role to improve organizational operations in the Twin Cities metro archdiocese.

For more than 30 years Bill Lentsch thrived in the dynamic airline industry. He climbed the executive ranks of Northwest and Delta airlines as they constantly were forced to adapt their products and operating systems to respond to swings in the economy and changing consumer preferences. Now Lentsch is retiring from Delta Air Lines and in October he’ll become the inaugural chief operating officer of the Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.

Lentsch became well-known in Minnesota business circles after he was named Delta’s senior vice president of Minnesota operations in October 2008 when the Delta-Northwest merger took effect. He served in that Minnesota role for five years until then-Delta CEO Richard Anderson promoted him to senior vice president of airport customer service. In that position he oversaw about 25000 employees across the airline.

That operations expertise was among the qualities that differentiated Lentsch from the field of candidates for the new job of COO in the archdiocese which has parishes and Catholic programming across the Twin Cities metro area.

“Those who have worked closely with Bill describe him as a servant leader who listens deeply to others to assess challenges and weigh multiple points of view as he collaborates with others to make the best decision possible” Archbishop Bernard Hebda said in a Wednesday statement announcing Lentsch’s selection.

“I believe Bill has the humble faith right skills steady temperament and real-world outlook to help the Archdiocesan Catholic Center staff continue its improvement in organizational health and effectiveness” Hebda said.

The archbishop added that the hiring of Lentsch would propel “our wide-reaching effort to improve organizational operations structures and efficiencies in the archdiocese” which would support “vibrant parish communities quality Catholic education and ready outreach to the poor and marginalized.” Lentsch will work directly with the archbishop and other archdiocesan leaders “to better serve our priests parish staffs and other Catholic entities in the 12 counties of the archdiocese” Hebda said.

Strong Catholic ties

The archbishop’s statement said that a search committee and selection team identified Lentsch as the “top choice” from more than 40 candidates. However Lentsch is no stranger to Hebda. They served together on the board of trustees of the Saint Paul Seminary and Saint John Vianney College Seminary in St. Paul.

Lentsch is a native of St. Paul where he grew up in a large Catholic family. He earned an MBA from the University of St. Thomas and Lentsch and his wife Kate are members of Assumption Parish in St. Paul. Their four children attended Catholic schools in the Twin Cities area.

“I am humbled by this opportunity to serve the same local Catholic community that fed my wife and me spiritually educated my children and continues to serve hundreds of thousands of Catholics today” Lentsch said in a written statement.

Lentsch’s career shift is reminiscent of two Minnesota-based business leaders who moved into leadership roles in the nonprofit sector. Richard Davis became the CEO of Make-A-Wish America in 2019 after a long tenure in the top executive job at U.S. Bancorp. That same year John Wilgers became president and CEO of the Greater Twin Cities United Way following a long career with Ernst & Young which culminated with the role of managing partner of EY’s Minneapolis office.

In his final position with Delta Lentsch served as chief customer experience officer which involved leadership for employees in airport customer service in-flight services reservations and customer care and consumer insights. That was a particularly important role during the pandemic which is why Twin Cities Business named Lentsch to the TCB 100 list of people to watch in 2021.

Previously he served as executive vice president of flying/air operations meaning he oversaw the work of more than 24000 flight attendants and 13000 pilots. In this job and other executive posts Lentsch commuted between Delta’s Atlanta headquarters and his home in the Twin Cities.

Although he endured a hectic travel schedule it allowed Lentsch and his family to maintain their home in Minnesota and he remained involved in Twin Cities activities. This month Lentsch was among seven Minnesotans honored by Northern Star Scouting for their community leadership and positive impact on youth. Lentsch was recognized for his 15 years of involvement with Serving Our Troops.

Lentsch will talk about leadership community service and his airline industry career on August 3 when he is the 1st Tuesday series speaker at the Carlson School of Management in Minneapolis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhZGRsZXlvdXJvd25rYW5vby5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8yNy9kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtdW52ZWlscy1tYXNrZWQtdXAtaW5mbGlnaHQtc2FmZXR5LXZpZGVvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Unveils Masked Up Inflight Safety Video,"Delta Air Lines has just launched its latest inflight safety video and there’s no escaping the feeling that this airline at the very least believes passengers will be required to wear face masks onboard airplanes for the foreseeable future.

The video features Delta pilots and flight attendants who all wear face masks throughout the video which also includes face mask reminder messages.

The decision to focus so much on face masks is in stark contrast to other airlines that have recently unveiled new inflight safety videos with no mention whatsoever of COVID-19 precautions.

Last week Air Canada launched its new safety video which featured Canadians in iconic locations around the country without a face mask insight – despite the fact that Canada is only emerging from one of the longest Coronavirus lockdowns in the world.

Delta’s new video could however age pretty quickly if a group of Republican senators have their way. The group which includes Ted Cruz and Roger Wicker are pressing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to immediately lift mask requirements on public transport including onboard commercial flights.

“Over 150 million people in the United States are fully vaccinated and mask mandates have been lifted across the country. But the CDC inexplicably still hasn’t lifted the mask mandate for public transportation” Cruz said of his demands.

“It’s long past time for President Biden and the CDC to follow the science.”

The group believe ending the federal mask mandate early would incentivize more Americans to get vaccinated. According to Our World in Data around 54 per cent of all Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine but supply is far outstripping demand and the United States is falling far behind other countries in its vaccination campaign.

The federal face mask mandate is currently due to expire on September 13 but the Delta variant poses a significant risk to the U.S. if the level of vaccination doesn’t start rising again and there may be a need to extend the mandate.

In fact the Delta variant is such a risk that the World Health Organization said on Friday that fully vaccinated people should continue to wear face masks – advice that flies in the face of CDC guidance that says fully vaccinated no longer have to wear a face mask in most settings.

If all goes well though let’s hope Delta (that’s the airline) recorded two versions of their new video – one without face masks.

View the current offers here.

Last year I decided to move my airline loyalty from United to Delta. Right before the pandemic I took a handful of Delta flights and found the experience to be consistently better than United. Plus having hubs at New York (LGA) and New York-JFK is far more convenient than United's Newark (EWR) hub given I live in Queens.

Most of my colleagues would've opted to match their status from United to Delta. Delta has an ongoing status challenge program where you get temporary status for 90 days and have to earn a set number of Medallion Qualifying Miles (MQM) or Medallion Qualifying Segments (MQD) and Medallion Qualifying Dollars (MQD) to keep status for another year.

But here's the thing: I had a failed Delta status challenge in 2019 that prevents me from taking advantage of the program for three years. So I set out to earn Delta Platinum status the hard way: by flying and with credit card spending.

While the coronavirus pandemic originally put a fork in my plans to earn status the airline rolled out promotion after promotion that will help me earn Delta Platinum Medallion status by the end of the first week of July. Normally earning a similar status tier through flying alone would take me until the end of the year so I've effectively earned status in half the time.

In this article I'll run you through how I was able to earn status so quickly and discuss if I'm planning to shoot for Delta Diamond.

How I'll earn Delta Platinum status in just 7 months

Delta's various promotions have helped me earn Delta status fast in 2021. (Photo by Andrew Kunesh / The Points Guy)

As discussed I originally made it my goal to earn Delta Platinum elite status at the beginning of last year. Being ineligible for a status challenge I started flying with Delta and putting spend on my Delta cobranded credit card. Here's how I leveraged these various promotions to fast-track myself to Delta Platinum.

All 2020 MQM rolled over to 2021

Last year I wrote an article on how I planned to earn Platinum elite status by the end of 2020. That didn't happen largely because I was a bit too optimistic about business and international travel restarting. In turn I finished the year with roughly 44000 MQM and Delta Silver status.

Thankfully however these MQM were a blessing in disguise. Early in the pandemic Delta announced that all MQM earned in 2020 would roll over to 2021. This means I started the year with the same 44000 MQM in my account putting me within close reach of Delta Gold status.

I earned this 44000 MQM by opening a Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card and earning the welcome offer and first tier of the MQM spend bonus. I also had a limited number of domestic flights on Delta in 2020.

This 44000 MQM was a way to start the year and made it easy to earn Delta Gold status (and — next week — Platinum).

American Express offered bonus MQM in 2020 and 2021

Another way I boosted my Delta MQM count last year was with an Amex Offer that awarded 500 bonus MQM for every $1000 spent on Delta cobranded cards. I was able to amass a 3000 MQM from this promotion when paying rent car insurance and other expenses.

Amex and Delta are offering bonus MQM in 2021 too. Instead of earning 15000 MQM for every $30000 you spend on your Delta Reserve card you'll earn 18750 MQM. While I don't need this to earn Platinum status this year I do plan to earn the first tier of the bonus to give myself a better shot at Diamond status.

Delta's status accelerator makes earning status in 2021 significantly easier

Delta made waves this year when it announced a new promotion called 'Status Accelerator'. Under this program Delta flyers earn a 50% bonus on flights in basic economy and Main Cabin and a 75% bonus in Comfort+ Premium Select first-class and Delta One.

(Screenshot courtesy of delta.com)

This promotion applies to both paid and award tickets. I've used this to stock up on MQM this year for work and personal travel which brings me to the roughly 73000 MQM in my account right now. I'll round this up to the 75000 MQM required for Delta Platinum status when I fly to/from Milwaukee (MKE) next week for a work trip.

The status accelerator combined with business travel coming back will undoubtedly help many Delta elites requalify for status this year.

MY thoughts on earning Delta Diamond

(Photo courtesy of Ryan Patterson/The Points Guy)

If all goes to plan I'll have Delta Platinum status by July 7 — but what's next? Obviously I'll continue to keep most of my travel on Delta to enjoy Platinum status benefits. I'll also have enough travel and credit card spend in the near future to get to the required 125000 MQM for Delta Diamond status.

But there's one major hurdle: Medallion Qualifying Dollars (MQD).

For some background you need to earn $15000 MQD in order to qualify for Diamond status. Unfortunately the standard MQD waiver that's earned with $25000 in spend on a Delta co-branded Amex card doesn't apply to this status tier. You must spend a whopping $250000 on one of these cards to earn the Diamond MQD waiver — and I have no plans to spend that much money.

So where do I go from here? That's complicated.

I'd love to have the benefits of Delta Diamond but I don't foresee myself spending $15000 on Delta flights even with the status accelerator. My only saving grace would be earning on partner-ticketed flights that earn MQD based on a percentage of miles flown.

Related: The ultimate guide to Delta partners

You can sometimes find cheap business class fares that earn a high percentage of MQD on long-haul tickets. For example a one-way Z fare business class flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Amsterdam (AMS) earns 40% MQD. The flight is 5578 miles long so you're looking at $2218 MQD even if the ticket is only $1000.

So while I'm not hopeful that I'll earn enough MQD for Diamond status it's possible if international travel reopens and business travel restarts. I'm going to keep my eyes open for low-cost partner fares that work with my travel plans in order to boost my MQD count.

What if I don't qualify for Diamond?

One nice thing about Delta status is the fact that all MQM earned over your status level are rolled over to the following year. So if I earn 100000 MQM I'll start 2022 off with 25000 MQM in my account. This will help me requalify for elite status next year and make me feel a lot better about not earning Diamond based on MQD alone.

Bottom line

I was able to leverage ongoing Delta promotions to earn Delta Platinum Medallion status just over halfway through 2021. Generally earning a similar status tier through flying alone would take me until the end of the year so I've effectively used these promotions to earn status twice as fast.

I hope we see Delta continue to offer these types of promotions to drum up travel demand and help those traveling less during the pandemic requalify for status. Promotions like this go a long way for travelers and have made me more loyal to Delta through the pandemic.

Safe travels!

Nichols and his son Larry wanted to build an energy powerhouse when they founded Devon Energy in 1971.

“We were always looking for new technologies and modern ways to produce oil and gas because we wanted to be innovators"" co-founder Larry Nichols said. ""I’m proud to say that I think that’s exactly what Devon has been in the industry over the years.”

Oil and gas exploration and production isn't the only thing the company has done well however.

Over the past five decades Devon also has been a major contributor and community partner across its operational areas through support it has provided for Science Technology Engineering and Math-focused educational centers installed in more than 50 schools across the state through a partnership with the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation.

Plus it annually supports community service organizations such as the United Way local food banks and emergency response organizations and also supports organizations that better residents' lives in other ways such as Allied Arts the Lyric Theater and the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum.

“Devon takes a thoughtful compassionate approach to helping our communities. For us it’s about more than just providing checks. We build long-term relationships so we can understand what people need and the best way to support them"" said Christina Rehkop its community relations director.

Other contributions the company has made to the community are highly visible such as its corporate headquarters that forever has changed the city's skyline.

As part of that project Devon played a pivotal part in helping Oklahoma City reimagine its downtown. A tax increment financing district created to provide Devon with funds to help it complete its project raised about $156 million that the oil and gas operator signed over to city officials who used the revenue to renovate the Myriad Gardens remake downtown streets and sidewalks to create an environment area residents could enjoy and to create an economic development fund to help bring employers back downtown.

It also has made significant contributions over past decades to help improve the city's River District ($5 million toward building the Devon Boathouse) to help keep St. Anthony Hospital in Midtown ($500000 toward a project creating a new campus for the facility) toward renovating the Overholser Mansion in Heritage Hills and regularly has supported community events such as Downtown in December.

“Devon has always prioritized being a good neighbor and tried to go above and beyond for the communities that allow us to do business” said Nichols. “They support us and we support them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1sZW9uLWNvb3Blcm1hbi1jcmF6eS0xMC0xODE4NTI4NDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 10 Stocks,"In this article we examined Billionaire Leon Cooperman’s portfolio management strategy and why Billionaire Leon Cooperman is crazy about these 10 stocks. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Cooperman’s history and hedge fund performance go directly to Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 5 Stocks.

The hedge fund manager and American billionaire investor Leon Cooperman recently stated in an interview that the stock market will be down from a year from now amid rising inflation increasing taxes along with prospects for an interest rate hike. Though Omega Advisors chairman doesn’t see any immediate downside risk he still believes the long-term US economic outlook is not favorable as the world’s largest economy is pulling the demand forward. He says that the recent stock market rally was supported by sentiments that the economy will rebound but he is concerned that how long stocks could move higher on recovery projections. He is also worried about the rising government debt levels as well as the strategy of supporting the labor market through multi-trillion dollar stimulus packages.

""If you spoke to a hundred economists today and he asked them what their view is of the potential real growth of the US economy the response would be centered on 2%"" Cooperman said. ""We're growing this year four to five times potential yet the Fed is persistent in keeping interest rates at near zero. That doesn't make any great sense to me. It's just pushing people out on the risk curve.""

He is also showing concerns over the rising inflation with the expectation that the inflation number will move well over Fed’s expectations.

""I think that Mr. Powell will be surprised by inflation. It's not going to be as quiescent and transitory as he thinks. I think the Fed will be forced to say something before the end of 2022"" Cooperman said.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman who worked for Goldman Sachs for 25 years remained busy last year in adjusting his portfolio to cope with rapidly changing market dynamics. He significantly expanded his focus towards financial stocks since the beginning of last year. As of the end of the first quarter financial stocks accounted for more than 40% of $1.6 billion worth of Leon Cooperman’s 13F stock portfolio up significantly from 17.88% of portfolio weighting at the end of 2019. Interestingly instead of chasing big banking stocks the billionaire investor invested heavily in small and mid-cap loan and mortgage companies. In the past couple of quarters he also expressed confidence in business acquisition and development companies.

Story continues

Leon Cooperman who sits on a net worth of around $3.2 billion believes in the portfolio diversification strategy instead of a concentrated portfolio. He has well-diversified his stock portfolio towards value and growth stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Microsoft and Alphabet Inc may seem like growth stocks because of their growth rates but we actually classify especially Alphabet Inc as a value play because of its huge discount compared to sum of its parts as well as its peer's P/S multiples. The billionaire investor is also seeking to take advantage of the booming information technology communications and consumer discretionary sectors. Furthermore Leon Cooperman invested millions of dollars in real estate and energy stocks to capitalize on the economic recovery period. At the end of the first quarter the real estate sector represented 7.26% of the entire Leon Cooperman's portfolio while energy stocks weighted around 8.96%.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman grew up in a Jewish family in New York City after immigration from Poland. After completing his MBA degree from Columbia Business School in 1967 he joined Goldman Sachs and spent 22 years in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989 he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. He also headed GS Capital Growth Fund for more than 1 year. After retiring from Goldman Sachs he founded Omega Advisors and converted it into a family office fund in 2016.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman is Crazy About these 10 Stocks

While Leon Cooperman’s reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy more than 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 206.8% since then and beat the SPY's 91% gain.

“We also made adjustments to the portfolio’s top 10 holdings to increase the participation of select stocks. The FAANGs and Microsoft delivered mixed results during the quarter and we continue to be mindful of our weighting to these mega cap growth stocks to ensure they are not limiting our ability to add diversity through new ideas.

I’ve previously written about deciding earlier this year to direct new capital towards better businesses versus adding more to the energy sector but given the material optionality at WPX we opted to maintain a material exposure. Recently WPX announced an all stock merger with a larger competitor – Devon Energy – which will leave the new company with plenty of cash flow at lower oil prices less leverage and material upside to higher commodity prices.”

The Omnipod 5 system combines a tubing-free insulin-filled delivery ""Pod"" with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor and an algorithm built into the Pod connecting the two devices via a smartphone app to semiautomate insulin delivery. It is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration. The company expects to launch it in limited release during the second half of 2021.

Results from a pivotal trial of the system in children aged 2 to 5.9 years with type 1 diabetes were presented during the virtual American Diabetes Association (ADA) 81st Scientific Sessions.

Follow-up data at 6 months were also presented for another pivotal study of 112 children aged 6-13.9 years and 129 adults aged 14-70 years. Those primary 3-month data were reported earlier this year at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting and subsequently published online June 7 in Diabetes Care. Another study presented at ADA looked at quality of life in children using Omnipod 5 and their caregivers.

If approved by the US Food and Drug Administration the Omnipod 5 would be the third commercially available automated insulin delivery system — also called hybrid closed-loop or artificial pancreas systems — in the United States. It would be the second approved for children as young as 2 years of age and the first to deliver insulin subcutaneously without tubing.

""No Tubing"" Feature Will Be a Draw for Parents of Young Children

Asked to comment pediatric endocrinologist Laura M. Jacobsen MD of the University of Florida Gainesville told Medscape Medical News: ""I think the big advantage for the Omnipod 5 is that [if approved it will be] the only tubeless automated insulin delivery system in the US.""

""The automated delivery systems have just been wonderful for helping patients achieve time in range especially overnight. And the fact that this goes down to such a young age where that can be very difficult is wonderful.""

Another difference between the Omnipod 5 and other systems is the ability to adjust glucose targets (from 110 to 150 mg/dL) although newer versions of the currently available hybrid closed-loop systems are expected to include that feature as well. ""They're all slightly different in the way the algorithms work but I think the end result is similar"" Jacobsen said.

But she said the no-tubing feature might be particularly helpful for some very active young kids. ""A lot of small kids do use the tubed pumps and you can make it work with a lot of kids but with some kids it just won't...the tubing gets caught. I think this really helps parents make the step. A lot of them don't want to try the tubing whereas they see the Omnipod and might feel a little more confidence to try a pump.""

Overall said Jacobsen who has no financial disclosures with Insulet Dexcom or any of their competitors ""I think any addition to the technology field to improve quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes is important and people need choices.""

Pivotal Data Show Benefit in ""Difficult to Manage"" Preschool Children

Pivotal 3-month data for the Omnipod 5 in children aged 2-5.9 years with type 1 diabetes were presented on June 26 by pediatric endocrinologist Jennifer Sherr MD PhD Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut.

""As a pediatric endocrinologist I can attest to the difficulty of managing this age group due to grazing eating patterns and erratic physical activity. Oftentimes care providers may fear hypoglycemia as these youth can not verbalize or self-treat lows"" she remarked.

A total of 80 children were enrolled at 10 institutions across the United Sates. There was a single 14-day standard therapy phase (baseline) followed by 3 months of automated insulin delivery during which the children's eating and exercise were unrestricted.

At 3 months average A1c had fallen from 7.4% at baseline to 6.9% a significant difference (P < .05). The proportions achieving the target A1c of less than 7% were 54% at 3 months versus 31% at baseline. The reduction was even greater among the 25 with baseline A1c of 8% or greater although it was significant even among the 55 who started with a lower A1c (–1.06 vs –0.31 percentage points; both P < .05).

Time in range rose from 57.2% at baseline to 68.1% at 3 months (P < .05).

""These youngsters are spending an average of 2.6 more hours/day in range"" Sherr commented noting that the difference became apparent shortly after study start and was maintained during the 3 months.

Sherr noted that this 10.9% improvement in time in range with Omnipod 5 was similar to improvements in the previously reported pivotal study of older children and adults. Data from that study showed improvement in time in range from a gain of 15.6% for the 6 to 13.9 year olds to 8.0% for those aged 26-49 years. Interestingly she noted improvements in time in range were seen even in the oldest group aged 50-70 who increased from an already high baseline of 69.9% to 79.1% with Omnipod 5 after 3 months.

In her current study in the youngest age group the improvement in time in range was achieved primarily by a reduction of time above range from 2.4 fewer hours/day above 180 mg/dL while time below 70 mg/dL was reduced by 4 minutes/day. Overnight time in range improved by 1.4 hours/night with most of the improvements in reduction of hyperglycemia.

The proportions meeting the combined goals of less than 4% time below range and greater than 60% time in range rose from 29% to 65%.

There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis during the 3-month study phase.

Another important related metric sleep quality for parents/caregivers also improved. The percentage reporting overall sleep quality of ""very good"" or ""fairly good"" increased from 65% at baseline to 90% with Omnipod 5 while ""very bad"" sleep quality fell from 8.8% to 0%.

All 80 patients completed the study and elected to continue in a 12-month extension phase.

Ongoing Benefit Seen in Older Children and Adults

In a late-breaking poster presented on June 25 Anders L. Carlson MD medical director at the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet Minneapolis Minnesota presented more follow-up data to the previously reported 3-month pivotal study including 108 older children and 109 adults from the original study.

A1c remained lower after 6 months than at baseline for both children and adults (P < .001). In the children A1c levels weren't significantly different at the end of 6 versus 3 months while in the adults there was an additional 0.1 percentage point decrease (P < .01).

There was one episode of diabetic ketoacidosis and no severe hypoglycemic episodes in the 3-month extension. ""Sustained reduction of A1c indicates the potential long-term benefit of the Omnipod 5 System"" Carlson and colleagues concluded.

Reduced Diabetes Distress Don't Forget Parents' Quality of Life

Meanwhile psychologist Korey K. Hood PhD of Stanford University California presented quality of life data at the meeting for 83 children aged 6-11.9 years and 42 teens aged 12-17.9 years using the Omnipod 5 from the larger study population and their parents.

Significant improvements were seen for both the youth and their caregivers in the Problem Areas in Diabetes score a measure of diabetes-related emotional distress. Changes were less dramatic on the Hypoglycemic Confidence Scale although improvements were significant for the caregivers of the younger children.

""We know this is a group that is really worried about hypoglycemia across a lot of situations not just sleep but also school and outside of the home. So to increase their confidence to this extent I think is a pretty important finding"" Hood commented.

There were nonsignificant trends in improvement across groups on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index but overall sleep quality did significantly improve among parents of the younger children. And on the World Health Organization-5 quality of life survey significant improvements again were seen among the caregivers of young children.

""Reduced diabetes distress and improved quality of life are key benefits of using the Omnipod 5 [automated insulin delivery] system that are complementary to the glycemic benefits achieved"" Hood said.

Jacobsen has reported no relevant financial relationships. Sherr has reported being an advisor for consultant for and/or grant recipient from Bigfoot Biomedical Cecelia Health Insulet Medtronic Diabetes Eli Lilly Lexicon Sanofi and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Hood has reported being a consultant for Cecelia Health Havas and Cercacor.

The special planning commission meeting will be held at 7 p.m. at the township hall at 1372 Goodells Road and both Township Supervisor Elizabeth Masters and township resident Matt Kettlewell expect a lot of people to attend.

""I do know there's a lot of support for the store as well as opposition"" Masters said with the opposition being the “louder party.”

According to the site plan submitted to the township in April the proposed Dollar General is 9100 square feet and will be on the southeast corner of the intersection of Wales Center and Lapeer roads.

""It is the busiest intersection in Wales Township"" Masters said.

Dollar General spokeswoman Angela Petkovic said in an email that the company is currently in a “due diligence phase” for a new store on Wales Center Road.

“This means we’re interested in adding a new store in St. Clair County but have not committed to doing so yet” she said. “Based on our current timeline we anticipate a final decision to be made on the store by late summer.”

If the Wales Township Dollar General is built it will be the 18th location in St. Clair County.

If built the store will employ six to 10 people. Dollar Generals sell merchandise such as foods health and beauty products home cleaning supplies and more Petkovic said.

She said when the company chooses store locations it considered whether it can meet customers’ price value and selection needs.

“We further strive to provide convenience for customers who may not have affordable nearby retail options” she said.

Kettlewell who lives three miles from the potential new store said another Dollar General was unnecessary with one nearby in Emmett.

“They’re like literally all over” he said.

He said Dollar Generals can make it hard for other convenience stores to establish a stronghold in the community becauselocal stores won’t be able to compete with the national chain's prices.

The Dollar General would increase tax revenue in the township but Kettlewell said he doesn’t see it being a big positive to the township with only hiring up to 10 people.

He said he plans to go to the meeting on Monday to hear others' opinions “even though it’s not going to change anything.”

Masters said Monday’s meeting is for reviewing the site plan to make sure the plan has things like ample parking is compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations and has low-impact lighting.

""It's further along in the steps than what people think"" she said.

Because the township is zoned for general business Dollar General has the right to build on the site. The township cannot discriminate against a business if it meets the zoning and building criteria she said.

Masters said the No. 1 concern local residents have shared is they don’t want to buy Chinese-made goods though Dollar General also sells U.S.-made products.

She said people are also concerned about the Dollar General putting other stores out of business. Masters said she believes Dollar General will be different enough from other stores and that there’s room for both in the community for different audiences.

GasPlus opened in 2014 at 1902 Oregon Pike in what had previously been a Getty Mart. Owners Attufat and Aftab Akbar sold snacks drinks grocery items and ethanol-free gas but also had an area for ready-made hummus falafel shawarma and kebabs.

“Our food was mainly advertised through word of mouth. We were blessed with caring people throughout this journey who not only loved our food but also recommended it to their friends and family” the Akbars wrote in a Facebook post announcing the change.

“We are looking for another place for our Mediterranean food. We will keep you posted as soon we get a new place” said the post which noted they are still accepting catering orders.

The Akbars did not respond to messages asking when and where they hoped to open a new location.

Manjit Singh who bought the station June 15 for $650000 said he plans to add more grocery items in the former food area and would be putting in more smoking products and Pennsylvania skill games. Singh also owns a Sunoco station in Ephrata at 529 W.

He and business partner Elliott Pickett have been working for more than a year to open the seven-barrel brewery and tasting room just north of the Copley Circle. The doors officially opened Wednesday becoming the community's — and western Summit County's — first craft brewery since the short-lived The Beer Factory.

""We are happy to be in Copley"" Robbins said. ""Good beer. Good vibes. Hopefully that's what we put out there.""

The 7200-square-foot facility at 1374 S. Cleveland-Massillon Road — which previously housed a Dollar General store — features a large L-shaped bar flat-screen televisions tables distressed floor and a small outdoor patio with pub-style picnic tables.

""A lot of people try to make a distressed floor look. We didn't have to cut holes in our jeans"" Robbins said with a laugh.

What's on tap?

Brighten opened with seven beers on tap: a double hazy IPA Belgian-style wit hazy pale ale saison American light lager Czech pilsner and dry stout. Robbins plans eventually to offer a dozen on draft including a hard seltzer with different syrups for flavoring.

Customers can expect an Irish-style red and fruited kettle sour to come next.

Robbins 35 and Pickett 36 who both grew up in West Akron have had some fun with the beer names.

The American light lager is named Ric after Pickett's uncle by the same name who enjoys that style. The dry stout is called Coffee Not Coffee. But there is no coffee in the beer.

Meanwhile the Tree Frog hazy pale ale got its name because there were spring peepers inside the building for a bit while it was being renovated driving Robbins crazy.

""It's our silly sense of humor"" he said.

Who are Robbins and Pickett?

Robbins is an accomplished brewer who has previously worked at Thirsty Dog in Akron Lager Heads in Medina and Magic City in Akron. He won two medals at the Great American Beer Festival while brewing at Lager Heads for an Oktoberfest and a smoke beer.

Pickett and his family are well-known in the Copley community. The Pickett family owns the nearby Walterville business complex and propane business.

Their goal is to bring some life back to the Copley Circle. The site is ripe for a brewery given the surrounding residential neighborhoods proximity to the Montrose shopping area and access to Interstate 77.

So far the buzz is good.

""It's great. The ambience is fantastic"" said customer Michelle Hilliard of Kent who came on opening night and had the Tree Frog hazy pale ale and Citra Slice double hazy IPA. ""The beer so far is great. Very tasty.""

Brighten — which is able to can beer to go — doesn't offer food. But Big Star Pizza is next door and menus are available in the brewery.

""I'm super excited"" Robbins said. ""As long as it felt all this took it feels like now that we're at this point it's happening super fast. There's no turning back now. The gates are open.""

Brighten joins a thriving craft brewing scene in Summit County. The county is home to nearly 20 breweries.

Brighten is open from noon to 10 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday; noon to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday; and 1 to 7 p.m. Sunday. It is closed on Monday and Tuesday.

“Overall the state has been uneven in how it’s helped people with disabilities navigate the pandemic” said Andrew Imparato executive director of Disability Rights California. “A lot of people with disabilities have had to fend for themselves.”

Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer cites logistical challenges. California maintains an up-to-date list of residents who get SSI because the state supplements the federal benefit by a few hundred dollars but doesn’t have access to the same information for SSDI.

“Trying to include SSDI ... would be a time-consuming and laborious process with the feds that doesn’t line up with the intent of (the Golden State Stimulus) — to get immediate relief to Californians with whom we have an existing relationship” Palmer wrote in an email.

‘Make Hard Decisions Quickly’

The Newsom administration may have also based the decision on a consideration of need.

California’s SSI recipients live in poverty by definition. Elderly blind and disabled people can only qualify if they have extremely low income and wealth and they typically receive just $954.72 per month.

On the other hand people with sufficient work history can qualify for monthly SSDI payments based on their former wages with the average national benefit at $1280 per month.

Still California’s SSDI recipients often face steep financial challenges.

The special planning commission meeting will be held at 7 p.m. at the township hall at 1372 Goodells Road and both Township Supervisor Elizabeth Masters and township resident Matt Kettlewell expect a lot of people to attend.

""I do know there's a lot of support for the store as well as opposition"" Masters said with the opposition being the “louder party.”

According to the site plan submitted to the township in April the proposed Dollar General is 9100 square feet and will be on the southeast corner of the intersection of Wales Center and Lapeer roads.

""It is the busiest intersection in Wales Township"" Masters said.

Dollar General spokeswoman Angela Petkovic said in an email that the company is currently in a “due diligence phase” for a new store on Wales Center Road.

“This means we’re interested in adding a new store in St. Clair County but have not committed to doing so yet” she said. “Based on our current timeline we anticipate a final decision to be made on the store by late summer.”

If the Wales Township Dollar General is built it will be the 18th location in St. Clair County.

If built the store will employ six to 10 people. Dollar Generals sell merchandise such as foods health and beauty products home cleaning supplies and more Petkovic said.

She said when the company chooses store locations it considered whether it can meet customers’ price value and selection needs.

“We further strive to provide convenience for customers who may not have affordable nearby retail options” she said.

Kettlewell who lives three miles from the potential new store said another Dollar General was unnecessary with one nearby in Emmett.

“They’re like literally all over” he said.

He said Dollar Generals can make it hard for other convenience stores to establish a stronghold in the community becauselocal stores won’t be able to compete with the national chain's prices.

The Dollar General would increase tax revenue in the township but Kettlewell said he doesn’t see it being a big positive to the township with only hiring up to 10 people.

He said he plans to go to the meeting on Monday to hear others' opinions “even though it’s not going to change anything.”

Masters said Monday’s meeting is for reviewing the site plan to make sure the plan has things like ample parking is compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations and has low-impact lighting.

""It's further along in the steps than what people think"" she said.

Because the township is zoned for general business Dollar General has the right to build on the site. The township cannot discriminate against a business if it meets the zoning and building criteria she said.

Masters said the No. 1 concern local residents have shared is they don’t want to buy Chinese-made goods though Dollar General also sells U.S.-made products.

She said people are also concerned about the Dollar General putting other stores out of business. Masters said she believes Dollar General will be different enough from other stores and that there’s room for both in the community for different audiences.

Rodney Davis's name as the next potential rival to run against Gov. J.B. Pritzker the GOP congressman was in southern Illinois visiting a coal plant that could get shut down if the governor gets his way.

Davis used the visit to criticize the governor’s support for a sweeping energy plan that could shutter every coal-fired power plant in Illinois by 2035 an idea many opponents lambast as one that will kill jobs and hike rates.

Davis called on Pritzker a Democrat to spare the Prairie State Energy Campus in Marissa located south of East St. Louis. The plant provides power to municipalities in eight states including a swath of Davis’ 13th Congressional District.

""The municipally owned Prairie State power plant is the cleanest coal-fired power plant in the nation"" he said during his June 18 visit. ""The company is actively pursuing and adopting additional carbon sequestration and storage and emissions-reducing technologies and they should receive support from state and federal agencies for their efforts.""

One of Prairie State Energy Campus’ two power units was selected in 2019 as the site of a U.S. Department of Energy-backed carbon capture research project slated for completion at the end of 2021. But federal data show the plant has been one of the nation’s 10 biggest emitters of heat-trapping carbon dioxide a fact recently highlighted by the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune.

While experts say there are multiple ways to evaluate which coal plants are the ""cleanest"" beyond total CO2 emissions — which tend to single out the power plants producing the most electricity — Prairie State ranked nowhere near the top based on any of the yardsticks we found to measure it.

Davis’ office did not respond to calls or emails requesting comment.

Not the ‘cleanest’ by any major metric

Defining how ""clean"" a coal plant is depends on whom you ask — and when according to experts.

""‘Clean coal’ has been this sort of amorphous term that has meant whatever people want it to mean and it's changed over time"" said Daniel Cohan a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University.

Before climate change gained significant attention Cohan and other experts said coal plants were generally judged by their emission of regulated air pollutants causing smog and acid rain such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).

Amid growing concern over climate change however experts said there’s a case for including CO2 emissions in the conversation about which plants are the ""cleanest.""

To compare Prairie State’s emissions against other power plants Cohan pointed us to data published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency showing how much of a given gas or pollutant power plants emit per unit of electricity they generate.

In 2019 the latest year for which this data was available Prairie State Generating Station ranked 169th of 306 coal plants in the nation with EPA data for CO2 emission rates. Its ranking for its SO2 emission rate was roughly the same.

Prairie State performed better when it came to its NOx emission rate — placing 37th — but still nowhere near the top.

""By no means is this a clean power plant"" Cohan said referencing the EPA data. ""It’s still a substantial contributor to air pollution and climate change.""

Calling Prairie State the cleanest coal plant in the country he added ""would be absurd.""

Emily Grubert an energy systems researcher and professor at Georgia Tech agreed. ""It’s not the cleanest by any reasonable metric"" she said.

Our ruling

Davis said the Prairie State power plant is ""the cleanest"" coal-fired power plant in the nation.

His office did not respond to our inquiry asking for evidence to back that up.

Experts told us there are multiple metrics by which to assess how ""clean"" a coal plant is but federal data shows Prairie State does not come out at or near the top on any of them.

UNDP/Azza Aishath Women build barriers in Nepal to prevent the river from overflowing and flooding nearby villages.

Many countries lack the financial resources to make the transition to clean energy and a sustainable way of life that could reverse climate change. The UN says that climate finance is the answer because not investing will cost even more in the long-term but also because there are significant opportunities for investors.

What is Climate finance?

Broadly speaking climate finance relates to the money which needs to be spent on a whole range of activities which will contribute to slowing down climate change and which will help the world to reach the target of limiting global warming to an increase of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

To reach this goal the world needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to practically zero by 2050; the phrase net-zero is also heard a lot in the context of financing climate action (you can read more about it here).

UNDP Costa Rica Women in rural Costa Rica are planting trees to help fight climate change.

Initiatives that must be financed to reach net-zero include those which reduce emissions of harmful gasses as well as enhancing or protecting the natural solutions which capture those gasses like forests and the ocean.

The finance also aims to build the resilience of populations most affected by climate change and help them to adapt to changing climatic conditions measures which in turn will help to reduce warming.

The finance exists and so do the solutions to transition to what the UN calls a green economy. Renewable energy which provides electricity without producing carbon dioxide or other forms of air pollution is a crucial building block for powering sustainable economic growth.

Why is it important?

With global temperatures rising along with changing weather patterns sea-level rise increases in droughts and floods the world’s most vulnerable populations are facing ever-increasing risks food insecurity and have fewer chances to break out of poverty and build better lives.

UN Women/Mohammad Rakibul Hasan Floods in Bangladesh have destroyed homes in remote villages in Islampur.

In fact the UN estimates that climate change could drive an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030.

Significant financial resources sound investments and a systematic global approach are needed to address these worrying trends.

So how much is needed?

Significant investments are needed and international cooperation is critical. More than a decade ago developed countries committed to jointly mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action in developing countries.

It may sound like a lot but compare that to world military expenditure in 2020 which was estimated at just under $2 trillion or $2000 billion or the trillions of dollars spent by developed countries on COVID-related relief for their citizens.

UNDP/Manuth Buth Solar panels are being used in Cambodia to help meet the country's demand for energy .

According to an expert report prepared at the request of the UN Secretary-General the $100bn target is not being met (the latest available data for 2018 is $79bn) even though climate finance is on an “upward trajectory.”

So there is still a big gap in finance.

Does it make financial sense?

The real question is whether the world can afford not to invest in climate action.

Communities in all parts of the world are already suffering from the financial effects of climate change be it crop loss due to drought or major damage to infrastructure caused by flooding or other extreme weather.

The UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney says the huge amount of investment required represents an opportunity and not a risk arguing that the benefits that flow from these investments dramatically outweigh any upfront costs.

Unsplash/Kouji Tsuru Air pollution from coal-fired power plants is linked to global warming and other damaging environmental and public health consequences.

It is also increasingly accepted that climate investments make economic sense. The financial and business cases for clean energy are stronger than ever. In most countries going solar is now cheaper than building new coal power plants. Clean energy investments also drive economic growth with a potential to create 18 million jobs by 2030; and that’s including the inevitable fossil fuel job losses.

Where is the money coming from?

This is where it becomes complicated but generally speaking finance is coming from a wide range of public and private funding sources which are supporting innovative climate action initiatives at a local national or transnational level.

A variety of financial instruments can be used to provide climate finance from green bonds to direct project-based loans to direct investments in energy or technology providers.

Unsplash/Nicholas Doherty Wind farms have been built in offshore locations around the United Kingdom.

The UN says it seeks to combine the “determination of the public sector with the entrepreneurship capacities of the private sector” supporting governments in making climate investments easier and more attractive for private sector companies.

Fortunately the UN reports that “efforts to engage the private sector in meeting the Paris goals are gaining momentum”.

A lot of climate funding is channeled through numerous UN funds and programmes.

What next?

The annual $100bn commitment “is a floor and not a ceiling” for climate finance according to the UN.

The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that adaptation costs alone faced by just developing countries will be in a range of $140 billion to $300 billion per year by 2030 and $280 billion to $500 billion annually by 2050.

UNDP/Andrea Egan The coastal zones of the Pacific are among the most vulnerable in the world.

It’s worth remembering here that adaptation is only one part of the complicated climate action puzzle. Once mitigation and decarbonization efforts and global resiliency efforts in both the developing and developed world are factored in the annual cost will greatly exceed $500 billion and possibly even more than a trillion dollars.

But the benefits of the investments will be far greater-- shifting to a green economy could yield a direct economic gain of $26 trillion through 2030 compared with business-as-usual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDYvMjYvYnJpZ2h0ZW4tYnJld2VyeS1jb3BsZXktb2hpby1iZWVyLW9wZW5pbmcvNTM0Mjc2MDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brighten Brewing is the only craft brewery in the Copley-Bath-Fairlawn area,"COPLEY TWP. – Tom Robbins smiled widely as he looked around the new Brighten Brewing.

He and business partner Elliott Pickett have been working for more than a year to open the seven-barrel brewery and tasting room just north of the Copley Circle. The doors officially opened Wednesday becoming the community's — and western Summit County's — first craft brewery since the short-lived The Beer Factory.

""We are happy to be in Copley"" Robbins said. ""Good beer. Good vibes. Hopefully that's what we put out there.""

The 7200-square-foot facility at 1374 S. Cleveland-Massillon Road — which previously housed a Dollar General store — features a large L-shaped bar flat-screen televisions tables distressed floor and a small outdoor patio with pub-style picnic tables.

""A lot of people try to make a distressed floor look. We didn't have to cut holes in our jeans"" Robbins said with a laugh.

What's on tap?

Brighten opened with seven beers on tap: a double hazy IPA Belgian-style wit hazy pale ale saison American light lager Czech pilsner and dry stout. Robbins plans eventually to offer a dozen on draft including a hard seltzer with different syrups for flavoring.

Customers can expect an Irish-style red and fruited kettle sour to come next.

Robbins 35 and Pickett 36 who both grew up in West Akron have had some fun with the beer names.

The American light lager is named Ric after Pickett's uncle by the same name who enjoys that style. The dry stout is called Coffee Not Coffee. But there is no coffee in the beer.

Meanwhile the Tree Frog hazy pale ale got its name because there were spring peepers inside the building for a bit while it was being renovated driving Robbins crazy.

""It's our silly sense of humor"" he said.

Who are Robbins and Pickett?

Robbins is an accomplished brewer who has previously worked at Thirsty Dog in Akron Lager Heads in Medina and Magic City in Akron. He won two medals at the Great American Beer Festival while brewing at Lager Heads for an Oktoberfest and a smoke beer.

Pickett and his family are well-known in the Copley community. The Pickett family owns the nearby Walterville business complex and propane business.

Their goal is to bring some life back to the Copley Circle. The site is ripe for a brewery given the surrounding residential neighborhoods proximity to the Montrose shopping area and access to Interstate 77.

So far the buzz is good.

""It's great. The ambience is fantastic"" said customer Michelle Hilliard of Kent who came on opening night and had the Tree Frog hazy pale ale and Citra Slice double hazy IPA. ""The beer so far is great. Very tasty.""

Brighten — which is able to can beer to go — doesn't offer food. But Big Star Pizza is next door and menus are available in the brewery.

""I'm super excited"" Robbins said. ""As long as it felt all this took it feels like now that we're at this point it's happening super fast. There's no turning back now. The gates are open.""

Brighten joins a thriving craft brewing scene in Summit County. The county is home to nearly 20 breweries.

Brighten is open from noon to 10 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday; noon to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday; and 1 to 7 p.m. Sunday. It is closed on Monday and Tuesday.

Rick Armon is the managing editor of The Canton Repository and Massillon Independent. When he's not editing he's likely visiting a brewery. He can be reached at 330-580-8310 or rarmon@cantonrep.com."

I started reading New Mutants and those teens grew up very fast. Domino was in the X-Force comics I read [after New Mutants] and she was teaching them that there were other “radical” ways to be heroes…and I loved it.

Through its #HaathBadhao #VaccineLagao India campaign the pizza chain is offering a total discount of ₹400 which can be claimed on four orders with a rebate of ₹100 being offered on each order. The discount can be availed on orders placed on the Domino's app as the pizza chain sees an uptick in the frequency of online purchases.

As of 31 March 2021 Domino’s Pizza had 1360 restaurants across 293 cities in the country. As of March quarter-end the pizza chain had 57.3 million app downloads.

Domino’s joins several other brands that are using vaccination as a plank to drive marketing campaigns and boost consumption. Globally too marketing campaigns around vaccination have been announced by several large companies such as AB InBev OkCupid and Tinder.

Last week menswear apparel brand Peter England launched a campaign to incentivize shoppers by offering free shopping worth ₹1000 for customers who have received their covid-19 jab. McDonald's and Godrej Appliances have also rolled out offers for vaccinated consumers.

Retailers and brands were severely hit by the second wave of covid cases as state-wide lockdowns resurfaced and discretionary spending took a beating. Restaurants were reduced to fulfilling deliveries and take-aways thereby impacting their in-store dining. As states move back to unlocks and vaccination drives pick pace brands are once again trying to drive consumption by upping offers and consumer promotions.

Safety and hygiene protocols remain the best method in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. While Malaysians embrace the new normal and adapt to new measures Domino’s Pizza Malaysia chief executive officer Shamsul Amree said Domino’s takes cognizance of these concerns.

As Domino’s remain open and operational during the Movement Control Order (MCO) it places great emphasis on safety and well-being of its customers and workforce.

Shamsul said Domino’s was the first service provider to implement mandatory Zero Contact Delivery across all its operations as a measure to mitigate and prevent the spread of Covid-19 as quickly and responsibly as possible at the beginning of MCO in 2020.

Domino’s also introduced its revolutionary Pandu Ambil service to provide safety and convenience to customers from kitchen to car eliminating the need to disembark or even look for a parking spot to collect the order while ensuring 100% contactless service.

Shamsul said the Zero Contact Delivery and Pandu Ambil take-away services were planned well ahead of its introduction as part of Domino’s continuous service improvement to their customers which are relevant for Covid-19 requirements of physical distancing.

“Tech-driven services are important for us to provide a customer experience that transcends touchpoints. The introduction of Pandu Ambil with its advanced integration of back-end programming has enables us increase our capabilities and heighten our efforts to serve our customers across the country” he added.

Shamsul said its Count of Domino’s pledge consists of vigorous safety and hygiene measures which are monitored closely by senior members of the team.

He pointed out that frequent and scheduled sanitization is carried out across all touchpoints including the order taking counter oven tending station pizza making station and routing station entrance and customer area.

Additionally all items in the restaurant and kitchen are sanitized regularly. Staff audits are conducted periodically to ensure SOPs are observed.

He also highlighted that all Domino’s employees including kitchen crew members and cashiers are required to wear face masks undergo daily temperature checks prior to their shifts and practice strict physical distancing in store.

They are also required to wash and sanitize their hands regularly on a scheduled basis. Glove usage is compulsory for all kitchen crew members throughout food preparation process. These steps are enforced as part of Domino’s hygiene and safety standards.

“Safety and convenience will always remain a top priority to us as we live up to our promise of ‘It’s All About You’. Domino’s culture is 100% customer-centric. We keep a close pulse on our customers’ needs and stay ahead of dynamic market trends as we constantly strive to deliver products and services beyond their expectations” concluded Shamsul.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL2J1c2luZXNzL2lyaXNoL3BpenphLXRvLWdvLW5ldy1jZW8tc2NvdHQtYnVzaC10by1iYWtlLWEtc2xpY2Utb2Ytc3VjY2Vzcy1hdC1kb21pbm9zLzQwNTc5NjM2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pizza to go: new CEO Scott Bush to bake a slice of success at Domino's,"Pizza to go: new CEO Scott Bush to bake a slice of success at Domino’s

The premise of active management is essentially that with enough skill it’s easy to consistently outperform the market or the benchmark. When this view was challenged decades ago it sparked a longstanding debate with strong believers on both sides and some in between.

The impact of the debate is far-reaching. It informs decisions about whether to use an active manager or invest in an index-based fund such as an ETF. It challenges the notion that alpha is what all investors should strive for. It has also created a need to gauge the suitability of both approaches across a range of time periods and asset classes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY29ycG9yYXRlLmRvdy5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2Vlay10b2dldGhlci9jZWxlYnJhdGluZy1wcmlkZS1tb250aC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celebrating Pride month,"ALBERTO: We came from very difficult months: friends and families lost spending months alone working from home or the cautions of going into work every day with all the ambiguity we had surrounding the global pandemic. As humanity I think we were very tired. And as a result of that the GLAD team came up with the idea of supporting #ShareYourPride: a vibrant spirit to engage in with communities by volunteering sharing experiences and really expressing yourself with others by celebrating the magic of true inclusion together- and that’s what this month really means to me. It’s a celebration of each other how we identify and what our unique heritages are.

ERICA: I love this year’s Pride month theme. To me it meant extending our progress outside of the company. Dow has made significant progress building an inclusive culture where employees can bring their whole selves to work– feeling proud inspired and a having a true sense of belonging. This culture has personally allowed me to not only come out at work but to raise my voice to continue progressing the journey. I want to not only progress the journey internally at Dow but externally working together to drive real change. This is why I found the event in partnership with GM as the perfect opportunity to work together in order to share our pride as a united voice.

ALEX: For me the campaign is much more than a one-time company event – and underscores the efforts within Dow to engage in our communities. When I grew up in a small town in upstate New York the only LGBTQ+ resource for me and my family was PFLAG Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. We would attend monthly meetings and get to know others in our community. These early years of meeting other LGBTQ+ families and learning about our history motivated me to become engaged in LGBTQ+ activism.

Today Dow is more involved than ever in our local communities and we actively participate along with local non-profits.

There’s been a sharp rise in cyberattacks in recent weeks often disrupting services and products that are essential to everyday lives.

In May the ransomware attack that forced a six-day shutdown of Colonial Pipeline — a key East Coast line that delivers gas to millions of people — brought the scary situation to the forefront of people’s minds. Days later food processor JBS USA also suffered a cyberattack which affected servers supporting its IT systems.

The uneasy trend continued in June with several high-profile companies like McDonald’s and Peloton revealing they too were targeted by hackers. These incidents highlight the growing need for cybersecurity professionals a space that’s facing a skills gap.

Here’s who announced this month that they got hacked:

Electronics Arts

Hackers broke into the systems of Electronic Arts one of the world’s biggest video game publishers and stole source code used in company games. The company made the announcement earlier this month.

Online forum posts reviewed by CNN Business and vetted by an independent cybersecurity expert show that on June 6 hackers claimed to have obtained 780 gigabytes of data from EA including source code for Frostbite the game engine that powers games that include titles in the FIFA Madden and Battlefield series.

Brett Callow a threat analyst at cybersecurity software maker Emsisoft said losing control over source code could be problematic for EA’s business.

“Source code could theoretically be copied by other developers or used to create hacks for games” Callow said.

An EA spokesperson said “no player data was accessed and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy. Following the incident we’ve already made security improvements and do not expect an impact on our games or our business.”

McDonald’s

McDonald’s said earlier this month it too was affected by a data breach which exposed private information of customers and employees in South Korea and Taiwan.

The burger chain said in a statement that an investigation revealed a “small number of files were accessed” some of which contained personal data like emails phone numbers and addresses. McDonald’s is contacting affected customers and regulators in the two areas and said that payment information wasn’t accessed.

“These tools allowed us to quickly identify and contain recent unauthorized activity on our network” a McDonald’s (MCD) spokesperson told CNN Business. “A thorough investigation was conducted and we worked with experienced third parties to support this investigation.”

Peloton

Earlier in June Peloton warned users of its Bike+ about a newly found security threat relating to the touchscreen. Researchers at cybersecurity company McAfee discovered a vulnerability that allows hackers to access Peloton’s bike screen and potentially spy on riders using its microphone and camera.

However the threat most likely affects only the $2495 bike used in public spaces such as hotels or gyms. That’s because a hacker needs to physically access the screen and plug in a USB drive containing malicious code. Researchers said hackers can then discreetly control the stationary bike’s screen remotely and interfere with its operating system.

Fortunately Peloton said it doesn’t know of any instances where this vulnerability was actually exploited and the company pushed a mandatory software update to users to patch the problem.

Volkswagen

Volkswagen and Audi revealed this month they were hit by a data breach that exposed the contact information of customers in the United States and Canada as well as personal details like drivers’ license numbers in some cases.

More than 3 million customers or shoppers had at least basic contact information stolen from an outside company that worked with the automakers according to VW. That data included phone numbers email addresses postal mailing addresses and in some cases vehicle identification numbers.

“We regret any inconvenience this may cause our current or potential customers” VW USA said in a statement. “As always we recommend that individuals remain alert for suspicious emails or other communications that might ask them to provide information about themselves or their vehicle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi9jYXJzL3Rlc2xhLXJlY2FsbC1jaGluYS1jcnVpc2UtY29udHJvbC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi9jYXJzL3Rlc2xhLXJlY2FsbC1jaGluYS1jcnVpc2UtY29udHJvbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla recalls nearly 300000 cars in China over cruise control safety issue,"CNN —

Tesla (TSLA) began recalling more than 285000 vehicles in China on Saturday over a safety risk concerning the vehicle’s cruise control feature.

The cruise control system in certain models can be activated when drivers try to shift gears or accidentally touch the gear selector resulting in accidental acceleration according to China’s State Administration for Market Regulation.

The recall includes 35665 imported Model 3 vehicles and 249855 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in Tesla’s factory in Shanghai. Customers will not be required to return the vehicles. Instead they will receive a free software update either remotely or in-person to resolve the issue.

Tesla apologized for the recall on Saturday in a statement posted on its official Weibo account one of China’s most popular social media sites. Tesla said it will keep improving in accordance with China’s safety regulations.

“We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to our car owners. In the meantime Tesla will strictly follow national regulations and keep improving our safety protection adamantly providing an excellent and safe driving experience to our customers” the automaker said.

China has proven to be a difficult market for Tesla. The company has had five Chinese regulatory agencies questioning the quality of its Shanghai-made Model 3 cars.

The electric car leader sold fewer than 26000 cars in China in April down 27% from March according to figures released by the China Passenger Car Association. The drop came as Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers such as Nio (NIO) Xpeng and Li Auto all reported improved domestic sales."

Here’s who emerged as winners losers,"For Dallas-Fort Worth’s public companies there may never be another year like 2020.

With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the economy in every way many of the region’s biggest corporate players shrank dragged down by a slump in oil prices a reluctance to fly or the complete shutdown of live events and other entertainment.

It also was the year Exxon Mobil Corp. the region’s perennial king of the hill fell a notch in The Dallas Morning News’ annual ranking compiled with the assistance of Bloomberg data analysts.

McKesson Corp. one of North Texas’ California transplants surpassed the Irving-based oil giant to gain the top spot with revenue exceeding $231 billion compared with Exxon’s $178 billion.

But don’t count Exxon out.

With oil prices on the rebound this year the global player could ascend once again based on the strength of early 2021 results that saw Exxon book $59 billion in revenue in the first three months. McKesson which operates on an April to March fiscal year has already set the 2021 target recording $238 billion in revenue.

After the top two it was a textbook example of winners and losers.

Health care companies homebuilders financial firms and consumer products makers — especially toilet paper supplier Kimberly-Clark — all turned in revenue wins. Arlington-based D.R. Horton the nation’s largest homebuilder saw a 15% spike in its revenue and its subsidiary that develops residential lots Forestar Group soared more than 117%.

North Texas homebuying surged 21% in January from the previous year and never really slowed down after that. Credit low mortgage rates and a seller’s market for driving home prices to unprecedented levels.

Airlines oil and gas retailers and hotel and restaurant chains took massive hits feeling the pandemic’s hibernation-inducing grip for much of the year. Fort Worth-based American Airlines watched its revenue plummet 62% and its crosstown rival Dallas-based Southwest Airlines didn’t fare much better — sinking nearly 60%.

But as vaccination rates pick up and consumers confined to their homes much of last year begin to revenge spend 2021 is shaping up as a year of recovery for nearly every corner of North Texas’ highly diversified economy.

Who came out on top?

McKesson’s rise to the top marks the first time one of the region’s California transplants led the Top 150 ranking. The medical and pharmaceutical supplier moved to North Texas in April 2019.

Now headquartered in Irving McKesson saw its revenue soar almost $17 billion in its 2020 fiscal year. And that didn’t include much of the financial lift it got from lucrative government contracts to deliver vaccine supplies around the country.

At the start of the pandemic people scrambled to stock up on prescriptions to prepare for government-ordered lockdowns said Ashtyn Evans a health care equity analyst at the Edward Jones investment firm. Drug volumes dipped later in the year as the pandemic dragged on.

“Health care typically holds up better because it’s harder to delay health care products” said Evans who noted that McKesson distributes one-third of all prescriptions in the U.S.

Other locally based health care companies also benefited from the nation’s pandemic response.

Retractable Technologies Inc. a Little Elm-based maker of syringes saw its 2020 revenue nearly double from the previous year on the strength of government contracts to ramp up production for the vaccine rollout. Its two contracts totaled $137. 4 million last year.

Addus HomeCare Corp. a Frisco-based caregiver business that operates 215 locations in 23 states posted a nearly 18% revenue gain as Americans turned to home care rather than in-person visits to the doctor or hospital.

But 2020 wasn’t universally positive for all health-related companies. Farmers Branch-based Tenet Healthcare for example saw its revenue fall 4.5% primarily from a pause in elective surgeries — an increasingly important part of its business.

Wedbrush financial adviser Chris Mooney said elective surgery postponements weighed heavily last year on the U.S. health care industry’s financial results. The businesses “were hurt overall besides the [government] grants that helped” he said.

Mooney pointed to Orthofix a Lewisville-based medical device company that manufactures implants and screws used in surgeries and the $53 million revenue hit it took last year.

Patient volumes are rebounding this year and hospital stocks are soaring. Tenet’s shares are up around 70% year-to-date.

The biggest winners in 2020 were any companies involved in building homes as the red-hot housing market accelerated throughout the pandemic.

Builder D.R. Horton Inc. posted a 15.5% revenue gain in 2020 and homebuilding supplier Builders FirstSource’s sales spiked 17.6%. D.R. Horton’s affiliated company Forestar Group Inc. had that triple-digit revenue gain.

Edward Jones consumer analyst Brian Yarbrough called it a “perfect storm” year for the residential real estate industry with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates low and the health crisis causing many urban residents to seek land and space in suburban or rural areas.

“The pendulum swung toward [the industry]” Yarbrough said. “How big does it swing back toward entertainment? As people get back to normal they may not have as much cash laying around.”

Last year’s divisive presidential election also played a role in driving up revenue for another North Texas company. Irving-based Nexstar Media Group the nation’s largest owner of local television stations moved into the ranking’s top 30 as its revenue soared by $1.5 billion. It cited political advertising as a key contributor.

Who took the hardest hits?

The pandemic and resulting recession had a predictably disastrous impact on industries and companies involved in oil and gas production or anything to do with travel and hospitality.

Exxon pipeline operator Energy Transfer and its related gasoline distributor Sunoco refiner HollyFrontier and Irving-based independent oil and gas explorer Pioneer Natural Resources all recorded revenue drops ranging from 27% to 36%. High oil prices early in 2020 followed by a falloff in driving during the pandemic are mostly to blame.

Petroleum consumption by the transportation sector declined 16% last year according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Transportation typically accounts for 70% of all U.S. petroleum use.

Despite a troubled 2020 the energy market is almost back to where it was before the pandemic Mooney said. Some analysts are forecasting $100 oil by the end of the year.

“If that happens that would certainly pull capital back into the Texas oil industry” according to a monthly report compiled by Robert Dye Comerica Inc.’s chief economist. “By the third week of June the Texas rig count had improved to 221 active rigs more than double the level from a year earlier.”

The air travel industry is also coming back.

On June 20 the most recent Sunday travel day passenger traffic through U.S. airports had rebounded to 77% of pre-pandemic levels according to data from the Transportation Security Administration. That was up nearly 256% from 2020′s dismal number on the same day.

A year ago Dallas-Fort Worth’s two major airlines were worried about simply surviving as multibillion-dollar losses led to an industry bailout by the federal government. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines both took billions of dollars in grants and loans to stave off mass layoffs that could have sunk the country into a deeper recession.

Both companies tumbled in The News’ annual ranking. American fell from the fifth-largest company in D-FW by revenue to ninth. Southwest slipped from sixth to 19th.

Rivaling the travel industry for hardest hit by the pandemic were the hotel restaurant and entertainment sectors.

Revenue declines recorded by Dallas hotelier Monty Bennett’s empire especially Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc. and Braemar Hotels and Resorts Inc. were typical across that industry. Ashford Hospitality Trust’s revenue evaporated by 66% while Braemar saw 53% of its revenue disappear.

For a finer point on the pandemic’s impact look no further than amusement parks and movie theaters. Shelter-in-place orders and germ spread fears led to silenced rides and empty seats.

Arlington-based Six Flags Entertainment Corp. which operates 26 theme parks in North America watched its revenue dwindle from nearly $1.5 billion in 2019 to $356 million last year — a 76% drop.

Plano-based Cinemark Holdings Inc.’s decline was even more dramatic. Revenue for the movie theater chain plummeted from $3.28 billion in 2019 to $686 million last year — a 79% dive.

Both companies are building back this year with amusement parks and movie theaters reopened. Cinemark has even tapped into new ways to use its theaters — as esports venues for public gaming.

New faces and the soon-to-be departed

Corporate headquarters relocations initial public offerings and direct listings through special purpose acquisition companies brought a handful of new names to this year’s ranking.

Real estate titan CBRE Group made Dallas its official corporate home leaving California behind and taking a spot among D-FW’s five largest companies. Financial services firm First Foundation also left the Golden State.

Drive Shack a golf entertainment business similar to Dallas-based Topgolf or ClubCorp’s Big Shots arrived from the East Coast moving its headquarters from New York to Dallas.

Thryv Holdings Alkami Technology Vine Energy Signify Health RumbleOn and Berry Corp. are also first-timers in the ranking. Thryv’s 2020 revenue topped $1.1 billion making it one of 67 D-FW companies to top the billion-dollar mark.

Next year’s ranking also stands to lose some longtime names through go-private deals or mergers.

Plano-based At Home Group Inc. Irving-based Michaels Cos. Inc. Euless-based U.S. Concrete Inc. Dallas-based RealPage Inc. and Grand Prairie-based Neos Therapeutics all have closed deals or are in the process of leaving the public company ranks.

Looking forward

So what’s ahead for the remainder of 2021?

In May the Dallas-Plano-Irving side of the metro area created 17400 jobs last month accounting for half the new jobs statewide. But the eastern side of D-FW is still 75000 jobs shy of its pre-pandemic level.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had projected that Texas would add over 800000 jobs this year which would have recouped all the positions lost during the pandemic. It has since cut its forecast to 510500 this year in part because of new COVID-19 fears.

“The forecast was revised down this month primarily due to an upward revision in the anticipated path of COVID-19 hospitalizations” said Keith Phillips Dallas Fed assistant vice president and senior economist. “While the percentage of Texans vaccinated against COVID-19 continues to increase the pace of vaccinations has slowed and the more contagious Delta variant is spreading. Together these two patterns have changed the outlook for COVID-19 hospitalizations in the third quarter from a consistent downward trend to a slight increase through September.”

Supply-side complications such as difficulty finding workers widescale shortages of materials long lead times and transportation issues also threaten to restrain economic growth according to Dallas Fed senior business economist Laila Assanie and research analyst Carlee Crocker.

Waco economist Ray Perryman remains bullish on Texas’ rebound.

“We can reasonably expect a solid comeback as the global economy is able to reopen and both business and leisure travel resume” Perryman said. He noted that prices are rising too — a positive sign for businesses trying to make up lost ground.

“The fortunes of individual companies will vary based on specific circumstances but there should be ample opportunities for expansion and innovation going forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVybG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVuLzI2L3BsYW50YXRpb24tYmF5LWhvbWUtdG9wcy10aGUtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtc2FsZXMtbGlzdC1pbi1vcm1vbmQtYmVhY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plantation Bay home tops the real estate sales list in Ormond Beach,"A house in Plantation Bay was the top real estate transaction in Ormond Beach and Ormond-by-the-Sea for the week of May 16-22 in the Multiple Listing Service.

The couple returned to their home along Grindston Road east of M-53 to find lawn mowers snow blowers compressors deep freezers grills tools hunting gear and beloved Christmas decorations in shreds or just plain gone. The garage structure itself had disappeared blown into hundreds of pieces.

The twister in the Thumb was one of five confirmed tornadoes that hit Michigan on Saturday as stormy weather stretched across the state. The National Weather Service also reported tornadoes touching down in central Michigan's Clare County and in west Michigan — two in Ionia County and one in Mecosta County. The Port Austin twister was the strongest the weather service said.

The Horetskis were among a handful of Port Austin families recovering from the EF-2 tornado which had peak winds estimated at 120 mph with a 6.9 mile path and maximum width of 400 yards. It hit the southern portion of the village.

""Our garage is completely gone. Everything is all over the place in the neighbors' yards. We can't find some of it. The garage door is all smashed on top on it with sharp pieces right into things"" Jan said on Sunday.

Of the 18 to 19 maple trees the couple planted just after they got married 50 years ago on their property everyone was uprooted Jan said. Fruit trees flowering trees and other landscaping have all been ripped from its foundation and roots adding to the shock of a tornado which hit several homes along Grindstone Road east of M-53 at the southern portion of Port Austin village.

The National Weather Service on Sunday confirmed the Saturday tornado. The tornado hit about 5:49 p.m. leaving in its wake sheared-off trees splintered limbs and damage to several homes.

""We've never had a tornado here"" Jan said. ""We are OK. Everything can be replaced.""

The last tornado to hit Huron County was an EF-0 on Nov. 6 2015 the NWS said.

Officials at the weather service said the tornado touched down 4 miles southwest of Port Austin north of the intersection between Port Crescent Road and Sand Road. It snapped several trees and tree limbs uprooted trees and damaged barns and buildings.

The tornado moved northeast and crossed M-53 just south of the M-25 intersection. From there it damaged six houses with three roofs detached and one house with major roof damage. Two garages and one barn were completely destroyed. There is substantial tree damage in the area.

A tornado watch had been issued for the Thumb area on Saturday until 10 p.m. but that watch never became a tornado warning which would have activated a tornado siren said Trent Fray a meteorologist with the weather service.

Fray said the service issued a special water spout warning for across Saginaw Bay on Saturday afternoon that included a tornado warning.

""We watched a cluster of storms come across the bay. The storm moved into the tip of the Thumb here and didn’t present significant evidence a tornado was ongoing that’s why the watch wasn’t changed to a warning"" Fray said.

""We didn’t receive reports until it was over"" Fray said.

A silo and barn collapsed on Joseph Baranski's dairy farm on Grindstone Road after the tornado tore across its pastures damaging sheds a hen house and the main property said Sharon Scranton sister to Joseph Baranski. Baranski was not available for an interview on Sunday.

Scranton said the cows were outside and not in the barn when it collapsed but one is injured. Windows in her brother's home were blown out and several trees had been ripped out.

""There was no warning. It's kind of a mess. It's like a movie set"" Scranton said. ""(My brother) was in the house and not the barn. He is OK.""

DTE crews were on-site Sunday attempting to repair downed poles and lines as residents picked through the damage.

At 6:30 p.m. Sunday DTE's outage map showed 1996 customers in Port Austin Port Austin Township and Huron City have been without power. The utility expected to restore power by 11:30 p.m. Sunday.

DTE said its teams are encountering extensive wind and flood damage across the region which was delaying access to equipment. The utility asked residents to stay at least 20 feet from power lines and anything they’re in contact with and to consider them live.

""Our field crews have been working around the clock to repair damage and restore electric service for our customers"" DTE representative Jill M. Wilmot said. ""We expect most to be restored by 11:30 p.m. Monday evening although there is a possibility for those customers near the downtown Port Austin area to have their electricity back on as soon as 11:30 Sunday night.""

Outages and downed lines can be reported online at outage.dteenergy.com with the DTE Energy Mobile app or at 1-800-477-4747.

The tornado in Clare County which touched down in Clare was about 85 mph NWS officials said. Damage included a partly caved-in barn and snapped tree limbs and a house attachment or garage-like structure on cinderblocks was destroyed.

The tornado in Mecosta County reached speeds of 90 mph. There were no injuries NWS officials said. In Ionia County one storm produced two tornadoes

Flooding

Since residents started waking up Saturday morning we’ve received hundreds of pictures showing flooded streets highways and basements.

Many pictures are coming in from Detroit Dearborn Dearborn Heights Livonia Canton Township Grosse Pointe Westland Southfield Bloomfield Hills Rochester Hills and other cities.

Dozens of residents have sent in pictures of water as high as cars and mailboxes. Drivers should be careful out on the road. Remember if a road is flooded don’t try to drive through it -- turn around!

It’s also been a difficult morning for many residents who woke up to flooded basements.

A flood watch is in effect for Detroit and all of Southeast Michigan until 4 a.m. Sunday.

Upcoming weather forecast

We haven’t seen the last of this week’s rainfall.

In his Saturday morning forecast update Andrew Humphrey wrote that “more showers and thunderstorms will give Friday’s deluge a run for its money on Saturday.”

He said 2-4 inches of rain fell Friday and at least 1-2 inches will fall in spots before Saturday ends.

“Saturday afternoon will have periods of showers and thunderstorms” Andrew wrote. “With any sunshine temperatures will pop to the low and mid-80s. Areas with more clouds will have afternoon temperatures in the mid- and upper 70s.”

Saturday evening will have scattered showers and thunderstorms. Wet weather could continue into the night.

Scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible Sunday as well though partly sunny skies are more likely with wet weather lifting north in the afternoon Andrew says.

More on-and-off showers and thunderstorms are in the forecast for the start of the workweek."
DUK,Duke Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmYWUub3JnL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEtMDYtMjYvYmFjay10by13b3JrLWNvbnVuZHJ1bS13aGVyZS10by1wYXJr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Back To Work Conundrum: Where To Park?,"With smaller employers returning to the office and the big banks bringing most of their workers back over the next few months Charlotteans who work uptown will be confronted with a question many haven’t thought about for more than a year: Where will I park?

It’s a simple question with big ramifications both for the future of Charlotte — an auto-dependent city trying to wean itself from absolute reliance on cars — and workers’ finances. A reserved spot in an uptown garage can easily cost $200 or more a month adding a $2400 annual expense. Although non-reserved garage spots and surface lots can be cheaper they still generally run anywhere from $50 to $200 a month.

Despite new mass transit options on the horizon endless think pieces about the future of remote work and high-profile moves like Duke Energy’s reducing office space 60% one thing is clear: A convenient parking spot in uptown is still going to be a hot and pricey commodity. Parking operators aren’t touting any discounts and some garages like Center City Green across from the Spectrum Center still have waitlists for monthly spots.

“Transient (daily) parking has come back very quickly as things have opened up. On the monthly parkers side it’s coming back slowly” said Steve McClure CEO of Spectrum Cos. which manages garages in office towers including 300 South Tryon and 230 South Tryon. But with the banks offering more definitive timetables about returning (Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan pointed to “Labor Day or mid-September” last week ) McClure has a prediction: “Things are going to ramp up very quickly. We’ll get back to pre-COVID levels soon.”

A walk around uptown last week showed how much things have changed from the winter  when center city on a typical workday still looked Christmas-morning empty. Although they weren’t full the parking garages and surface lots of uptown are no longer vacant. Several garages were full up to the top couple of floors and street parking was once again hard to find on busy streets.

Several major parking lot operators painted a similar picture: In the early days of the shutdown March 2020 daily parking immediately fell to near-zero and stayed there. Data from the city of Charlotte shows parking transactions at the city’s metered spots were down by more than half in August 2020 (when Charlotte started enforcing metered parking again) compared to the prior year.

Roger Stacks president and CEO of Preferred Parking — you’ve doubtless seen their red-and-white signs across the city — said revenue was down an average of 48% last year. Some garages and lots however were down 80%.

“Business ground to a halt and ours did also” said Stacks. Nevertheless some monthly parkers held onto their spots.

“Employees maintained their parking because of the uncertainty. People expected to be coming back in the fall” said David Pitser Childress Klein’s Charlotte-based director of property management. Childress Klein handles parking at office towers like One Two and Three Wells Fargo and the Duke Energy Center.

But once it became apparent that almost no one was going back to the office in 2020 and maybe not until late 2021 monthly parkers quickly cancelled their contracts. Parking is down anywhere from 40% to 60% in their garages Pitser said.

It’s only the second time Pitser’s seen uptown’s parking supply exceed demand. The first was after the Great Recession.

“All of the garages historically had lengthy waitlists. It could be several years for a space to open up” he said. That’s changing however. “We are seeing a sudden but expected spike for people registering for parking again.”

Still not everyone is looking forward to a seamless return to the parking deck. Shannon Binns executive director of Sustain Charlotte said he hopes people will consider other ways to get back to the office.

“It’s not an inevitability that the commute has to be awful and parking has to be a struggle” he said. “This is the time to say ‘I want better choices.’”

We have a complicated relationship with parking. Workers have to shell out thousands of dollars a year to go to their jobs; developers pay millions of dollars to build less-profitable parking decks that take up much of the space they could otherwise turn into leasable top-dollar offices or apartments; and urbanists rage against the blocks of “cars behind bars” and oceans of hot asphalt that suck vitality from city streets.

Despite Charlotte’s decade-long building boom about 144 acres of uptown is still devoted to surface parking lots according to an analysis by Clayton Sealey of CLT Development. This spring The Atlantic ran a story titled “ How Parking Destroys Cities ” which generally describes the regard in which many hold parking. Several parking operators were hesitant to speak on the record about a mundane subject that provokes ire — monthly parking — which one termed a “necessary evil.”

But damn if we don’t love a good parking spot. Is there anything sweeter than finding an open spot right by the elevator or near the exit so you slip out at 5 p.m. on the dot without waiting behind a line of cars trying to get out of the deck?

Out of necessity or choice more than 7 in 10 Charlotteans drive alone to work. The proportion is a bit lower for uptown workers according to Charlotte Center City Partners: About 57% drive to work while 29% walk almost 10% telecommute and 2.9% take public transit (the rest get to work by “other” means).

Since more than 120000 people work uptown and there are roughly 55000 professionally managed parking spaces available that means that even if a significant number of people adopt some kind of hybrid schedule demand for parking is likely to exceed supply. Working two days a week at home won’t matter much in terms of making parking easier if most people are coming in Tuesday-Thursday for example.

“We villainize parking in some ways. The truth is it’s an essential asset” said Michael Smith CEO of Charlotte Center City Partners. His prediction: Uptown’s parking growth will slow as more people work from home sometimes and new transit options like the Silver Line open but we’re not going to see that growth stop.

“In our economic development work” said Smith “when we meet with professionals and it gets down to space it quickly turns to ‘How will I park this?’”

Parking operators and developers are planning for the return of office workers but they’re also planning for a future that looks slightly different. Stacks said his company is expecting a return to a sense of normalcy by the end of the year. Preferred Parking is also exploring new options like a punch-card type system that would give workers who have to be in the office only some of the time the option to buy 10 days per month of parking instead of the standard monthly unlimited option.

Even seemingly simple plans like that come with more ripple effects to puzzle out. Pitser of Childress Klein said they’re looking at similar ideas. But if you sell 10-day passes instead of a set number of monthly passes what happens if more people try to park in a garage one day than the garage has capacity for?

“It’s not good for us when people who depend on our parking facility to support their business can’t find parking” he said. They’re exploring ways to tie parking reservations to hot desk reservations for tenants in the office towers Childress Klein manages — the kind of banal but indispensable infrastructure we’ll have to work out to support true hybrid workplaces.

Whatever the future holds Smith had one more simple prediction: “I will be surprised if we’re a city that needs less parking than we have now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBlbm55aG9hcmRlci5jb20vc2F2ZS1tb25leS9ob3ctdG8tY29vbC1kb3duLWEtcm9vbS13aXRob3V0LWFjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Cool Down a Room Without AC,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/save-money/how-to-cool-down-a-room-without-ac/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBlbm55aG9hcmRlci5jb20vc2F2ZS1tb25leS9ob3ctdG8tY29vbC1kb3duLWEtcm9vbS13aXRob3V0LWFjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL2dvZGFucml2ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYWZ0ZXItZGFuLXJpdmVyLXRyYWdlZHktaW4tZWRlbi10YWxrcy1tYXktc3VyZmFjZS1vbi1yZW1vdmluZy1kYW52aWxsZS1kYW0vYXJ0aWNsZV8wNmNhZTJhMi1kNWViLTExZWItOWVkMi1lYjU1NjNlNjg5NTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Dan River tragedy in Eden talks may surface on removing Danville dam,"Following the fatal tubing accident at a dam in Eden N.C. that left at least four people dead earlier this month Danville officials are likely to re-examine whether to remove the dam spanning the Dan River near the former White Mill and Long Mill buildings.

“There are no immediate plans to bring that up to [Danville City] Council but we would likely be bringing that to Council at some later date” Danville City Manager Ken Larking said.

A City Council member who has been a long-time advocate of the dam’s removal is Vice Mayor Gary Miller.

“I’m certainly going to bring it up to the mayor” Miller said Thursday.

Whether to tear down the dam has been and off-and-on question discussed by city officials for years.

The concrete White Mill — or Long Mill — dam owned by the city stretches 1144 feet across the Dan River and is 5 feet tall.

The dam is believed to have been built around 1894 to create water power for the Dan River Inc. factories along both sides of the Dan River. For most of its history it was not accessible to the public.

A review by consultants hired by the city about four years ago found at the time that fully removing the structure would bring the most benefits and the fewest concerns.

Danville Public Works in 2016 recommended removing the dam.

The city did not demolish the dam previously because many area residents opposed the idea.

Recent deaths

Five-year-old Kolton Karnes drowned at the Brantley Steam Plant dam in 2010. He was the fourth person to drown at one of the Dan River’s low-head dams since 1965. The dam which was located downstream of the White Mill dam was removed in 2011.

In August 76-year-old Axton resident Ronald Edward Reynolds died after the canoe he was in with his grandson capsized twice at the bottom of the White Mill dam.

A deadly June 16 tubing accident claimed the lives of four of family members at an 8-foot-high dam at the Duke Energy Dan River Steam Station in Eden. The nine family members who set out tubing that day were unaware of the dam a survivor said. One woman remains missing.

Expressing sorrow at the tragedy Danville Mayor Alonzo Jones said he would present the question of the dam’s possible removal at a later date. Now is not the time he said.

“Let’s allow the families to heal” Jones said. “The last thing the families need is an argument or debate.”

City Council member Sherman Saunders said he is not opposed to taking the dam down.

“I do think that it should be discussed again” Saunders said Friday.

With plans for a riverfront park on a 4-acre spot near King Memorial Bridge and an area for whitewater rafting “we ought to be as safe as we can be” he said pointing to more expected visitors and residents in the city in the future.

“I would choose the side of safety” Saunders said. “It may cost a little but how do you put a figure on human life?”

The firm DHM Designs Inc. (which is now Site Collaborative) in Raleigh N.C. found in 2017 that demolishing the dam would restore natural habitat and an extended view up and downstream of the structure showing water rushing over rocks in the river.

The study estimated at the time that it would cost between $100000 and $250000 to remove the dam.

Also getting rid of the dam would result in no ongoing maintenance costs or dam safety concerns the study concluded.

By removing a large obstruction smaller obstacles could be added to get more recreational benefits from the river a consultant with DHM told councilmen at the time. The only drawback would be elimination of the visual cues of the dam’s presence.

Park benefit

Bill Sgrinia director of Danville Parks and Recreation said removing the dam — as part of the riverfront park project — would be a credit for the city toward getting permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the park project.

“Any time you can remove a dam from the river it’s good for the health of the river” Sgrinia said. “Low-head dams are very dangerous.”

Removing it would enhance the area’s safety and add a beautiful aesthetic to the river with expanded views of its rocks he said.

“A river that is free-flowing is prettier than when it is dammed up” Miller said.

Conditions also would be safer for kayakers and canoers. If the dam is not removed another dam-related tragedy is inevitable he added.

“It’s just a matter of time before it happens again here” Miller said.

Group speaks out

The Dan River Basin Association is launching a conversation about outdoor recreational safety following the tragedy in Eden.

“Every year thousands of people safely enjoy our outdoor recreational assets because of the collaborative efforts of the organizations and municipalities in our region” Tiffany Haworth executive director of the Dan River Basin Association said in a statement this week. “But one tragedy is too many. People and organizations from every corner of the Dan River Basin are reaching out to us and sharing new ideas related to outdoor recreational safety. We want those voices to be heard.”

The group is inviting the more than a dozen counties that make up the Dan River Basin to join in the talk by reaching out to the organization at drba.nc@danriver.org or 336-627-6270.

“DRBA is the expert when it comes to outdoor recreational assets and protecting the environment” Cindy Adams tourism for the city of Eden said in the statement.",,,,,,

The ultrasonics business that originated in Jim Bullen’s garage in 1971 is now an “ultrasonic machining powerhouse” and globally recognized leader in the production of high-quality components used in semiconductors MEMS transportation defense & aerospace medical & life sciences industries. Half a century later Bullen Ultrasonics remains a privately held company owned by Jim’s son-in-law Steve Brown and daughter Vicki Brown and their family.

“I know that Jim would be proud to see the company doing what it’s doing today staying true to our values and committed to excellence in every way” Brown said. “Because we’ve remained committed to our family values Bullen has been able to accomplish so much more than technical output over the last 50 years. The beauty of a family business means that we have the freedom to push the boundaries and innovate uniquely. We’ve built things no one else has built; we’ve reached markets others hadn’t touched and created value for our customers in unique and innovative ways.”

Fifty years ago Bullen Ultrasonics began as a small group of engineers that repaired old ultrasonic machines and sold them globally to in-need countries like India. In the early 1990s led at the time by Steve Brown and Mary Bullen the business started working alongside IBM and Howmet Aerospace and took on a newfound trajectory.

Around that same time Bullen’s engineers began working with Lam Research (LRCX) in California. What started as a small job with Lam quickly turned into a more significant project and Bullen acquired even more customers through a network of semiconductor manufacturers looking for similar ultrasonic solutions.

This series of events propelled Bullen to dive deep into the silicon production world which ultimately led to the company’s differentiation in the ultrasonics space. The Bullen team decided to alter its supply chain by growing its own silicon crystal in 1997. Despite its small size and humble roots Bullen was the only crystal grower in the world growing wafer-quality silicon for non-wafers at the time. By 2006 they had 13 crystal growers. They eventually sold these silicon growing and processing assets to Lam Research now known as Silfex. It continues to experience growth at its Eaton and Springfield Ohio facilities.

Today Tim Beatty serves as the company’s president proudly preserving the DNA of the company. “While I embrace the opportunity to carry on the legacy of the Bullen family as the company’s president I also recognize that everything that’s happened in these last 50 years can be traced back to our employees” said Beatty. “We have incredibly talented people working for us. Everywhere I turn our employees strive to make a difference for our customers in their homes and within their communities. This positive culture I believe is created by people and fostered by leadership.”

Beatty and the rest of the Bullen Ultrasonics team believe that their work extends beyond just the technology and day-to-day production. Bullen has gained a reputation of service both locally and globally over its 50 years in business and was most recently awarded Dayton Business Journal’s 2020 Business of the Year. It contributes 10 percent of its profits to global charitable organizations in Cambodia Mumbai and the Philippians. It continues to serve those in Preble County as a longstanding affiliate of the Preble County Development Partnership and Home is the Foundation.

“We want our employees to know they are making a difference when they come to work every day. We give a portion of our profit back to our employees and people in need worldwide. This has been a part of our DNA ever since the beginning and that’s something that will define us for years to come” adds Beatty.

Bullen continues to seek opportunities to create value for its customers by improving operational excellence in everything from engineering to quality assurance. It has created a system built around supporting its employees to focus on delivering value and quality services to its customers. The company plans to diversify its technology to open new markets while allowing them to better serve existing customers in the semiconductors aerospace and MEMS industries. Bullen continues its growth and is currently hiring for various positions which can be viewed at bullentech.com/careers.

Bullen leadership is inviting any current and former team members as well as their families to a 50th-anniversary celebration which will be held on Saturday Sept. 11 at the Bullen facility. Find out more about Bullen’s celebration and history at bullenultrasonics.com/anniversary.

Todd Hernandez has coached nearly a half dozen distinct Eaton squads during his five years running the program.

But he began to notice in the opening days of the season two months ago that this team was just a little bit different. It had a different dedication level a different mentality — it was just wired differently.

And being a little bit different is often not a bad thing.

The second-seeded Reds proved as much today when they topped the fourth-seeded Classical Academy 4-1 in the title game of the Class 3A state baseball tournament at Frederick High School.

As it has all season Eaton maintained unflappable focus the entire game even while the game was delayed 45 minutes in the fifth inning because of a passing thunderstorm.

“From the first day of practice our coaches said ‘You know something’s different about this group. … It’s just a different feel'” Hernandez said. “And you can sense that throughout the year. When we tried different lineups when we did different things they were all in.”

By being a bit different this Eaton team now has something in common with 11 other Reds teams of yesteryear. With the victory today the Reds (21-1) became the 12th team in school history to win a 3A state baseball title — building upon the program’s own all-classification state record.

Within an environment in which most teams would have had to overcome early butterflies while experiencing a state finals atmosphere for the first time this collection of Eaton players displayed no nerves as they jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the top of the first inning.

The Reds’ mindset is just different.

“You just have to go up with the same approach — like when you get down two strikes — if you just put it in play good things happen” said sophomore three-hole batter Walker Martin who rocketed a double to the center-field fence for Eaton’s first run. “That’s what we’ve been working on all year long — two-strike hitting.”

Even with an immediate two-run cushion Reds senior pitcher Logan Moser refused to take anything for granted. He pitched a complete game throwing 95 pitches allowing no earned runs on two hits striking out 13 and walking two.

With a 110-pitch limit it’s a bit rare these days for a pitcher to go the distance in a seven-inning game especially in a game deep in the state tournament against a truly elite opponent.

Yet when most pitchers would be tiring Moser only got better in the game’s latter stages — at one point striking out 10 of 12 batters between innings four and seven.

Moser is just different.

“Everything today was good” said Moser who will pitch next year for the University of Mary in Bismarck North Dakota. “When I woke up this morning I was ready to shut down (the opponent) and go as long as I possibly could on the mound.”

After giving their pitcher two runs of support many lineups might ease up a tad and wait for the other team to make a move before responding.

But the Reds never afforded the Titans (13-8) even a hint of a rally. Facing a pair of top-tier pitchers The Classical Academy had at its disposal — seniors Teller Wilson and Kobe Katayama — Eaton scratched and clawed its way to a pair of insurance runs in the second and sixth innings.

This Reds lineup is just different.

“We always want to put up runs for our pitcher” Martin said. “He’s dealing out here. We got to protect him a little bit with run support. So getting those last two runs kind of sealed the deal for us.”

This was the fourth team champion Eaton has had this school year alone joining the football softball and volleyball teams.

Though this Reds team is one of a dozen to claim a baseball title during the program’s famed existence it is the first since 2015. It’s also the first title under Hernandez an Eaton alum and longtime coach at the school who has also spent the past 15 years coaching the Reds’ girls basketball program.

Even though casual observers years and decades from now may just lump this team into the same company as the other 11 Eaton teams that hoisted that championship trophy after that final game of the 3A baseball season this year’s squad established its own identity and left its own unique mark.

And this collection of 18 pinstriped players have left no doubt: these Reds are just different.

“I can not say enough about the group that we have” Hernandez said. “Man … they’re gritty they grind and they come to work every single day. The best part about it is they’re in it for each other.”

Like the fact that she won a racing championship with her family-owned team or that she’s competing in her first open-wheel race this weekend with the W Series—where she’ll also be competing against her girlfriend Jess for the first time.

At the start of the month I had a chance to sit down with Abbie to chat about what her experience in motorsport has been like. I’ll admit that I was really interested in how she responded to being a gay woman in a sport that’s been traditionally composed of straight men. But I learned so much more: how her family has served as her biggest support how she handles sponsorship and marketing as a nontraditional racing figure and how she balances her work and her life when everything is so focused on racing.

Elizabeth Blackstock: Thank you for taking the time to talk. I think I mentioned it a little bit in my email but I’m working with A Girls Guide to Cars and we want to have more focus on the LGBTQ+ community and talk about it. With your success in racing and your appearances on The Grand Tour you were the first person I thought of. I’d love to talk about your career especially the way it intersects with your identity. Could you start with telling me how you got into racing and what it was like growing up in a male-dominated sport?

Abbie Eaton: I first got into racing—well I was 10 years old when I started myself. But my dad always raced. He got his first bike when he was 16. So I was at racing circuits in my mum’s tummy. It’s all I’ve ever known. Growing up at the race track to be honest I’ve always been a bit of a tomboy. It never once entered my head that it was a male-dominated thing. It was like well guys are just more into cars than girls. But like I like cars so I want to do it.

I remember it taking a couple years of pestering my dad to get my a go-kart. Eventually he had a sponsorship deal in a championship he was racing and when that came to an end he was like right I’ve got some time to commit to you now to pass the baton on. That type of thing.

I started karting when I was 10 for about four and a half years. The money we were spending on that we could actually get our first race car and move into cars when I was about 15. Now next year will be our 20th year of racing.

EB: Oh that’s exciting. Congratulations.

AE: Long time right?

EB: How did you balance school and life and racing? That’s a pretty tough trifecta.

Advertisement

AE: Racing always came first. It probably shouldn’t have but it did. My parents said I had to get an education first to fall back on. Yes you’re good at racing but you have to think logically about things and if you haven’t gotten anything left to fall back on you’re screwed.

I did my GSCEs took my A-levels—basically the exams you have to do before you go into uni. I remember I was taking my A-levels and it was just when my racing was taking off a little bit. I found it really really hard to focus on and put everything into doing my A-levels because I was like I need to look at this data I need to do this for the track I’m racing this weekend. I remember one of my races I had an A-level test on the Friday so I missed the testing for racing. I just turned up on the Saturday. And I remember that whole time during testing I was thinking about being on track.

Advertisement

I didn’t do too bad in my exams. I did okay. But yeah I’ve not needed them so far. It was a juggling act but motorsport is a lifestyle and if you want to succeed in it and you love it and you’re passionate about it it literally is in every single part of your life. You’ve just got to embrace it.

EB: With your dad racing that was engrained in your family. What was it like growing up in that atmosphere where racing was basically what you knew.

Advertisement

AE: It was just a lot of fun. Even now looking back on it I realize what a childhood I had. Friday to Sunday at the track with my dad and my mum. Without having that I don’t think I actually ever would have spent that much time with my dad if I didn’t have motorsport.

When you’re competing professionally and taking it seriously it teaches you a lot of life lessons. You know the kart might break and it’s something out of your control and you have to deal with that loss. You might be winning like Max Verstappen [at Baku]. He was awesome. He controlled the race it was a done deal but something out of his control ended his race. And it’s how you deal with those setbacks.

Advertisement

Equally you might win you’ve got to learn how not to gloat. Which like as a 10 or 12 year old kid it’s tough. I loved it. I wouldn’t change it for the world. I couldn’t imagine not growing up in that atmosphere.

EB: That sounds amazing. My family loved racing when I was growing up but we never went to the track. The first race I went to was when I was 18. I can’t even imagine what a great time you had.

Advertisement

AE: I remember when I was really young—probably preschool—when my dad would go racing I’d go away with him on the weekend. So we’d go away on Friday then I’d obviously have school on the Monday. And I’d be like “mum no I’m tired.” So I’d get the morning off on Monday. Oh Abigail’s sick she’s poorly today—on Friday while I’m on my way up to Scotland with my dad to go racing.

EB: That’s the dream. So you initially came out on Twitter I guess kind of unceremoniously? After there were accusations of homophobia directed at the cast members of The Grand Tour. What prompted that decision on your part?

Advertisement

AE: I’ve never hidden the fact that I was gay so I never actually came out. I’ve been openly showing photos and referring to my girlfriend and stuff for years and years. I came out when I was 16 or 17. It wasn’t difficult for me to defend them or anything. Actually I was just being jovial and taking the mick out of the whole situation. And it was all like “Oh my god she’s come out on Twitter.” Like if you actually looked at my social media I’ve not been hiding anything. I’ve been posting date nights with my girlfriend blah blah blah. I think the press just like to create a story out of stuff. They can’t help themselves.

Obviously for me working on The Grand Tour yes maybe they pushed boundaries on some of their humor and stuff like that. But I’ve never once been offended by any of their sketches or their jokes. Even with Top Gear before they went to The Grand Tour. I think the world is always looking to be offended by certain things. Just like Jeremy takes the michael out of James he takes the michael out of himself. He’s the first to be “blithering idiot” “big middle aged fat man.” It’s a TV program at the end of the day and it’s there to entertain and I felt it was unjust the grief they were getting. So I just said funny that they’ve got a gay as their driver. And then media freaked out.

EB: Well I’ll admit that I was one of the people who had no idea—I’m sorry! ...What was it like working on The Grand Tour? I’m sure it was awesome exposure but it was just a lot of fun watching your appearances.

AE: It was good fun. I never thought I’d have the opportunity to work with Clarkson and the boys. I grew up watching them. Sunday night in the UK would always be sit down with the family and watch Top Gear. To work with them is something really cool. Not only that but the certain cars I had the opportunity to drive I would never have been given that opportunity without given the job. I’ve been really lucky and very appreciative of the chance I’ve had.

Advertisement

EB: You mentioned that you came out fairly young. Would you mind talking about the support network you had that enabled you to share your identity with everyone?

AE: For me when I was younger as is probably the norm I was quite scared about it. I was really worried. I had it in my head that companies… well being a female in a male-dominated sport if you’re fast and you’re good looking you’re more marketable. So I was really worried that if I came out sponsors would look at me and be like “Well we can’t market her because ideally we want the Danica Patrick type stuff from back in the day. All the men want to date her and blah blah blah. I was really worried about that.

Advertisement

It took me a while to be comfortable in myself. I think it was more if I was comfortable in myself none of that would have mattered. Once I accepted it then I’m quite thick-skinned and quite strong-willed so I didn’t care about anything else. I was like I’m fast enough on the track. If people want to sponsor me and partner with me then it’s because I’m fast on the track. I can hold myself well I can talk to people I can represent their company in a positive way. Fast forward to now there’s this massive push with diversity and inclusivity and all that. If I was now a 16 year old kid then I would be much more comfortable to come out.

EB: I was going to ask the culture has evolved pretty significantly in the past few years. What has it been like to be part of that change?

Advertisement

AE: I haven’t really acknowledged that I’ve been part of it. I’m there to drive fast and compete and win races. I think it was when I was about to join W Series and Matt Bishop who was the head of communications at the time said look I’m helping this Racing Pride organization. I’d love for you to be involved.

My initial response was I don’t want to be part of it if I’m being forced to say oh there’s all this homophobia and this and that because I’ve been lucky. I’ve not really experienced that much of it. I haven’t experienced any homophobia full stop in motorsport. I didn’t want be associated with stories that I haven’t experienced myself. But I know from other people’s experiences that I’ve just been really lucky.

I said to Matt I said if I can be part of it with my little profile that I have if me just being authentic and living who I am—if that helps someone then of course I want to be part of Racing Pride.

EB: I really love the way that the organization has posited itself as a positive and doesn’t unduly focus on the negative. Like you can do this too.

AE: It’s just more educating people. Especially since people are so worried of saying the wrong thing that they don’t say anything at all. So if we can educate people on what’s the right way to converse with someone or how to do it without making the other person uncomfortable—but also the person speaking they need to be comfortable and not worry that they’re offending someone. That’s what we’re here to do.

EB: I’ve followed it since it first started and it’s just been so great to see it evolve. Especially with the push of allyship and going beyond just being specifically the LGBTQ+ communities and expanding to allies. That’s what needs to happen with motorsport since the community is probably not as hip to some of these concepts as maybe some other parts of society. Especially in America.

I’ve talked to a few other LGBTQ+ drivers who feel like their experience of motorsport would be totally different if they had been straight or something else. Do you have any special way you feel like your identity intersects with your career? Or has it just not occurred to you? Some drivers feel it’s really important and some drivers just aren’t really bothered.

AE: I think more the latter. It’s a part of who I am but I’m not defined by my sexuality or by the fact that I’m a girl in motorsport. I’m all those things lots of different things and as long as I’m fast then that’s all I care about. I know there are other drivers—a friend of mine like Charlie Martin for example she’s a real activist for trans rights so she uses that alongside her career. They help each other. Her career will help the task she’s got ahead of her and that’ll make everything better. The two bounce off each other. For me personally it’s just who I am. I’m just me.

EB: I love it. I don’t want to pry too deeply into your personal life but your partner is also a racer. That’s a very demanding job. How do both of you balance your work and your life when you’re both part of this super demanding sport?

AE: For me previously motorsport is very niche. It’s very demanding as you said. You don’t really understand the workings of it unless you’re in motorsport so previous relationships I’ve had have ended because they just can’t wrap their head around the fact that it is my life and my life revolves around motorsport.

Whereas with Jess she’s doing the exact same thing as me pretty much. We both get it. We’ll be at different race tracks and I won’t hear from her most of the day but because I know she’s doing this and that. Whereas other people I’ve dated that have been out of the industry they’re like why aren’t you responding? It’s just understanding and trusting each other. So far it’s been awesome. We’ve really been enjoying how it’s all working.

You know we haven’t really had to race against against which will happen in a few weeks’ time it’ll be our first race against each other. That’s another dynamic we’ll have to get our heads around. I just want her to succeed and do well and she wants the same for me. If we can both be at the sharp end of the grid then we’ll both be happy.

EB: What moment in your career has made you proudest so far?

AE: Probably when I won the MX-5 Supercup Championship because it was the last year that I raced with the family team and it was a real nail-biter of a year. It was highs and lows all year. My dad basically built the car and engineered it along with my mechanic Chris and was there supporting all the time. My uncle Matt was team manager and it was all a family-run thing. We ended up winning the championship. It was so nice being able to sign off that kind of era of family-run stuff with something so special. I was the only girl on the grid and there was 38 in total I think. So it was something really cool and special to do. So being able to share that with my family is something I’ll always treasure. If I could bottle up the feeling I had at the end of it I’d be a millionaire.

EB: Aside from your family who were your mentors? Or even just the racers you looked up to when you were growing up?

AE: When I was growing up I watched F1 in the era where Michael Schumacher was dominant so I’d always look at him and think I wanted to be as fast and as successful as him. Obviously my dad from my dad’s racing. As a young kid you look up and think wow he’s invincible he can do anything. And a lot of the V8 Supercars drivers from Australia. They’re absolutely outstanding drivers. What they do in the car and how they make the car dance is just awesome. Those as well.

In terms of female drivers there wasn’t really any I could think of at that top level that I wanted to emulate because they weren’t winning at the time. All I wanted to do was win so I’d support the drivers that were winning.

EB: My last question is what are your hopes for the future. Your goals and where you want to be in five years.

Advertisement

AE: Very very rich probably. I’ll have even more trophies in the cabinet.

In the short term W Series is a brand new challenge for me. I’ve never raced formula cars or single-seaters. My learning curve is very steep this year. I’m viewing the next year as a learning year then hopefully make it to the next year to go for the title.

I want to keep doing what I’m doing. I’ve been really lucky this year. I’ve had loads of opportunities in different championships and I want to keep building on that. I’d really like to go out to America and do some sportscar racing out there. We’ll see how the next few years go. Then we’ll see what seeds I can sow out in the US.

EB: Do you have any bucket list races you want to do above any others?

AE: I want to race at Bathurst in Australia. That’s on my bucket list. And that’s pretty much it. That’s what I want to do. Everything else I’ll take it or leave it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhc2tldGJhbGxuZXR3b3JrLm5ldC9vbGQtc2Nob29sL2hvdy13aWx0LWNoYW1iZXJsYWluLWhlbHBlZC1tYXJrLWVhdG9uLXN1Y2NlZWQtaW4tdGhlLW5iYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Wilt Chamberlain helped Mark Eaton succeed in the NBA,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.basketballnetwork.net/old-school/how-wilt-chamberlain-helped-mark-eaton-succeed-in-the-nba on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhc2tldGJhbGxuZXR3b3JrLm5ldC9vbGQtc2Nob29sL2hvdy13aWx0LWNoYW1iZXJsYWluLWhlbHBlZC1tYXJrLWVhdG9uLXN1Y2NlZWQtaW4tdGhlLW5iYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXRoZXJidWcuY29tL25ld3MvRnVubmVsLUNsb3VkLUZvcm1zLUFtaWQtVG9ybmFkby1XYXJuaW5nLWluLUVhdG9uLVLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video: Funnel Cloud Forms Amid Tornado Warning in Eaton Rapids Michigan,"For more than 20 years Earth Networks has operated the world’s largest and most comprehensive weather observation lightning detection and climate networks.

According to an article in Southern Living interest in vintage Polly Pocket products began to rise again in 2018 and one set actually sold for over $1400. Since then the prices settled back down but it appears that being shut in during the recent pandemic re-sparked interest in the item.

Take for instance this slumber party-themed Polly Pocket recently listed on eBay. What originally sold for a few dollars in the 1990s is now selling for almost $100.

Now as per recent reports some iOS apps are forcing users to allow tracking by disabling basic app functionalities.

For those unaware Apple added a nifty privacy-focused feature dubbed App Tracking Transparency with iOS 14 earlier this year. The said feature essentially allows users to block apps that track them across other third-party apps to deliver targeted ads.

As per reports more than 96% of users in the US now prohibit apps from tracking their digital activity across other apps and platforms. Due to this many app developers now cannot access the users’ Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) that lets them track users and deliver targeted ads based on their digital activities.

Now according to user feedback some iOS apps such as eBay and Microsoft Outlook are forcing users to allow tracking. These apps are reportedly rejecting third-party logins for users who did not allow tracking.

A screenshot of a pop-up message on iOS gives us a better idea of the enforcement. So as per a pop-up message seen in eBay the app will not allow users to log in with their Google accounts unless they enable app tracking. You can check out the screenshot right below.

If you are wondering who’s the culprit here eBay or Google? Well Rob Leathern the VP of Privacy product management at Google responded to Dieter’s tweet earlier today. He says that “Google Sign-In doesn’t collect data for any tracking/ advertising purposes” in a tweet. So yes eBay needs to figure out its strategy and not force users into letting the app track their digital activity.

Now after Apple released the App Tracking Transparency feature we have seen apps like Facebook and Instagram encourage users to allow tracking. However the said apps did not force the users to allow tracking by denying basic app functionalities like this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vY2hhbm5lbHgud29ybGQvMjAyMS8wNi9lYmF5LWNvbXBsZXRlcy10cmFuc2Zlci1vZi1lYmF5LWNsYXNzaWZpZWRzLXRvLWFkZXZpbnRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,eBay completes transfer of eBay Classifieds to Adevinta,"eBay have announced that it has completed the transfer of its eBay Classifieds business to Adevinta in exchange for $2.5 billion in cash and a 44% equity stake in Adevinta equivalent to approximately 540 million shares. This news comes just weeks after the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority approved Norway’s Adevinta acquisition of eBay Classifieds.

eBay had been trying to complete a $9.2B deal to sell the eBay Classifieds business to Adevinta but the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) got involved and didn’t like the potential reduction in competition for the UK market. According to The CMA the transaction between eBay and Adevinta could pose a risk to competition in the UK due to higher prices and less choice for consumers.

“We are pleased to finalize the deal between Adevinta and eBay Classifieds where the combination of these two companies will create a leading global online classifieds business. By joining Adevinta the eBay Classifieds’ business has an enormous opportunity ahead. We are optimistic that the breadth of talent and collective experience across the combined portfolio will offer additional value for our customers employees and shareholders.”

The completion of this transaction results in after tax net cash proceeds of approximately $2 billion. With this transfer complete the Company is updating its capital allocation plans for 2021 by increasing its estimated share buyback from $2.0 billion to $5.0 billion.

The Company has agreed to reduce its ownership stake in Adevinta to 33% or less over the next 18 months as part of remedies it proposed to resolve the competition concerns raised by the Austrian regulatory authorities.

E-mart offline stores projected to create synergy with eBay's open market platforms







By Kim Bo-eun







Shinsegae Group's ambitious acquisition of the local unit of eBay is set to produce a retail giant that will rival the existing top players. With its latest acquisition Shinsegae is set to jump into the competition between Naver and Coupang which has dominated the local e-commerce market.







Shinsegae's offline discount chain E-mart signed an agreement to purchase 80 percent of eBay Korea's shares for 3.44 trillion won ($3.04 billion). Despite the higher-than-expected acquisition cost Shinsegae is making a bold bet that the combination of its online and offline sales channels merging with eBay Korea's open market platforms will translate into bolstered competitiveness. Neither Naver nor Coupang have an offline sales channel.







The latest deal is also set to result in the consolidation of top players and widen the gap with smaller players in the market.







With the acquisition Shinsegae is expected to become the No. 2 player in the domestic e-commerce market after Naver. SSG.com Shinsegae's online commerce channel currently accounts for 3 percent of total e-commerce transactions while eBay Korea accounts for about 12 percent. The top players are Naver with an 18 percent share and Coupang with 13 percent.







Shinsegae's acquisition of eBay Korea will boost its market position to second place with a share around 17 percent. Annual transactions are expected to jump to a combined 24 trillion won; eBay Korea's annual transactions total 20 trillion won and SSG.com 4 trillion. That will seriously challenge Naver's annual transactions which total 28 trillion won according to market experts.







Naver is the dominant portal site through which most online shoppers search for items and serves as the platform that connects consumers with vendors on various open markets.







Naver and Coupang have different models. Naver's portal site acts as a broker between vendors and consumers while Coupang buys and ships most of its products directly.







Coupang is the strongest player when it comes to same-day and early-morning delivery services which has become a key driver of its success. Under same-day delivery items purchased in the morning are delivered by the evening of the same day.







E-mart also has strengths in is its online early-morning delivery service of groceries. But with the latest acquisition Shinsegae's core competitiveness will be the synergy created between its offline sales channels and e-commerce platform. Shinsegae has a competitive logistics system for fresh products ― E-mart has three state-of-the-art automated distribution centers and 160 offline stores. The group's offline channels also include a competitive department store. Shinsegae has pledged to scale up additional investments into its logistics system.







EBay Korea currently operates open market platforms Gmarket Auction and G9. The platforms connect online shoppers with vendors and eBay is not involved in direct purchases. EBay Korea will be able to share the valuable database of customers and vendors it has accumulated over the last 20 years operating here.







""What will be key is whether the company acquiring eBay Korea will be able to create actual synergy with a substantial strategy"" said Oh Lina an analyst at eBest Investment & Securities.







Naver to double as partner competitor

Shinsegae initially took part in the eBay Korea bid in a consortium with Naver with plans for the latter covering about 20 percent of the acquisition costs. But Naver pulled out later due to differences over the acquisition price and how it would contribute to the deal.







Still Shinsegae and Naver are set to continue working together based on their existing partnership. The two entities swapped 250 billion won in shares and have plans to work together in online and offline retail and sales.







Shinsegae's retail rival Lotte also took part in the deal but dropped its bid as it was not willing to pay as much for the deal. This casts uncertainties over Lotte's strategy for its online shopping channel as its e-commerce unit Lotte ON has been struggling.







EBay entered the local market in 2000. Last year eBay Korea generated 1.3 trillion won in annual sales and an operating profit of 85 billion won from commissions collected from items sold on its open market platforms. EBay Korea's performance has shown steady growth since 2015. Sales surpassed 1 trillion won for the first time in 2019 up 799.4 billion won compared to 2015.

In the three years since setting up its first manufacturing facility in Ireland Edwards Lifesciences has grown to employ 200 people in the Midwest.

The US-headquartered lifesciences company set up its first manufacturing base in Shannon in 2018 and has now completed construction on a new 190000 sq ft purpose-built manufacturing plant at the National Technology Park in Castleroy outside Limerick city.

Recruitment at the new facility is ongoing with plans to have 650 people employed on the site when it is fully operational.

“Our plans in Limerick are to grow quickly. We have 200 of our first 650 people hired with more being added every day” Nathan Tenzer plant general manager for Edwards Lifesciences in Ireland said.

“We have a variety of roles from product assembly inspection and warehouse operations to engineering supply chain and finance roles to support the plant.

“New cutting-edge technologies will continue to move into our brand new facility in Limerick and we hope to be making further announcements for growth in the future.”

Edwards Lifesciences is a global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease as well as critical care and surgical monitoring.

The company is headquartered in Irvine California with European headquarters in Nyon Switzerland.

“While we have had a sales office in Dublin for quite some time our manufacturing plants [in Ireland] are very new” Tenzer said.

“Edwards needed to expand its manufacturing facilities and very much wanted to base its newest investment in Europe our second largest market.

“The facility in Shannon was established from an existing structure in 2018 and the facility in Limerick was purpose-built with construction completed just March of this year.”

Both plants were involved in making the delivery systems used to repair and replace damaged heart valves Tenzer said.

“Once our validation and registrations are complete products built in our Limerick and Shannon facilities will be delivered to patients worldwide.”

For Edwards Lifesciences manufacturing in the Midwest offered easy access to Europe and the opportunity to move ahead with “vital expansion allowing global business continuity” Tenzer said.

The US company’s decision to set up a base in Ireland was also influenced by a number of other factors.

“First and foremost is the access to phenomenal people. Ireland is known for investing heavily in education” Tenzer said.

“It has a very strong base of people with medical device experience and it has an ease of working with corporations. It is stable politically and has very reliable infrastructure.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMjcveW91bmdlci1raWRzLXRvLXZheC1vci1ub3QtdG8tdmF4LXRoYXQtaXMtdGhlLXF1ZXN0aW9uL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMjcveW91bmdlci1raWRzLXRvLXZheC1vci1ub3QtdG8tdmF4LXRoYXQtaXMtdGhlLXF1ZXN0aW9uL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Younger kids: To vax or not to vax? That is the question,"Come fall parents of elementary schoolchildren will make a decision that’s weightier than which backpack to buy for the new school year:

Deputize Junior as a foot soldier in the war against COVID-19’s spread in the U.S. and get the child vaccinated? Or sit this one out with the knowledge that younger kids are far less likely to get severe illness than their grandparents?

As school bells ring in September data from clinical trials of the Pifzer vaccine on children ages 5 to 11 are expected to go to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization. Moderna’s trials in younger kids are not far behind.

But there are complexities to the vax-or-not equation for this age group that give even adults who eagerly rushed for the jabs some pause.

There are moral objections based on the global scarcity of vaccine.

There are risk objections based on extremely rare reactions seized upon by vaccine opponents.

“Parents who were all too happy to roll up their own sleeves for shots might not feel the same for their kids” said Richard Carpiano a public health scientist and medical sociologist at UC Riverside. “It might not be a one-to-one correlation.”

Indeed Suellen Hopfer assistant professor of public health at UC Irvine held focus groups with scores of Orange County families to understand their thinking on vaccinating children. Fewer than half — 45% — said they’d get their adolescent children vaccinated. Nearly as many — 43% — were unsure. And 11% said they definitely would not.

“The younger the children were the more hesitant the parents were to have them vaccinated” Hopfer said.

And this conundrum comes as a more contagious variant spreads and as children make up a much larger portion of reported cases than they did when the pandemic dawned.

What’s right?

The World Health Organization argues that vaccinating young healthy kids is not a priority because billions of the world’s most vulnerable people still don’t have access to vaccines.

“Though they can get infected with COVID-19 and they can transmit the infection to others they are at much lower risk of getting severe disease compared to older adults” said WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan.

“And that is why when we started prioritizing people who should get the vaccination when there are limited supplies … we recommend that we start with health care workers and frontline workers who are at very high risk of exposure to the infection” she said.

“Also elderly the people who have underlying illnesses that make them at high risk to develop severe disease. Protect them first because we want to reduce the death rates that we are seeing today globally and then gradually come down age-wise in the population until we get to children.”

Kids who have underlying conditions that make them more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 could be prioritized Swaminathan said. But vaccinating kids is not necessary for schools to safely reopen in the fall.

What’s safe?

On June 23 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that — after more than 177 million people have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — more than 1000 reports of heart inflammation after vaccines had been logged over the previous two months.

That’s a minuscule percentage — less than 0.001% — of those receiving shots.

“These reports are rare given the hundreds of millions of vaccine doses administered and have been reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination particularly in adolescents and young adults” the CDC said.

“CDC and its partners are actively monitoring these reports by reviewing data and medical records to learn more about what happened and to understand any relationship to COVID-19 vaccination. Most patients who received care responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.”

Confirmed cases have occurred mostly in male adolescents and young adults 16 or older more often after the second shot. Patients have resumed normal activities after their symptoms improved and the CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 12 years and older given the risk of COVID-19 illness and possibly severe complications.

Some doctors say healthy children should not be vaccinated because their risk of severe disease is so low and complications though rare are still not well understood.

Perhaps most prominent among them are two who’ve endured criticism for their thoughts on keeping the economy open while doubling-down on protections for higher-risk groups: Dr. Martin Kulldorff a biostatistician epidemiologist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya a professor of medicine at Stanford University.

“The idea that everyone must be vaccinated against COVID-19 is as misguided as the anti-vax idea that no one should” the two argue in a co-bylined piece for The Hill. “The former is more dangerous for public health.”

All medical interventions should provide more benefits than risks and that’s decidedly true for older people and COVID vaccines but not yet clear for younger people. Even a slight risk of a serious adverse reaction could tip the benefit-risk calculation in younger people making the vaccine more harmful than beneficial they argue.

Fear of winter outbreaks

Hopfer the UCI researcher is the mother of a 10-year-old with underlying health issues. Theirs is a multigenerational household with a resident grandmother. She has seen university students who contracted COVID-19 still using inhalers to walk up stairs six months after infection.

With everyone going back to classrooms in the fall she worries about winter outbreaks.

More than a year ago — on April 23 2020 — children represented just 2.6% of reported COVID-19 cases in the U.S. according to data compiled by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association.

On June 17 children represented 24.6% of U.S. cases.

Nationwide there have been more than 4 million cases logged among children more than 14% of total cases. And even with fewer states reporting case numbers among kids are creeping up from 14421 the week of June 10 to 15763 on June 17 the data says.

Experts say vaccinating children must be part of the overall attack plan because even if most kids don’t get terribly sick from the virus they can still pass it on to others who can get terribly sick — and they could be the incubators where the virus morphs into more lethal forms.

They’re waiting on clinical trial data for the elementary school set but the evidence is expected to come back strong on safety for this group just as it has for all the others.

“What we’re hearing — for all the vaccines in all the age groups — is that there are vanishingly small risks associated with vaccination. What we need is perspective” said Paula Cannon associate professor of microbiology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.

“What we do know for sure is that there is a very real and significant risk associated with COVID infection including in young children. They get severe symptoms at a much lower rate than adults but they still get them. Children under 12 die of COVID and can have long-term consequences” she said.

The official death tally is 335 in the U.S. but experts believe the true number is closer to 600. And with more infectious variants spreading there’s a very real risk that children will be more vulnerable than in the past.

“There’s a reason every other vaccine is given to children” Cannon said. “The risks associated with the vaccine are massively smaller than the known risks associated with COVID. Vaccinating our youngest children is part of the overall continuing effort to rid our communities of the consequences of COVID.”

Global concerns

The moral argument around global vaccine access is much more complicated than it sounds Cannon and Carpiano said.

An American parent turning down a vaccine for a 10-year-old in no way means a shot will be available to a senior citizen in Sudan. There are complex logistics at work from manufacturing to transportation freezing to storage staffing to supplies vital to getting shots into arms that underlie at least part of the global situation right now they said.

“We should all care about the people at high risk in other states and countries” Carpiano said. “But the fact is you’re not going to suddenly be able to send that shot you’re offered to India. It’s here. It has to get used. We can still have outbreaks here and with variants circulating there’s the potential for surge. If the vaccine is available get it.”

That’s the prevailing advice from medical professionals.

“If the vaccine is determined to be safe and effective for younger children we would encourage parents to vaccinate their children in the interest of safeguarding their health and the health of their loved ones” said Dr. William Towner director of clinical trials for Kaiser Permanente Southern California in a statement.

Hopfer’s research found that the children and parents who said yes to vaccination had trust in its development safety ingredients and efficacy. Those who were hesitant felt that their children were not at risk of infection or that the threat was manageable. A powerful motivator for all was the strong endorsement of their family doctors for vaccination.

She’s eagerly awaiting the data from the clinical trials on younger kids and plans to roll up her daughter’s sleeve if all goes as planned. “As more people are vaccinated the unvaccinated are really vulnerable” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzcG9zdC5pZS9jb21tZXJjaWFsLXJlcG9ydHMvbGltZXJpY2stdGhlLWlubm92YXRpb24tY2FwaXRhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Limerick: the innovation capital,"With a growing population world-class education top technologies and a major plan for the docklands the city is well on the way to achieving the goals of Limerick Twenty Thirty

Limerick is reinventing itself with key stakeholders working together to lay the foundation for growth; one that will position the city and county as the economic linchpin of the Midwest and a beacon for green and digital progress business innovation and world class education.

Already Limerick is home to some of the world’s leading companies among them Dell Johnson & Johnson Vision Care Edwards Lifesciences Analog Devices and General Motors.

Regeneron one of the biggest employers in the Midwest operates Ireland’s largest biotech facility just outside Limerick city.

Homegrown success stories meanwhile include Kneat – the validation software company founded in Limerick in 2006 and now listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange – AMCS the Castleroy-based recycling firm and Kirby Group the engineering firm with annual revenues of €360 million..

And with the population of Limerick city and suburbs expected to rise by up to 60 per cent over the next 15 years initiatives already under way are laying the foundations for crucial new infrastructure.

Five years on from its launch Limerick Twenty Thirty is gathering momentum with six landmark projects at various stages of development.

The first special purpose vehicle of its kind in the country the designated activity company (DAC) was established in 2016 by Limerick City and County Council to stimulate the local economy by driving commercial development on disused sites.

With a target to develop 1.4 million sq ft of prime real estate property Limerick Twenty Thirty has already let close to 500000 sq ft of property.

The €20 million Gardens International development opened on Henry Street in 2019 with 112000 sq ft of office space and capacity to accommodate a 500-strong workforce.

And work recently commenced on the €200 million development of the 3.7-acre Opera Site in Limerick city centre.

When complete the single biggest commercial property investment in Limerick’s history at the junction of Patrick Street Rutland Street and Bank Place is expected to transform the city centre.

The Opera Site will have capacity to employ up to 3000 people on a 550000 sq ft campus with a 14-storey tower block and mixed-use office retail and residential space centred around a 3000 square metre public plaza.

Troy Studios is also going from strength to strength. Opened in 2017 on the former Dell site at Castletroy Troy underwent further expansion in 2019 making it the largest film studio in Ireland.

Now with a capital portfolio of €1 billion Limerick Twenty Thirty is ‘realising its vision’ to transform the city and county and enable growth by encouraging future FDI investment David Conway its chief executive said.

Elsewhere Shannon Foynes Port Company is advancing plans laid out in its Docklands Framework to redevelop buildings and amenities on a 30-hectare site along the Dock Road.

The “non-core assets” presented an opportunity to reimagine the site as a new economic and employment hub close to the city centre Pat Keating chief executive of Shannon Foynes Port Company said.

A key element of this plan is the 36000 sq ft Bannatyne Mills building. “We have planning permission to convert that into potentially commercial office space” Keating said.

US company Nautilus Technologies is meanwhile developing a floating data centre off the docklands its first project in Europe.

The 10-megawatt data centre will float on a barge cooled by water funnelled from the Shannon. Once up and running it will provide a guide for Nautilus on building other floating data centres in Europe.

“The [docklands] project is moving Covid has definitely impacted on that but our ambitions as a company are full square on delivering the objectives of the framework strategy” Keating said.

And the county is leading in other ways too. This time last year University of Limerick appointed the first ever woman president of an Irish university.

Kerstin Mey took over in the role in June 2020 having joined UL two years prior as vice-president and professor of visual culture.

Since her appointment at the helm of one of Ireland’s leading universities UL has announced two new pioneering third level programmes in response to the fast-changing needs of the working world in Ireland and internationally.

The Immersive Software Engineering (ISE) programme at UL will launch in 2022 redefining computer science education in partnership with 40 leading technology companies among them Stripe Provizio Transact Campus Inc and Analog Devices.

In a departure from existing computer science programmes ISE students will take part in a series of paid residencies with participating companies and learn practical problem-solving skills working in project teams at a new purpose-built studio at UL.

U@Work another new industry-focused UL programme recently secured more than €16 million in Human Capital Initiative funding.

Developed by the university in partnership with employers in the Midwest and beyond its aim will be to “bring the worlds of education and work together” with a particular focus on emerging high-tech skills such as Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics and Cognitive Robotics.

The project would “build a flexible technology-enhanced learning platform that responds to digitisation and the future world of work” Mey said.

The existing world of work in Limerick has fared relatively well during the pandemic according to new research released last month by Ernst & Young.

The EY Economic Monitor for Limerick a biannual report commissioned by Limerick City and County found that 860 jobs had been created in Limerick in the first quarter of 2021 a more than two-fold increase on the same period last year.

The report also pointed to strong start-up activity with 194 new ventures emerging in the county in the first three months of the year.

For Limerick City and County Council chief executive Pat Daly environmental sustainability will be at the heart of the council’s strategy for the future.

The Draft Limerick Development Plan 2022-2028 sets out a blueprint for the development of Limerick as an environmentally sustainable and carbon neutral economy and a pioneer in sustainable growth.

This would be achieved through engagement innovation and resilient urban development Daly said positioning Limerick in the years ahead as a leading location for “sustainable living in an increasingly digital world.”

Already Limerick is one of just two EU Lighthouse Cities selected to take part in +CityxChange a climate change pilot programme which will lead the rest of Europe on how to reduce the carbon footprint of urban areas.

The county recently received a welcome boost with the announcement of €116 million in funding under the government’s Urban Regeneration and Development Fund.

URDF funding of €73.4 million will go towards the planned waterfront development including the regeneration of the area around the former Cleeves site in the city and the proposed pedestrian bridges and re-alignment of the road at Arthur’s Quay and Honan’s Quay.

A further €42.61 million will be allocated to the Living City initiative which aims to revitalise the city centre with a specific focus on underutilised Georgian buildings.

“Many transformational and innovative developments have been realised in recent years and Limerick is now recognised as a progressive attractive and inclusive city with a vision as a green city region leveraging the natural assets of the majestic Shannon and its estuary” Daly said.

“We are fast gaining a reputation as Ireland’s innovation capital and we have firm plans to keep this momentum going until 2030 and beyond.”",,,,,,

There’s been a sharp rise in cyberattacks in recent weeks often disrupting services and products that are essential to everyday lives.

In May the ransomware attack that forced a six-day shutdown of Colonial Pipeline — a key East Coast line that delivers gas to millions of people — brought the scary situation to the forefront of people’s minds. Days later food processor JBS USA also suffered a cyberattack which affected servers supporting its IT systems.

The uneasy trend continued in June with several high-profile companies like McDonald’s and Peloton revealing they too were targeted by hackers. These incidents highlight the growing need for cybersecurity professionals a space that’s facing a skills gap.

Here’s who announced this month that they got hacked:

Electronics Arts

Hackers broke into the systems of Electronic Arts one of the world’s biggest video game publishers and stole source code used in company games. The company made the announcement earlier this month.

Online forum posts reviewed by CNN Business and vetted by an independent cybersecurity expert show that on June 6 hackers claimed to have obtained 780 gigabytes of data from EA including source code for Frostbite the game engine that powers games that include titles in the FIFA Madden and Battlefield series.

Brett Callow a threat analyst at cybersecurity software maker Emsisoft said losing control over source code could be problematic for EA’s business.

“Source code could theoretically be copied by other developers or used to create hacks for games” Callow said.

An EA spokesperson said “no player data was accessed and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy. Following the incident we’ve already made security improvements and do not expect an impact on our games or our business.”

McDonald’s

McDonald’s said earlier this month it too was affected by a data breach which exposed private information of customers and employees in South Korea and Taiwan.

The burger chain said in a statement that an investigation revealed a “small number of files were accessed” some of which contained personal data like emails phone numbers and addresses. McDonald’s is contacting affected customers and regulators in the two areas and said that payment information wasn’t accessed.

“These tools allowed us to quickly identify and contain recent unauthorized activity on our network” a McDonald’s (MCD) spokesperson told CNN Business. “A thorough investigation was conducted and we worked with experienced third parties to support this investigation.”

Peloton

Earlier in June Peloton warned users of its Bike+ about a newly found security threat relating to the touchscreen. Researchers at cybersecurity company McAfee discovered a vulnerability that allows hackers to access Peloton’s bike screen and potentially spy on riders using its microphone and camera.

However the threat most likely affects only the $2495 bike used in public spaces such as hotels or gyms. That’s because a hacker needs to physically access the screen and plug in a USB drive containing malicious code. Researchers said hackers can then discreetly control the stationary bike’s screen remotely and interfere with its operating system.

Fortunately Peloton said it doesn’t know of any instances where this vulnerability was actually exploited and the company pushed a mandatory software update to users to patch the problem.

Volkswagen

Volkswagen and Audi revealed this month they were hit by a data breach that exposed the contact information of customers in the United States and Canada as well as personal details like drivers’ license numbers in some cases.

More than 3 million customers or shoppers had at least basic contact information stolen from an outside company that worked with the automakers according to VW. That data included phone numbers email addresses postal mailing addresses and in some cases vehicle identification numbers.

“We regret any inconvenience this may cause our current or potential customers” VW USA said in a statement. “As always we recommend that individuals remain alert for suspicious emails or other communications that might ask them to provide information about themselves or their vehicle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZGF2aWRob2NobWFuLzIwMjEvMDYvMjYvbGFzLWNvb2xlc3QtbmV3LXNob3BwaW5nLXNwb3QtaXMtaW4tcGxheWEtdmlzdGEtdGhhdHMtcmlnaHQtcGxheWEtdmlzdGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L.A.'s Coolest New Shopping Spot Is In Playa Vista,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhochman/2021/06/26/las-coolest-new-shopping-spot-is-in-playa-vista-thats-right-playa-vista/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZGF2aWRob2NobWFuLzIwMjEvMDYvMjYvbGFzLWNvb2xlc3QtbmV3LXNob3BwaW5nLXNwb3QtaXMtaW4tcGxheWEtdmlzdGEtdGhhdHMtcmlnaHQtcGxheWEtdmlzdGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2VhLXJlbW92aW5nLXVsdGltYS1zeW5kaWNhdGUtZ29nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA Removing Three Classic Games from GOG Storefront,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2VhLXJlbW92aW5nLXVsdGltYS1zeW5kaWNhdGUtZ29nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9hc3Nhc3NpbnMtY3JlZWQtdmFsaGFsbGEtZGlyZWN0b3ItZGVhZC1zcGFjZS1yZWJvb3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Assassin's Creed Valhalla Director Joins Motive The Studio Behind The Alleged Dead Space Reboot,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9hc3Nhc3NpbnMtY3JlZWQtdmFsaGFsbGEtZGlyZWN0b3ItZGVhZC1zcGFjZS1yZWJvb3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1YWxzaG9ja2Vycy5jb20vbWFkZGVuLTIxLXVwZGF0ZS0xLTI5LXBhdGNoLW5vdGVzLXRyYWluaW5nLXVwZ3JhZGUtZm9yLXBsYXllcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Madden 21 Update 1.29 Patch Notes - Training Upgrade for Players,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1YWxzaG9ja2Vycy5jb20vbWFkZGVuLTIxLXVwZGF0ZS0xLTI5LXBhdGNoLW5vdGVzLXRyYWluaW5nLXVwZ3JhZGUtZm9yLXBsYXllcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Detailed SURPASS-1 results were presented today in an oral presentation during the American Diabetes Association's ® (ADA) 81st Scientific Sessions® were simultaneously published in The Lancet and will be featured during an ADA -sponsored symposium on Tuesday June 29 .

Study participants in SURPASS-1 54.2 percent of whom were treatment-naïve had a relatively short mean duration of diabetes of 4.7 years a baseline A1C of 7.9 percent and a baseline weight of 85.9 kg. For the efficacy estimandi tirzepatide reduced A1C by up to 2.07 percent and body weight by up to 9.5 kg (20.9 lb. 11.0 percent) compared to placebo (+0.04 A1C change and body weight change of -0.7 kg [1.5 lb. 0.9 percent]). Up to 52 percent of participants achieved an A1C less than 5.7 percent – the level seen in people without diabetes. Tirzepatide also led to improvements in the change in fasting serum glucose from baseline. In an additional secondary endpoint tirzepatide led to improvements in the change in two-hour post-meal glucose values from baseline from self-monitored blood glucose data.12

The overall safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to the well-established glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class with gastrointestinal side effects being the most commonly reported adverse events. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were less than 7 percent in each tirzepatide treatment arm.1

""Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease and many people with the condition have trouble reaching their A1C goals through diet and exercise. This monotherapy clinical trial was designed to assess the impact of tirzepatide alone on several important diabetes treatment targets including glycemic control and weight loss"" said Julio Rosenstock  M.D. Director of the Dallas Diabetes Research Center at Medical City and Principal Investigator of SURPASS-1. ""In the SURPASS-1 results tirzepatide led to significant improvements across all primary and key secondary endpoints with clinically meaningful A1C reductions and robust weight loss among study participants who had a relatively short duration of type 2 diabetes.""

Tirzepatide is a novel investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist that integrates the actions of the GIP and GLP-1 incretins into a single molecule representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

For both estimandsii all three tirzepatide doses reached statistical significance in A1C and body weight reductions from baseline and in the percentage of participants who achieved an A1C of less than 7 percent (the American Diabetes Association's recommended target for people with diabetes) or less than 5.7 percent.1

At 40 weeks tirzepatide led to a significant decrease in fasting serum glucose (FSG) compared to placebo. In an additional secondary endpoint the mean two-hour post-meal glucose values for tirzepatide across all three doses were under 140 mg/dL (considered normal values in individuals without diabetes).2

Specifically the efficacy estimand results showed:

A1C change: -1.87% (5 mg) -1.89% (10 mg) -2.07% (15 mg) +0.04% (placebo)

Weight reduction: -7.0 kg (-7.9% 5 mg) -7.8 kg (-9.3% 10 mg) -9.5 kg (-11.0% 15 mg) -0.7 kg (-0.9% placebo)

Percent of participants achieving A1C <7%: 87% (5 mg) 92% (10 mg) 88% (15 mg) 20% (placebo)

Percent of participants achieving A1C <5.7%: 34% (5 mg) 31% (10 mg) 52% (15 mg) 1% (placebo)

Change in FSG: -43.6 mg/dL (5 mg) -45.9 mg/dL (10 mg) -49.3 mg/dL (15 mg) +12.9 mg/dL (placebo)

The treatment-regimen estimandiii results showed:

A1C reduction: -1.75% (5 mg) -1.71% (10 mg) -1.69% (15 mg) -0.09% (placebo)

Weight reduction: -6.3 kg (5 mg) -7.0 kg (10 mg) -7.8 kg (15 mg) -1.0 kg (placebo)

Percent of participants achieving A1C <7%: 82% (5 mg) 85% (10 mg) 78% (15 mg) 23% (placebo)

Percent of participants achieving A1C <5.7%: 31% (5 mg) 27% (10 mg) 38% (15 mg) 1% (placebo)

Change in FSG: -39.6 mg/dL (5 mg) -39.8 mg/dL (10 mg) -38.6 mg/dL (15 mg) +3.7 mg/dL (placebo)

No events of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia less than 54 mg/dL were observed in the tirzepatide treatment arms.12

In an additional exploratory endpoint all three doses of tirzepatide led to favorable changes from baseline in fasting lipids. Specifically at the highest dose of tirzepatide (15 mg): total cholesterol was reduced by 8.4 percent triglycerides were reduced by 21.0 percent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced by 12.4 percent very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol was reduced by 19.8 percent and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was increased by 7.5 percent.2

The most commonly reported adverse events for tirzepatide were gastrointestinal-related and mostly mild to moderate in severity usually occurring during the dose escalation period. For study participants treated with tirzepatide (5 mg 10 mg and 15 mg respectively) nausea (11.6 percent 13.2 percent 18.2 percent respectively) diarrhea (11.6 percent 14.0 percent 11.6 percent respectively) vomiting (3.3 percent 2.5 percent 5.8 percent respectively) and constipation (5.8 percent 5.0 percent 6.6 percent respectively) were more frequently experienced compared to placebo (6.1 percent [nausea] 7.8 percent [diarrhea] 1.7 percent [vomiting] 0.9 percent [constipation]). The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.1 percent (tirzepatide 5 mg) 9.9 percent (tirzepatide 10 mg) and 21.5 percent (tirzepatide 15 mg) compared to 14.8 percent (placebo). The majority of the discontinuations in the 15 mg and placebo arms were due to reasons other than adverse events (such as concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic and family or work reasons).2

SURPASS-1 is the first of five global registration studies for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes all of which have been completed. Lilly intends to submit the full registration package to regulatory authorities by the end of 2021.

About tirzepatide

Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. GIP is a hormone that may complement the effects of GLP-1. In preclinical models GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase 3 development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes and for chronic weight management. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

About SURPASS-1 and the SURPASS clinical trial program

SURPASS-1 (NCT03954834) is a 40-week multi-center randomized double-blind parallel placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 5 mg 10 mg and 15 mg as monotherapy to placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone. The trial randomized 478 study participants across the U.S.  Mexico  India and Japan in 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either tirzepatide 5 mg 10 mg or 15 mg or placebo. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that tirzepatide (5 mg 10 mg or 15 mg) is superior in A1C reduction from baseline after 40 weeks in people with type 2 diabetes naïve to injectable therapy who haven't used any oral antidiabetic medicines within three months compared to placebo. Study participants had a mean A1C between 7 percent and 9.5 percent and a BMI greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2. All participants in the tirzepatide treatment arms started the study at a dose of tirzepatide 2.5 mg once-weekly and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 5 mg (via a 2.5 mg step) 10 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg 5 mg and 7.5 mg) or 15 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg 5 mg 7.5 mg 10 mg and 12.5 mg).

The SURPASS phase 3 global clinical development program for tirzepatide has enrolled more than 19000 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials five of which are global registration studies. The program began in late 2018 and all five global registration trials have been completed.

It is considered one of the oldest pharmaceutical chemical sites in the world.

Today Villeneuve is making the main ingredient in one of the world’s newest drugs: Mithra Pharmaceuticals’ oral contraceptive Estelle approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on April 15 and now marketed by Mayne Pharma. The ingredient is estetrol a natural estrogen touted as having a better side-effect profile than the estrogen in most contraceptives. Synthesizing it for use in a drug though is no easy task.

Like the site where estetrol is being made the story behind the new drug is many years old. Estetrol was first identified in 1965 by Egon Diczfalusy a reproductive endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute. But Diczfalusy didn’t pursue its potential as a contraceptive says Jean-Manuel Fontaine Mithra’s vice president of external and scientific affairs. “It was kind of shelved for 40 years” Fontaine says.

Estelle at a glance ▸ Active ingredient: Estetrol ▸ Discovered: 1965 by Egon Diczfalusy; conceived as a therapeutic around 2000 by Herjan Coelingh Bennink ▸ Indication: Pregnancy prevention ▸ Innovation: An estrogen with fewer side effects than current products ▸ Status: US Food and Drug Administration approval in April 2021

Estetrol also known as E4 was revived around the year 2000 by Herjan Coelingh Bennink an executive at the contraceptive maker Organon. “He was convinced that E4 would be a fantastic estrogen to explore as a therapeutic agent” Fontaine says.

Bennink was struck by the high concentration of E4 in fetal blood at 9 weeks of pregnancy. “If at the ninth week of gestation you have such high concentrations at such a delicate moment of life it’s got to be safe” was Bennink’s reasoning Fontaine says.

The leading oral contraceptives today are based on ethinyl estradiol a synthetic derivative of another estrogen estradiol. Like Estelle many also include the progestin drospirenone. Current products are effective at preventing pregnancy but they carry the risk of liver damage and blood clots and are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Moreover ethinyl estradiol is considered an endocrine-disrupting chemical that after people excrete it can build up in creatures living in rivers and oceans. Mithra says estetrol doesn’t accumulate in living organisms.

Bennink left Organon soon thereafter to form his own company Pantarhei Bioscience which launched studies on estetrol in women’s health and oncology applications. In 2009 the company formed a contraceptive-focused joint venture with Mithra; by 2015 Mithra had acquired full rights to estetrol for contraceptive and menopausal uses. Pantarhei continues to develop the molecule for oncology and veterinary use.

Mithra had picked Cambridge Major Laboratories’ ChemShop unit in Weert the Netherlands to manufacture estetrol in the early days of development. Output was enough for preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials but yields were low. “There was a need to find a different provider to get a better yield” Fontaine says. Mithra focused its hunt for another supplier on western Europe to ensure intellectual property protection and rapid response.

Meanwhile executives at Seqens had their eyes on estetrol. A drug services and specialty ingredient firm based in France Seqens operates 24 plants and seven R&D centers across Europe North America and Asia. Its pharmaceutical synthesis business includes facilities acquired from several long-standing players in the business including PCAS and Uetikon in Europe and PCI Synthesis in the US.

Philippe Clavel Seqens’s vice president for pharmaceuticals says his team saw estetrol as a good fit. The company had experience making another hormone at its site in Aramon France and the Villeneuve facility likewise had the equipment and health safeguards needed to produce a compound considered highly potent. Mithra apparently agreed. It chose Seqens out of the 10 contract manufacturers it was considering and in 2012 the two firms signed an agreement covering production of estetrol for clinical trials.

Estetrol is not an easy molecule to manufacture according to Fontaine and Clavel. Development of the industrial-scale process now being carried out in Villeneuve took about 4 years mostly at Seqens’s R&D center in Porcheville France Clavel says.

A production campaign which takes several months starts with a phytosterol extracted from soybeans. Getting to estetrol requires eight synthetic steps plus associated purifications. Multiple protection and deprotection steps are needed Clavel says as are tricky oxygenation reactions. All the while both the stereochemistry and the molecule’s four hydroxyl groups must be maintained.

Seqens first established production at an existing unit in Villeneuve that it modified for the purpose. But as the contraceptive cleared hurdles in clinical trials and regulatory approval looked more and more likely Clavel and his team took stock. Estelle could eventually require multiple metric tons per year of estetrol more than the modified facility could make. They realized they would have to step up to keep Mithra as a customer.

So Seqens decided to spend roughly $35 million on a brand-new facility in Villeneuve dedicated to estetrol production. The firm began construction in the second half of 2018 and completed it in mid-2020. Last August the president of France Emmanuel Macron visited Villeneuve for the new facility’s inauguration. Seqens is validating the facility now Clavel says in anticipation of beginning commercial production later this year.

Clavel says Macron’s visit demonstrates the French government’s understanding that more and more pharmaceuticals are considered highly potent and that the ability to make them is key to keeping drug production alive in the country. “France has very few manufacturing facilities of this type” Clavel says. “What is at stake is France’s and Europe’s sovereignty in manufacturing highly active APIs.”

There was a need to find a different provider to get a better yield. Jean-Manuel Fontaine vice president of external and scientific affairs Mithra Pharmaceuticals

Both Clavel and Fontaine say the new facility in Villeneuve may not be enough if Estelle and estetrol live up to their potential. In addition to the US Estelle has been approved in the European Union and Canada. KBC Securities an investment firm that covers Mithra says Estelle could bring in nearly $1.2 billion in sales by 2031 capturing 8% of the global oral contraceptive market.

And Mithra sees potential for estetrol in other applications as well. “Next is menopause where a safer estrogen is even more important” Fontaine says. The company is conducting clinical trials of an estetrol-based product for relieving menopause symptoms and plans a product for perimenopause also known as menopause transition.Beyond reproductive health Mithra is researching the use of estetrol in wound healing and reducing neonatal encephalopathy. And it is even conducting clinical trials of estetrol to help hospitalized patients with COVID-19 recover.

Anticipating continued growth in demand for estetrol Mithra is studying the best way to make it. “We have a whole department dedicated to the synthesis of E4” Fontaine says. Among the scientists’ goals are production routes with fewer steps and syntheses that incorporate both chemical and biotechnological transformations.

Fontaine also wants to diversify Mithra’s supply of estetrol beyond the Villeneuve complex. Seqens and Mithra are already discussing the idea of establishing Seqens’s Aramon site as a backup Clavel says and Seqens is prepared to build another dedicated facility that would be ready by 2027 or 2028.

Fontaine says Mithra is looking at a range of companies for its future manufacturing needs but he says he’s committed to his relationship with Seqens. “It’s an important contract for them and for us” Fontaine says. “We’re going to be working together for many years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL2FkYS0yMDIxLW5vdm8tdHJ1bXBldHMtZGF0YS1oaWdoZXItZG9zZS1vemVtcGljLWFzLWxpbGx5LWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWxvb23SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ADA 2021: Novo trumpets higher-dose Ozempic data as Lilly competitors loom,"Novo Nordisk's semaglutide franchise has taken off in a big way. Type 2 diabetes med Ozempic smashed the blockbuster barrier in 2019 the same year the company launched its oral option Rybelsus. Now the Danish diabetes major is touting data on a higher-dose prospect.

In a late-stage trial Ozempic 2 mg trumped its 1-mg predecessor on blood sugar reduction—and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The higher dose also helped patients lose more weight when taken as directed and importantly showed side effects on par with Ozempic 1 mg—something analysts have flagged as a potential drawback to higher GLP-1 doses. All in all the data bode well for Ozempic 2 mg’s application at the FDA which Novo resubmitted in May.

Ozempic also known as semaglutide already comes in 0.5-mg and 1-mg doses injected weekly. Novo also markets an oral counterpart Rybelsus which is on the ascent after some early pandemic turbulence. As for where Ozempic 2 mg fits into the equation “it goes back to the right medication for the right patient” said Michael Radin M.D. executive director of the diabetes cardio renal medical director team in medical affairs at Novo Nordisk.

“It gives patients who are already on say the 1-mg dose of Ozempic who maybe still need a little bit of additional glycemic control an opportunity to get there” he said in an interview.

Patients entered the phase 3b Sustain Forte trial presented at the American Diabetes Association’s 2021 virtual scientific sessions with baseline A1C levels of 8.9%. A1C is a commonly used metric for blood sugar and the American Diabetes Association says most adults with diabetes should have an A1C level below 7%.

In the 961-patient study higher-dose Ozempic patients saw A1C reduction of 2.2% after 40 weeks of treatment versus a 1.9% reduction in the 1 mg Ozempic arm.

Meanwhile subgroup analyses after the study wrapped showed that Ozempic 2 mg topped the lower dose in patients across a range of baseline blood sugar levels. Patients who came into the study with a mean A1C of less than 9% saw a 1.9% reduction on the higher dose compared to a 1.7% reduction in the 1-mg arm. And patients with baseline A1C of at least 9% saw reductions of 2.6% versus 2.3% among patients on the lower dose.

Weight loss favored the higher dose as well. Working off an average baseline body weight of 99.3 kg (218.9 lb) Ozempic 2 mg helped patients lose 6.9 kg (15.2 lb)—statistically significant compared with the 6 kg (13.2 lb) lost by patients on the lower dose provided they took the drug as directed.

The study compared 1- and 2-mg Ozempic as an add-on to metformin with or without sulfa drugs. The primary results are set for publication in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.

“Those better efficacy results did not come at a cost of greater adverse events” Radin pointed out.

Side effect rates were similar across both doses with the most common being GI-related such as nausea diarrhea and vomiting. That should play in higher-dose Ozempic’s favor; if it's approved the 2-mg dose will come up against Lilly’s GLP-1 rival Trulicity and potentially its dual-action contender tirzepatide.

Lilly recently posted Ozempic-topping data in a head-to-head with its dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide which bested Novo’s drug at all three doses tested. The trial pitted 5- 10- and 15-mg tirzepatide against Ozempic 1 mg but not the 2 mg dose that’s now at the FDA’s desk. While the difference wasn’t “jaw-dropping” 5 mg tirzepatide sets “a bit better efficacy/side-effect benefit” than the lower Ozempic dose Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal wrote in a note to clients in March.

At the time Gal pegged 1-mg Ozempic and 5-mg tirzepatide as the “workhorse” doses of the drugs predicting most patients would stick to the lower doses because of increased side effects on the stronger regimens.

In another set of phase 3 trials for tirzepatide dubbed SURPASS-3 and SURPASS-5 the drug drove down blood sugar levels and body weight at all three strengths but side effects like nausea were more pronounced on the stronger doses Gal noted at the time adding that patients’ failure to stick to their treatments is a major problem in diabetes care.

In SUSTAIN FORTE rates of nausea which Radin flagged as one of the biggest side effect burdens for patients on these drugs were below 15% for both Ozempic doses tested. The percentage of patients who had to stop treatment because of GI side effects was around 3% in each group he said.

For its part Novo doesn’t seem too concerned about Lilly’s dual-action prospect. “We welcome that there’s more options out there to treat patients” Radin said. The company’s semaglutide franchise has plenty to offer he added.

“With now multiple doses of Ozempic to choose from [and] with Rybelsus on the market it really gives the opportunity to individualize care for patients so that the right patient gets the right medication the right dose the right formulation” he said.

The other ace up Ozempic’s sleeve is its approval to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes patients with an established heart condition he said. Lilly hopes to earn that distinction for tirzepatide with its phase 3 SURPASS-CVOT trial. The study is comparing the drug to Trulicity which also boasts an FDA approval to improve CV outcomes.

Thanks to a suite of impressive data over the past few years diabetes care has “changed so much” Radin said. Up until meds like Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance and Novo’s Ozempic predecessor Victoza hit the scene diabetes drugs were approved based on their ability to lower A1C he said. That’s still “extremely important” but now there’s a wealth of outcomes trials that show therapies can improve glycemic control help patients lose weight and fend off cardiovascular episodes like heart attacks and strokes.

Now that the bar has been “set higher” to hear Radin tell it “It’s not good enough to just lower A1C. What can you do for the patient in terms of the hard outcomes that cause morbidity and mortality in them?”

Eighty-five percent of Type 2 diabetes patients also struggle with their weight and cardiovascular death remains the leading cause of mortality for those same patients he said making those weight-loss and CV benefits all the more vital."
EMR,Emerson Electric,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZ2l6bW9kby5jb20uYXUvMjAyMS8wNi9ldmlscy1taWNoYWVsLWVtZXJzb24tc2hhcmVzLXdoYXQtaXRzLWxpa2UtdG8tcGxheS1hLWd1eS1tb3JlLXNpbmlzdGVyLXRoYW4tc2F0YW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evil's Michael Emerson Shares What It's Like to Play a Guy More Sinister Than Satan,"Evil is back and its most memorable character Leland Townsend is already causing mischief for its trio of Catholic Church-sponsored supernatural investigators. To learn more about what’s to come we hopped on the phone with the actor who brings him to life: Michael Emerson whose past credits include Lost and the late great Person of Interest.

It’ll be hard for Leland to top all the malevolent hijinks he got up to in season one (getting a serial killer freed from prison seducing the mother of one of his enemies encouraging a budding “incel” to plan a mass shooting) but the show is called Evil — and there’s no telling exactly how low Leland will go. “People have cause to fear him. And that probably does his heart good” Emerson told Gizmodo. “He probably wakes up happy every morning.” Shivers. Read on for our interview…

Cheryl Eddy Gizmodo: Evil is a show about the actual devil with characters that are literal demons and yet Leland Townsend is absolutely the most sinister character on the show. What’s it like getting to play someone like that?

Michael Emerson: It’s great fun! He’s a mystery to me certainly. We’re not sure what his motives are or what the long-term plan is — other than sort of devilment and creating as much mayhem as he can getting in the way of David’s [Mike Colter] holy orders. That seems to be kind of it. But then he seems to be a fairly high office-holder in a sort of underground world of you know secret rituals and mischief. He seems to rather relish the stuff he does! He seems to take some pleasure in it and he’s funny upon occasion.

Gizmodo: I was actually going to ask you about that because even though he is definitely a bad guy Leland often functions as Evil’s comic relief too. What’s it like bringing that element into a show that tends to be more serious?

Emerson: I think there’s a fair amount of wit in the show all around but I’m fortunate that I have more opportunities to display it. I guess if you’re a force of misrule then making fun or mockery or blasphemy in this case those are all just pleasurable tools for his work. Whatever it is in his childhood or his youth that has driven him to this place he must have a sense of power and vengeance all of that’s so good because now he can do things that other people can’t and people have cause to fear him. And that probably does his heart good. He probably wakes up happy every morning [laughs].

Gizmodo: What attracted you to the role of Leland and how much did you personally bring into shaping his character?

Emerson: I just play what’s written on the page. I mean I guess there’s some interpretation involved but I just try to let what’s written for me be the sort of parameters or the blueprint for the role. And then the rest is just me getting down inside it and playing around with it really. I don’t want to say that it’s not hard work but it’s more fun than a lot of acting jobs are because the language is good and they write him with a nice turn of phrase here and there. He’s droll. He’d be pretty good company if he wasn’t so deadly dangerous.

Gizmodo: Did you base your portrayal on anyone fictional or real?

Emerson: Maybe I have seen people in my life who were bad actors but did it in a charming way — I might have sort of filed that away somewhere. But I think my experience of playing villains whether it’s on the stage or before the camera you can’t do a lot of mustache-twirling. You have to play the opposite. You have to find what keeps them going and what keeps them effective. And also you have some obligation to be entertaining [laughs]. So I try to live up to those possibly self-imposed standards.

Gizmodo: Most of the time you can assume that the villain of a story doesn’t think she or he is a villain; they believe they’re in the right even if it’s in opposition to the other characters. But do you think in this case of Evil Leland knows he’s the bad guy?

Emerson: Yeah unlike most of the bad guys I’ve played or the men of questionable ethics I think Leland gets that he’s a bad actor that he’s a really bad one and he doesn’t care. And that’s kind of good and freeing for me as an actor in the role — it releases me from grey-er considerations of morals ethics behaviours. He can just play sort of. Play with it.

Gizmodo: Viewers don’t know yet what Leland will get up to in season two but I thought season one’s terrifying “incel” episode was his best worst moment so far. Would you agree?

Emerson: To me that was the scariest episode because it was plausible. Because there are vulnerable people out there who could be persuaded by someone like Leland to do something terrible. It scared me. It worried me to work that number on a vulnerable soul. That one I thought “Wow! I hope somebody doesn’t punch me out on the street after confusing me with this character I play!”

Gizmodo: Has that ever happened maybe not getting punched out but someone confusing you with one of your characters?

Emerson: For some people the line gets a little bit blurred sometimes. You know I’ve played characters that make people nervous. I’ve had people scream and run away from me. That kind of thing. Which is flattering in a way — it’s also kind of silly. But it’s a testament to how much they’ve immersed themselves in the story how much they have suspended their disbelief.

Gizmodo: We’ve learned a little bit about Leland’s background — his real name where he grew up etc. Will we be learning any more this season?

Emerson: Not that much I would say. We’re not gonna go back in time and meet Leland at another stage of his life or anything like that. We’ll get little bits and pieces but I think everything [show creators Michelle and Robert King] want you to know you pretty much already know. It’s not going to be a character like I played on Lost whereas we go back and learn about Ben Linus’ childhood or something [and] it mitigates our feeling about him the character. I think Leland is going to remain a bit of a mystery and a really bad guy — if a somewhat entertaining one.

Gizmodo: Since we won’t be looking back into his past will we see Leland evolve as season two progresses? Will viewers’ opinions of him change by the end of the season?

Emerson: Yeah! Because a lot of the power dynamics certain relationships where we thought he was in control or in charge some of that stuff’s going to get turned on its head. We will definitely see Leland in surprisingly vulnerable situations. We won’t feel much pity for him because they’re situations he’s brought on himself but still he gets into some trouble. [Laughs]

Gizmodo: Leland’s relationship with Kristen (Katja Herbers) is probably Evil’s most contentious especially now that he’s planning to marry Kristen’s mother (Christine Lahti). What’s it like playing those scenes with them?

Emerson: A couple of real pros you know? We have a lot of fun me and Katja and Christine and I. It’s a tribute to the writing we go in and if we just say the lines on the page the scenes will crackle. And Katja’s character Kristen has turned out to be quite an able adversary for Leland. The more she stops playing by self-imposed rules the more trouble she can be for Leland I think.

Gizmodo: Is that something we’re going to be seeing more of this season?

Emerson: Yeah I think so because one of the things we explore in season two is: where is Kristen on the scale of good and bad? What are her real ethics values? What are the things she won’t do? Are there any? [Laughs]

Gizmodo: I was going to ask something similar about Leland. Is there a line that even he won’t cross? Is there any soul left in that guy?

Emerson: I think there are probably some things that even he would quail at. Not sure I could name one yet but I suppose it’s possible to contemplate such a thing. But he is rather immune to the normal shocks and horrors that afflict feeling humans. [Laughs] I mean I guess he’s a human but of a different sort.

Gizmodo: A recurring theme on Evil is scepticism. Leland however seems to fully exist in a world where the supernatural is real. What’s that like for him and what’s it like playing a character like that?

Emerson: It gives the character and me the actor the freedom to just say audacious things. Bold pronouncements sometimes cutting observations that are painfully true. You know he believes that he has found humanity’s number. He’s got their number! And they’re frail weak contradictory hypocritical — he at least says just what he means. So in a way I think he considers himself as occupying a higher ground.

Gizmodo: You’ve touched on this a bit but in your career we’ve seen you play some very dark parts — an antagonist on Lost a serial killer on The Practice a monster-of-the-week on that X-Files episode about the Brady Bunch house. You’ve even voiced the Joker. For you personally what’s the appeal in these sorts of roles?

Emerson: I’m attracted to the stuff that’s well-written or funny or poetical. And I guess most of the stuff I really respond to is characters who are ambiguous and mysterious and possibly dangerous but also — again characters that have a wit about them. I don’t know if it’s me seeking out the villain roles or if it’s just the scripts that come my way or if it’s the stuff I’m right for. You know I’m never gonna play the hero in a Western movie or anything like that. There are certain things I’m right for. Having a particular kind of voice and speaking in a particular kind of way that I’m not even always completely aware of I think it alarms people. There’s that vein of instinct in the American society that distrusts people who are verbal people who talk too much or talk too well. You know we pride ourselves on being do-ers and not talkers. Walk the walk don’t talk the talk all of that kind of thing. We really cling to those ideas. And so I think for me these kind of ambiguous or sinister roles are a good fit. They’re kind of natural for me. If the camera’s up close to me and I talk a certain way deliver the lines a certain way I think it could be chilling. [Laughs] I think by the same token something in my intonation or delivery disqualifies me in a way from playing a normal good guy. I’ve played good guys but they’re usually odd. So I think it’s more a quality of oddness or grotesquerie that ends up being the right fit for me.

Gizmodo: The last shot of the season two premiere where Leland just laughs at the camera was very unsettling.

Emerson: Oh yeah and they made it look like it was an electronic glitch in the surveillance system! A glitch that reveals some deeper truth about Leland: that maybe on some level that is not visible from the surface he is more monstrous than we think.

Gizmodo: Hopefully we’ll be getting to see more of that in season two! Anything else you can tease about what’s coming up?

Emerson: Oh yes stay tuned. There’s going to be some wild stuff! There’s a lot to do with turning Catholic sacraments on their head in this season. And there’s a lot to do with blood. [Laughs]",,,,,,,,,,,,

This ratchets up 10 per cent if your income hits $136740. While you used to be able to escape repayments in periods where you were living overseas worldwide income now counts and the same loan contributions are required. Still a HELP debt is the cheapest you can get as there is no interest charged. It grows only at the rate of inflation which today is exceptionally low at just 1.1 per cent in the year to March. Crucially there is no time limit to repay your debt. However what does a lingering HELP debt mean for the rest of your financial life?

Ability to get a home loan Firstly your credit score is unaffected. Credit bureau Equifax confirmed this is because the debt stays relatively low and repayments vary with your income – and cease if you lose your job. However an Equifax spokesperson said: “A HELP debt can have an impact on borrowing power as it effectively reduces income.” When banks assess an application for a loan they look at income expenses and any liabilities. A HELP debt is classified as a liability that could at some stage require repayments which will reduce your capacity to service a home loan. “Each lender has their own lending criteria and the assessment of HELP debt as part of a loan application may differ between lenders” the spokesperson said.

A HELP debt must be factored into your expectations of how much you might be able to borrow for your first home said Mozo spokesperson Tom Godfrey. “HELP debt tends to be viewed in much the same way as the money you owe on a credit card or personal loan so it could have a major impact” he said. And the size of the debt is also significant in choosing the right course to study. The federal government announced a dramatic overhaul of degree pricing last year to encourage more students into what education Minister Dan Tehan called “jobs for the future”. The cost of agricultural and maths degrees has decreased 62 per cent psychology English language teaching and nursing degrees are lower by 46 per cent and health science IT and engineering degrees are 20 per cent cheaper.

Fees are down to between $3700 and $7700 a year with existing as well as new students getting these discounts. Meanwhile law and commerce degrees are up 28 per cent and humanities degrees by a huge 113 per cent. This will put all three degrees at a similar average cost of $14500 a year but only new students will wear the price hike. Demand for university places has also soared with an estimated 20000 extra Year 12 graduates who are unable to travel overseas for a gap year because of the coronavirus pandemic and many people who have lost jobs choosing to undertake higher education. The Federal Department of Education Skills and Employment says that preliminary data suggest undergraduate enrolments are up by 5.1 per cent this year and commencements by 7.3 per cent. So how much HELP are Aussies receiving?

In 2019-2020 the latest year for which figures are available the number of people with outstanding HELP debts was 2.9 million. That represents an 87 per cent increase on 10 years ago. The average time taken to repay student loans is the longest ever at 9.3 years with an average of 5.5 years before wages hit a threshold sufficient for compulsory repayments to start. How can students best make HELP pay? The rationale behind the government’s fee tweak is to get Australians using HELP for courses that will pay off on the long run… and therefore pay back. While the employment success rate after undertaking vocational training is at 78 per cent post university it is just 72.2 per cent.",,,,,,,,,,,,

First her father died. Then she learned that she and her adult siblings would not inherit the one-family home they shared because unbeknownst to them their dad had taken out a reverse mortgage.

“We needed to pay more than $300000 to the mortgage company before the house could become ours” Clay told Truthout. “And we couldn’t.”

Tensions ran high she says and the family scattered. For Clay this meant moving from couch-to-couch while she looked for an affordable apartment.

It felt impossible she says. Months passed. Eventually a friend told her about Breaking Ground a nonprofit agency that owns 24 residential buildings throughout New York City. She applied for a subsidized apartment was accepted and now lives in The Schermerhorn a 217-unit supportive housing complex in downtown Brooklyn. Her rent? $663 a month. “I have a studio” she says. “I wish I had an oven but since I have a microwave and a stove top I have what I need.”

This was especially important she continues during the worst months of the COVID-19 pandemic. “In addition to being in a comfortable space I was able to do my data entry job thanks to the building’s Wi-Fi connection so I didn’t get laid off” she says. And although she has never utilized the social and recreational services that the building offers — among them virtual and in-person case management counseling and group activities — she is endlessly grateful to be safely and affordably housed.

Her neighbor 53-year-old Rodney King feels similarly. King has been in The Schermerhorn since 2015. “I started sleeping in the street in 2007” he says. “I was in a park when Breaking Ground came through and the worker asked me if I needed shelter. They gave me a place for 30 days and then moved me into this building. I pay $256 a month and have my own room in an apartment I share with three other men. If I’d been on the street during COVID I don’t know what would have happened to me.”

Creating Permanent Supportive Housing

Breaking Ground has been providing permanent supportive housing to unhoused New Yorkers since 1990. In addition to The Schermerhorn and 22 other buildings the organization runs the largest supportive housing community in the U.S.: 652 units in Manhattan’s Times Square. All told they manage 4000 units of low-cost housing; 750 more are currently in the development pipeline.

Housing activists and progressive lawmakers are pushing for the creation of new single-room occupancy units or the renovation of existing properties so that people can move into permanent affordable homes.

Not surprisingly Breaking Ground is a model for groups throughout the country and staff frequently consult with organizations that are considering starting their own supportive housing programs. Demand is enormous due in part to large-scale coronavirus outbreaks that rocked overcrowded congregate shelters in the spring of 2020 and sent localities throughout the country scrambling to find vacant rooms so that shelter residents could be relocated.

This was meant to be a short-term stop-gap measure — with unhoused people returning to congregate shelters as soon as the pandemic was over. But housing activists and progressive lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of new single-room occupancy units or the renovation of existing properties so that people can move into permanent affordable homes rather than return to temporary shelters or the streets.

“Right now we’re looking at a few distressed hotels in New York City and are in negotiations with a hotel owner in the midtown theater district to buy hundreds of units” Breaking Ground CEO Brenda Rosen told Truthout. A combination of city and state grants private philanthropy and low-interest loans will finance the project. The result will be 500 units of permanent and 140 units of transitional housing. All will be covered by the state’s rent stabilization law which controls allowable rent hikes and protects renters from arbitrary evictions.

“Breaking Ground has a long history of repurposing beautiful old hotels” Rosen says. “We can do a complete rehab in about 12 months as opposed to 24 months on new construction.” In addition she continues renovating an existing structure costs far less than starting from scratch.

But financing and renovating are just two components of creating successful supportive housing and Breaking Ground’s staff of 600 also works to keep the properties in good repair. What’s more the social service staff provides case management on-site counseling and organizes recreational activities for residents who want them; staff also contracts with an outside medical group for on-site and tele-med health care.

But if it sounds straightforward and easy Rosen makes clear that there are constant challenges. “Some of the people who live in our buildings have been on the streets for a long time” Rosen explains. “Some have severe mental health issues or substance use disorders but we are a Housing First organization” and offer people a place to stay without conditions regarding sobriety or drug use. This Rosen says often results in residents voluntarily reducing their reliance on alcohol or drugs but some never stop using.

“The secret to supportive housing” Rosen continues “is the ability to be agile. We ask people about their personal goals and then see what we can do to help them get there.”

Benefits of Supportive Housing

The benefits of the Housing First model are well documented.

When chronically homeless people are given permanent supportive housing they have fewer emergency room visits fewer hospital stays and utilize primary care and counseling services more readily.

In fact a recent study conducted by the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation released in December 2020 affirms that when chronically homeless people are given permanent supportive housing they have fewer emergency room visits fewer hospital stays and utilize primary care and counseling services more readily.

This result — and the money it saves — prompted New York lawmakers to pass the Housing Our Neighbors with Dignity Act (HONDA) in early June; it allocates $100 million to purchase vacant properties and convert them into permanently affordable single-room occupancy units. Half of the units will be reserved for people who have experienced homelessness and half will be reserved for those whose incomes are below 80 percent of area median income.

“One hundred million is a start but it is by no means enough” New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) the bill’s sponsor said in a press conference after passage of the legislation.

Nonetheless Cea Weaver coordinator of Housing Justice for All New York a statewide coalition of housing and tenant groups sees this as a good entry point a down payment on what’s necessary and says that she considers passage of HONDA a victory. At the same time she cautions that it will not be a quick fix for the shortage of affordable housing. “We’ll first have to identify buildings for conversion then these buildings will have to be sold to a nonprofit housing provider and then they’ll have to be renovated” Weaver says. “This won’t happen overnight. A big need right now is stopping the New York City mayor from returning people to congregate shelters.” A lawsuit by the Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the Homeless has been filed to prevent the transfer slated for July 1.

Other threats to housing security are also looming including the pending expiration of the CDC eviction moratorium on July 30 which is why Weaver advocates dealing with both the immediate crisis and strategizing about ways to permanently end housing insecurity.

Creating new SRO housing is one piece of the solution.

“People have lived in single-room occupancy (SRO) hotels as long as the City has been around” Weaver says. “They are an affordable form of housing for low-income adults so if HONDA eventually creates 400 more SRO units it will be a positive outcome.”

This will also represent a return to a once ubiquitous form of housing. In fact SROs were originally created as low-cost housing for male lumberjacks miners and railroad workers and cropped up in places as diverse as Chicago Des Moines Joliet Los Angeles Salt Lake City San Francisco and Seattle. From day one however they were derided as dens of vice and shunned as the housing of last resort but they served an important function until the lure of “urban renewal” and later gentrification led to their demise. The upshot was the loss of between 900000 and one million SRO units between 1955 and 2013. Some became boutique hotels; others became co-ops or condominiums. In some areas the buildings were razed in “slum clearance” efforts.

Now decades after they were destroyed California is leading the way toward the rebirth of SRO housing. It’s also promoting sound social policy announcing in late June that it will forgive rent arrears for many tenants who have fallen behind.

According to San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Matt Haney early in the pandemic San Francisco identified hotels that could be used to shelter in place as well as isolate and quarantine those who had been living in congregate shelters. “Hotels were never meant to be used permanently” he told Truthout. “Most will transition back to tourist hotels by the end of 2021 or early 2022. The initial program called Project Roomkey led to the development of Project Homekey the resettlement of the unhoused [people] into supportive permanent housing.”

The goal Haney says is acquisition of at least 1000 additional units of SRO housing in San Francisco to be run by nonprofit supportive housing providers. Statewide $12 billion — including $600 million in CARES Act money — will be allocated so that other California cities and towns can begin to do likewise over the next two years.

The Battle for Equity

Housing activists in Los Angeles — both the city and the 88 municipalities that comprise LA County — support hotel conversions but they worry that another more pressing issue may scuttle their development.

Their fears rest with a 110-page decision issued in response to a 2020 lawsuit filed by the LA Alliance for Human Rights a business group. In it U.S. District Court Judge David Carter ruled that Los Angeles must offer housing to every homeless person living on “Skid Row” estimated at more than 60000 by October 18 2021. The decision further stipulates that ordinances against sitting sleeping or living on city sidewalks in parks or under freeway overpasses cannot be enforced unless an adequate amount of indoor shelter is available.

Bill Przylucki director of People Organized for Westside Renewal (POWER) says that while this sounds good in principle he fears that the City will open enormous congregate facilities to comply with the order. “The issue” Przylucki says “centers around what constitutes shelter. Warehousing people is not a solution even without COVID.”

The Los Angeles Times he continues has reported that the city plans to create enough housing for 60 percent of unhoused Angelinos and will then again enforce anti-camping and anti-vagrancy orders. “The consent decree should not be a trade-off between policing and housing” he says.

Przylucki’s worries don’t end there. While he acknowledges that Project Roomkey worked well in other parts of the state — giving people privacy security and autonomy — he notes that numerous LA hotels were so restrictive imposing curfews and daily room checks that some residents returned to the streets; others formed Unhoused Tenants Against Carceral Housing.

“Homelessness is the defining public policy issue for Los Angeles” Przylucki says. “Are we going to invest in warehousing and policing or are we going to direct dollars to long-term building conversion and develop housing for people with extremely low incomes to once and for all end homelessness? We can turn the tide if we choose the latter.”

Housing and tenant activists agree that this is what’s needed. From Austin to Denver from Ft. Lauderdale to Newark and from Phoenix to Tulsa the need for affordable housing is obvious.

“We know what works” Breaking Ground’s Brenda Rosen concludes. “We have to develop housing for low-income people with wraparound social services for those who need and want them.”

Consider this before building an apartment over the garage,"watch now

Many things have been in short supply during the coronavirus crisis and that includes housing. When the country went into lockdown Americans were on the move. The sudden shake up caused a spike in home prices. Even now potential buyers continue to be shut out of the housing market as prices head higher and higher. At the same time the pandemic-induced run on housing has put even more pressure on the demand for rentals which are generally more affordable than ownership. More from Personal Finance:

Many Americans can't afford an emergency expense

How to determine your spending rate in retirement Anyone with a little extra space can turn that room into a rental. For some this is an investment opportunity. As the nation's housing crisis intensifies a growing number of homeowners particularly in high-cost areas are converting a piece of their property into a garage apartment granny flat or guest house for short- or long-term rent. So-called accessory dwelling units or ADUs are now a popular way to add an income-generating rental property on the same lot as a single-family home according to a recent research note by Freddie Mac. ""We're in the midst of a huge housing crisis; that leads to classic economic supply and demand"" said Caitlin Bigelow the CEO of Maxable a startup that connects homeowners with resources to build rental units from start to finish. ""Homeowners are looking at ADUs as low-hanging fruit."" (Each Maxable project begins with an evaluation for $199.)

In 2018 Amy O'Dorisio 40 turned a stand-alone garage into a one-bedroom one-bath unit. In the last year demand for those types of apartments has only grown O'Dorisio said — particularly in San Diego where she lives and works as a residential realtor. ""I knew that it would catch on and it has"" she said. O'Dorisio said she spent $130000 on the conversion including permits and some furniture. She now rents the unit for roughly $2000 a month. She is currently working on converting another portion of her property into an additional ADU. ""My goal is to have enough rental income that I don't have to work as hard"" she said.

In fact after a year of record low interest rates and soaring home prices real estate became the most preferred way to invest over the long run according to a recent Bankrate.com report — topping savings accounts or certificates of deposit and the stock market. But there are many factors to consider. For starters whether you can add on an accessory dwelling unit depends on the ordinances or rules in your jurisdiction. The scarcity of affordable housing is driving more cities to adopt ADU-friendly legislation making these units legal in many neighborhoods; however it's not across the board. And turning spare rooms into rentals isn't cheap. Garage conversions start at about $100000 according to Maxable's Bigelow. Building a separate stand-alone structure is even more.

Once a unit is built there are two main ways to make money: cash flow and appreciation according to Tendayi Kapfidze chief economist at LendingTree an online loan marketplace. ""If your goal is cash flow you'll need to know if you can lease the property for enough to earn more than you spend on the mortgage and maintenance"" he said. The rental income should cover your monthly costs including insurance and some amount of vacancy. ""All that has to average out"" Kapfidze said. ""If you're more interested in appreciation you have to estimate whether the property will be worth more several years down the line"" Kapfidze added. Like all things in real estate much of that comes down to location location location. Notoriously expensive cities like Chicago Miami and Seattle have seen a growing number of these rental units over the last decade while homeowners with ADUs in more affordable cities like Austin Texas; Nashville and Phoenix could benefit going forward from a sudden increase in rent prices due to Covid.

Vacation towns may be even more lucrative. Properties in exclusive enclaves such as Kiawah Island near Charleston South Carolina; Key Biscayne Florida; Park City Utah; Rehoboth Beach Delaware; Nantucket Massachusetts and the New Jersey beach towns of Stone Harbor and Avalon have the highest value as investments according to another report by MagnifyMoney. Still potential rental income can also vary from block to block Kapfidze cautioned. ""It's something that's very very local"" he said. ""Before you figure out the finances it's very important to understand the level of demand in a very small geographic area where your home is.""

McKinsey leads at Harvard and Stanford while BCG tops the list at Wharton.

But what about the rest of the major recruiters of MBA talent from these three business schools? If you want the answer to that question don’t go to the MBA employment reports published by the schools. All three business school giants keep the major employers of their MBAs under wraps.

Now for the first time an extensive analysis of MBA recruits by Menlo Coaching the premium MBA admissions consulting firm has pulled the curtain back on exactly which firms are hiring in a big way from these schools. Menlo Coaching’s research team analyzed 51991 student profiles on LinkedIn to get to the bottom of it. What does the analysis reveal?

SURPRISES SIMILARITIES & DIFFERENCES IN WHO HIRES MBA TALENT FROM HARVARD STANFORD & WHARTON

“Harvard Stanford and Wharton have some things in common: all of them placed strongly at McKinsey Bain BCG and Google” says David White a founding partner of Menlo Coaching. “At Harvard the vast majority of top employers were leading global brands whether in finance (KKR Blackstone Bain Capital) tech (yes all of FAANG were among their top employers) or even consumer products (Estée Lauder). The only emerging company to make the list of top recruiters at HBS was June Motherhood a startup that came out of the Rock Accelerator at HBS.

“On the other hand” he adds “around one third of the top employers at Stanford were startups or smaller companies including multiple companies started by Stanford GSB founders. Some of these startups were based outside the US such as Muni Tienda an ecommerce platform in Latin America. At Wharton there was a mix of everything. Although the leading consulting firms and investment banks were well-represented Wharton also placed well at exciting tech companies (TikTok DoorDash) in private equity (H.I.G. Capital hired numerous graduates) and in healthcare.”

How useful to applicants are these stats? They may very well have more entertainment value than anything else. As White notes “lists of top employers don’t reveal everything. At each of the programs there were also exciting employers that hired only one or two graduates in 2020.”

THE STATS REVEAL SEVERAL BIG TRENDS IN MBA HIRING OVER THE YEARS

Evident in the stats are some of the big trends in MBA hiring. The bulge bracket banks now employ fewer MBA graduates than they used to and have largely been replaced by several of the tech giants most notably Google Amazon Microsoft and the global consulting giants. Some 20 years ago Goldman Sachs was the number one financial recruiter at Wharton carting away 42 MBAs from the Class of 2000. Last year Goldman hired half a dozen less than Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Evercore or H.I.G. Capital. BofA/Merrill hired just eight Wharton MBAs in 2020 less than half of the 27 Merrill alone employed out of the Class of 2000.

Meantime MBB still displays a voracious appetite for MBA talent from Wharton. In fact Boston Consulting Group has more than doubled their hires from the school in the past 20 years bringing aboard 56 Wharton grads from the Class of 2020 up from a mere 22 in 2000. McKinsey’s hiring is roughly the same: 56 last year and 61 some 20 years ago. Ditto for Bain & Co. which employed 26 out of the Class of 2020 vs. 34 from the Class of 2000.

The days when a lot of firms hired MBAs by the boatload are long gone with only MBB left. Look back those 20 years at Wharton and it took ten hires from a single class to make the Top Ten major employers. Today a company need only hire a pair of Wharton grads to make its Top Ten list.

STANFORD MBAs HAVE A CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR STARTUPS EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES VC AND PE FIRMS

The other big trend goes to the ambitions of today’s MBA graduates. More than ever they want to graduate into roles that allow them to have immediate impact. That is why so many Stanford MBAs gravitate to startups and early-stage companies that provide greater responsibility off the bat and more opportunity to make a difference to the hiring organization. This trend is most pronounced at Stanford in part because so many entrepreneurially driven students are naturally attracted to the school and because they are surrounded by a startup culture and ecosystem that knows no peer.

Among the 24 major employers at Stanford last year more than a third–at least nine–qualify as startups or early-stage players that few would immediately know about. The include Rested DataFleets Muni Tienda Sagelink Stealth Startup Check FarmRaise and Juni Learning. And then there is DoorDash and Peloton. Compare that to the

the 28 largest employers at Wharton: only two would quality as startups or early-stage companies: DoorDash and TikTok. Of the 25 biggest hirers at Harvard there’s one startup but also Netflix and Lyft.

Often times smaller elite firms that crop up on these lists have founders who are alumni of the schools. Consider Owl Ventures a Silicon Valley-based venture capital fund that invests in the world’s leading education technology companies. Though Owl recruited only a pair of Stanford MBAs last year it puts the firm among the Top Ten tied with 14 other employers. But a Stanford MBA is nearly a prerequisite to work there. Co-founded by Stanford MBA Tory Patterson in 2014 all four of the VC fund’s managing directors and three of the five principals sport Stanford MBAs on their CVs. The one MBA interloper among the principals is a Harvard Business School grad.

DELOITTE NOT ALL THAT SUCCESSFUL IN HIRING Harvard MBAs OF LATE

No less interesting is who’s not on these lists. Who would have thought that Deloitte Consulting now among the top ten employers at Wharton and Stanford would have so little success at Harvard Business School. Last year more Harvard MBAs began employment at June Motherhood a digital health startup that offers virtual pregnancy and postpartum support for women than Deloitte which doesn’t make this list of Harvard’s top 28 employers of the Class of 2020. There’s a catch here of course. The startup was founded in 2020 by three Harvard MBAs so each of them qualifies as a co-founder of the company. By the way two of the three used to work for Deloitte.

Apple pops up at both Harvard Business School (4) and Stanford (3) but doesn’t make the list of major employers at Wharton though the company also recruits on the Philadelphia campus. Goldman Sachs hired at least six Wharton MBAs and five Harvard MBAs last year but was nowhere to be found among the major employers at Stanford.

However the world of dolls extends beyond the typical Barbie and baby models you find in a toy store. Artists like Anastasia aka Eslyn's Dolls create exquisite ball-jointed figurines that look like lifelike women.

As the name suggests ball-jointed dolls utilize ball and socket joints in their construction allowing the figurine greater mobility. Anastasia creates each of her characters using high-quality polyurethane (a type of resin) and custom wigs made of goat wool. She carefully sculpts delicate facial features in neutral expressions before painting the color of the skin eyes eyebrows and makeup onto the surface. This attention to detail ensures that each figure is completely unique.

Even the hands of these dolls have been sculpted in such a way that they can be posed in a variety of different positions that seems completely natural for the figure. Many of Anastasia's clients have imaginative photoshoots with their purchases dressing them up with custom clothing and styling their hair into different coiffures.

The exquisite creations are available to purchase via Eslyn's Dolls Etsy shop. You can view her full portfolio by following the artist on Instagram.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks go directly to the 5 Stocks to Buy to Profit from Post-COVID Economic Recovery.

Inflation fears and a cryptocurrency slump in recent weeks have hit some of the prospects for the post-COVID economic recovery. However with the vaccine rollout in the United States proceeding forward at a healthy pace and international travel activities resuming the post-pandemic boom is well and truly underway. Some of the stocks that investors can look towards in hopes of riding these growth catalysts include Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA).

Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) the online platform that connects renters with those who need short-term lodging can power through the coming few months with strong recovery momentum behind it. On June 21 investment advisory Baird maintained an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $200. Colin Sebastian an analyst at the firm underlined the platform improvements and focused marketing campaigns of the company that he said would enable Airbnb to capitalize through the rest of the year.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) perhaps one of the most recognizable brands in the world is also expected to be one of the big gainers of the year as theme parks reopen in tandem with relaxed social distancing rules and easing mask mandates. According to investment bank UBS theme parks could be back to pre-COVID operating levels as early as the holiday season this year. However UBS has cautioned that full-year recovery for the sector is not expected for at least another two years.

With the relaxation of lockdown rules another stock that could benefit is Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) the telecom firm that owns several broadcast channels and film studios. The relaxations would allow the company to resume filming and as cinemas reopen another source of revenue would be added to the money pipeline that would strengthen the firm in the coming weeks and months. As the internet streaming business of the firm grows it could rival other streaming giants in the space because of sheer capital backing.

The tilt towards internet streaming has been necessitated by the digitization of the world in recent years. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2% vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th.

With this context in mind here is our list of the 10 stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery. These were selected based on the upside potential they offer as the economy reopens the overall market ratings and hedge fund sentiment around the companies.

Stocks to Buy to Profit from Post-COVID Economic Recovery

10. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) is a company that owns and runs several hotels and resorts across the world. It is placed tenth on our list of 10 stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery. The company’s shares have offered investors returns exceeding 74% over the course of the past twelve months. The company has been investing heavily in Las Vegas in recent years doubling its footprint in three years with plans to expand to 30 hotels in the area by the end of this year.

On June 15 investment advisory Argus maintained a Buy rating on Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) stock with a price target of $145. The investment advisory also raised the 2021 earnings per share estimate on the hotel firm to $2.6 from $2.56.

At the end of the first quarter of 2021 47 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5 billion in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) down from 60 the preceding quarter worth $6 billion.

Just like Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) is one of the stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter LRT Capital Management an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Hilton is the second largest hotel company in the world after Marriott International (MAR). The company owns a portfolio of brands from the low end (Hampton Inn Hilton Garden Inn) through the mid-tier (DoubleTree Hilton Curio Embassy Suites Homewood Suites) to the luxury high end (Waldorf Astoria Conrad LXR). Hilton’s portfolio is almost perfectly balanced between the three categories while the majority (73%) of the company’s EBITDA geographic exposure is in the United States with Asia Pacific and Europe each contributing another 10%. Hilton today is almost exclusively a manager and franchisor of hotels not a hotel owner. The company owns 61 hotels manages 715 and franchises 5702 – in total 6478 properties with over 1 million combined rooms.8 Like all franchise based businesses Hilton requires very little capital to grow as it utilizes the investment capital of its hotel-owners/partners to expand. Hilton currently faces a difficult operating environment due to the covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty about the future of business travel. However the company is an excellent operator with a somewhat leveraged capital structure – if pent-up demand for travel materializes post-Covid as we expect it will the company will quickly go from losing money to raking in profits. Hilton last reported earnings on February 17th with both top and bottom line disappointing investment analysts’ expectations. However these poor results are not indicative of the company’s long-term outlook. In normal times Hilton generates prodigious free cash flow which we expect will resume once travel demand returns. Over the longer term we expect Hilton to grow its topline at least twice as fast as GDP due to rising revenues per room and the growing number of rooms. Most importantly the industry continues to consolidate with chain branded hotels taking market share from independent operations. With the superior marketing and loyalty programs offered by hotel chains (Hilton Honors has 112 million members) driving demand independent hotel owners see the benefits of signing up with one of the dominant hotel chains (Hilton IHG and Marriott). Furthermore the company’s main growth opportunities remain abroad as hotel chain penetration remains much lower outside the United States. Shares are up 9.34% year-to-date. We believe the shares are undervalued at 31.72x forward earnings.”

9. LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE: LYB)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47

LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE: LYB) is a Dutch firm that makes and sells chemicals. The company has operations throughout Europe North America Asia and other places.

It is ranked ninth on our list of 10 stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery. The stock has returned 62% to investors over the course of the past year.

LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE: LYB) is a solid option for income investors as the firm pays a regular and healthy dividend. On May 28 it declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share up more than 7.5% from the previous dividend. The forward yield was close to 4%.

Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey New York-based investment firm Eagle Capital Management is a leading shareholder in LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE: LYB) with 2.9 million shares worth more than $308 million.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86

Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) is placed eighth on our list of 10 stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery. The company’s shares have returned 121% to investors in the past year. It is an online travel firm based in Washington. The firm recently beat market expectations on earnings per share and revenue for the first quarter of 2021 reporting a 14% year-on-year increase in bookings on the platform that are set to increase further as the vaccine rollout allows for more business operations to resume.

On June 10 investment advisory Wells Fargo gave Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) stock Overweight rating and placed the company in an attractive value and high momentum target list for investors in the consumer discretionary sector.

At the end of the first quarter of 2021 86 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $6.1 billion in Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) up from 76 in the previous quarter worth $6.5 billion.

Just like Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) is one of the stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter ClearBridge Investments an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Several of our better performers in the first quarter were purchased while their business models were under stress from COVID restrictions or the macro environment the pandemic created. What gave us confidence in purchasing Expedia were the actions the company took to extend out their balance sheets until travel resumed. It should benefit as a broader vaccination rollout prompts cruise lines to resume operations and consumers to start traveling again and are positioned to deliver better margins and gain pricing power as the economy normalizes due to the cost controls implemented during the downturn.”

~ Over 600 workers to be employed during first phase ~

GEORGETOWN Guyana--Oil giant ExxonMobil is currently seeking the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) approval for the gas-to-shore pipeline which its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) says will have a lifespan of 25 years.

According to the project documents submitted by Esso Exploration Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) Exxon’s local subsidiary the estimated US $900 million project will have a start-up date in 2024 and will have a lifespan of at least 25 years until it is decommissioned.

The project life cycle the application stated will include engineering construction commissioning operations and decommissioning. The engineering phase will include design front-end engineering and design (FEED) and detailed engineering. The construction phase will include procurement fabrication and construction installation commissioning and start-up.

“Operations will follow commissioning and start-up and will be the longest phase of the project with a duration of at least 25 years. Start-up of the facilities is expected to occur in 2024” the EIA states.

It was further explained in the EIA that the offshore pipeline installation will be conducted simultaneously with the onshore installation of the pipeline and works at the natural gas liquids (NGL) plant.

The installation will see Exxon laying approximately 220 kilometres of pipe from the Liza Destiny floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel to the gas plant which will be located at Wales on the West Bank of Demerara (WBD). However initially the pipeline will land at Crane on the West Coast of Demerara (WCD).

The EIA says the offshore pipeline installation phase of the project will employ approximately 300 workers at its peak. However it was explained that this is a preliminary estimate that depends on construction/installation and support vessels.

Meanwhile the onshore pipeline installation phase will employ approximately 100 workers at its peak. The construction of the NGL plant will see 300 workers employed at its peak. Following commissioning 25 workers will be employed during the operation aspect of the project with that number doubling during decommissioning.

“The project is in the initial stages of planning and design and detailed estimates of workforce requirements have not yet been developed. Preliminary workforce estimates are provided …” the EIA states.

“These estimates will be refined following selection and contracting for the offshore and onshore scopes of work. The estimated peak construction workforce will be on the order of 600 persons or less with accommodation needs served by existing lodging in the greater Georgetown area.”

The gas-to-shore project is a transformative project that will see gas from the Liza Field offshore Guyana being pumped onshore to generate power. The main objective of the initiative is to transport sufficient gas from the Stabroek Block’s petroleum operations to supply some 200-250 megawatts of energy to the national grid leading to a significant reduction in electricity cost.

Industrial development

President Dr. Irfaan Ali had previously said the gas-to-shore pipeline would lead to “big industrial development taking place there that is linked to not only power generation and a power plant.” He also said the investment on the Demerara River’s shoreside would create massive opportunities and a trickle-down effect.

Soon after the government issued permit licences to Exxon for the Payara Development Project last year Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo had announced that the government would turn its attention to negotiating the gas-to-energy project.

A number of factors including geotechnical geophysical and environmental were examined before Jagdeo announced recently that the government had settled on Wales to land the pipelines for the project.

Meanwhile Prime Minister Mark Phillips who has responsibility for the energy sector had previously said the government was looking to produce 200 megawatts of power from the gas-to-shore project by 2024.

Exxon has said that around 30 to 35 million cubic feet of natural gas will be required for the gas-to-shore project. Data from Norwegian research company Rystad Energy had indicated that less than 20 per cent of the 1.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) discovered last year was gas. ~ Guyana Times ~",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFicm9la25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMjcvc3VuZGF5L2d1eWFuYS1hbmQtdGhlLXdpZGVyLXdvcmxkL2d1eWFuYXMtb2lsLWFuZC1nYXMtc2VjdG9yLXdyYXBwaW5nLXVwLXRoZS1kaXNjdXNzaW9uLW9mLXRoZS1zZWN0b3ItYW5kLXRoZS1uYXRpb25hbC1idWRnZXQtMjAyMS1wYXJ0LTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guyana’s Oil and Gas Sector: Wrapping-up the discussion of the Sector and the National Budget 2021 - Part 8,"Introduction

After seven consecutive weeks today’s column draws to a close my rather extended (albeit selective) excursion into this year’s National Budget and its treatment of the country’s emergent oil and gas sector. Important areas of treatment in the Budget have not been considered; for example the Budget treatment of policy recommendations on institutional capability and resource governance of oil and gas. My intention is to address these where appropriate as the column series unfolds.

It is important to acknowledge that the Budget gives no indication at all of a stressful relationship between the Government of Guyana GoG as the petroleum resource owner and ExxonMobil and partners as the Contractor under the extant Production Sharing Agreement PSA. Indeed to the contrary mainly on account of two recent occurrences. These are: firstly the Contractor has indicated it is on trend to adjust upwardly its longstanding target of 750000 barrels of oil equivalent boe per day by 2025/2026; and secondly the role announced for ExxonMobil in the proposed natural gas-to-shore project.

Through recently publicized productivity gains ExxonMobil and partners now project a target for 2025/26 which is closer to one million boe per day. Gains are expected in its first field operation Liza 1 taking it potentially to as high as 140000 boe per day. Similar productivity gains are anticipated across all of the first five of the ten Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels projected to be eventually operational offshore Guyana.

Further as indicated earlier the gas-to-shore project construction is expected to be financed by ExxonMobil and recovered from cost oil under the PSA. This topic will be addressed in the next section where I take the opportunity to advance a recommendation on this matter.

Re-negotiation and NOC

As matters stand today I cannot envisage how the upfront financing of the natural gas-to-shore project by ExxonMobil whether in the whole or part thereof with the GoG payback undertaken through the cost oil provisions of the ruling PSA can be satisfactorily arranged without re-negotiating the PSA. Because of this requirement to renegotiate I recommend the formation of a National Oil (energy) Company to execute this project as a joint venture JV vehicle. About a year ago I had repeated an earlier recommendation made back in 2017 which called for Guyana to establish a NOC to shepherd its emergent oil and gas sector.

When recommending the establishment of a NOC in last year’s column I had stressed my explicit rejection of any notion of twinning this proposal to the construction of a state-owned (or joint venture state-private) downstream oil refinery. This outright rejection on my part applies to mini-oil refineries as recently evaluated in the Japanese commissioned consultancy study. Mini-refineries were once widely discussed in local circles.

Relatedly I should add that in similar manner It is vital for readers to keep in mind that my recommendation to establish a NOC is one envisioned along the lines of the NRC’s Charter. This declares the NOC: “offers policy options and practical advice… on how best to manage (Guyana’s) natural resource wealth”. The aim therefore is to “ensure the NOC can draw on accumulated experiences… learn from history and avoid mistakes of the past” NRC 2nd Edition.

I note here also that I reject the IMF-type proposal to create a State Holding Company. As conceived by the IMF such a company is restricted to financial interests with little or no operational involvement in decision making and execution. Indeed my recommendation is biased in favour of the establishment of a broad-based energy company.

My arguments on this topic can be found in a score of previous columns over the period May 28 2017 to October 29 2017 and subsequently in August 2020

Climate change: Is natural gas the new coal?

Today’s environmentalists are quick to remind us that as recent as a decade ago American President Obama boasted the USA was well underway to exceed the target set for cutting its greenhouse gas ghg emissions by switching from coal to natural gas. Emissions from natural gas releases half the carbon dioxide of coal. The fact is though this is not the only ghg. Natural gas releases methane a ghg. Experience has shown that natural gas has failed to provide “a bridge fuel or a middle ground’ in transitioning to sources of energy that can prevent climate disaster.

Thus Vox recently proclaimed natural gas is a climate disaster. It has fallen out of favour with investors concerned with the environment. Comments highlight the risks it carries in use: odourless flammable and toxic thereby placing a high premium on safe storage and secure transport. While petroleum pipelines report fatalities spills and leaks at a rate close to one a day natural gas pipeline disasters are far less frequent. Despite this recent analysts forecast stranded natural gas assets in the region of 109 billion US dollars

All told gas pipelines are expensive to construct and the proposed capex for Guyana’s is as high as one billion US dollars. To ExxonMobil and its partners the options facing them are the traditional ones. That is to burn bury or monetize the associated natural gas. Burning is prohibited. Burying is costly. If the GoG involves them in a no risk to them venture to monetize it they will surely go to the bank happy to do this

Conclusion

New Delhi: India's tyre sector is seeking effective collaboration with raw material partners to harness its potential industry body Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association ( ATMA ) said.According to ATMA Chairman Anshuman Singhania  Managing Director JK Tyre & Industries  India's tyre industry has immense growth potential in the emerging new world order.However an effective collaboration between the industry and raw material partners is imperative to harness this potential Singhania said at the ATMA Partners' Summit held recently.""As a key sector of the economy tyre industry has displayed resilience to bounce back after every challenging phase. Last year the growth plummeted in the first quarter in view of the lockdown. However the industry staged a strong recovery in the subsequent quarters and the supply side was under stress to meet the demand"" he was quoted as saying in a statement.""This year again we have witnessed a slowdown in the months of May and June.

The Bahrain-listed group said the transaction was part of its strategy to invest in “high quality logistics assets in key distribution hubs” especially amid a surge in the e-commerce scene.

“An increase in global trade and e-commerce as well as development in supply chain management has created an increased structural demand for warehousing space and hence further growth” CEO of GFH Capital KSA Razi Al-Marbeti said.

It recently acquired the Amazon Spain Portfolio and the Michelin distribution facility in Chicago.

“The logistics and distribution real estate sector has proven to be one of the most dynamic sectors of commercial real estate” he added.

The unit is a mission-critical facility for FedEx GFH said as it is located in a “fast growing metro center” where the logistics company will have access to over 60 percent of the US population in one day’s drive.

GFH will announce other deals over the next few months in North America and Europe the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0cHRvdXIuY29tL2VuL25ld3Mvemhhbmctd2ltYmxlZG9uLTIwMjEtZmVhdHVyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carrying The Weight Of National History Zhang Zhizhen Says 'It's Just The Beginning',"Player Features

Carrying The Weight Of National History Zhang Says 'It's Just The Beginning'

The Chinese No. 1 is making his major main draw debut at Wimbledon

Zhang Zhizhen has the weight of a country — China with a population of 1.4 billion — on his shoulders. But if you talk to the 24-year-old you would never know it.

On Thursday Zhang became the first Chinese man in the Open Era to qualify for the main draw at Wimbledon. It has been 62 years since Chu Chen Hau and Mei Fu Chi competed in The Championships in 1959. Yet the No. 178 player in the FedEx ATP Rankings is approaching this massive moment with a clear calm.

“It’s not the last tournament for me” Zhang said. “I didn’t finish the tournament yet. It’s just the beginning it just started. [I need to] be calm be easy.”

Zhang is not just internalising his emotions because of the magnitude of this occasion. He is always easygoing.

""My full name is too hard for people to say so I just tell them to say whatever they want to call me and I will respond” Zhang told ATPTour.com. “Then it became 'ZZZ' because there are three Zs in my name. It is much easier for people outside of China to say. And it sounds cool. Triple-Z. I also like to sleep so 'ZZZ' is perfect.""

The Shanghai-native comes from an athletic background. His father Zhang WeiHua was a soccer player for Shanghai ShenHua. His mother Qin Wei was a shooter. But today’s No. 1 men’s tennis player from China did not follow in his parents’ footsteps.

“My father gave me a choice: studying swimming [or] tennis” Zhang recalled. “Studying is too boring and it costs too much. Swimming the coaches are really strong really tough. I was so scared of the swimming coach. And tennis was fun. The coach was relaxed… I was like ‘Let’s go [play] tennis.’”

Zhang was four when he was first introduced to the sport and looking back he says “I had no idea what tennis was.” At six he chose to focus on tennis over swimming and any other sport even though soccer runs in his blood.

“My father was a soccer player but my father didn’t want me to play soccer. The reason is there are 11 players on the [field]. You are not deciding [the game for] the whole team so it’s tough” Zhang said. “He wanted me to play something that I can decide how the match goes. Tennis I can decide everything. I [can] decide to lose or decide to win. It’s all about me it’s not about the other 10 people.”

The Chinese star impressed early qualifying for his first ATP Tour main draw at the age of 18 in 2015 when he reached the second round in Shenzhen. The following week he earned his first Top 100 victory in Beijing.

“In that moment I thought I was going to fly I was going to make it to something. But I got a big injury. I was running and I broke my left foot” Zhang told ATPTour.com two years ago in Zhuhai. “After that injury I thought it was trouble. I played two or three Futures. The first week I lost right away and said ‘Okay no problem.’ The next week I won a round got a point and was like ‘No problem I’ll come back.’ But then I kept falling and falling and falling and falling.”

Zhang’s training has taken him around the world to countries including Spain the United States France Italy and Croatia. When he was an 18-year-old Zhang trained at the same academy in Nice France as current World No. 2 Daniil Medvedev. They practised together and became friends with the Russian winning “65 to 70” per cent of the time. In qualifying for an ATP 250 event in Nice in 2016 Medvedev beat Zhang in a final-set tie-break.

“I lost to him in the third set it was so sad” Zhang said. “Then after he just went up like ‘whoosh’.”

Meanwhile Zhang fell as low as World No. 894 in May 2017. But he has shown moments of brilliance too. Towards the end of 2019 the home favourite claimed his first two ATP Challenger Tour titles in China. Between those triumphs he won main draw matches at ATP Tour events in Zhuhai and Beijing.

In Zhuhai that year Zhang and good friend Wu Di became the first Chinese pair to advance to the second round of a tour-level event since Shenzhen in 2015. Wu is not surprised by Zhang’s success at Wimbledon.

“I believe he only will be getting better because he already showed some high quality tennis a couple years ago” Wu said. “He is talented and has a good understanding of tennis. Most people thought players from Mainland China are not comfortable on grass. Zhizhen showed how much he has grown in the past few years and I hope people can see more of him in the future.“

Last year Zhang reached his career-high FedEx ATP Ranking of No. 136 in February before play was suspended for more than five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. And now here in London on his fourth attempt to qualify for a Grand Slam — and his first at The Championships — he has broken through to become the first Chinese man in the Open Era to reach the main draw at a major outside of the Australian Open. According to his countryman Li Zhe the World No. 268 this was a long time coming.

""I think Chinese players should have made this breakthrough a long time ago . For me Zhizhen’s performance in Wimbledon is not surprising and I believe he will break more records for Chinese male tennis” Li said. “I am truly happy for him. I think people should have more faith in all the Chinese players because we are all capable to do this but [have had a] lack of opportunities.”

Zhang is well aware of the success of Chinese women including Li Na although he did not watch when she won Roland Garros in 2011 and the Australian Open in 2014. To the 24-year-old it is important to not try to reach those heights overnight.

“Women [from China] always had good results from many many many many years ago. They had a Grand Slam already in singles doubles” Zhang said. “The men we are not even close to the [Top] 100. That’s quite different so [we need to go] step by step maybe. It cannot be [in] one day or one week [that] we can figure this out.

Zhang who idolised Roger Federer — he calls the Swiss legend “the perfect one” — is now in the same Grand Slam draw as the 20-time major champion. The qualifier has received a lot of messages from friends and he is ready to make his historic debut on Monday at SW19 against fellow qualifier Antoine Hoang. However he is treating it no differently than his other matches.

“Nothing special” Zhang said. “I would say keep it as a normal one as a normal match. It is a different match its a little bit special. But I will prepare like normal.”

Unless your job involves a lot of shipping it can be hard to know which service best suits your needs—and your budget. Maybe UPS is cheaper in some parts of the country than others for the type of package you need to send. Or perhaps FedEx has better rates on overnight shipping to your destination.



The problem with all the shopping around is that it takes a lot of time. And it’s not a case where you can look something up once and then have all the shipping information you need moving forward. That’s where the Online Shipping Calculator comes in. Here’s what it does and how to use the website.

What is the Online Shipping Calculator?

The Online Shipping Calculator website first landed on our radar via the Recomendo newsletter where contributor Claudia Dawson shared her secret for getting the best shipping rates and/or fastest shipping options. It works like most price comparison websites providing users with a quick estimate of shipping costs from multiple carriers. And it’s free to use.

Part of what makes the Online Shipping Calculator particularly handy is that it also provides information on different discounts for each carrier and includes them in their price quotes. These include:

USPS: This site returns Commercial Prices. You can get Commercial USPS prices from accounts on Shippo  Paypal Stamps.com  Endicia.

UPS: This Shippo discount is used.

FedEx: This discount is used.

How to use the Online Shipping Calculator

The process is pretty self-explanatory and similar to other price comparison websites but here are the directions listed on the Online Shipping Calculator:

Start typing your origin ZIP code or city name in the “From City” field. Select from the autocomplete options.

Do the same for the “To City” field. This field is for the destination city of the parcel.

After filling out the cities enter in the length height width and weight of your package. The default units can be changed with the dropdown menus.

Click the “Get Rates” button.

The button will only be active when you fill out all the fields. It can take about 10 seconds or more to calculate and retrieve the shipping rates.

The Canadian Press





COWESSESS FIRST NATION - Members of the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan spent Saturday morning placing solar-powered lights next to each of the 751 unmarked graves near the site of a former residential school.

A vigil was planned for later in the evening and a moment of silence was scheduled for 7:51 p.m.

After that community members planned to wait for darkness when the lights charged by the sun during the afternoon twinkled on one-by-one.

The First Nation announced Thursday that the unmarked graves at the former Marieval Indian Residential School were located using ground-penetrating radar the same technology that detected what are believed to be the remains of 215 children at another former residential school in Kamloops B.C.

Jon Z. Lerat a band councillor and chair of the Chief Red Bear Lodge which is the First Nation's child safety service says there were some tears while the lights were planted in the ground on Saturday.

He says the announcement of the graves has triggered numerous elders but he says there were also laughs and smiles as families and friends gathered.

“To me personally it was heartwarming for me knowing that these unmarked graves are being acknowledged. As sad as it is it makes me happy and a lot of others happy” Lerat said in a phone interview as he prepared for Saturday night's vigil.

Lerat said the vigil which was also to include a smudging ceremony drumming and speeches began with an idea from the community's youth council for a candle-light ceremony. When that idea switched to a solar-light ceremony a connection with a car dealership in Prince Albert Sask. proved helpful.

Lerat said a Cowessess member is a salesman with the dealership and his boss wanted to do something to support the community.

“We wanted to put a solar light at each unmarked grave so that each and every one of them were acknowledged” Lerat said.

“They immediately said they wanted to help and they donated 800 solar lights. The next day they brought them down.”

A teepee has also been erected at the site and a fire will burn for four days.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Friday to the people of the Cowessess for the pain they are feeling.

That suffering and grief is also prompting some communities to cancel or alter their Canada Day celebrations.

Meanwhile information is still emerging about the unmarked graves in Saskatchewan.

It appears that not all of the graves contain children's bodies Lerat said. He said the area was also used as a burial site by the rural municipality.

“We did have a family of non-Indigenous people show up today and notified us that some of those unmarked graves had their families in them -- their loved ones” Lerat said.

The Indian Residential Schools Resolution Health Support Program has a hotline to help residential school survivors and their relatives suffering trauma invoked by the recall of past abuse. The number is 1-866-925-4419.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 26 2021."

This marks the third straight series in which the Hawks lost Game 2 after winning Game 1 on the road. Those Game 2 losses have been decided by a total of 59 points.

The series shifts to Atlanta for Game 3 on Sunday.

Brook Lopez scored 16 points for the Bucks while Khris Middleton had 15 points eight assists and seven rebounds. Antetokounmpo had nine rebounds and six assists.

Danilo Gallinari had 12 points and John Collins added 11 for the Hawks.

Milwaukee was intent on making life difficult for Young two nights after the Bucks blew a seven-point lead in the final four minutes of Game 1. Young’s Game 1 performance had made him the first player ever with at least 45 points and 10 assists in a conference finals game.

Young committed eight turnovers in the first half alone. He shot 6 of 16 overall and 1 of 8 from 3-point range.

Milwaukee pulled ahead in the opening minutes as Antetokounmpo continually got to the rim for easy baskets. The Bucks already owned a double-digit lead before going on a 20-0 run late in the second quarter to break open the game.

Holiday scored nine points in the spurt and capped the run with a 3-pointer and layup. Lopez added seven points during that stretch.

The Bucks led 77-45 after a first half in which they shot 64.6 percent and capitalized on 13 Hawks turnovers including eight from Young.

This week I wrote a “comparison” of the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Tesla Cybertruck. Two trucks that don't exist yet. It got a lot of comments and reactions from the Tesla loyalists and the Blue Oval fans. I did not think what I wrote was that controversial.

However Tesla loyalists are incredibly passionate and often chime in to vehemently defend Elon and the Tesla brand. Truth be told I love Tesla vehicles and I would love to interview and hang out with Elon Musk. And Teslas are a blast to drive. I would love to drive a Cybertruck just for the experience.

The gist of my comparison story between the Lighting and the Cybertruck was this: both Ford and Tesla are really good at what they do. But what Ford does well Tesla does not and what Tesla does well Ford is just now beginning to do. So for me it would have made sense for these two innovative companies to have combined their resources to make one amazing electric truck.

Areas Where Tesla Could Improve The Ford F-150 Lightning

Directly after the world reveal of the Ford F-150 which was less of a circus and had less showmanship that Elon’s reveal of the Cybertruck back in 2019 I wrote a piece showcasing five things I liked about the Lighting and three things I didn’t.

Looking that over the biggest letdown for me was that the F-150 Lightning’s range was disappointing when compared to the maximum range of the Cybertruck. All along I wanted and hoped for 500 miles of range. This would allow for towing which will likely decrease range by 50 percent. So having 500 miles of range meant 250 miles in range while towing (in theory).

The Lightning has a maximum range of 300 miles and that drops to 150 miles or less when you start towing. Meanwhile the tri-motor Cybertruck claims it can reach that 500-mile range.

So imagine if Tesla and Ford joined forces and put Tesla’s outstanding battery technology into the Lightning? Imagine if Ford got to that 500-mile range level with ease and could then showcase the Lightning’s impressive torque and towing ability. That would greatly improve one of the biggest knocks against the Lightning.

To be honest this is the area that Ford needs to improve upon and a collab with Tesla could help. That won’t happen of course.

The other area is the charging network. Tesla has been making EVs for years and has the charging network infrastructure in place to dominate that. Ford is still playing catchup in that regard and some of the criticisms have been the slow charge times at their networks especially when you get to the 75% charge range. Ford has done a great job of improving their at-home charging and I expect big advancements in that regard down the road.

Likewise the nation’s entire EV charging network will have to quickly improve and Tesla won’t be able to dominate this area for long. All manufacturers will have to play in the sandbox together so to speak. But imagine if Ford’s Lightning could also jump onto Tesla’s supercharger network. Wow!

Areas Where Ford Could Make the Cybertruck Better

Tesla has always been an outlier when it comes to the automotive world. They do their own thing. Elon Musk is a rebel and a little quirky. So it shouldn’t have surprised anyone when he revealed the Cybertruck.

But if you’re like me you were shocked and thought Musk might be playing a prank when he revealed that goofy looking Cybertruck. That can’t really be it I thought. It looks like something from Mad Max.

But the Cybertruck with its angular steel panels is the truck that everyone mocks. Perhaps that is an advantage for Tesla – to be different. But if Ford and Tesla were to collaborate imagine how the Ford Design Center and their experienced designers and clay modelers could have made the Cybertruck look better.

Related story: The F-150 Lightning does not represent a missed opportunity for Tesla.

It could still break “the rules” and be different but not look like something drawn by a five-year-old in kindergarten. Sorry but the Cybertruck just looks ridiculous and I can’t help but assume that Ford’s designers would have made it look much better while still allowing it to have its own personality.

As such the Cybertruck won't be a draw amongst the commercial consumer which is missing a big market of the Lightning.

The Lightning is an F-150 so it had to stay in a similar look but the Cybertruck would not have to stay in that mold. I wonder what it could have looked like with designers from within the auto industry versus.

The other area as I pointed out in my “controversial” article that Ford excels at that Tesla does not is in manufacturing. The Tesla fans can try to jump to Elon’s defense but all of his business success has not come from manufacturing. In fact most everything comes from the tech world.

When Elon started cranking out his Teslas he admitted he had no idea how to make cars and admitted numerous mistakes. Ford has been a leader and innovator in the auto manufacturing for more than a century.

They know how to improve the manufacturing process. They have the workforce and the facilities. Tesla is playing catch up to Ford in this regard.

So manufacturing seems like a no brainer area that Ford could help Tesla in this imaginary collaboration.

Conclusion

Obviously a Ford and Tesla collaboration won’t happen (although in this industry never say never). The one thing that is super annoying is that Tesla fans seem to want to tear down and destroy all of the other auto manufacturers. That is weak and unnecessary. It’s also disrespectful.

Companies like Ford and General Motors paved the way in manufacturing and automotive technology for a multitude of decades. Tesla is the newcomer. That’s what draws fans to them I get that.

But you can be drawn to Tesla without being disrespectful to the history of the automobile of which Ford plays a monumental role. Tesla would not exist were it not for Ford. But Ford existed long before Tesla. Think about that.

Leave me your comments as the discussions have been mostly good (keep it civil).

The Ford Maverick will be available in fall 2021. (Ford/TNS)

Putting an exclamation point on its aggressive transition to all-SUV/truck brand Ford Motor Co. has debuted its Maverick compact pickup — based on the unibody chassis shared with the Escape and Bronco Sport SUVs.

Slotted below the midsize ladder-frame $26015 Ranger pickup the entry-level Maverick starts at just over $21000 including destination fee $19995 without. Its compact size and bed-full of tech features are aimed at urban buyers who want a ""ute with a bed.""

Along with the Hyundai Santa Cruz pickup introduced earlier this year the segment-busting Maverick further expands sub-$25000 SUV offerings.

""Since 2009 the car market share in the U.S. has decreased 56% while at the same time truck/SUV has increased 73%"" said Ford Global Chief Marketing Officer Suzy Deering. ""Three years ago Ford made the decision to stop producing sedans. It opened up an incredible whitespace opportunity for us (that) combined the best attributes of cars and utilities.""

Ironically Ford first used the Maverick nameplate on a Japanese compact-fighting car in the early 1970s but the badge now fits the brand's off-road adventure vibe. It's ""the truck you didn't see coming"" crows Ford's YouTube ad.

While taking its conservative bold design cues from Ford's flagship F-series pickup Maverick's nimble unibody chassis youthful interior and clever tech will be more familiar to buyers of the Ford Escape and red-hot Bronco Sport The Detroit News' 2020 Vehicle of the Year.

""The unibody design gives the truck better ride and handling from an overall maneuverability perspective"" Maverick/Ranger marketing manager Trevor Scott said in a vehicle walkaround. ""And it gives the truck more of the characteristics this customer is looking for. Five passengers. Tons of cargo space.""

Contrary to traditional rear-wheel-drive trucks the unibody Maverick will be front-wheel-drive-based with an all-wheel-drive option. It will be made alongside the Bronco Sport at Ford's plant in Hermosillo Mexico. Maverick power-train options are shared with the Escape. A gas-electric hybrid 2.5-liter four-cylinder comes standard. A more powerful 2.0-liter turbo-4 is optional.

Indeed Maverick will be the first pickup on the market with a standard hybrid powertrain.

Ford has aggressively priced the Escape Hybrid for volume sales to meet fuel economy regulations and the Maverick appears determined to make hybrids mainstream with pickup buyers as well.

They will be rewarded with a significant mpg boost as the hybrid Maverick boasts 40 mpg city and 500 miles of range compared to the Ranger's 21 mpg/414 miles.

""It's actually stronger fuel economy than a Honda Civic"" said Scott.

Though priced on top of Ford's cheapest SUV — the India-made Ecosport (and well below the $28710 Bronco Sport) — Maverick is much more robust. It eschews Ecosport's somnolent 123-horse three-cylinder and 166-horse 4-cylinder egg beaters for four-cylinder mills making 191 and 255 horsepower. Maverick engines can also tow a healthy 2000 pounds (think two jet skis) and 4000 pounds (think camper) respectively.

""It's definitely intended to serve the entry-level price point for the Ford showroom — but also for the Built Ford Tough lineup"" said Scott. ""We're going to be looking at a lot of first-time truck contenders.""

Similar to Ranger Maverick will start with Ford's core XL XLT and Lariat trims with the loaded models topping out at $35k. Ford's rugged FX4 package will be available on top trims. ""We anticipate that a lot of the volume will be in the XLT series which is closer to that $23000-$24000 price point"" said Scott.

The interior is a departure from the critically panned cheap plastic designs of Ecosport and Ranger. Adopting a youthful blocky look — think IKEA meets LEGO — Maverick bristles with storage cubbies and clever details.

""Cut-out"" front armrests allow more vertical space for tall Thermoses. In the rear speakers have been moved to the c-pillars opening room for say a computer tablet.

To keep costs down the base XL model will offer basic tech amenities like auto high beams and emergency braking. Popular safety features like blind-spot assist and adaptive cruise control are available. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come standard however as does Smart Pass app connectivity so owners can start the pickup remotely in frigid Michigan winters and check details like tire pressure.

Like Bronco Sport the interior is decorated with bright orange trim while the console mimics a desk organizer with ample storage bins. More storage is under the rear bench seat — courtesy of moving the gas tank aft of the cabin.

Also aft of the cabin is the heart of the Maverick a 4.5' long x 4' wide bed. ""Flexbed"" Ford calls it.

Like Bronco Sport's creative hatchback the bed can swallow two bicycles with front tires removed. Maverick embraces the Do It Yourself trend with a bed-based 12-volt outlet 10 tie-downs and optional rails with cleats and 110-volt outlet. A QR code is even stamped on the bed wall to offers suggestions on how owners might configure the bed for more utility (DIY slots can be found inside for customer add-ons too). Useful 8"" x 8"" side bed cubbies can store say two-liter soda bottles or bike pumps.

""You can go to your local lumber store purchase a couple of two by fours and create bed dividers"" noted Scott. ""We'll give (customers) instructions on how they can create their own bike rack.""

Maverick is not as radically designed as Santa Cruz (which channels Tesla's Cybertruck with a sliding bed cover) but the Ford pickup's flanks are notably clean like the Hyundai's thanks to a single-option bed. Ladder frame trucks like Ranger and F-series by contrast have a clean break between cab and bed in order to offer different bed sizes.

The wee Ford pickup's front fascia bear signature F-series elements like a power-dome hood and C-clamp headlights. Out back C-clamp taillights and Maverick-stamped tailgate are familiar as well. Maverick distinguishes itself with an off-center license plate holder — in order to make way for the tow hook.

Expect Maverick to ride into dealerships this fall.

""It's a very bold target"" said Yachiyo Tanaka an analyst at automotive research company Fourin. ""Honda has pledged to pull ahead of other automakers by introducing the latest technologies.""

The spoils if Mibe can pull it off are significant. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and firms with a first-mover advantage may capture market share. Electric-vehicle penetration in the nation is 1% well down on China the world's biggest market for electric cars at around 6%.

But it's a bet that stretches beyond Japan's borders too. Global sales of passenger electric vehicles are set to rise sharply jumping to 14 million in 2025 from 3.1 million in 2020 according to BloombergNEF. Honda which gets about 56% of its revenue from North America and around one-quarter from Asia excluding Japan has already begun aligning itself with powerful carmakers overseas last year striking a pact to use General Motors' battery technology.

Honda's electric strategy also includes its traditional strength -- motorcycles. Honda plans to unveil three new electric two-wheelers by 2024 as well as 10 new electric cars in China within five years (its first mass-produced Honda e released last year has a global sales target of 10000 units annually).

While motorcycles represent only around 14% of Honda's total revenue their sales volumes are much greater. Honda is selling around 15 million two-wheelers a year compared with around 4.5 million cars. Pit that against BNEF forecasts for electric two-wheeler sales of 78 million in 2040 from 27 million in 2020.

In March Honda formed a consortium with Yamaha Motor Co. KTM AG and Italy's Piaggio & C SpA to develop swappable battery standards for electric two-wheelers tricycles and quadricycles as the fall in global lithium-ion battery prices lures high-volume manufacturers further into the motorcycle market.

Honda ""won't hesitate"" to form alliances if necessary Mibe who took the reins on April 1 said at his inaugural press conference that month. He said he thinks the Japanese government's target is reasonable.

""We can't postpone making an effort and then expect to reach the target at the last minute"" said Mibe 59 although he did note that selling only zero-emission vehicles by 2040 will ""be an uphill struggle.""

Honda declined to make Mibe available for an interview.

Critics of Honda's strategy wonder whether the goal is realistic. Bigger players like Ford Motor Co. aren't expecting to be 100% carbon neutral until 2050 while Toyota sees hybrids playing a much more important role. It's a short-term tactic to grab stakeholder attention as the focus around environmental social and corporate governance picks up said Takeshi Miyao an analyst at Carnorama.

For Honda to position itself in the market it had to say something different from Toyota he said. ""Honda had no choice but to unveil a plan that's almost opposite to appeal to investors. It's no use saying the same thing"" Miyao said.

Honda's decision to end its long history with gasoline-powered engines is a marked shift.

The pledge also comes after former CEO Takahiro Hachigo ordered a cost-cutting exercise amid falling profits at Honda's car unit shutting factories slashing models and scrapping the company's participation in the Formula One World Championship at the end of the 2021 season leaving fans dismayed.

Honda became involved in Formula One more than half a century ago competing as an entrant constructor and engine supplier and scoring numerous championships in the world's most watched motor-sport competition.

""I'd never imagined Honda would say farewell to engines because that's how Honda has succeeded up until now"" one person tweeted. ""I thought F1 was Honda's DNA so it's sad hearing about its withdrawal.""

Mibe said at Honda's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday that the carmaker may consider involvement in an auto race again ""after we win the race for carbon neutrality.""

The split was bittersweet for engineers within Honda too. It can be harder to differentiate electric cars in the market which is a concern for those across the auto industry one said. Another who also declined to be identified because the employees are not authorized to speak publicly said that while the all-electric goal may be challenging at least Mibe has laid out a clear strategy and the general feeling inside the company is one of positivity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvbW9zdC1oYXJkdG9wLW9wdGlvbnMtZm9yLXRoZS0yMDIxLWZvcmQtYnJvbmNvLWhhdmUtYmVlbi1kZWxheWVkLXRvLXRoZS1teS0yMDIzLTE2NDA1Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most Hardtop Options for the 2021 Ford Bronco Have Been Delayed to the 2023 MY,"PHEV

Coming courtesy of a dealer FAQ posted on the Bronco6G forum the delay is attributed to supplier issues. Ford says it has to deliver more soft tops than originally expected for the 2021 model year which is very bad planning on the automaker’s part. As such the black modular hardtop white modular hardtop body-color modular hardtop and dual-top roofs have all been pushed back in favor of the soft top and carbonized gray MIC hardtop.The Dearborn-based automaker highlights that switching to a soft roof will expedite a customer’s order although it doesn’t guarantee a 2021 delivery date. Scheduling is based on part availability the number of Broncos attributed to each U.S. dealership and the reservation’s timestamp.Customers who don’t want to wait for the delayed hardtops can easily change their configurations to the molded-in-color hardtop or the soft top which is probably the only bit of good news for would-be owners. Those who really want any of the fancier hardtops should also be aware that Ford will sell them as accessories directly through authorized retailers in the United States.MY 2023 production will start in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2022 while MY 2022 customers can look forward to a few new options. These include a green exterior finish special editions the off-road Sasquatch Package with a stick shift and the four-door 'Squatch with a roof rack.The dealer FAQ doesn’t mention a word about the Warthog desert runner with 37-inch tires and we’re also left in the dark about theoption."

USAA has come under heavy criticism for airing advertisements on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show in recent days after the conservative commentator’sdisparaging remarkstoward chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley with some members threatening on social media to take their business elsewhere.

USAA a banking institution for members of the U.S. military and their families is being pushed to remove their ads from Carlson’s show Tucker Carlson Nightly after he said Milley was “not just a pig he’s stupid” on Thursday. The comments were made after Milley told lawmakers he wanted to understand “white rage” and that he believed members of the military should be well read on a variety of issues including critical race theory.

Critical race theory is a legal academic framework taught in higher education — typically in law school — to study systemic racism and its impact on society according to an NPR segment of Fresh Air published on Thursday.

Following Carlson’s comments many longtime USAA banking members have demanded that the bank pull its ads from Carlson’s show including retired colonels and generals.

Moe Davis a retired Air Force Colonel and USAA member for 38 years said he would completely sever ties with the company if they continued “supporting sedition and the trashing of the military.”

I’ve been a @USAA member for 38 years. I’ve already moved our mutual funds and brokerage accounts. I guess I need to move our insurance and banking and completely severe our ties if they’re supporting sedition and the trashing of the military by assholes who didn’t serve. — Moe Davis (@ColMorrisDavis) June 26 2021

Donald Arnold said Americans are desperate to return to Carnival Corp's cruises.

""We have far more demand than we have ships available to supply right now"" he told Fox Business.

He added that the chance of a COVID-19 outbreak onboard is ""very low"" but can't be ruled out.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The CEO of Carnival Corp the world's biggest cruise company said that demand across its nine cruise lines is soaring and that Americans are raring to get back on the water.

""Honestly people are champing at the bit to cruise again"" Donald Arnold told Fox Business Friday.

Its first US cruise the Vista by Carnival Cruise Line its biggest brand is setting sail from Galveston to the western Caribbean on July 3.

Arnold said that people were confident in the safety of cruises as the vaccine rollout continues across the US and that the shots were a ""huge game-changer.""

Bookings were ""robust"" and among the highest in the company's history according to Arnold.

He said: ""We do not have an issue with being able to fill the ships. People are ready to sail. In fact we have far more demand than we have ships available to supply right now.""

In a second-quarter business update Thursday the company said that booking volumes for future cruises were 45% higher than during the first quarter. It added that advance bookings for 2022 were already higher than in 2019 thanks to pent-up demand.

People are spending a lot of money on board too. The CEO of Celebrity Cruises said travelers are eager to shell out extra cash on casinos massages and luxury meals.

Arnold told Fox Business that some of Carnival's cruise lines including Costa had been sailing out of Europe during the pandemic. Many of these passengers were unvaccinated but the company implemented universal testing social distancing mask-wearing and enhanced medical screenings he said.

There were less than 50 reported coronavirus cases out of around 400000 guests on board according to Arnold who added that guest satisfaction scores were ""sky high.""

Arnold said that there would be some unvaccinated guests on its cruises in the US but that these passengers would have to take regular COVID-19 tests and wear masks.







Celebrity Cruises last week unveiled new regulations subjecting unvaccinated passengers – or those unwilling to show proof of the vaccine – to onboard restrictions extra COVID-19 tests and additional costs.

But being fully vaccinated doesn't completely prevent the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

""If the virus is in the community on land … then of course you can get it on board despite all the things we do"" Arnold told Fox Business.

""We can't guarantee there will never be a case on board but the chance of an outbreak is very low"" he added.

And on a ""fully vaccinated"" Royal Caribbean cruise sailing from the Bahamas two passengers aboard tested positive for COVID-19. Both were under the age of 16 meaning they were exempted from the vaccine mandate.

Carnival said that at least 52% of its ship capacity would be sailing by the end of November and expected to have its full fleet back in operation by spring 2022.

Arnold told Fox Business that Carnival was selling or had sold 19 ships during the pandemic reducing its total capacity by 13% but that the company was buying more ships and would grow its capacity by around 2.5% through 2025.

He added that its newest ship the Mardi Gras was setting sail from Port Canaveral to the eastern and western Caribbean on July 31. Carnvial Corp said that the ship is the first in the world to have a rollercoaster on board as well as the first in North America to be powered by liquefied natural gas."

USAA has come under heavy criticism for airing advertisements on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show in recent days after the conservative commentator’sdisparaging remarkstoward chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley with some members threatening on social media to take their business elsewhere.

USAA a banking institution for members of the U.S. military and their families is being pushed to remove their ads from Carlson’s show Tucker Carlson Nightly after he said Milley was “not just a pig he’s stupid” on Thursday. The comments were made after Milley told lawmakers he wanted to understand “white rage” and that he believed members of the military should be well read on a variety of issues including critical race theory.

Critical race theory is a legal academic framework taught in higher education — typically in law school — to study systemic racism and its impact on society according to an NPR segment of Fresh Air published on Thursday.

Following Carlson’s comments many longtime USAA banking members have demanded that the bank pull its ads from Carlson’s show including retired colonels and generals.

Moe Davis a retired Air Force Colonel and USAA member for 38 years said he would completely sever ties with the company if they continued “supporting sedition and the trashing of the military.”

I’ve been a @USAA member for 38 years. I’ve already moved our mutual funds and brokerage accounts. I guess I need to move our insurance and banking and completely severe our ties if they’re supporting sedition and the trashing of the military by assholes who didn’t serve. — Moe Davis (@ColMorrisDavis) June 26 2021

Joseph Collins is a retired Army Colonel who says he has been a USAA member for more than 50 years and said USAA would lose customers if they continued to support people like Carlson.

Veterans for Responsible Leadership a non-partisan veteran group with a self-described mission to “keep fascism and authoritarianism from rising again” that has been critical of former President Donald Trump has also called on USAA to pull their ads and has highlighted USAA members who are demanding a change.

It looks like Garmin heard our request and did something about that.

Garmin introduced the vivoactive 3 Music — a running watch that allows you to store up to 500 songs and listen to them during your workout. You can either load up your own music if you have it downloaded to a computer or download playlists from iHeartRadio if you subscribe to that service. Deezer support will be added in the future too though we’d certainly like to see more integrations like Spotify or Play Music.

A newer version of this device is now available. The The Garmin vivoactive 4 is the follow-up to the vivoactive 3 and 3 Music and adds more sport profiles longer battery life and more health-tracking features. The Garmin Venu and Venu 2 are also out now which both have OLED displays and nearly the same features.

I wasn’t able to use iHeartRadio playlists during the testing period but I did load up my own music from my computer. The process is much faster than Fitbit’s method to load music on the Ionic or Versa. With the Garmin vivoactive 3 Music you simply plug the watch into your computer sync it with Garmin Connect and select the music you want to be loaded on your watch. That’s about it. Alternatively you’ll be able to drag and drop your music files into the Windows file manager or the Android Device Manager if you use a Mac.

Once you’ve loaded up your music you can connect and listen through a pair of Bluetooth earbuds. Music streaming from the watch is pretty seamless. Though my music did cut out every once in a while when paired with the Fitbit Flyer. Also read: The best running watches you can buy

Aside from a slightly redesigned bezel on the new watch (and music support of course) the vivoactive 3 and Music version are basically the same. That means you get a fantastic running watch with a built-in GPS heart rate monitor 5ATM water resistance rating Garmin Pay support and seven-day battery life. You can check out our full Vivoactive 3 review right here to learn more.

That is according to a recently-released letter in which the FAA outlines concerns and says it is unlikely to issue the 777-9’s amended type certificate until mid- to late-2023.

The given timeline does not mean a fresh delay for the 777-9 because in January Boeing pushed back its first planned 777-9 delivery until late 2023.

The letter dated 13 May highlights changes Boeing is making to the 777-9 and mentions lack of clarity about progress toward certification in Europe. It says the FAA needs more information – including about a major software architecture called the “Common Core System” (CCS) – before considering the 777-9 to be on track to certification.

Specifically the FAA’s letter addresses the state of the 777-9’s “Type Inspection Authorisation” (TIA) – a milestone issued by the FAA when it determines that an aircraft “is expected to meet” certification requirements.

“The FAA and Boeing have been discussing the TIA readiness of the Boeing Model 777-9 in numerous meetings over the past nine months” says the letter. “Based on our assessment the FAA considers that the aircraft is not yet ready for TIA even if it is a phased TIA of limited scope with a small number of certification flight test plans proposed.”

The letter was sent from the FAA’s Aviation Safety unit to Boeing staffer Tom Galantowicz who administers the Chicago airframer’s 777-9 certification effort. The Seattle Times reported about the letter on 27 June.

“The technical data required for type certification has not reached a point where it appears the aircraft type design is mature and can be expected to meet the applicable regulations” the letter adds. “The Model 777-9 amended type certification date is realistically going to be mid- to late-2023.”

Asked to comment the FAA says it “will not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards”.

Boeing “remains fully focused on safety as our highest priority throughout 777X development” the company says.

“As we subject the airplane to a comprehensive test programme to demonstrate its safety and reliability we are working through a rigorous development process to ensure we meet all applicable requirements” it adds. “We continue to communicate transparently with the FAA and other global regulators about 777-9 certification.”

Boeing is working to certificate the 777-9 amid heightened regulatory scrutiny following the 737 Max disaster.

The FAA’s letter says Boeing plans an “upcoming major software update” to the 777-9 that is intended to address “many” items including a “fix for the un-commanded pitch event that occurred on December 8 2020”.

“After the un-commanded pitch event the FAA is yet to see how Boeing fully implements all the corrective actions identified by the root cause investigation” the letter says.

The FAA expects Boeing will complete a comprehensive review “and implement a robust process so similar escape will not happen in the future and [so] this is not a systemic issue”.

Details about that event were not disclosed. The 777-9 made its maiden flight in January 2020.

Much of the letter’s focus rests on the 777-9’s CCS which the letter says fails to meet “readiness requirements”. Boeing does not provide details. But in 2014 GE Aviation said it had been chosen by Boeing to provide the 777X’s CCS.

GE Aviation did not respond to a request for comment.

“The CCS is a very complex and critical avionics system” the FAA’s letter says. “It is an integrated modular avionics architecture that provides a set of shared computing networking and input/output resources.”

The CCS system on the 777-9 marks a “significant change from the baseline 777-300ER” the letter adds.

It cites “lack of sufficient data” related to the CCS and “lack of availability of [a] preliminary safety assessment for the FAA to review”. The agency cannot yet confirm the CCS “is mature and will provide only uncorrupted data”.

It notes that Boeing’s proposed modifications to the 777-9’s design include “firmware and hardware changes to the actuator controls electrics of the flight control system”. Boeing chief executive David Calhoun disclosed in January that Boeing was making those types of design changes.

The FAA still has “concern” about the modifications and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) “has not yet agreed on a way forward on the Model 777-9” the letter says. “Boeing needs to ensure the changes do not introduce new inadvertent failures.”

It adds that “design maturity is in question as design changes are on-going and potentially significant”. The letter asks Boeing’s Organisation Designation Authorization office – the company’s self-certification unit – to “close these gaps” before requesting that the FAA issue the Type Inspection Authorization.

In early June CEO Calhoun said Boeing remains “confident” that the 777-9 will be certificated in the fourth quarter of 2023.

He said Boeing’s timeline incorporates lessons from the 737 Max’s re-certification and “the architectural preferences that both the FAA and the EASA has embedded in their regulations”.

“We don’t have like a load of technical glitches and we don’t have a battery issue” Calhoun added. “We don’t have that kind of stuff.”",,,,,,,,,

Is that enough to make it a buy over an industrial stalwart like 3M? Read this before doing anything.

General Electric (GE -0.80%) has been struggling to get off its back foot since the 2007 to 2009 recession. Three CEOs later and as many turnaround plans it looks like the business may finally be solidifying. Before buying this icon however you should consider it compared to some peers. For example 3M (MMM 1.02%) could be a good alternative. Here's a head to head to see why.

1. The recent run

General Electric's stock is up roughly 85% over the past year. 3M's gain is a relatively meager 25% or so. Over the past three years GE's shares have risen about 4% while 3M's are basically flat. Since the start of 2007 however GE's stock is off by more than 60% while 3M's shares have gained 150%. These are three very different time periods but the big takeaway is that GE's stock has been performing better of late. However that hasn't been enough to make up for the hit the business took during the 2007 to 2009 financially-led downturn.

During that period GE's foray into finance caused massive financial harm leading to several rounds of restructuring asset sales and dividend cuts. That's a very truncated summary of what has been an incredibly trying time for the business but the truth is that GE is not the same company today that it was in 2007. That's notable because while there is likely to be more recovery potential in GE's stock it may take a long time before it regains anything close to prior peaks. By comparison 3M is still the lumbering giant it has been for decades. There's an important level of comfort in that for moderate and conservative investors.

2. The portfolio

Today GE breaks its business down into four main categories: power (21% of sales) renewable energy (20%) aviation (32%) and healthcare (26%). It makes fairly large industrial products that service businesses in each of these areas. 3M does things on a somewhat smaller scale creating products like adhesives and dental supplies not windmills and jet engines (two of GE's core products). 3M's business is broken down across its safety & industrial (35% of sales) transportation & electronics (27%) healthcare (24%) and consumer (14%) segments.

While both of these companies would fall into the industrial conglomerate category 3M's business has more diversification built into it. Diversification is good for your portfolio and it can be good for companies as well. To put a figure on that GE's sales fell 16% in 2020 while 3M's were flat. To be fair 2020 was an extremely unusual year given the coronavirus pandemic but 3M weathered the hit better because of its vast mix of products. Demand for GE's big costly industrial items were hit much harder. Once again conservative and moderate investors will likely favor 3M.

3. The dividend

This isn't perhaps a fair comparison given that GE has been working through a tough turnaround that has left its dividend at a token penny a share per quarter. At some point it will likely start to increase the dividend again which might end up being a sign that its turnaround is finally complete. But for now dividend investors won't be too happy with the shares and the scant 0.3% dividend yield. 3M has increased its dividend for more than 60 consecutive years making it a Dividend King. The current yield is around 3% which is toward the high side of its historical range. It has been higher so using yield as a rough gauge of valuation you wouldn't call 3M a screaming buy. But it is probably fairly valued to slightly cheap. Again 3M ends up looking like the better option for most investors.

4. Nothing is perfect

GE has been in turnaround mode for over a decade thanks to some pretty big self-inflicted wounds (straying too far into the finance industry was the biggest issue). It is getting past major structural problems as it slims down its operations with the focus now on getting its remaining businesses back on more solid footing. So there's progress here but still issues.

But don't think that 3M is without its own warts. The biggest one right now is a pair of lawsuits that it is fighting around environmental and product quality issues. The costs could end up being material. However the core of the business remains strong and 3M is a large and financially robust company that should be able to handle the legal costs should it end up losing these cases. This isn't as fundamental an issue as what GE has been dealing with. All in it would probably be best to view GE as a special situation stock as it looks to complete its turnaround effort a type of investing that's really best suited to more aggressive types. Buying 3M involves some uncertainties but they won't likely scare off conservative investors.

Boring is better

When you add it all up 3M looks like the safer option here. That's not to suggest that GE won't reward investors with larger stock gains as it has over the past year. But that's a function of the high risk turnaround that's taking place -- if the effort stalls the shares could drop just as quickly. Most investors will be better served sticking with a slow and steady name like 3M. Perhaps when GE starts to increase its dividend again it will be time for a reexamination but for now 3M looks more appealing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGNibWFnLmNvbS9uZXctbWVkdHJvbmljLWNlby1tYXBzLW91dC1zdHJhdGVneS10by1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLWlubm92YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Medtronic CEO Maps Out Strategy to Accelerate Innovation,"Medtronic’s board of directors gave Geoff Martha the luxury and burden of eight months of time to think about how he would succeed Omar Ishrak as CEO of the medical technology giant.

When Medtronic announced its leadership succession in August 2019 the board praised Ishrak for doubling company revenue during his tenure and expressed confidence in Martha’s “ability to take Medtronic into its next chapter of growth.”

Martha took the reins from Ishrak in April 2020 when Medtronic’s health care customers were in the early stages of battling the Covid-19 pandemic. A month earlier Medtronic had announced it would give manufacturers access to the company’s proprietary design specifications for ventilators which hospitals badly needed.

Yet the pandemic didn’t interfere with Martha’s change-agenda timetable. He unveiled a new organizational structure last year. It divides Medtronic’s work into 20 operating units such as cardiac rhythm management and respiratory interventions. Martha contends Medtronic had become too bureaucratic which had slowed its introduction of products into the market.

He’s pushing profit-and-loss accountability and product development decision-making down to the operating unit level. He argues this new structure will allow Medtronic to grow more rapidly and compete more intensely with other medical-technology businesses.

He’s also excited about a wide range of new Medtronic products and procedures. He points to renal denervation as a procedure that can revolutionize treatment of high blood pressure.

Martha had a 19-year run with GE Healthcare and GE Capital before he joined Medtronic in 2011. Most recently he led Medtronic’s Restorative Therapies Group and in 2014 he had a key role in Medtronic’s acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien the largest acquisition in the company’s history. He became Medtronic’s board chairman in December.

Martha who grew up in a Pittsburgh suburb honed his competitive drive when he was captain of the Penn State hockey team. While he was earning a bachelor’s degree in finance Martha says his hockey experience taught him about team dynamics humility and work ethic.

Now Martha 51 leads a workforce of more than 90000 employees including 11000 based in Minnesota. On May 27 Medtronic reported $30.1 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2021 up from $28.9 billion for fiscal 2020. Martha noted a strong finish for the 2021 fiscal year that ended on April 30. He said Medtronic is now poised for “accelerated revenue growth.”

In a recent interview with Twin Cities Business Martha discussed how he plans to grow Medtronic which new products hold the most promise how he’s addressing diversity issues and why Medtronic is the subject of high-profile litigation. The following are edited excerpts of the interview.

Q: You recently spoke at a Medical Alley virtual meeting that focused on diversity equity and inclusion. During a 45-minute conversation with the moderator you brought up the importance of humility three times. Why is it important for a CEO to try to maintain some level of humility?

Humility is one of the core things that I look for in people and try to emulate myself. Humble people tend to listen more and learn more. The people who have the highest impact are active learners. My predecessor Omar Ishrak is a very humble guy and also a lifelong active learner. How do I try to get the rest of the organization to think that way? One is to lead by example and look I’m not perfect at this.

I don’t really like arrogance. In high-performing people who don’t display a level of humility we’ve moved them out of [Medtronic]. People don’t like to work with arrogant people.

Q: It can be difficult to succeed a longtime CEO. About a year into your CEO tenure what would you say is the biggest change to the Medtronic business that you’ve led?

A: We’re a biomedical engineering company but we don’t just invent products for technology’s sake. Our products are designed to have a measurable impact on patients and health systems around the world. The [business] environment has progressed becoming much more global fast moving and competitive. We decided to make some changes to the operating model of the company. The goal was to decentralize a lot of the decision-making—around innovation and our go-to-market—into our operating units.

These operating units are set up around specific therapies like diabetes or spine surgery. We’ve tried to empower them to move faster to make decisions and also to be accountable for their performance. We eliminated some layers of bureaucracy within the company. We’ve added some new cultural traits around competitiveness being bold with our plans and creating a sense of urgency.

Q: You’ve aligned 19 operating units under three portfolios—cardiovascular neuroscience medical-surgical—and diabetes is a free-standing unit. By granting more decision-making to these 20 operating units what is the No. 1 problem you are trying to solve?

A: Speed. We need to move faster in everything we do. We’ve got smaller very focused [competitor] companies. These companies are well funded and able to move faster. They are very focused [sometimes on just one product or therapy]. At Medtronic we’re trying to get at the speed of decision-making speed of innovation. If it took us four years to create a new product under the new organizational model I want that to be two and a half years or so. Also we can measure the [financial performance of] Medtronic operating units against their business competitors much easier when we look at the company this way.

Q: As people get Covid-19 vaccinations how does that affect Medtronic’s business going forward? In a less-restrictive health care environment what do you expect will happen within your cardiovascular portfolio?

A: We are very optimistic bullish that in the U.S. in particular we’re going to see a pretty rapid snapback of elective procedures. We’re going to get back to a normal prepandemic level of procedures we anticipate here in the next several months.

We innovated during Covid along with our hospital partners to manage many of our patients remotely. Pacemaker patients regularly go into the hospital to get their pacemaker checked out to make sure it’s working properly. [During] Covid hospitals started to really utilize the full extent of the Medtronic cardiovascular technology to manage devices remotely. Doctors were hesitant to do that but because of Covid they had to use it and patients liked it better.

Q: Many people live their daily lives with high blood pressure or diabetes and others deal with irregular heartbeats. If we look at these three common areas what types of innovative products has Medtronic put on the market relatively recently? And do you have any new products in late-stage development to treat these three ailments?

A: Let me take high blood pressure first. Over the last decade we invested more than a billion dollars in a therapy that is called renal denervation. [The procedure delivers energy to overactive nerves near the kidneys.] We have a mountain of evidence here that shows that it safely and effectively lowers your blood pressure without the side effects that the drugs have.

And it’s permanent. We have one big pivotal trial that we should get the results back from this calendar year in the fall. If those results are positive where we expect them to be then soon after that we should get FDA and other approvals. We will be launching this commercially in the next two years. This could be the biggest thing in the medical technology industry because hypertension is the No. 1 contributor to death around the world. This could be a real big disruptor and game changer that could really reposition Medtronic.

In addition to the growth—the number of patients we would serve and the resulting growth of the company— it would move us more in a big way to marketing to consumers. We’ve got to do that get that word out to cardiologists to primary care physicians and directly to the consumer that this therapy is out there and what it does.

Q: What about treating irregular heartbeats and diabetes?

A: An atrial fibrillation is another big condition that is primarily served by pharmacological products first. We have a product that’s an ablation therapy that freezes the tissue in your heart. It’s called cryoablation. The New England Journal of Medicine just published data that shows that for a large segment of patients you should use cryoablation first instead of drugs. It’s that effective.

In diabetes we’ve got a number of new products coming to market. Today we focus on insulin-dependent diabetes so this is severe Type II and Type I patients. And we’ve got a whole new system that we launched in Europe first because the European regulators approved it faster. It is sitting in the FDA right now and it’s our next-generation diabetes pump system with new algorithms. And it is getting just fantastic results on patients in Europe and in Latin America.

We also bought a company in August that serves more insulin-dependent patients and it’s a smart pen that delivers insulin vs. the pump. So it’s a much cheaper solution. You don’t have a pump tied to you and it does replace the multidaily injection shot. It works with glucose sensing so we can have a closed loop between your body and the insulin delivery device which is this pen. You see a theme here—where our therapies in many cases are not only better than the prior version but it opens us up to a whole new set of patients.

Q: At the core of Medtronic’s mission statement is producing products and therapies that alleviate pain restore health and extend life. Within that fundamental context of doing good how does Medtronic end up in a fair number of high-profile lawsuits and Department of Justice investigations?

A: As a company our intentions are pure. It’s very mission-driven and for those who have worked here and partners of ours such as health care systems and physicians if you surveyed them you would get that feedback.

We’re creating new therapies new standards of care things that have not been done before. That’s what really separates Medtronic from the competition. We are pioneers and then people tend to follow us.

From time to time we find out unfortunately after the fact that there was some sort of design flaw or some sort of mistake that was made which results in a product that doesn’t work quite the way over the long term that we expected it to. It’s something that we strive so hard to avoid but when [these circumstances] happen we are very transparent about that. We move quickly. Sometimes you get caught up in lawsuits and around your product liability.

Regarding the Department of Justice look we have over 90000 Medtronic employees all over the place. Unfortunately there is somebody somewhere doing something that they shouldn’t. Sometimes we find it and self-report sometimes other employees find these things and tell us about it and again we suffer for it. Or they call the government themselves. These things pop up. We work very hard on our culture to prevent these things. When they happen we act decisively and swiftly.

“People don’t like to work with arrogant people.”

Q: In 2019 Medtronic agreed to create a $35 million fund to compensate those who said they were harmed by the SynchroMed II an implantable drug pump. What were the lessons from that particular case?

A: It gets back to simplifying our organizational structure. Information flow from the patient through the health care provider and to our senior leadership could have been faster when there were product issues.

Sometimes this information was filtered [by layers of management at Medtronic] and we didn’t act decisively enough to address those issues. You’ve got to make sure that you have very good systems in place to pick up what we call “signals in the field” that the products aren’t working right. It may appear to be innocuous things in these reports you are getting back from physicians. But when you look at patterns they turn out to be problems that are brewing. We’ve gotten more sophisticated in recording these signals proactively asking the right questions analyzing these signals and predicting problems not just discovering problems.

When you hear these things you’ve got to be decisive and move quickly even when there are unknowns. But I’ll tell you that [SynchroMed II] context. That’s an implantable drug pump that provides tiny dosages of the drug directly to where it’s needed inside the body vs. the patient having to take that through pills with all kinds of side effects. It’s a super-complicated medical device maybe the most complicated one out there. And guess who’s the only one that does it? It’s us. Others have tried it and failed.

There’s a huge need out there. When we got into issues and created that fund and we got in trouble with the FDA and got a consent decree the easy thing to do would have been to shut that business down. Keeping that business alive and continuing to innovate that business has cost more money. If you look at it strictly from a return on investment it doesn’t provide nearly the returns that we would normally get. But because we are the only ones we stayed with it and we serve those patients. It’s part of our mission. If we had shut the business down we would have stranded a lot of patients and that’s just not who we are.

Q: Medtronic has achieved diversity by race ethnicity and gender in its top corporate leadership and on its board of directors. You were an executive leader of the Medtronic African Descent Network yet the Wall Street Journal reported in October that Medtronic had paid settlements to several Black employees who alleged racial discrimination in the company’s promotion process. What actions are you taking as CEO to make the Medtronic culture and promotion environment more hospitable for Black employees?

A: We’re going to keep going on the journey that we’ve been on. If you would have said in 2013 or 2015 that we would have as many vice presidents and senior vice presidents of African descent that we have today people would have thought that to be a pipe dream.

We’ve made tremendous progress but that doesn’t mean that we’re good enough. There are individuals who feel like it’s still not inclusive for them at Medtronic. We’re continuing to get better and work on that.

Most media outlets treated Flynn’s videotaped oath last summer in which he uttered a well-known QAnon slogan as a sort of coming-out story about a onetime Trump insider who had gone off the rails. The video has since become the subject of a lawsuit by members of Flynn’s family who claim that “left-wing media outlets began to spread false narratives” about the Flynn family’s connections to QAnon. An Intercept investigation has found that Flynn’s ties to the QAnon phenomenon stretch back much further than the July 4 weekend last year when the video first appeared however to the days immediately following Trump’s 2016 election victory.

That November nearly a year before the first cryptic clue from QAnon’s organizers – known as a “Q drop” — appeared on the online message board 4chan Flynn told a roomful of Trump supporters that the president-elect had been borne into office by an “army of digital soldiers.” The phrase “digital soldiers” which Flynn later trademarked has become a central QAnon rallying cry and a key indicator of the movement’s growing turn toward violent extremism and insurrection.

Flynn a retired Army lieutenant general who once oversaw military intelligence in Afghanistan and led a sprawling intelligence agency in Washington would go on to become a central hero in QAnon’s conspiratorial narrative. But his move to trademark the term “digital soldiers” — ensuring that only he and others who obtain his express permission can profit from the sale of “Digital Soldiers”-branded merchandise — hints at his attempt to capitalize on a marketing and communication strategy that resonates with the Q community.

Flynn hitched his financial fortunes to QAnon at least as early as the summer of 2019 when he was facing a mountain of legal costs The Intercept’s investigation found. His push to leverage QAnon’s viral popularity with the far-right coincided with his efforts to reverse his guilty plea for lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

The money-making virtual empire that Flynn his lawyer Sidney Powell and other Trump loyalists have built on the back of the QAnon phenomenon has long been hiding in plain sight. But in the wake of the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters disinformation researchers began digging into the tangle of financial legal and business relationships that have fueled the growth of a far-right conspiracy theory the government has classified as a serious threat. Data and records reviewed by The Intercept for this report were provided by the January 6 Research Consortium a joint initiative of New America and Arizona State University focused on investigating social media’s role in contributing to election-related violence at the Capitol and across the country.

What began with the launch of Flynn’s legal defense fund in 2017 has morphed into an intricate network of conspiracy-promoting websites and companies. Among the firms linked to Flynn and his surrogates including Powell are entities registered in Florida Virginia and Texas some of which are inactive; they include a political action committee and a related firm now at the center of a $1.3 billion libel lawsuit connected to the 2020 presidential election.

Flynn Powell and their lawyers did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The constellation of conspiracy-propagating enterprises reveals how Flynn’s background in irregular warfare signals intelligence and psychological operations collided with the strange underworld of hacker culture alternate reality games and far-right extremist message boards and spurred the rise of a movement with a cult-like global following.

While QAnon was originally spawned on far-right social media sites disinformation researchers have tracked the movement’s migration from the fringe to the mainstream on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. QAnon’s global following claims that an unlikely amalgam of mainstream media Democrats wealthy billionaires and Hollywood movie stars are part of an elite cabal of bloodsucking child traffickers out to destroy the United States. A hallmark of the thousands of posts and reposts of QAnon content is the co-optation and repurposing of anodyne catchphrases such as “Save the Children” “The Great Awakening” and “We Are The Storm.”

In QAnon folklore a covert group of military officers tapped Trump to run for president. “The Storm” refers to what the movement’s adherents say are Trump’s ongoing efforts to have members of the “deep state” arrested and sent to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay; references to stormy weather and “The Coming Storm” are threaded throughout QAnon content. Another popular QAnon theme is the exhortation to “take the oath” an apparent reference to the pledge sworn by QAnon followers which is widely known as the “Oath of the Digital Soldier.” At the end of the video showing Flynn and his family taking a version of the oath which is similar to one sworn by members of the U.S. armed forces and others who work for the government Flynn uses the phrase “Where We Go One We Go All” a reference to a quote from the 1996 movie “White Squall” that has also been shortened to a catchall meme for the QAnon movement: #WWG1WGA.

The scope and timing of Flynn’s engagement with the QAnon phenomenon — and the role he and key allies played in promoting false claims about election fraud — are coming into sharper view as Flynn’s stature and influence in the QAnon universe continues to grow. Flynn’s pledge on July 4 2020 reignited long-running speculation about his role in an online influence campaign that law enforcement officials have linked to violent incidents including the murder of a leading member of the Gambino crime family in New York and the January 6 assault on the Capitol. Over Memorial Day weekend Flynn headlined a Q-themed conference in Dallas where he apparently endorsed a Myanmar-style military coup aimed at reinstating Trump as president. Flynn later backtracked from his remarks but that didn’t stop several prominent politicians from calling him out.

The Daily Beast reported in March that four Trump allies and campaign surrogates including Flynn’s brother Joseph had recently registered a 501(c)(4) — a tax-exempt “social welfare organization” that can engage in lobbying and advocacy — called “Defending the Republic Inc.” in Florida. A lawyer who volunteered to work on Trump’s post-election legal challenges Peter Haller created a Florida political action committee Defending the Republic PAC Inc. around the same time. Additional public records indicate that Mike and Joseph Flynn along with Powell are listed as directors of a Texas corporation by the same name that shares an address with Powell’s Dallas legal offices. The Texas corporation was established on December 1 2020 less than a week after Trump pardoned Flynn who was facing up to six months in federal prison.

Ties between Flynn’s legal defense fundraising campaign and his online business efforts became more pronounced beginning in May 2019 about a month before he fired the lawyers who had convinced him to accept a plea deal in connection with charges that he lied to investigators about his contacts with Russian officials implicated in Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Soon after Flynn sought to trademark the term “digital soldiers” and resilientpatriot.com began redirecting to his legal defense fund he appeared on Parler under the handle @GenFlynn. His presence there coincided with a sharp increase in the number of posts on the platform that included QAnon-themed hashtags according to a review by the New America-ASU team of more than 183 million posts and comments by Parler users from the time the right-wing social media platform was launched in August 2018 until it was temporarily taken offline in the wake of the January 6 riot. Posts made under Flynn’s handle include an exhortation to take “the oath.”

“#DigitalSoldiers must fight on battlefields NOT of our choosing” according to an October 2020 post that appeared on Flynn’s Parler account. “Allowing tyranny to reign over liberty keeps us from breathing freedom’s fresh air and informing our democracy of the grave threats our constitutional republic faces. Read listen understand comprehend and respond with facts and sound analysis. That is how Digital Soldiers Fight back.”

A separate but related analysis of Parler posts archived by an anonymous hacker shows that #digitalsoldiers — Flynn’s signature online rallying cry — appeared in no less than 2700 posts from Parler’s 2018 debut through January 6 2021. The use of #digitalsoldiers gradually increased from May 2020 to January 2021 when Parler was temporarily deplatformed. Posts containing #digitalsoldiers echoed across Parler as reposts pushing the hashtag up the ranks of the top 200 most posted terms and often drawing engagement from tens of thousands of Parler users each time.

Corporate filings and other records show however that Flynn began flirting much earlier than 2019 with the idea of mobilizing what he called an “army of digital soldiers” to rally conservatives behind Trump and mount a far-right political coup.

As far back as the fall of 2017 Flynn and his surrogates began probing the possibility of deploying a viral online information operation that would tap into the minds of millions of social media users.

As far back as the fall of 2017 public documents internet registry records and media interviews show Flynn and his surrogates began probing the possibility of deploying a viral online information operation that would tap into the minds of millions of social media users. Flynn first registered one of the central companies in his online business empire just two months after he resigned under cloud from the Trump administration in 2017. (All but one of the sites connected to Flynn’s network of online enterprises founded between 2017 and 2019 are now defunct.)

The story of Flynn’s attempt to capitalize on the “army of digital soldiers” he conjured to support Trump has not been publicly told until now. That may be partly because the cast of characters companies and websites behind Flynn’s lurching quest to profit from his insider status within the military and the highest echelons of Washington’s national security establishment is so sprawling that it seems nearly impenetrable.

Raising an Army of “Digital Soldiers”

Flynn articulated his vision of leveraging digital media to mount a political insurgency at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. on Veteran’s Day weekend five years ago.

In November 2016 less than a week after Trump had been elected president Flynn spoke at an event hosted by the Young America’s Foundation. A co-founding organizer of the right-wing flagship Conservative Political Action Conference the YAF has kickstarted the political careers of dozens of well-known Republican Party personalities including nativist former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. The anticipation among the high school- and college-aged conservatives in the packed hotel conference room was palpable as Flynn bounded up to a speaker’s podium at the front of the room.

Buoyant and glowing with the excitement of the moment Flynn declared that the sheer force of a digital “insurgency” had helped Trump win the presidency. The online campaign that Flynn had helped Trump wage was nothing short of a total break with the politics of the past he said. “This was not an election” Flynn told the audience of young conservatives “this was a revolution.” Trump Flynn declared had been elected by an “army of digital soldiers.”

That moment would cement Flynn’s pivotal role in QAnon mythology. The video of his November 2016 speech and his role in defending Trump after his departure from the White House have since been referenced in countless QAnon posts transforming him into the victim-hero of a fantastical conspiratorial plot to save America from child traffickers liberals and the “deep state.”

The first Q drop didn’t appear online until October 2017 when an anonymous user on 4chan posted a curious message about the supposed secret war Trump was waging against a “liberal cabal” running covert child trafficking networks. The online movement grew partly in response to mainstream news coverage at the time of Mueller’s investigation into allegations that members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to swing the 2016 election in Trump’s favor.

Over time cryptic messages posted by “Q” who purports to hold a high-level security clearance gained a wider following as they migrated from 4chan to the 8chan then 8kun message boards and spilled across more mainstream platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. A December 2020 NPR/Ipsos poll found that 17 percent of Americans surveyed subscribe to idea that a “group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media.”

A primary strand of QAnon’s ur-narrative is that the person behind thousands of Q drops is a high-ranking military or intelligence official who sees it as their patriotic duty to serve as a backchannel between Trump and his loyal constituents. Flynn features prominently in many Q drops. References to “the oath” became popular after “Q” urged followers to “take the oath and serve your country” on June 24 2020 and become “digital soldiers.” After #TaketheOath began to ricochet across QAnon communities on multiple platforms Flynn’s posts garnered thousands of comments a separate analysis by New America and ASU researchers found. A video of Flynn’s oath last July received 100000 likes when Flynn posted it on Twitter.

Previously unreported events following Flynn’s November 2016 “digital soldiers” speech raise questions about his role in the origins of the QAnon movement. Days after he spoke to YAF when his name was being floated for a high-level job in the Trump administration a website called resilientpatriot.com was created according to internet registry files. While Flynn’s name does not appear in domain name records for that site the registry records for another Flynn-linked website list mflynnjr@resilientpatriot.com as the registrant email; Flynn’s son Michael Flynn Jr. also used the name Resilient Patriot on Twitter.

If the elder Flynn played a role in creating resilientpatriot.com in November 2016 it would have been an unusual move for a potential presidential appointee. Many White House officials go to great lengths to avoid extra scrutiny of their business and personal affairs and it is common practice in Washington for nominees to scrub their social media accounts and reduce their digital footprints.

Flynn was named national security adviser but held the job for less than a month before he was accused of lying to Vice President Mike Pence and the FBI about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador during the transition period. He resigned in February 2017. Two months later in April Virginia public records indicate that the state issued a receipt to Flynn for the creation of a company called Resilient Patriot LLC; Flynn’s LinkedIn page lists him as president of a company of that name. At the time a contrite Flynn had offered to testify before Congress on what he knew about Russian interference in the 2016 election in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

That summer Flynn’s sister Barbara Redgate and brother Joseph Flynn started a fundraising campaign to help pay Flynn’s legal bills. Web archives indicate that resilientpatriot.com had lain dormant for a time but at some point after Flynn’s family launched the legal defense fund Flynn’s resilientpatriot.com site was repurposed according to website registry records. Starting in May 2019 resilientpatriot.com began redirecting visitors to mikeflynndefensefund.org according to internet archives.

Initially the fund garnered donations from thousands of supporters Flynn’s brother told the press. By Joseph Flynn’s reckoning however mounting legal fees appeared to be outpacing donations.

Flynn and his family reportedly determined that one way to make a dent in the bills would be to sell Flynn’s three-bedroom house in the leafy suburb of Alexandria Virginia. In December 2017 Washingtonian magazine featured splashy photographs of the home’s interior saying that Flynn had bought it for about $774000 and that he planned to sell it to pay off his mounting legal costs. A few months later Flynn’s brother told ABC News that the retired Army general had listed his home at $895000. (The house later sold for slightly less than that.)

Flynn remained in serious financial trouble in the spring of 2019. After pleading guilty in the Mueller investigation and enduring a bruising inquiry into his company the Flynn Intel Group for allegedly failing to report connections to the Turkish government the disgraced general was reportedly staring down an estimated $4.6 million in unpaid legal bills.

That May as special counsel Robert Mueller announced that his expansive investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would soon end Flynn took his first tentative steps toward launching a new fundraising vehicle seeking to register “Digital Soldiers” under his name with the trademark division of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. He abandoned the registration of those words alone in May 2021 but applied to trademark “Digital Soldiers” when used in tandem with his distinctive red white and blue three bars and three stars logo — a nod to his rank as a retired three-star Army general.

The trademark registration shows that Flynn seeks to hold exclusive rights to prevent anyone from selling similarly marked goods. Perhaps more than any other detail it documents his desire to sell to QAnon adherents; wherever his logo with “Digital Soldiers” is used on anything from T-shirts to swimsuits to mugs and tote bags he wants to benefit financially.

The trademark documents Flynn’s financial connection to the QAnon movement; wherever his logo with the words “Digital Soldiers” is used he wants to benefit.

That August digitalsoldiers.us was created according to internet archive and domain registry records. The listed registrant for that site is mflynnjr@resilientpatriot.com. Another site advertising a fundraising event for Flynn — digitalsoldiersconference.com — was registered on August 9 2019. The conference website’s landing page includes an image of an American flag with the stars arranged in a large “Q” beneath the words “The battle is joined. Victory will be ours.” Scheduled for September 14 2019 at an upscale mall in Atlanta the Digital Soldiers Conference was the most visible sign yet that Flynn had yoked his personal brand and fundraising efforts to QAnon’s radical ideology.

“America” the website for the Digital Soldiers Conference declared “is on the verge of a digital civil war” and “Flynn is a true American hero fighting the Deep State who put everything on the line for God and Country.”

The site announced that Flynn would be a keynote speaker alongside former Trump campaign adviser and fellow Mueller casualty George Papadopoulos and other MAGA influencers. The website advertised $99 general admission tickets for the conference while a “VIP All Day” pass cost $500. Those interested in a sit-down dinner with Flynn and front-row access to speeches could buy the “Ultra VIP” ticket package for $2500. The “majority of proceeds from the Digital Soldiers Conference will go to benefit The Mike Flynn Defense Fund” the conference website promised.

“To be an outspoken conservative now on social media is to be a pariah. If you’re a patriot and love your country you’ve been called Nazi Fascist and White Supremacist” the site crowed. “Republicans may control the White House and Senate but these cubicle cowboys control the Media Universities Hollywood and Silicon Valley.”

Flynn’s lawyer Powell even filed a petition a month in advance to secure permission for him to travel outside his home state to attend the conference despite a pending review of his legal appeal in a D.C. court. But Flynn apparently pulled out after Mother Jones reported on the event’s connection to QAnon.

By October 2019 Flynn’s “digital soldiers” websites were joined by a real-world company: Digital Soldiers Media LLC. Florida public records list Flynn his brother Joseph and his son Michael Flynn Jr. as managers of the company and show an address in the tony retiree suburb of Englewood Florida where Flynn recently bought a home.

Right-Wing “Citizen Journalism”

Part of the Digital Soldiers business plan appears to have been to sell T-shirts and hoodies bearing Flynn’s name and logo. The T-shirt sale model parallels another Flynn-backed website called “The Shirt Show USA” which also aims to capitalize on Flynn’s hero status among QAnon followers.

But the sale of “WWG1WGA” T-shirts featuring Flynn’s name at $32 apiece was a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds of dollars supporters were asked to cough up in a pay-to-publish scheme first advertised on a website linked to Flynn through his Digital Soldiers brand.

“We have an army of digital soldiers: citizen journalists” an archived version of the digitalsoldiers.us site’s landing page declares borrowing directly from Flynn’s 2016 speech. It goes on to note that digital soldiers “from all over the world have stepped up to fill the void where real journalism once stood.”

“Soon” the site promised “you will be able to submit your story to the Digital Soldiers website where in partnership with UncoverDC.com it will be vetted edited and shared with our network of thousands of fellow Digital Soldiers.” The digital trails leading from Flynn’s digitalsoldiers.us to UncoverDC surfaced in the analysis of data collected from Parler social media accounts by the New America and ASU team.

UncoverDC.com was created on May 31 2019 according to internet registry records; soon after a company called UncoverDC LLC was registered in South Carolina according to public records. Run by online influencer Tracy Beanz the site taps into the “alt-tech” movement that sprang up after major social media companies began taking a more aggressive approach to content moderation in the wake of deadly clashes between protesters at the 2017 “United the Right” rally in Charlottesville Virginia. Like many alt-tech sites that seek to monetize access to specially curated content generated by far-right influencers UncoverDC offers paid membership options.

Flynn has long professed a fascination with journalism. He has likened reporting to intelligence gathering in his public writings about spycraft and in interviews on lessons learned about how intelligence operations could better support counterinsurgency campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In those war zones Flynn advocated the use of open-source intelligence centers to enhance counterinsurgency campaigns and augment the ability of fusion centers to gauge potential emerging threats and target insurgents. He also launched the architecture for military officials and diplomatic and humanitarian aid advisers in Afghanistan to share information about sociocultural dynamics that could influence everything from the price of rice to how Afghans might vote in an upcoming election.

Chock full of conspiracy theory-laden stories on topics ranging from the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccines to local and federal elections UncoverDC offers a glimpse at a rapidly evolving business model that is increasingly favored by many far-right influencers QAnon devotees and Trump insiders like Flynn. Many of the website’s listed staff are right-wing alt-tech influencers. Several are one-time micro-influencers and citizen celebrities whose substantial social media following earned them recognition and ad revenues on mainstream platforms like YouTube but who after falling afoul of content moderation rules on mainstream platforms migrated to more fringe platforms like BitChute Gab and Parler.

From Dark to Light

Beanz is listed as UncoverDC’s editor-in-chief and an archived version of digitalsoldiers.us states that that site is a “project of General Flynn and UncoverDC” linking the sites via a trail of digital breadcrumbs. One of several conservative micro-influencers who have ridden the QAnon wave Beanz is a central player in Flynn’s growing online profile. A bio on UncoverDC indicates that she worked on Ron Paul’s 2012 presidential campaign and Trump’s in 2016.

Beanz also hosts a podcast called “From Dark to Light” and touts her credentials as an “investigative journalist.” The podcast features talk show-style banter and interviews with well-known far-right figures including one with Flynn himself. A recent episode released in April featured Ekim Alptekin a Turkish businessman who paid Flynn’s firm for research and lobbying work related to Fethullah Gülen a well-known Turkish opposition figure.

Beanz whose given name is Tracy Diaz was a featured speaker at the “March for Trump” rally in Washington in November 2020. A month later she appeared alongside Flynn at a Women for America First rally that promoted Trump’s false claims of election rigging. She recently won a leadership position in the Horry County Republican Party in South Carolina; in a video posted on her YouTube channel Flynn helped her celebrate the victory at an outdoor rally in late April.

Another video on Beanz’s YouTube channel titled “We are the Storm” includes montages of the Capitol building against the backdrop of a storm darkened sky interspersed with video clips of Trump and photos of Democratic politicians like Rep. Adam Schiff Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The video includes a hypnotic soundtrack similar in style to those accompanying QAnon videos and ends with a clip of Trump tracing an imaginary figure in the air and referencing “the calm before the storm” an iconic image that plays a central role in the QAnon mythos.

In response to an email requesting comment for this story Beanz invited an Intercept reporter to join her on her podcast. Beanz also noted that she has “litigation in process against several other outlets that have falsely accused me of being part of some larger QAnon conspiracy and I am hesitant to take part in any interviews that may be edited or taken out of context.” Beanz did not respond to a follow-up email.

UncoverDC combines characteristics of a vanity publishing scheme with those of a political fundraiser.

UncoverDC combines characteristics of a vanity publishing scheme with those of a political fundraiser. A chance to engage directly with Beanz gets pride of place on the site’s “Support” page. For $125 a month users who sign up for the “Say So” editor’s tier can get their investigative contributions published on the site. Those seeking more tailored access or a private audience with Beanz can sign up for the “Luminary Tier” where a $2000 donation will also secure access to a group chat. For an even more intimate experience Luminary Tier members can pay $3000 to have Beanz “convince a doubter on a hot topic” or $6000 for a chance to see their name on the site’s “FOUNDERS page.” Donations of any denomination can also be made via PayPal.

Several of Flynn’s lengthy statements appear prominently on the site in blogposts under his name including a statement posted in February about the elections and a call to join Jericho March a far-right Christian nationalist group that counts Oath Keepers militia chief Stewart Rhodes and Flynn as among its most prominent members.

Despite the digital dots connecting Flynn’s constellation of websites there is no express mention of him on the UncoverDC masthead. But in addition to Flynn’s having authored several posts on the site Beanz and others cover his legal travails and political activities closely. After Trump pardoned Flynn in November the site’s coverage of Flynn’s activities intensified leading up to and immediately after the Capitol siege on January 6.

Rallying the Digital Troops

It is on Parler and across the digital annals of Flynn’s websites and business enterprises that flashes of the violent future of American politics become clearest.

Flynn apparently joined Parler under the handle @GenFlynn in mid-July 2019 but did not post from the account until September when he announced that he was “coming in for a landing! And a soft one too!!!” He only posted a few comments using that handle the rest of that year but the tempo picked up considerably after June 23 2020 when a single line — “Digital Soldiers are on the move (get ready!)” — appeared under his name.

Flynn’s next post appeared on Parler the same day that Twitter temporarily locked Flynn’s lawyer Powell out of her account and it may have been the first significant sign of the scale of Flynn’s plan to promote the “digital soldiers” cause on alt-tech platforms. “America’s Guardian Angel of American Justice @SidneyPowell1 twitter account has been suspended” Flynn wrote. “Trust me she will not be silenced nor should she be. Digital Soldiers must keep fighting.” The post garnered 9000 “echoes” Parler’s version of reposts; overall it garnered 16000 upvotes the equivalent of “likes” on Facebook or Twitter.

The New America-ASU review of Parler data indicates that QAnon-themed hashtags including Flynn’s #digitalsoldiers are among the site’s most popular. Posts including #digitalsoldiers appear to have generated more traffic on days when Flynn Trump or both headlined the news cycle such as when the video of Flynn and his family reciting the oath and the well-known phrase associated with QAnon “Where We Go One We Go All” was posted online last July and shortly after Flynn and Powell were banned by Twitter.

The review also found that several Parler accounts that behaved like automated bots amplified Flynn’s QAnon-related posts on the platform at a rate of thousands per hour. For example on at least six occasions Parler user @Reeseysnotsorry averaged more than one post or comment per minute and on many occasions averaged more than one post or comment every two minutes for a total of more than 17000 posts and comments.

While ASU researchers emphasized that it can be difficult to establish when and whether social media posts are amplified by bots as opposed to a group of people who farm out a single account to many users the push to amplify Flynn’s #digitalsoldiers on Parler dovetailed neatly with key political events during the 2020 presidential election campaign such as Election Day and Flynn’s appearance at a post-election rally in Washington D.C. in December that devolved into violent clashes between Proud Boys and counterprotesters. Thousands of mentions of related terms including #digitalarmy and #digitalwarriors received tens of thousands of engagements on Parler many peaking at key milestones in the timeline from the days leading up to Election Day on November 3 2020 and after.

As returns from the 2020 presidential election began to roll in from around the country it became apparent that the race would be close. When the results tipped toward Joe Biden Trump and his allies made it clear they would contest them.

On December 1 Powell who had represented Flynn when he sought to reverse his guilty plea registered the Texas corporation “Defending the Republic Inc.” Flynn and his brother Joseph were added in an amendment to Texas corporate registry records on December 12 the same day Flynn gave a rousing speech on the National Mall during the pro-Trump Million MAGA March.

Then on December 31 2020 — a little less than 24 hours after Republican Sen. Josh Hawley declared his intent to challenge the certification of the Electoral College results — Flynn posted a lengthy quote from George Washington calling for Americans to rally as an army:

My brave fellows you have done all I asked you to do and more than can be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake your wives your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay one month longer you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably can never do under any other circumstances.

Battling the “Deep State” Virtually

Flynn posted Washington’s rallying cry for a revolution 13 days after a White House meeting between Trump Flynn Powell former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne and others to discuss the election. It was at that White House meeting where Powell suggested that Trump should seize voting machines made by Dominion Voting Systems and where the group reportedly discussed Flynn’s notion that Trump should impose martial law and re-run the elections. In the days that followed Flynn took to Parler and Telegram a messaging app to urge his followers to protest the election outcome at the January 6 rally in Washington.

All the while during that crucial period in December 2020 when Trump and his supporters sought to overturn the election results Byrne Powell Flynn Flynn’s brother and other key Trump surrogates like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell were building the back-end architecture for a dark-money fueled political campaign.

On January 8 — just two days after hundreds of militia members and conservative Christians stormed the Capitol to try to derail the certification of Biden’s victory — Dominion Voting Systems filed a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit that named Texas-based Defending the Republic Inc. and Flynn’s lawyer Sidney Powell as defendants. Dominion sued Powell Lindell and Trump’s lawyer Rudolph Giuliani over baseless claims made by all three that Dominion voting machines and software were fraudulently rigged to eliminate or “flip” ballots cast for Trump to Biden.

Dominion’s lawsuit claims that Powell’s law firm defendingtherepublic.org and the Texas-based Defending the Republic Inc. are Powell’s “alter egos.” Visitors to Powell’s websites were invited to donate “but depending on the website or hyperlink the user follows they are directed to make checks payable to various entities” according to Dominion’s suit and archived versions of defendingtherepublic.org. An announcement about the launch of the Defending the Republic PAC also appears on sidneypowell.com.

Powell has countered that Dominion’s “alter ego” references improperly blur the line between the corporate entity and Powell as a person and that the claim is factually incorrect.

Web archives show Powell’s eponymous website has touted her work on Flynn’s federal legal case and linked to several other sites including dtrpac.com which redirects to defendingtherepublicpac.com a website launched soon after Election Day last November. An earlier version of defendingtherepublic.org stated that donations would be used to support lawsuits brought by Powell based on unsubstantiated claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election and directed visitors to several other sites including hereistheevidence.com a crowdsourcing site for reporting election “irregularity.”

“Millions of dollars must be raised to defend the Republic as these lawsuits continue to be filed to ensure victory” Powell stated on the Defending the Republic website in 2020. At the time there was no visible reference on the donations page to the Florida PAC which was added to the page in April 2021. The change to the website came one month after the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued a subpoena to GoDaddy requesting information about the owner of defendingtherepublic.org. Other than Sidney Powell there is also no mention on the site about any of the people listed as directors agents or managers of Texas-based Defending the Republic Inc. and it is unclear who benefits from donations made via defendingtherepublic.org.

On June 15 officials with the Florida commission which is also known as the FDACS lodged an administrative complaint against Powell’s Texas-based firm Defending the Republic Inc. saying that the website’s donation page “misrepresented” the Texas firm’s charitable status in Florida and its ability to accept donations. In a statement issued a few days later the FDACS described Defending the Republic Inc. as “legal fund involved in conspiracies related to the 2020 presidential election” and said that the department had found the firm had violated state law. “Defending The Republic has a choice to make – they can come into compliance with the law or face large fines and court orders” commissioner Nikki Fried said in the statement.

Lawyers for Dominion contend that Powell only registered the Texas for-profit firm after claiming during several media appearances that she had set up a website for a nonprofit organization to support a litigation campaign aimed at overturning the outcome of the 2020 election. Dominion’s lawyers contend that Powell began soliciting donations on her website in early January on the premise that Defending the Republic was a nonprofit organization although Defending the Republic PAC had not been officially registered as a nontaxable entity with the IRS at the time.

Flynn is not named in the suit but Dominion notes Powell’s tie to defendingtherepublic.org and to the Texas-based firm that in December 2020 filings listed Flynn and his brother as directors. The website named in the lawsuit defendingtherepublic.org is linked to the West Palm Beach address where the Florida-based PAC is registered. That is also the address listed for former Trump White House liaison Emily Newman who shows up in registry records for the Florida nonprofit.

The two Florida firms bearing the names “Defending the Republic Inc.” and “Defending the Republic PAC Inc.” were registered in Florida in February. Florida public records indicate that Newman Flynn’s brother and Lindell are registered as directors of the 501(c)(4) Defending the Republic Inc. The 501(c)(4) is no longer active.

On March 22 Powell filed a motion to dismiss Dominion’s defamation lawsuit against her claiming that “reasonable people” would not accept as fact spurious claims about election fraud that she’d made on the Defending the Republic website or in the press. In a declaration attached to Powell’s motion former Overstock.com CEO Byrne is listed as the chair and CEO of Defending the Republic. He now claims to have resigned.

Although Michael Flynn is also referenced several times in Powell’s legal brief no mention is made of his having been listed as a director in the Texas firm’s original filings. Nor is there any reference to Flynn’s brother Joseph or to Joseph’s connection to the Florida-based Defending the Republic Inc.

Lawyers for Dominion declined to comment on the case.

At the Memorial Day QAnon-themed conference in Dallas Powell repeated her false claims that the presidential vote was rigged.

Taking Over “the Idea of Information”

Dubbed the “For God and Country Patriot Roundup” the Dallas event sparked controversy after Flynn seemed to suggest that the military should mount a coup to reinstall Trump as president. He quickly backtracked but his comments in Dallas echoed his suggestion in December that military authority could be invoked to restore Trump to the White House. They are also entirely in keeping with Flynn’s repeated appeals to patriotism through posts on Parler and other platforms that venerate the military as a sort of Praetorian Guard of Trump’s presidency.

Flynn’s post for instance of George Washington’s Revolutionary War-era words calling for a citizen-led uprising were emblematic of the grand vision Flynn had spelled out in his calls for a virtual insurgency and they resonated in the far-right online market he has sought to corner. #digitalsoldiers has appeared most frequently alongside hashtags like #redpill #qarmy and #thegreatawakening according to at least one reliable aggregator of digital tags. In the days leading up to January 6 the hashtag became a clarion call to the far-right to mount an insurgency against Trump’s political detractors.

On his now-defunct website digitalsoldiers.us Flynn had equated the “army of digital soldiers” to citizen journalists. The wave that had elevated Trump was “an insurgency — irregular warfare at its finest in politics” Flynn declared in an excerpt from his 2016 post-election speech to the Young America’s Foundation posted on the site. “The journalists we have in our media did a disservice to themselves. More than that they did a disservice to our country. So the American people decided to take over the idea of information. They took over the idea and they did it through social media.”

QAnon-themed right-wing sites similar to those promoted by Flynn appeared to gain more prominence as Trump’s false rhetoric about the election began to build during the course of the 2020 campaign. A search of historical domain registration information shows that digitalarmy.com was registered on GoDaddy in November 2020. A company called Digital Army LLC is registered in Nevada under the name of Sean Schoepflin and an entity called For God and Country Trust according to records.

It is not known whether Flynn’s digital soldiers websites relate to digitalarmy.com. The sites employ similar tactics to engage users to sign up as “citizen journalists” but the architects of digitalarmy.com apparently had bigger ambitions. On October 30 2020 announcements of the coming launch of a “censorship free platform for truth-seekers” appeared on a local broadcast news channel in Youngstown Ohio. The announcements were picked up by radio and television news outlets in rural areas from Ohio to Nebraska.

The term “digital soldiers” was repeated again and again in connection with the broadcast media push and online rollout of digitalarmy.com. “Monetization will occur after elections via brands that are built and funded by digital soldiers” a statement from digitalarmy.com proclaimed. “These digital soldiers will be given ownership of the developed brands and supported by the Digital Army worldwide.” Curiously both the digitalarmy.com statement and the newswire press release that was pushed out across the country made oblique references to QAnon stating that “Digital Army has spent the last three years working alongside the ‘Great Awakening’ to develop a foundation for change.” The “Great Awakening” is part of the foundational Q myth about the coming revolutionary rise of the right against the “deep state.”

Most of the online enterprises Flynn was linked to between 2017 and 2019 are no longer active. The lone survivor the “citizen journalism” site UncoverDC.com shares a curious feature with digitalsoldiers.us.

Both sites were registered by Anonymize Inc. a subsidiary of Epik.com a Washington state web hosting firm popular with far-right extremist groups. Epik was best known in 2019 for doing business with the 8chan message board that gave life to #Pizzagate and sparked white supremacist attacks in Christchurch New Zealand and Hanau a suburb of Frankfurt Germany.

Additionally Epik has hosted BitChute and Gab two far-right social media platforms cited by civil rights advocates for hosting content posted by Atomwaffen Division a neo-Nazi group. Epik also briefly hosted Parler on its servers after Amazon booted the platform following the violent siege at the Capitol.

How much Flynn knew about Epik’s willingness to do business with white supremacists is anyone’s guess but the company’s profile as a safe haven for right-wing extremism was well established when both digitalsoldiers.us and UncoverDC.com were set up in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMjcvbWlhdGEtc2NpLWZpLWRpZ2l0YWwtZGFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miata Sci-Fi Digital Dash,"One of the hardest but sometimes best things you can do for a project is to walk away. [Jroobi] had spent hundreds of hours crafting the digital dash for his MX5 Miata (video embedded below) and after spending far too long chasing down I2C bugs he made the difficult decision to step away for a while. However as of May 2021 [Jroobi] returned to the project and found a power supply was under-specified and was causing brownouts that resulted in crashes.

All in all it’s an incredible work of engineering. Everything from the massive codebase that describes all the different states to the tasteful graphic design is masterfully done. The Star-Trek-inspired theme and attention to detail really show in the different modes on the tachometer. The dynamic soft RPM limit based on engine temperature is particularly ingenious.

Under the hood of this custom dash are two Ardunios running the show. The center media console offers more controls with a generous touch screen while the instrument cluster shows most of the data. They talk over I2C to each other and communicate with other parts in the car such as the RGB cabin lighting and the TEIN electronic suspension dampeners. Fuel and temperature levels come in as voltage levels which can be read via an ADC. The gear position is calculated based on RPMs and speed given the wheel size and the transmission in the vehicle.

It is a phenomenal labor of love and if you’re inspired to further upgrade your Miata you might want to see how to put carbs on the engine or RGB light rings in the instruments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHA6Ly93d3cubXVsdGl2ZXJzaXR5Y29taWNzLmNvbS90di9ldmFuZ2VsaW9uLTA1LTA2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five Thoughts on Neon Genesis Evangelion's “Rei Beyond the Heart” and “Showdown in Tokyo-3”,"ELEVEN

The animation in Neon Genesis Evangelion is nothing if not ambitious. From the show’s first moments from the very opening credits it’s clear Hideaki Anno and his team at Gainax wanted to push the boundaries and capabilities of traditional television cel animation. We see it in how they block the scenes in how they layer the frame with numerous moving elements and in how they use the process’s limitations and restrictions to generate tension and energy.

Evangelion was created at the end of an era when the primary form of animation production was still done on paper with ink and paint and cellulose acetate. Digital drawing methods had just stared to appear on a larger scale and advancements in that technology surged forward at sonic boom speeds. Toy Story the first feature film to be entirely animated in 3D premiered the same year as Eva. The French production house Studio Fantome broadcast Insketors in 1994 a television series animated with computers and looking like it just jumped off of a PlayStation console. The propaganda cartoon VeggieTales released shortly afterward also experimented with various software packages and became part of the genesis of this method.

Beyond the initial wave of 3D animated projects many traditionally animated titles had begin exploring digital tools in their productions. Eva flirted with 3D imaging notably in the massive display readout at NERV HQ. By this point for instance Disney had transitioned to using the Computer Animated Production System or CAPS program developed by Pixar where instead of laying out individual cels animators scanned their drawings directly into the computer and proceeded to ink and paint and finally composite everything virtually. The last movie Disney released with handprinted colors and India ink lines had been The Little Mermaid. One of the final feature films to be physically painted altogether was Princess Mononoke.

(All of this of course is film and television related. Video game studios had always worked digitally and some of their first three-dimensional images were created as far back at the 1970s. By the mid-’90s Link and Mario and Sonic ran around 3D environments.)

It took much longer for digital compositing and coloring to spread throughout TV animation — Spongebob Squarepants and The Simpsons continued to use these methods long past the time most other shows transitioned to CAPS-like programs — especially Japanese animation. Which gives a lot of ’90s anime in my opinion the best age of anime this distinct timeless and tactile feeling.

At this point in the production Evangelion was flush with cash or at least with as much cash as the show ever saw. Budges and production issues reared up in later episodes forcing the animators to come up with more creative and abstract ways to tell the story. Gainax would also eventually become so overwhelmed in production turmoil the animation was outsourced to another studio with maybe only three Gainax staff members working on any given episode. But at this moment at the time of “Rei Beyond the Heart” and “Showdown in Tokyo-3” the studio felt free to experiment and go wild.

And it’s glorious.

TWELVE

Cel animation is a time intensive and expensive process. It’s also one of the most efficient ways to create traditional 2D animation. For over 70 years most of the technological developments in animation and by extension filmmaking in general were made to help make this process less arduous.

In the early days of film animation artists would have to draw out every element in the frame. Windsor McCay’s office was stacked with the drawings for “Gertie the Dinosaur” where he drew every stone every mountain face and every tree on each new frame. He believed it gave his cartoons more life. Most of the time however in the wider industry this meant shots consisted of sparse backgrounds. When the assembly line animations started animators would use celluloid to draw the backdrops then layer the characters over those using rice paper.

In 1915 Earl Hurd and John Bray basically got the idea to flip those around with the characters and malleable objects now slated for the transparent sheets and the background often painted. It broke down so the animators drew out a scene or an action on paper which was then sent to the Ink and Paint Department. The teams here traced the images onto the transparent sheets of cellulose acetate with India ink before sending them to the color department who added color by painting the backside of the sheets in acrylics. When this was completed the transparent sheets would be stacked on top of each other and then photographed. One frame at a time. For Pinocchio Disney created the multiplane camera this hulking machine that needed something like a cathedral to be housed. Here the frames were set on enormous layers and the photographer after he climbed a ladder to set the picture in place slowly moved each element to manipulate the character background and camera movement.

Continued below

Cel frame animators soon discovered shortcuts. They found they didn’t always need to draw one figure for every frame but rather could manipulate one element of the drawing. If a person was speaking they created an overlay where only their mouth moved or their eyes blinked. Sometimes they might raise and arm and point. They also discovered that having 24 individual drawings per second made for an impossible workflow and they animated instead on twos where each picture was photographed twice at 12 frames per second. Smaller productions used even less drawings per second veering toward six or eight frames per second. And then to save on costs the studios cleared off the transparencies and used them again once they had been photographed. It’s that chemical they used to kill the toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

This limited animation made TV cartoons possible especially Japanese animated cartoons. And those restrictions only added to their charms.

THIRTEEN

Anime is made up of a lot of cheats. In Speed Racer cars shifted back and forth laterally. In Space Battleship Yamato the star cruisers rose and fell through the cosmos in rigid straight lines. Often the camera pans over a still image with sound effects added in the background to imply the liveliness of a scene. Long dialogue sequences are intercut with seemingly random glimpses of the environment. Characters shift straight into frame with exaggerated expressions and wild background images.

These shortcuts appeared throughout cartoons well into the ’90s. Consider how Sailor Moon never flows into a new expression but rather shifts between expressions. Or how Spike Spiegel is hidden by his hair when he speaks. Or how in so many of these shows the characters’ lips never form sounds but kind of jerk up and down.

This is because cel animation is an inherently imperfect method. When animators lay too many images over each other the bottommost layer which receives the least amount of light appears fuzzy on camera. The shortcuts sometimes create glaring and rigid and stiff actions. Smudges might appear within the frame. Despite the assured hands and practiced movements there are invariably variations in the line. The camera itself can only offer a limited range of motion. Paint quirks might appear for a fraction of a second. And if one element is off by a fraction of an inch the whole thing looks wonky.

Also because these are handdrawn different animation directors take their own approach to model sheets. Shinji looks similar between episodes but sometimes he might be somewhat chonkier. Or Rei Ayemani’s body may be drawn in with a more lustful intention here and then a pitying sadness there.

On paper this might sound like a fundamental disadvantage a crippling and damning set of shortcomings but even the cheapest most rapidly produced traditional animation holds up stronger than 3D animation from five years ago.

FOURTEEN

With the advent of digital animation technologies animation production has become cheaper quicker and simpler. As computers’ rendering ability has become more powerful from the lighting to the texture emulations the line between animation and live action has blurred. Huge franchise movies are basically animated films not unlike Roger Rabbit or Mary Poppins where physical actors are inserted into a digital environment. Films and series that market themselves as animated stray close to realistic environments. There are moments in Raya and the Last Dragon that look like the production team took a crew to Southeast Asia for background plates.

Not only that but digital tools have made it easier for anyone to make an animated cartoon. Small teams can create great looking productions. More creators are able to have a seat at the table. ToonBoom Animate Blender FlipaClip this proliferation of available animation softwares at various price points make cartooning accessible to everyone with looks that resemble traditional animation or the current trend for more rounded characters.

In Japan there’s still a desire for a traditional look even if they’re using digital tools. Same goes for a lot of television animation. It’s because the sets can be more elaborate the camera can move on an theoretical and therefore infinite axis the characters don’t always have to stand still and the frame can be loaded to the point of breaking. These cartoons can be produced economically but not sacrifice anything in the motion or fluidity of the sequence.

Continued below

Yet there’s something missing in all these productions something that can only be accomplished by using physical materials. That’s the weight in the image. The tacitle nature in the drawing. Every pencil stroke is visible. Every movement planned out. When you look at a traditionally animated cartoon there’s a part in the back of your head that knows this was made by people made painstakingly by people. It has life. It has a soul. At any moment it might go totally out of control.

It’s tangible. It’s textured. It feels authentic because it’s so imperfect.

FIFTEEN

It’s here Evangelion shines. Like other anime of the era — Escaflowne Sailor Moon Cowboy Bebop Berserk (the good one) Revolutionary Girl Utena — it captures the audience’s imagination which takes it further than the endless code we see otherwise.

Take a look at the scene in “Rei beyond the Heart” when the Angel Ramiel unleashes it’s attack. The beat bursts through a nearby building melting the structure before it crashes into Unit-01.

The final showdown with Unit-00 and Unit-01 is an abstract swipe of light and colors. The impact of the beam the failure of the first shot the countdown tension feels so much more intense because of it. Anno and his animators cut between the gun cocking the NERV control room on edge Shinji in Unit-01 and the incoming drill from Ramiel and it’s so quick the movements so considered that you’re waiting for release until the very last moment. It’s a scene one among many that works because of the traditional methods.

Though I suppose you could argue it’s impossible to know that how the animators would approach the scene with digital tools instead of physical ones and how a sequence like Ramiel would play out with 3D animation.

Except we can!

In 2007 Hideaki Anno and Studio Khara launched the Rebuild of Evangelion series with Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone. A reimagining alternate take on the original cartoon series. The Rebuilds are movies with the first couple borrowing more from the series before finally veering off into their own territory by the third and fourth installments. These films were animated digitally.

Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone ends with the Ramiel attack. Whereas in the series each movement each beat felt calculated and precise used the limitations of its budget and its resources to generate tension the film goes for more visual flourishes. The camera sweeps across Unit-01 zipping in and out of the cockpit while Shinji disintegrates. Ramiel now with a reflective surface splits apart into eldritch geometric shapes and fires its laser blast from a clear source at its core. It’s louder bigger and more elaborate but I don’t think it’s anywhere near as intense or effective. In the film version there’s so much going on the battle becomes a confused mess of colors and cuts. The animators were able to do anything so they decided to try for everything. You can see Ramiel’s power but I don’t think you can feel it.

Cel animation is impractical and laborious. It’s unlikely we’ll ever see the return of it on a large scale. Even shows animated on paper Adventure Time Steven Universe WolfWalkers end up composited within the computer. Yet as Eva continually demonstrates episode after episode the care the thought the precision pay off into these heavy experiences. It can carry that weight because it has that weight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3R2L3VzdHYvYTM2ODU2MzQ5L3RoZS1ib3lzLWFudG9ueS1zdGFyci1zZWFzb24tMy1mYW5zLWZyZWFrLW91dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"The Boys star says season 3 will make fans ""freak out""","The Boys season 3 sounds like it's shaping up to be an exciting one with all the recent updates and new cast announcements.

You can watch YouTube browse the internet and even play music. The Echo Show is a home assistant device with a screen. This means you can see the weather get recipes and even play music.

Unlike other Echo devices the Show offers more functionality and features. So it’s only natural to wonder whether you can download applications onto your Echo Show. In this article we’ll teach you all about Alexa apps also known as skills so you can make the most out of your Echo device.

What Are Alexa Skills?

Alexa’s “skills” are essentially third-party apps that you can install so the device can obey new commands. These commands can be anything from reading (or watching) daily news reports playing games displaying cooking recipes and a wide range of other interesting features. Currently there are over 100000 Alexa skills and more are appearing every day.

Pre-Loaded Skills

The Echo Show has a bunch of pre-installed skills that enhance the user experience. For example you can watch any YouTube video by saying: “Alexa play (desired video) on YouTube.” If you want to see the weather forecast for the day or the following month just say: “Alexa show me today’s (or this week’s/month’s) weather.”

Paid Subscriptions

There are various built-in skills that require a subscription to work. For example if you’re subscribed to Amazon Music you can play over 2 million songs with displayed information about the artist and even the lyrics. Similarly if you’re subscribed to Amazon Video you can look for any movie or TV show by saying the name of the titles actors genres and plenty of other keywords.

How to Set Up Skills?

The Alexa platform is similar to iOS and Android. Unlike some home assistants that come with an integrated set of apps that you can’t change most of Alexa’s skills require additional set up. This allows you to personalize your Echo Show device by choosing skills according to your needs and preferences.

You can set up new skills in two different ways. The first way is by saying: “Alexa enable (skill name) skill.” However this method requires you to know which skill you want to enable. Additionally skill availability depends on your location so you may not have access to them.

Another way to set up a skill is from the Alexa app. Of course this requires you to install the Alexa app on your smartphone before you proceed. You can download the app from the App Store (for iOS device) or Play Store (for Android). Then do the following:

Launch the Alex app on your phone. Tap the ‘menu’ icon (hamburger icon) at the lower right of the screen.

Choose ‘Skills & Games’ from the menu.

Find a skill that you want to use from the list or use the search bar to locate a particular one.

Tap the skill to open the skill description and menu. Tap ‘Enable skill.’



Keep in mind that you may need to launch some of the pre-installed skills before they’ll work.

How to Disable Skills?

If you want certain apps to disappear from Alexa’s skill set you can disable them from the skill’s menu. Just use the steps 1-5 from above to access the menu and find the skill that you want to disable. Then tap ‘Disable’ skill and Alexa will stop recognizing your commands.

You can customize other settings from the same skill menu. For example you can only toggle the notifications off instead of disabling the whole thing. Additionally you can manage parental permissions if you add kid skills to the device.

Some Useful Skills You Can Get

As the skill database grows over time it will get harder and harder to choose between certain skills. Some of the most popular skills will appear in your ‘Skills & Games’ menu and you can figure out their usefulness and quality by checking out their user ratings.

Here are some skills Echo Show users find convenient:

Uber: If you use Uber’s services and have an account it’s easy to arrange a ride via Echo Show. Enable the skill and say: “Alexa request a ride on Uber” and the app will appear on the display. From then on you can follow the instructions and use voice commands to finalize the arrangement. Allrecipes: This huge recipe database will help you in many ways. If you’re unsure what to cook you can ask Allrecipes to recommend a meal. Have only a few ingredients at home? You can find recipes based on that. Moreover the skill can send a list of necessary ingredients to your phone so you know what to look for in a supermarket and on top of that both your hands will be fully focused on the meal. You can read the instructions and ‘turn the pages’ by using only your voice. Audible: If you’re passionate about books you can purchase a book via Audible and then let Echo Show display and read the book in the background. This way you can do your business around the home while getting your daily piece of literature.

Of course there are various niche apps such as Web Analytics for those who monitor their traffic Tweet Reader that reads your twitter timeline CryptoCoin that tracks and notifies you about the value of BitCoin and an abundance of other apps.

Frequently Asked Questions

Here is some more information you may want to know about the Echo Show Skills.

What do I do if my skill isn’t working?

Skills like most apps can have problems and glitches. If for some reason a skill isn’t acting properly it’s best to disable and enable it again first. This usually fixes most problems.

Of course you could also check other skills. Assuming all of your skills are having issues you may want to check your internet connection.

If the skill is brand new then there’s likely an issue with the Settings. Some skills require parental controls while others may need you to tap ‘Enable’ again. If it’s an issue with a subscription make sure that you’re signed into your account.

Make Echo Show Your Perfect Assistant

Currently Amazon Alexa is probably the best digital assistant. It’s compatible with an abundance of other devices and has various third-party connectivity options.

It has a version of third party-apps in ‘skills’ (something that neither Ciri nor Cortana have) that you can use to make Alexa a unique personal assistant. If you customize its skill set to fit your needs you can make your life much more convenient.

Late last year the U.S. Navy posed a question to six of its favorite military shipbuilders: Would it be possible to build a warship 200 to 400 feet long and displacing somewhere between 1000 and 8000 tons armed with multiple .50 caliber machine guns a 30 mm chain gun and a helicopter and capable of attacking a beachhead with a reinforced platoon of U.S. Marines -- all for under $130 million?

Oh and the warship would also need to go from concept to delivery of 30 complete vessels by the end of 2026.

Yes we can

America's shipbuilders responded with enthusiasm: Yes we can do that. But it turns out the companies responding to the Navy's invitation weren't ""the usual suspects"" -- defense contracting giants General Dynamics (GD 1.10%) Huntington Ingalls (HII 1.64%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.48%).

Instead as USNI News reported last week the five companies interested in building budget-priced Light Amphibious Warships (LAWs) for the Navy were largely private and foreign companies aiming to take a larger role in Pentagon defense contracting. Intriguingly these are exactly the kinds of companies that buyers might look forward to investing in one day through the IPO process.

Specifically the Navy has awarded ""concept design"" contracts to Italian defense company Fincantieri and to Australia's Austal (AUTLY) and also to private engineering firm TAI Engineers and private shipbuilders VT Halter Marine and Bollinger Shipyards.

But this was no fluke. In fact a Congressional Research Report noted that the specs described for the LAW were such as to permit ""any of several [smaller] U.S. shipyards"" to build it thus increasing competition for the contract and helping to keep prices down. This appears to be exactly what happened.

What it means for investors in the short term

How far prices might fall remains to be seen but just even the prospect of having the Navy buy 30 brand new warships for under $3.9 billion total is pretty astonishing. ($3.9 billion is roughly the cost of just one Zumwalt-class destroyer.)

On one hand it's a bargain price for the Navy. On the other hand $3.9 billion in Navy orders would be multiple times the annual revenue at a company like VT Halter for example which according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence probably did less than $1 billion in business last year; or even an established military contractor like Austal which did just $1.4 billion last year.

Granted in the near term the numbers we're talking about will be much smaller (but soon to grow). The five firms named above will share contract awards totaling less than $7.5 million for their concept work reports USNI. The Navy will consider these concepts and then award three additional contracts for ""preliminary designs"" in mid-2022. Toward late 2022 the Navy will pick one single winner for a ""design and construction"" contract.

It's at that point where we'll stop talking about ""millions"" of dollars in contract value -- and start talking about ""billions.""

What it means for investors in the long term

Winning $3 billion in Navy contracts would be a big deal for any of these companies. But there's an even bigger picture to consider here.

The enthusiasm with which smaller shipbuilders are bidding for the LAW work suggests that the Navy now has the ability to spread more of its shipbuilding work around among multiple ""new"" defense contractors. And this has the potential to reverse a decades-long trend of increasing consolidation in the defense industry which has diminished competition and supported strong profit margins among the larger defense companies.

For investors in such larger companies this is a risk that must be weighed. Will companies like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls be forced to cut profit margins to compete with their new rivals or will they lose business or will they simply buy out the competition?

In any scenario other than the last one there's opportunity for investors here. Bollinger in particular has explored the possibility of conducting an IPO in years past. VT Halter actually did IPO back in the 1990s before later being acquired and made a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Engineering in 2002.

With billions in new contracts pouring in from the Navy either of these companies could IPO again.

Gus Vratsinas of Little Rock chairman of the Arkansas Economic Development Foundation said Friday that the private nonprofit foundation's board on Thursday night approved a $54810 bonus for Preston recommended by Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

Preston performed well during the coronavirus pandemic in the past year Vratsinas said.

He said the Air Force's selection of Ebbing Air National Guard Base as the preferred facility to set up a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II training center for Foreign Military Sales participants and the new home for a Singaporean General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon training unit ""is huge.""

""Just that in itself I would say it was a great year.""

Vratsinas said he expects Preston will receive his check from the foundation early this week.

Asked about that bonus Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey R-Texarkana said Friday ""Personally I don't have any heartburn over it.""

""I'm OK with the bonus since it is not taxpayer funded and also as long as no special favors are being given due to this arrangement"" he said.

Vratsinas said the bonus is part of the compensation package agreed to in 2015 when Preston was hired. Hutchinson evaluates Preston's performance each year.

""Tell him that's it no different than the Razorback Foundation paying the football coaches"" Vratsinas said.

Preston also serves as secretary of the state Department of Commerce created in July 2019 under Hutchinson's consolidation of 42 executive branch state agencies into 15 departments.

The department includes the Economic Development Commission Development Finance Authority Bank Department Division of Workforce Services Insurance Department Securities Department Division of Aeronautics Wine Producers Council Waterways Commission and Office of Skills Development.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

In a letter dated June 11 to Vratsinas Hutchinson said he conducted Preston's annual performance evaluation and recommended awarding the ""full bonus"" of $54810.

Preston is eligible for a performance bonus of up to 30% of his total salary under a memorandum of understanding he has with the foundation. His salary for fiscal 2021 which ends Wednesday is $182700. The state pays $155295.09 of that according to the Arkansas Transparency website. The foundation pays the rest according to the governor's office.

Preston will receive a 2.8% increase in his state-paid salary to $159954 in fiscal 2022 said Shealyn Sowers a spokeswoman for the governor.

Hutchinson said in his letter to Vratsinas that the commission's accomplishments under Preston's leadership during a particularly difficult year included:

• Managing programs that disbursed $9 million in Quick Action Bridge Loans to 483 businesses resulting in the retention of 6610 jobs.

• $10 million in Community Development Block Grants to 27 rural hospitals resulting in the retention of 7800 jobs.

• $130 million in Ready for Business grants to 11409 businesses affecting 225000 employees.

• $7.8 million provided to developmental disability providers for paycheck protection resulting in the retention of 4000 employees.

""In a year when unemployment rates skyrocketed across the nation Arkansas reached an unemployment rate of 10.2% before dropping back down to 4.4% a full percentage point below the national average"" the governor wrote.

The commission also distributed $118 million in grants for broadband deployment resulting in 130000 Arkansans gaining access to broadband and spent $2 million in grant funding for the Arkansas Accelerator Program in the past year Hutchinson said.

Hutchinson said the commission in the past year signed 47 incentive agreements that yielded 2242 new jobs with a proposed average hourly wage of $20.87 and a capital investment of $830.9 million. These competitive projects represent new payroll of $97.3 million and yield a positive cost-benefit analysis on the tax dollars spent he said.

""Since 2015 the total number of competitive projects won is now over 524 bringing in more than $10.5 billion in new capital investment and more than 25000 new jobs.""

Hutchinson wrote ""I would also be remiss if I did not recognize Secretary Preston's extraordinary leadership in securing the new foreign F-35 and F-16 training mission at Ebbing Air National Guard base in Fort Smith (Ebbing).

""This was a highly competitive project that was bolstered by a commitment to extend the base's runway by more than 1000 feet"" he wrote.

""This major announcement will result in hundreds of jobs and more than $800 [million] in annual economic impact to the region"" the governor said. ""Secretary Preston and AEDC's Global Business and Military Affairs Team were instrumental in identifying incentives that ultimately led to Ebbing's selection.""

As with last year Hutchinson said he has worked closely with Preston.

""Throughout Secretary Preston's tenure I have been impressed with his professionalism determination focus energy and character"" wrote in his letter to Vratsinas. ""He has poured himself into Arkansas and has gone the extra mile every day to assure that our state is an economic engine for growth and increased opportunities for Arkansans.""

Before Preston started working at the development commission he spent 6½ years as vice president of government relations for Enterprise Florida the state's primary economic development organization.

LEGISLATIVE CRITICS

In April of this year Sen. Trent Garner R-El Dorado told senators that he had lost confidence in Preston and Preston should be replaced.

Garner urged senators to vote against the Department of Commerce's appropriation which required a three-fourths vote for approval. In its fourth try the Senate approved the appropriation. The House approved that appropriation on its second vote.

At that time Hutchinson said ""Mike Preston is one of the most successful economic developers in the nation and Arkansas is fortunate to have him at the helm of the Department of Commerce.""

Garner's call to replace Preston was made after Garner's bill that would have barred the development commission from having an office in China failed to clear a House committee.

In the 2020 fiscal session the Joint Budget Committee rejected Garner's proposal to close the office after Preston said the department already planned to trim the office's budget from $285000 to $125000 a year starting in July 2020 and employ an American citizen as a liaison in China.

In February Rep. Fran Cavenaugh R-Walnut Ridge attempted to stop the foundation from paying additional salary to Preston.

She failed to get a motion in a House committee for her bill.

Cavenaugh said her bill would bar a Cabinet-level secretary from taking funding for a salary from an outside source for performing the secretary's duties.

Special language in the Commerce Department appropriation allows the foundation to use private funds to provide extra pay to the development commission's executive director while special language in the Department of Education appropriation bars the education commissioner from accepting any additional salary from any other source ""so there is a double standard"" she said.

State officials have said that numerous states particularly in the South maintain employment contracts with state employment directors that include additional private funds in the director's overall salary.

In the 2005 session the Legislature gave then-Education Commissioner Ken James a raise in his state pay from $122295 to $204620 and banned him from receiving outside income. When James was hired in 2004 a private group the State Board of Higher Education Foundation agreed to provide him $81000 a year. James also made $122295 from the state so his total salary amounted to $203295.

The salary for the state's current education commissioner and education secretary Johnny Key is $239361.20 according to the Arkansas Transparency website.

According to that website the highest-paid executive branch department leader is Human Services Secretary Cindy Gillespie whose salary is $287042.06. Health Secretary Jose Romero's salary is $273779.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvZi0xNi1maWdodGluZy1mYWxjb24td2lsbC1zb29uLWJlLWZpZ2h0aW5nLWl0cy1saWZlLTE4ODY4NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The F-16 Fighting Falcon Will Soon Be Fighting for Its Life,"Here's What You Need to Remember: If the agile little fighter has any shortcomings it’s that the American F-16’s radar has fallen out of date and that the type was never designed to carry a great deal of fuel limiting its combat radius to just 340 miles on internal stores.

The F-16 Fighting Falcon bears an unusual distinctions: it is one of the only top jet fighters in the world to also be cost efficient. Fast and extremely agile the light fighter does have some shortcomings in range and payload compared to larger twin-engine fighters like the F-15 Eagle but that was easy to forgive due to costing less than half as much—around $18 million in 1999 ($27 million in 2017 dollars). This favorable bang-for-buck ratio has not been lost on air forces across the world—the F-16 currently remains the most popular aircraft in modern military service: out of 4500 produced nearly 2700 currently remain in service in around twenty-six countries. Needless to say the cutting-edge fourth-generation fighter of the 1980s will remain with us for a good while longer.

The F-16 was born out of the conundrum experienced by the Air Force in the Vietnam War. Fast and heavy F-4 Phantom fighters had underperformed against the North Vietnamese Air Force due to their immature long-range missile technology and lack of aptitude for tight maneuvering in dogfights. This led a faction known as the Fighter Mafia to argue that Air Force had its design priorities all wrong and that what was really needed was a relatively cheap lightweight airframe that maximized energy for short-range dogfights rather than another heavy twin-engine fighter like the F-15 Eagle that was then under development which would doubtlessly be over-reliant on defective guided missiles. (In fact the Eagle went on to prove it was in fact possible to create a very maneuverable twin-engine jet fighter if you didn’t mind the cost—and air-to-air missiles would improve dramatically as well.)

Support for a light fighter eventually consolidated in the Pentagon due to simple economics: the Air Force liked the F-15 but realized it was too expensive to equip all of its fighter squadrons so it came to seek a “high-low” force mix. Eventually two prototypes faced off in a competitive trial in 1974: the Northrop YF-17 and the General Dynamics YF-16. The latter was unanimously found to be more responsive while the former evolved into the Hornet fighters now serving in the Marines and U.S. Navy. The first production F-16As went on to enter service in 1980 joined by the two-seat F-16B variant.

The single-engine F-16 leveraged new design technologies to maximize kinematic performance. A powerful Pratt & Whitney F100 engine with the intake slung under the fuselage could generate an excellent thrust-to-weight ratio due to the overall lightness of the Falcon propelling the F-16 to twice the speed of sound at high altitude. Pronounced strakes bulged out like the hood of a cobra from the fuselage to support the cropped delta wings enabling very high roll rates. A bulging bubble canopy afforded an excellent field of view for the pilot who was lounged in a seat angled thirty degrees back so as to mitigate the G-forces from violent maneuvers. And the F-16 could pull off very violent maneuvers indeed becoming the first jet fighter able to pull nine Gs in a turn—tighter than any other U.S. fighter until the advent of the F-22 Raptor. This explains the type’s service in the Air Force’s Thunderbirds aerobatics team.

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ol4ZhV8WX0I"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In fact to maximize its maneuverability the F-16 was intentionally designed to be aerodynamically unstable—a deficit which its Flight Control System automatically compensated for. This worked thanks to the F-16’s then-revolutionary fly-by-wire control scheme which basically meant that the pilot’s controls were interpreted via an electronic interface instead of via hydraulic or cable-connected manual controls. Not only were fly-by-wire controls more reliable but they made it possible for the flight computer to correct the pilot’s maneuvers as necessary to avoid exceeding the Falcon’s tolerances. Another feature was an integrated throttle in the joystick known as Hands-On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) enabling much smoother operation by the pilot. Fly-by-wire and HOTAS have since become standard features in modern combat aircraft.

Unlike the early model F-14 and F-15s the Falcon was also designed as a multirole fighter and it could lug up to seventeen thousand pounds of munitions or electronic-warfare gear on its eleven hardpoints including a new generation of precision guided weapons such as Maverick missiles and laser-guided bombs. A twenty-millimeter Vulcan cannon in the lower fuselage served as a backup weapon.

Ironically while the Fighter Mafia had little faith in guided missile technology the F-16 arrived just when such weapons attained a new level of efficiency and the Falcon’s APG-66 doppler radar Heads Up Display and targeting computers were able to leverage these weapons to deadly effect. This was demonstrated in June 1982 when Israeli F-15s and F-16As engaged in a massive three-day air battle over the Bekaa Valley against Syrian jet fighters. The Israeli Falcons downed forty-four Syrian MiG-21s and -23s without suffering a single loss. A year earlier in 1981 the Falcons had demonstrated their versatility when eight of the brand-new fighters bombed the Osirak reactor in Baghdad with sixteen two-thousand-pound Mark 84 bombs bringing Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program to a halt.

By the mid-1980s the currently serving F-16C and two-seat D models entered service. These boasted modernized avionics such as liquid-crystal displays and new APG-68 radars that allowed for long-range missile engagements with newer AIM-7 Sparrow and forthcoming AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. The C and D have since undergone several more incremental upgrades including better radars GPS-targeted weapon capabilities and the integration of the AIM-9X Sidewinder heat-seeking missile which the pilot can target using a helmet-mounted cuing system—permitting an F-16 to shoot at an enemy within visual range without having to line them up directly in front of its nose.

The U.S. F-16 fleet first saw action in the 1991 Gulf War where it flew more than thirteen thousand strike missions loaded down with two-thousand-pound bombs and Maverick missiles. F-16s embarked on the largest air strike ever over downtown Baghdad during the seventy-two-ship Form Q—though two of the Falcons were shot down by air-defense missiles during the raid and their pilots captured. One squadron took on “Wild Weasel” duties by hunting down Iraqi surface-to-air missile batteries with AGM-88 Harm missiles.

The Air Force also attempted to boost the F-16 as a replacement for the A-10 Thunderbolt in the Close Air Support role by equipping F-16Cs and Ds of the 138th Fighter Squadron with Pave Claw thirty-millimeter Gatling cannon pods. However the lightweight jets were so shaken up by the weapon’s recoil that the idea was abandoned and the A-10 fleet survived yet another of many assassination attempts by the Air Force brass.

After the formal end of hostilities F-16s enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq scored the first kill using the long-range AIM-120 Scorpion missile when they downed a speedy MiG-25 Foxbat.

Since the Gulf War the Falcon has been ubiquitous in U.S. and NATO air campaigns over the former Yugoslavia Iraq and Syria. American and Belgian F-16s shot down additional enemy fighters over Serbia and Kosovo during the 1990s though two were brought down by Serb surface-to-air missiles. The F-16s sold abroad have also seen action in plenty of conflicts. Pakistani F-16s shot down ten Soviet and Afghan aircraft on its border during the 1980s. In 1992 two Venezuelan Falcons pilots played a key role in defeating a coup by supporters of Hugo Chávez by shooting down two rebel OV-10 Broncos and a Tucano trainer.

By one count the Falcon has shot down seventy-six enemy aircraft while only suffering one or two losses in aerial combat generally under ambiguous circumstances (a Pakistani F-16 shot down another by accident; a Greek Mirage downed a Turkish F-16 in what had formerly been mock aerial combat). And of course Falcons have continued to serve as bomb-toting workhorses for air strikes on targets in Lebanon Iraq Libya Syria Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The most sophisticated F-16 in service today aren’t in the U.S. Air Force unit but rather Block 62 F-16Es and Fs ordered by the United Arab Emirates. The new F-16s boast conformal fuel tanks that greatly extend the Falcon’s short range at minimal aerodynamic cost as well as an APG-80 Active Electronically Scanned Array radar. AESA radars represent the cutting edge of fighter-borne radar technology due to their superior resolution and lower visibility to enemy radars. Currently an even more advanced Block 70 version is being considered for production in India. However the costs for these newer Falcons have also skyrocketed.

Due to delays and cost overruns in the F-35 stealth fighter program the U.S. Air Force intends to continue flying its 1200 F-16s well into the 2040s by extending the airframe’s service life from eight to twelve thousand hours. The Fighting Falcon has proven to be a fine and versatile combat jet—and furthermore by one count it costs $22000 per flight hour to operate compared to $42000 for a twin-engine F-15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90ZWNobmV3cy5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzA2LzI3L2RlZmVuc2Utc3BhY2UtZXhwbG9yYXRpb24tYW1vbmctdGhlLWNvbnRyaWJ1dGlvbnMtb2YtYWVyb2R5bmFtaWNzLXRlc3QtYnJhbmNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Defense space exploration among the contributions of Aerodynamics Test Branch,"From the testing of subscale to full-scale models at speeds ranging from subsonic to hypersonic work performed over the decades in the nine wind tunnels that comprise the Arnold Engineering Development Complex Aerodynamics Test Branch has played an integral role in protecting civilians and warfighters by providing customers with valuable risk-reduction data.

Six continuous-flow wind tunnels within the AEDC Aerodynamics Test Branch are located across two facilities at Arnold Air Force Base Tenn. headquarters of AEDC.





The Propulsion Wind Tunnel

The Propulsion Wind Tunnel (PWT) is home to the 16-foot transonic wind tunnel (16T) the 4-foot transonic wind tunnel (4T) and the recently-reactivated 16-foot supersonic wind tunnel (16S).

PWT is devoted to aerodynamic and propulsion integration test and evaluation of aircraft models. Some of the most powerful electric motors ever built are contained within the facility.

16T has a 16-foot-square by 40-foot-long test section that can be operated from Mach numbers 0.06 to 1.60. 16S comprised of the same test section dimensions as 16T is capable of operating from Mach numbers 1.60 to 4.75. These tunnels are used for testing that includes aerodynamic tests and combined aerodynamic/propulsion systems.

In 2020 the aerodynamics team added large-scale mass flow assembly testing to the suite of capabilities available in 16T and 16S.

4T is a mid-sized 4-foot-square by 12.5-foot-long test section used for testing at subsonic to low-end supersonic airspeeds a range approximately equivalent to 160 to 1600 miles per hour at sea level.

Planning for PWT began in early 1950 when the Air Force Research and Development Board on Facilities met with representatives from aircraft propulsion companies. They concurred that a supersonic propulsion wind tunnel with a 15-foot-diameter test section was needed.

In December 1951 AEDC’s commanding general approved a proposal design construction and operation of PWT’s transonic circuit. The entire PWT complex was completed and accepted by the Air Force by early 1961. The project spread out over nearly 40 contracts cost just south of $79 million.

Utilizing the trio of tunnels currently housed within PWT provides customers with access to capabilities such as store separation testing and testing using pressure-sensitive paint. Store separation testing is done to ensure bombs missiles tanks and other stores separate cleanly from aircraft when released. Store separation and flow-field mapping is completed using the Captive Trajectory Support system. During store separation testing a model of a store can be positioned where needed for testing in proximity to the aircraft model to determine aerodynamic loads caused by the aircraft’s flow field. Pressure-sensitive paint is used to optically determine the surface pressure across wind tunnel models with each image pixel containing pressure data to provide millions of measurements on a model as opposed to dozens or hundreds of mechanical pressure measurements on a similarly sized model.





The PWT 1-foot transonic wind tunnel

The first test in PWT was performed in 1953 in the now-inactive 1-foot prototype wind tunnel (1T) known as “Pee Wee.” This test was on a 0.03-scale model of the Bomarc missile for the Boeing Company.

The 1T served as the predecessor for the still-active 16T which was completed in 1956 and that same year underwent its first powered operation prior to calibration.





The PWT 16-foot transonic wind tunnel

Within AEDC’s first decade testing on the Navy Polaris and the Air Force Titan missiles was conducted in 16T. In mid-1957 the nose cone proposed for the Air Force Atlas missile was tested in 16T.

Also among the first tests conducted in 16T was a program involving a model of the B-58 Hustler the country’s first supersonic bomber.

A significant milestone occurred in 16T in December 1959 when a liquid-fueled rocket engine was tested in a closed-circuit wind tunnel for the first time. The prior year the GAM-72 decoy system also known as the Green Quail was tested in 16T. This was the first combined aerodynamic-propulsion test of a full-scale missile of this type at AEDC.

Not long after tunnel operations began 16T was utilized in support of the national space program. In April 1959 tests supporting the NASA Mercury program America’s first human spaceflight program were performed in the tunnel. This work involved the aerodynamic stability study of a manned capsule.

Even 1T was used for space program testing. In 1966 the Saturn 1B and Saturn V upper-stage configurations were tested there. These launch vehicles were developed to support the NASA Apollo program. Project Apollo succeeded in landing the first people on the moon in July 1969.

In the 1970s programs carried out in 16T included full-scale B-1 inlet testing testing on the Air-Launched Cruise Missile and testing on a full-scale model of the General Dynamics Tomahawk.

Testing in 16T occurring in the 1980s included one to determine the effect of a pilot after bailing out of an aircraft traveling several hundred miles per hour.

In the early 1990s tests were conducted in 16T to support the European Space Agency’s Huygens probe to the Titan moon of Saturn. These tests evaluated the performance of the parachute used to slow the probe down as it descends to Titan’s surface.

In the early 2000s store separation was conducted on a model of the EA-18G warfare aircraft. More recently the facility has been used to perform store separation to support the B-1B Lancer.





The PWT 16-foot supersonic wind tunnel

The first run in 16S occurred in 1960. The first user test occurred the following year. Just a year after this RS-70 inlet testing began in 16S. This was then the largest model ever tested in a wind tunnel as it measured 75-feet long and weighed more than 200000 pounds with support equipment.

Scale model tests of the F-111 aircraft began in 16S in 1964. The launch vehicle for Titan III was also tested in 16S with testing completed in 16S and 16T in December 1966.

The first propulsion test in 16S occurred in 1962 during a shakedown program on the B-70 propulsion system.

In the early 1970s testing in support of the B-1 bomber was performed in 16S.

As national priorities shifted usage of the 16S facility declined at it was mothballed in the 1990s. However efforts to return the tunnel to service began several years back. The tunnel returned to operational status early this year.





The PWT 4-foot transonic wind tunnel

4T was added to the PWT in 1968. This tunnel was built to aid in the development of new weapons and to ensure stores could be safely released from high-speed aircraft.

The concept of a 4-foot transonic wind tunnel dates back to the early 1960s. Officials at Eglin Air Force Base Florida where store separation is managed had determined that in the midst of the jet age the development of new weapons that could safely separate from aircraft and strike the intended targets was critical.

In 1965 1st Lt. Roland H.A. West with the help of others in the U.S. Air Force Development Division and AEDC personnel prepared and submitted a brochure which detailed the need for a new wind tunnel and the plans for its construction at Arnold AFB. In the document West wrote the development of a 4-foot wind tunnel would provide an economical capability for conventional weapons development.

According to West weapons of the time would need to be redesigned and new ones developed for use in subsonic and transonic speed regimes to meet then-current and projected requirements.

At the time 16T and 1T were the only two tunnels in these desired speed ranges AEDC had at its disposal. West pointed out issues with both. He wrote that 16T was designed for testing large- or full-scale articles. The testing West had defined would not require a tunnel of this size. Other concerns including the cost to operate 16T and its availability as the tunnel was booked for the foreseeable future which would make the rapid testing of weapons difficult. West further indicated 1T would be too small to meet testing requirements.

Planning and discussions led to the development of 4T to study the separation of stores from aircraft. The first user test in the tunnel began in January 1968 and was conducted at the request of the Air Force Armament Laboratory. It involved the testing of a Hard Structure Munition missile model at transonic speeds.

The first store separation test at 4T was conducted in April 1968. Tests were conducted to determine the dynamic and static stability characteristics of the AGM-12E missile and to investigate the separation characteristics of the missile from the inboard wing pylons of the F-105 aircraft. This test determined that the store would separate from the inboard pylon without jeopardizing the aircraft.

Within its first 10 years 4T had been used in a number of test programs for the Air Force Army Navy and NASA. These tests supported the development of stores and certified their use with numerous aircraft including the F-105 F-4 A-7 and A-10.

In the 1980s testing was performed in 4T to determine the ability of the F-16 to jettison both a new external fuel tank and the pylons by which they are attached to the plane’s wings. The ability of the AV-8 Harrier “jump jet” to carry and deliver a new munition was also studied in 4T in the 1980s.

Testing conducted in 4T in the fall of 1999 satisfied requirements for later flight testing of the F-22 Raptor. The following year the tunnel was used to prepare the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle for upcoming flight tests.

In 1989 the American Society of Mechanical Engineers designated PWT an International Historical Mechanical Engineering Landmark.





The von Kármán Gas Dynamics Facility

VKF is home to the mid-sized continuous-flow wind tunnels known as Tunnel A Tunnel B and Tunnel C.

Recommendations for what was originally known as the Gas Dynamics Facility were approved by the Air Force Engineering Development Division commanding general in early 1951. The first developmental-type test occurred in the facility a little more than two-and-half years later. The facility was dedicated as the von Kármán Gas Dynamics Facility in October 1959 to honor mathematician physicist and engineer Dr. Theodore von Kármán.

Tunnel A is a supersonic wind tunnel with a 2D variable flex-wall nozzle. Tunnels B and C are the only operational continuous-flow hypersonic wind tunnels in the world utilizing fixed Mach number nozzles. Both VKF and PWT wind tunnels are renowned for their flow quality and operational tempo that allows rapid acquisition of large aerodynamic databases to accelerate the pace of vehicle development.

Each VKF tunnel is equipped with a model inject system that allows continuous pitch and roll sweeps of the test articles. These systems also provide a means to remove test articles from the flow so that changes to the test articles can be performed during air-on operation.

The first test in Tunnel A was performed in June 1958 just two years after the Air Force turned the tunnel over to the Arnold Research Organization which had been selected to manage AEDC operations to begin shakedown operations. This initial effort involved testing for the Thor weapons system.

The tunnel was also used in the early days of AEDC to test a model of the Air Force Atlas missile.

Like PWT VKF played a part in helping to get Americans in space and to the moon. Tests supporting the NASA Apollo program began in VKF in June 1962. Apollo command module tests were completed in Tunnels B and C in July 1966.

Years after the first men landed on the moon Tunnel A was still utilized to aid in space exploration efforts. In the mid-1970s a model of the complete Space Shuttle assembly was tested in the tunnel. This design of the Space Shuttle was aided by testing in facilities across Arnold including those in PWT. Materials testing of the spray on foam insulating the shuttle’s external tanks occurred in the 80s 90s and early 2000s in VKF’s Aerothermal Mach 4 Tunnel C. Testing in PWT and VKF also supported conclusions made by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board in the aftermath of the ill-fated STS-107 mission.

Along with these efforts testing on the Poseidon ICBM reentry vehicle was conducted in Tunnels A B and C in 1967. An upgraded version of the Patriot air and missile defense system was among systems tested in Tunnel A during the 1990s.

Testing to support the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency Operational Fires program was completed in VKF in October 2020. The goal of this program was to develop and demonstrate a novel ground-launched system enabling hypersonic boost-glide weapons to penetrate modern enemy air defenses and rapidly and precisely engage critical time-sensitive targets.

Major food companies employ virtual armies of chefs food scientists and marketing gurus dedicated to developing test-marketing and (if all goes well) eventually rolling out new products. Both salty and sweet and sometimes both at once these items tend to tempt consumers into eating more sugar salt and/or fat that is good for them. (These are the stories behind America’s favorite cookie brands.)

Along the way though they also please us with their vivid flavors and attractive textures — and when they eventually disappear from the shelves as many of them do we end up missing them even though we realize that they’re not exactly constituents of a healthy diet. (Here though are some healthy versions of old-school junk-food snacks you’d like to try.)

Why do such snack foods get discontinued? In most cases it’s simply a matter of sales. They just don’t generate the revenue that projections called for and so are phased out in favor of the tried-and-true or of other new introductions that might end up doing better.

24/7 Tempo consulted numerous snack food fan pages company histories and rating sites to compile this list of chips candies and other such items that we wish we could eat again right now.

Sometimes we get the chance. Scrapped products may be brought back in some cases either in their original form or with slight variations (or new names). Sometimes the snacks are still made in other countries too such as Mexico Canada or Australia and these may be available by mail order. Collectors also sell unopened packages of the original on eBay and other sites — and some aficionados turn to crowd-sourcing platforms like change.org and ipetitions.com to beg companies to gear up production of their favorites again.

The Shifting Retail Sales Landscape

Overall retail sales have experienced a tremendous rebound since the COVID-19 outbreak. By most measures we are back to pre-pandemic levels. However the retail landscape is ever-shifting and being redefined by a “new norm.”

Consumers return to restaurants in droves

As vaccination efforts accelerated restaurants welcomed back customers. Sales for Food Services and Drinking Places surged 68.5% YoY surpassing pre-pandemic levels. In particular Limited-Service restaurant sales grew at the highest rate since the end of 2019. For details on food sub-categories go to Food Institute Economic Benchmarking.

Balancing big-ticket items and discounts

Cars were among the top big-ticket items that Americans purchased this year. Concerns about the pandemic drove many consumers away from public transportation and toward used-car lots. Rental companies also boosted car sales by replenishing their fleets. Auto dealership sales peaked in April with 44.6% increase YoY. Car sales decelerated in May but many dealerships still expect strong demand as employees go back to work on-site.

At the same time price-conscious consumers are gravitating towards online discounts. Amazon Prime Day 2021 sales surpassed $11 billion >6% increase from last year. Many of the most popular items are everyday essentials.

Source: U.S. Census Bureau and https://www.numerator.com/prime-day

Global supply crunch and retail outlook

Current supply and demand conditions are highly unusual and shouldn’t persist over the long term for a number of reasons:

The effect of fiscal stimulus is fading. Consumers are unlikely to spend more on big-ticket items. Pandemic regulations and cyberattacks presented new challenges to the global supply chain. Though carriers have deployed more ships than at any time in history the effective capacity is 25% less than what’s actually deployed because so many vessels are caught up in record bottlenecks at ports . This is likely to last for months not years. Current demand is outpacing supply.

In both April and May overall retail sales fell short of market expectations. Looking forward 12 months most economists expect retail sales growth to return to a “normal” range.

The five-day event called Lordstown Week involved ride-alongs in prototype versions of the Endurance pickup which the company hopes to begin building final versions later this year for commercial fleet customers. The truck is powered by battery packs supplying energy to electric motors in each wheel hub. That motor-in-a-wheel design largely sets the Endurance platform apart from other electric vehicles.

The company gave guided tours and demonstrations inside its mammoth 6.2 million-square-foot factory complex in Trumbull County. The company purchased the property for $20 million from General Motors which originally built the plant in the 1960s. The facility for decades had been key part of the Mahoning Valley economy and national political battles on jobs.

And there were introductions of the company's newly revamped executive team including presentations from Angela Strand Lordstown Motors's executive chairwoman and acting chief executive officer. She is leading the company following the dismissals on June 13 of company founder and chief executive Steve Burns and of Julio Rodriguez chief financial officer.

Lordstown village mayor optimistic about electric pickups

Arno Hill mayor of the village of Lordstown took part in Thursday's presentations. Hill said he had tours of the plant when General Motors owned it and was there the day GM shut down production in 2019. He's impressed with the work Lordstown Motors has done.

""I will tell you the transformation was utterly amazing. ... I am very optimistic"" Hill said. ""They are still moving forward.""

Still that optimism is tempered with what Hill described as himself and the village being in a ""wait and see mode"" on whether the company ultimately will succeed. Lordstown Motors has hired significant industry expertise in management engineering and other areas he said. He said established electric car maker Tesla was at one point considered to be near failure.

Lordstown Motors looks to be working to get recent bad press behind it Hill said.

Strand the acting CEO made presentations and introduced top executives to visitors at the start of each day's program. She did not take questions at Tuesday's event which involved news media.

""I embrace change"" she said. ""And the leadership and board of directors embrace understand the need for change in order to mature and grow an organization. Particularly a public company.""

Her role is to guide Lordstown Motors as it also embraces change Strand said. ""And the board of directors and leadership team are deeply committed to that purpose to bring the first full-size all-electric pickup truck to market.""

Company says focus is on three key areas

The company is ""relentlessly focused"" on team technology and transparency Strand said.

""We are laser focused on hitting our initial production target at the end of September"" she said.

Strand in talking about transparency did not elaborate on related issues the company has found itself embroiled in. Lordstown Motors fired founder Burns and the previous chief financial officer after reports saying the company improperly disclosed the number and quality of non-binding orders for the Endurance pickup. And a Wall Street Journal story early in the week said five company executives including the former CFO sold significant personal stock holdings in the company prior to Lordstown Motors publicly disclosing a significant quarterly loss and higher-than-expected expenses.

Lordstown Week was scheduled before the recent bad news.

""As a public company transparency is essential"" Strand said. ""Transparency first starts with honesty integrity accountability the way we treat each other and the way we interact with media with shareholders with our partners and our customers.""

The company is seeking additional funding to scale up capacity and further automate processes to hit full production Strand said. ""We are exploring multiple sources of capital in addition to evaluating strategic partnerships. And we are continuing to do due diligence with our [federal government] loan.""

The company still has to install its electric motor production lines; it says it will get the needed parts in August in time to begin vehicle production in September. Lordstown Motors licenses the hub motor technology from a Slovenian company. Other parts of the production process are running including mammoth stamping presses that form body panels and an initial battery assembly line.

Still lots of unused space

A vast amount of the Lordstown complex space is unused and Strand said that is to be expected. The company currently has about 450 employees. At its peak under General Motors thousands of people worked there.

Darren Post vice president of engineering with decades of automotive industry experience was among the executives on the media tour. He showed off features on the Endurance pickup and helped explain the manufacturing processes.

Among the the things he demonstrated was the Endurance ""frunk"" or front trunk secure space where a motor would be in a traditional fuel-powered pickup.

Post said the truck's hub motor technology which has been questioned by analysts and others is viable and robust.

""It doesn't break"" he said.

The assembly process uses robots to bolt what the company calls the skateboard – the chassis with wheels motor and battery back – to the body.

Lordstown Motors and its Endurance truck getting mixed reviews

Industry analysts and other media reported mixed reviews of the plant and tour this week.

""We continue to believe Lordstown has a long road ahead"" wrote Joseph Spak analyst with RBC Capital Markets who attended Lordstown Week. Using the unique hub motor technology is a risk he said.

The large plant is an asset for the company and could be used as collateral for a loan Spak wrote in a note to clients. Plant management said the replacement value of the equipment inside is $3 billion he wrote.

Spak said he has had the opportunity to ride in Ford's prototype F-150 Lightning electric pickup as well as the Endurance.

""While both were betas the comparison wasn't close in our view as Ford had a more refined better performing and capable vehicle"" he wrote. ""That said Endurance can still improve and there were some impressive features including turning radius.""

Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote this week that Lordstown Motors needs to find quick access to capital to reach its goal of commercially producing Endurance pickups by the end of the year. The company faces significant challenges he wrote.

""While the market opportunity is large and Lordstown's truck received decent initial interest from potential fleet customers we see considerable uncertainty ahead"" Rosner wrote.

The consumer editor with Autoblog.com Jeremy Korzeniewski wrote that his brief interaction with the Endurance suggested it could be a viable electric truck but more work is needed. The company has a talented team behind it but will need more money and hard effort to meet its 2021 goals he wrote.

Prototype military-style vehicle demonstrates versatility

The nearly four-hour daily presentation ended with the chance to ride in another prototype vehicle based on the Endurance platform — a military-style vehicle with no doors and roll bars instead of a roof.

The one-off truck was designed to show the robustness of the Endurance skateboard as well as the versatility of being able to drop different body designs on it. The chassis was beefed up to take the regular abuse of driving up and over hills in mud ruts and deep water.

Lordstown Mayor Hill said he had to leave before getting a chance to ride on the military-style prototype.

Getting the auto plant up and running is important to the area Hill said.

""It means jobs"" he said. A viable Lordstown Motors will attract other suppliers to the area.

The Mahoning Valley is hoping to earn the nickname Voltage Valley and is on the way there with not just startup Lordstown Motors but also a General Motors battery operation he said. Other companies have also recently located or expanded in the area he said.

""We're going to be OK"" Hill said.

Ford guys hate Chevy guys Chevy guys hate Ford guys and everyone hates Mopar guys. It's a never-ending cycle of meaningless friction. In recent years there's been a general disdain for Tesla owners. Some people don't like electric cars some don't like Tesla fans' attitudes and a fair amount are very skeptical of Elon Musk. Regardless most of the finger-pointers are just plain ignorant because Tesla is an undeniably American company building cars in America. In fact the Model 3 was just named the most American vehicle money can buy in 2021.

That apparently wasn't clear to at least one parking attendant at General Motors' Wentzville Assembly Plant in Missouri. A Tesla parked in a lot at the facility on June 3 was ticketed for being a ""Foreign in domestic lot"" aka a car not built in the States parked in a lot designated strictly for domestic cars.

Kyl Brown

The parking slip was posted to Facebook in a group called ""Useless Unsuccessful and/or Unpopular Signage."" So far it has elicited a variety of responses from commenters wondering if it's real curiousity over separate parking for foreign cars at GM facilities and mocking the presumed ignorance of the person who wrote the ticket.

As a matter of fact some automakers’ facilities do have brand-specific parking. According to commenters on the post in the group Ford does it Subaru does it and as we confirmed so does GM.

GM

We reached out to GM to get the company's take on the situation and a representative confirmed a few details.

""Wentzville like many of our manufacturing sites has a parking policy and designated parking locations for GM vehicles non-GM domestic vehicles and foreign nameplates"" a GM spokesperson told us via email. ""Plant security inadvertently thought the Tesla was a foreign car and wrote a ticket accordingly.""

So in a nutshell the Tesla was parked in the correct lot but plant security made a mistake. The Tesla owner was in the right.

Tesla

There is no financial penalty for the citation it's just a warning or so the spokesperson said. Seeing as this one was issued by accident the Tesla owner will be able to keep parking where they park. A small victory perhaps but a victory nonetheless.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy8yMDIxLzA2LzI3L2NoaW5hcy1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItY2FwaXRhbC1oYXMtbGVzc29ucy1yZXN0LXdvcmxkLzUzNjgwNDgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's electric car capital has lessons for the rest of world,"Your subscription supports:

However in addition to producing the diesel-powered GM Defense ISV the subsidiary also recently developed a new all-electric ISV concept and now we’re putting both models side-by-side for a comparison.

Known simply as the All Electric Concept Vehicle the all-electric GM Defense ISV is closely related to the diesel-powered production variant. Like the “standard” GM Defense ISV the all-electric concept is based on the Chevy Colorado ZR2 pickup and is designed for the rapid deployment of infantry and their equipment onto the battlefield. Critically the ISV leverages a swath of commercial-off-the-shelf components such as Multimatic Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve dampers. In fact according to GM Defense chief engineer Mark Dickens the “standard” is more or less identical to the Chevy Colorado ZR2 from the waist down.

The all-electric GM Defense ISV takes the platform in a new direction replacing the 2.8L I4 LWN turbodiesel engine with the same all-electric powertrain as the Chevy Bolt EV and Chevy Bolt EUV. The standalone powertrain made its debut as the E-Crate during SEMA 2019 and produces 200 horsepower with motivation routed to the rear wheels. Alternatively the drivetrain offers the option to switch into 4WD at any time.

The battery pack for the all-electric powertrain is mounted under the bed floor which is made from the same material as the GMC CarbonPro box found on the GMC Sierra pickup truck. Meanwhile the electric motor is located up front under the hood. Range-per-charge depends on the driving style with estimates laying between 70 miles and 150 miles.

Beyond the new power source the all-electric GM Defense ISV differs from the “standard” GM Defense ISV in one other key area. Specifically the all-electric concept is longer with a bed that’s extended roughly five inches compared to the standard model.

The rest of the concept is identical to the “standard” ISV including the wheelbase and seating area.

Whether or not the GM Defense ISV Electric Concept will make it to full production status remains to be seen. For now though the concept demonstrates just how flexible all-electric power can be and what uses it may offer the military.

'The Handmaid's Tale is among TV's best dramas despite the relentless trauma'

Just when you thought the most harrowing show on television couldn’t get any more grim!

The latest episode of The Handmaid’s Tale hacked a man to death sealed our heroine’s bullet wound with a red hot poker and – possibly worst of all - killed off a cute pig called Mr Darcy.

The show has always left viewers reeling with its unflinching depiction of an oppressive totalitarian totally messed-up baby-mad regime.

And there are many who believe it should be put out of its misery leaving us all to happier times in front of Friends re-runs and jolly baking shows.

But despite the relentless – and I mean RELENTLESS – trauma this remains one of the best dramas of the last decade. Torture porn set to a cracking soundtrack.

A lengthy recap as season four hit C4 on Sunday was much-needed – a reminder that June played by Elisabeth Moss (give her all the awards) had pulled off a heroic mission to transport 86 Gilead children to the promised land: Canada. A rare ­glimmer of joy amid the gloom.

Slippery commander Fred and Serena Joy Waterford played by Joseph Fiennes and Yvonne Strahovski had been arrested. Double joy. But June has remained in Gilead to save her daughter Hannah and is bleeding out in the woods.

She can’t die of course because The Handmaid’s Tale would wither and die without Moss.

But tense scenes see the rebel group finally reach a safe house where June tends to her wound with penicillin made from rotten fruit and it’s all pretty wretched.

Watching this also involves dealing with a constant low-level anxiety that June and her fellow Handmaids will be captured by the enemies at any moment.

In episode one the unsettling figure was the 14-year-old mistress of the safe house Mrs Keyes (Mckenna Grace) who is bone-chillingly scary. She made Janine eat her pet pig for goodness sake.

But it turns out the teen wife is damaged having been raped by many men after being passed around by her commander husband. What she really needs is a mother figure to stroke her hair and tell her it will be all right.

But as June handed her a knife called her a good girl and whispered “Make me proud” as she sent her off to butcher her rapist… well it made me feel uneasy.

Is June turning into some kind of Suicide Squad ringleader?

It’s this shifting morality and our desperation to see her finally escape that makes this nightmarish show so captivating.

Just like June we must suffer before we get what we want – and this is a drama that’s totally worth the pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The newly built house was a 1200-square-foot three-bedroom bungalow with 1.5 bathrooms and a big backyard. The couple saved up for around five years to put a down payment on the $82000 house.

“It was easier to get into a starter house then” 68-year-old Sayant said. “We actually paid less than the asking price. There no bidding wars so it was pretty common to put in an offer that was less than asking.”

In 1976 — when the majority of baby boomers born between 1946 to 1965 were coming of age as young adults — it took a typical young person five years of full-time work to save a 20 per cent down payment on an average-priced home in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) Metro Vancouver and many parts of Canada according to Generation Squeeze a non-partisan Canadian organization that advocates on behalf of young adults.

Flash-forward to today and home prices have skyrocketed while people’s earnings have lost ground relative to inflation by thousands of dollars.

For example a millennial (someone born between 1981 and 1996) needs to work on average 14 years in Canada 24 years in the GTA and 28 years Metro Vancouver to put a 20 per cent down payment on a house according to Generation Squeeze.

“Hard work does not pay off like it used to” said Paul Kershaw founder of Generation Squeeze and policy professor in the UBC School of Population Health.

He started his organization a decade ago to shine a light on the lower earnings and rising housing costs that Canadians face. And since he founded Generation Squeeze he said the problem for young people has only gotten worse.

“The reality for a typical young person is that they have to go to school longer pay more for that privilege to land jobs that pay thousands of dollars less and to face housing costs that are up hundreds of thousands of dollars which drives up rent as well” he explained.

“This causes the generation to have to delay starting their families. And when they finally decide to do so the child-care cost is then near equivalent to another rent- or mortgage-size payment.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""This causes the generation to have to delay starting their families. And when they finally decide to do so the child-care cost is then near equivalent to another rent- or mortgage-size payment.""

He said this vice grip is tightened further by their growing debt.

For example according to Statistics Canada the median debt for millennials reached $35400 in 2016 compared to $19400 for young Canadians in 1999.

And according to a 2019 TransUnion report Canadian millennials hold more than twice as much debt as any other generation.

“So people may think ‘What am I doing wrong?’ But this is not an individual issue this is a societal economical and political issue” Kerhsaw said.

2:04 Priced out: Will the Canadian housing market crash? Why home prices may stay hot

Thirty-four-year-old Kathryn Checkley is no stranger to this struggle.

Story continues below advertisement

Checkley is a working professional living in Toronto as a renter with her husband and baby. She said she’s tired of renting and dreams about owning a house but feels priced out of the market in the GTA.

“I’m one of those people who loves checking Zillow and Realtor.ca just to see what’s out there and dream a bit” she said.

“At this point we would have to win the lottery in order to afford a house in the GTA.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""At this point we would have to win the lottery in order to afford a house in the GTA.""

She and her husband have talked about moving further out of the GTA in order to afford a house but her husband is an occasional teacher with the Toronto District School Board and would lose his seniority if he moved to another district.

“And I would likely have to commute to Toronto for work so we would add on the expense of a car transit passes gas and insurance. It’s not clear that we would be any better off if we did manage to find a home further away” Checkley added.

Some of the issues she’s been facing with affordability are paying off student loans not relying on parents or grandparents for financial support and salaries that have not kept up with the price of inflation.

Her husband also relies on contract teaching work and she was a professional in the non-profit sector which “tends to offer lower salaries than corporations.”

In 2017 Checkley made the switch to the corporate working world in the hopes of more stability and higher earning potential.

“But in March of 2020 I was laid off due to COVID while in my first trimester with my first baby” she said.

“So it feels like we’ve just never had a sustained amount of time with both of us working full-time and consistently able to save for a home. COVID knocked us back again as we both had to take the CERB to make ends meet.”

How did it get this way?

Millennials like Checkley have been accumulating less and less wealth over the past 30 years.

When baby boomers hit a median age of 35 in 1990 they collectively owned 21 per cent of the wealth in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Financial news and insights delivered to your email every Saturday.

When Generation Xers (born between 1965 and 1980) reached 35 in 2008 they owned nine per cent nation’s wealth. And in 2020 millennials owned 4.6 per cent of the nation’s wealth.

Kershaw called this a “snowball effect” of young people unable to get their foot in the door.

Because of this struggle many young Canadians have to rely on their parents or grandparents for financial support when purchasing a home.

While there’s little hard data on exactly what percentage of first-time homebuyers nationwide are receiving help from their family a 2017 poll by financial products comparison site Ratehub.ca found that 43 per cent of millennial homebuyers had financial help.

“And the harder it is to kind of get that start at the beginning the harder it will be to kind of continue on … so that there are more people going to post-secondary but then it’s more difficult to get a job with a degree and then there are more student loans. And then you get into housing child care. I think there’s a lot of different pieces that add up” Kershaw said.

In terms of housing the reason many young Canadians cannot afford a home is that policymakers have tolerated escalating prices far beyond what a young person makes Kershaw argued.

2:11 Housing costs and grocery prices put pressure on food ability in Canada

For example Sayant and her husband both worked full-time and she said they didn’t have to “scrimp” to get by their salary was able to cover the mortgage and they even had savings left over to put into retirement.

“It was very much easier at that point to be independent nobody would ever think about moving in with your parents or even taking money from their parents” Sayant said. “I think probably it was easier to get a job too.”

Of course housing in the 1970s and early 1980s wasn’t perfect. Sayant said her mortgage was 18.5 per cent due to the high interest rates at the time. However with interest accumulating on money she was still saving in her bank account.

Despite the high interest rate at the time Kershaw said those who got into the housing market at the right time such as Sayant have seen a significant increase in net worth.

“But it’s the opposite for those who didn’t” he said.

“We have tolerated rising home prices because it has made homeowners who got into the housing market earlier get rich while we sleep watch television and cook.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""We have tolerated rising home prices because it has made homeowners who got into the housing market earlier get rich while we sleep watch television and cook.""

Kershaw said he bought a home in Metro Vancouver in 2004 and over the last decade has “made more money from my home price going up than and I did as a hard-working professor who works day to day.”

The divide where the wealthiest in the country benefit from housing price gains and depend on their rise for retirement savings and wealth accumulation will affect Canada’s ability to create jobs and grow the economy in the long run he warned.

He blames some of the housing crisis on politicians who are not willing to adjust the housing system to ensure prices stay on par with what people earn.

“We are spreading the contagion of unaffordability not simply because of some mean-spirited foreign buyer or because of some greedy real estate agent” he said.

“We are spreading the contagion of unaffordability because many Canadian households are entangled by policies that incentivize them to hope that home prices will rise.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""We are spreading the contagion of unaffordability because many Canadian households are entangled by policies that incentivize them to hope that home prices will rise.""

Since the Trudeau government came into power in 2015 the party has put initiatives in place to help with soaring housing costs.

Tougher mortgage stress-test rules began June 1 (which aimed to cool the market) a national empty homes tax was announced in November 2020 and funding has been dedicated to building social housing.

The empty homes tax proposal which if passed would take effect in January would penalize homeowners who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents making them pay an annual tax of one per cent of the value of residential real estate that is considered vacant or underused.

But critics say the measures don’t do enough to tackle the growing problem.

National statistics show the average national home price is now more than seven times the average household income according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) and Statistics Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

For more than a decade home prices growing much faster than incomes was an issue largely limited to Vancouver and Toronto two of the country’s priciest and most active real estate markets.

In Greater Vancouver the average price of a home was close to 12 times the average local income in 2016 according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) and Statistics Canada.

But the current housing extravaganza is dramatically widening the gap between home prices and incomes in a number of markets across Canada the data shows.

In Ottawa and Montreal for example the average home price is now around six times local household incomes.

“There’s a pressure politically not to change what’s underway in the current system which is making those who got into the system earlier better off” he said.

Tack on child care to the monthly bill

It’s not just housing that creates financial barriers for millennials the high cost of care is a major issue for Canadian parents.

Story continues below advertisement

According to a 2016 report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Canadian families spend almost one-quarter of their income on child care — a much higher ratio than other OECD members.

The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) has found that the cost of child care in Canada is rising faster than inflation. And a 2018 survey by accounting and advisory services firm BDO Canada found that one in five millennials are actively delaying having children because they feel they can’t afford a family.

Of course millennials’ approach to family is different than it was for baby boomers Kershaw said as there are more dual-income earners than ever before — heightening the need for child care.

For example 2016 research for Statistics Canada shows that the percentage of families with two parents working outside the home had doubled in the 40 years between 1976 and 2015.

1:55 Budget 2021: How realistic is Ottawa’s $10/day childcare promise?

And as dual-income families have become the norm child care has only become more expensive especially over the last decade. In some cities including Toronto and Edmonton the cost of child care rose as much as 20 per cent between 2014 and 2017.

Story continues below advertisement

But child care was not much of an issue for the baby boomer generation Kershaw argued saying there wasn’t a strong “feminist commitment” to women working in the labour market.

“Baby boomer women were winning that battle for us so we owe them that debt” he said.

Also for the baby boomer generation one parent could bring in a salary that was much more in line with the cost of housing so there was not as much pressure for dual-income earners he added.

But now the massive gap between home prices and earnings has promoted a need for child care “more than ever” he said.

To address the rising costs in April the federal government proposed up to $30 billion in fresh spending over the next five years to create a nationwide child-care system that it promises will bring child-care fees down to an average of $10 per day in regulated child-care centres by 2025-26.

COVID-19 pandemic didn't help

Historically low mortgage rates a race for space and a rush to get into the market ahead of tougher borrowing rules have all fuelled a surge in home prices during the coronavirus pandemic.

Oksana Kishchuk a consultant at Abacus Data a polling and market research firm based in Ottawa said she and her partner have been watching housing prices rise around the city leaving young Canadians like her priced out of the market.

Before the pandemic she said wages were already not in line with rising inflation. But when COVID-19 hit the world economy some people at the top moved up the financial ladder while others fell to the bottom.

Housing is a perfect example of this she said.

“Housing has become a piece of the conversation that is the epitome of what boomers have and millennials don’t” Kishchuk said adding that COVID-19 just made it worse.

The pandemic shift to working from home coupled with rock-bottom mortgage rates and government aid drove up housing prices around Canada (and the world).

As of April home prices nationwide were up 23 per cent compared to the same month in 2020 according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA).

And the real estate frenzy that has long been the norm in Toronto and Vancouver has hit smaller cities too like Halifax Nelson B.C. and Winnipeg.

In April home prices in Halifax reached record heights with selling tactics like under-listing a house to attract multiple offers bidding wars and people buying houses sight unseen becoming increasingly common.

The situation has pushed the average price of a home in Halifax up nearly 35 per cent in March compared to the same time in 2020 according to the CREA.

What can be done?

Both Kershaw and Kishchuk said unless there are major policy changes in the upcoming years housing will continue to squeeze generations out of the market.

“There should be policies in place that allow for younger people to see their housing dreams more achievable such as enabling more housing to be built” Kishchuk said.

She argued that the reason a lot of affordable housing policies may not be currently in place is that young people don’t vote as much as older generations.

“Their voice isn’t heard as much and they don’t have as much power with their dollars against kind of thing” she said.

However she said that it is a dangerous view to fall into as population-wise the millennial generation is quite big. And the more the generation grows older the more it will accumulate wealth and power.

“And to ignore the generation for the first 20 years of their adult life could be very dangerous when they get to be in that baby boomer age” she said.

Kershaw said until “we break our addiction” culturally politically and economically to rising home prices there’s little chance that we will succeed in stalling home prices and letting earnings recouple.

Although there is no silver bullet to restore housing affordability he said there are enough “tools in our toolbox” to achieve the goal.

For example Generation Squeeze recommends restricting global capital flows into local real estate eliminating hidden ownership and incentivizing households to put more of their retirement and other savings into non-housing investments.

His advice to young people who have seen their dreams of homeownership dashed during the pandemic is not to blame themselves for what is happening around them. In his view they are collateral damage. They may have to wait it out until homeowners are willing to make concessions.

“We have to change our hearts and our minds about ‘not in my backyard.’ We need to welcome more renters and co-ops in our neighbourhoods” Kershaw said. “Those policy and cultural shifts need to happen side by side.”

There was his homer at Globe Life Field in Texas' season opener in Arlington back in February. He went deep in the Austin Regional against Southern. During a stretch in which he homered in a school-record six straight games Melendez hit two balls that traveled an estimated 451 and 471 feet and another one that cleared the batter's eye at UFCU Disch-Falk Field.

Friday night those mammoth moments all became footnotes.

Melendez's 13th home run of the season was his biggest: a three-run blast in the ninth inning that lifted Texas to an 8-5 win over Mississippi State at TD Ameritrade Park helping the Longhorns overcome a stunning eighth-inning collapse and keep their season alive at the College World Series.

It sets the stage for Saturday night's winner-take-all third meeting of this CWS between Texas (50-16) and Mississippi State (47-17). The winner advances to play Vanderbilt in the best-of-three championship series which will start Monday.

""It's do or die for both teams"" Melendez said.

Saturday's showdown seemed pretty much set in stone after seven innings. Texas held a 5-2 lead. But the Bulldogs rallied in the eighth against Longhorns relief pitcher Tanner Witt and closer Aaron Nixon.

Earlier in the week Witt and Nixon had successfully closed out elimination games against Tennessee and Virginia. In the bottom of the eighth inning however Witt gave up a double and then walked three straight batters. After Nixon came in with the bases loaded and the score 5-3 the Bulldogs tied the game when Brad Cumbest singled off the glove of UT second baseman Mitchell Daly.

But as rain began to fall in Omaha the Longhorns quickly responded.

Mike Antico drew a leadoff walk in the top of the ninth inning and was bunted over to second base. Zach Zubia then walked putting runners on first and second with one out.

That brought up Melendez who worked the count full before he crushed Bulldogs reliever Parker Stinnett's low pitch into the left field bleachers.

""I knew when it came off his bat it was gone"" Texas coach David Pierce said. ""He absolutely hammered that pitch.""

Texas fans had plenty of time to celebrate Melendez's homer — about 2½ hours. After the homer the Bulldogs made another pitching change but then a weather delay brought the tarp onto the field. The two teams were called off the field at 10:39 p.m. The ninth inning did not resume until 1:06 a.m.

Texas loaded the bases after the long break but failed to add any more runs. Nixon who had pitched 1 2/3 innings in Thursday's win over Virginia and threw 12 pitches Friday night before the delay returned to the mound.

The Bulldogs got two runners on board bringing the tying run to the plate but Nixon got a groundout to shortstop Trey Faltine to end the game.

Pierce was asked after the game why he decided to keep Nixon in after the delay.

""I've been in that situation many times"" he said. ""I've talked to medical teams; I understand it. As long as you're not in any kind of stress situation just want to keep your body loose or hot and basically play light catch about every 15 20 minutes and just keep moving. That's what he did. He was ready to go. We were good there.

""It wasn't that difficult of a decision. It's something that we trusted with Aaron and that's what we did.""

Said Bulldogs coach Chris Lemonis: ""We took a punch there in the top of the ninth and our kids came out of the rain delay and they were ready to play. They felt like they could win the game then. And I'm sure they're going to go to bed tonight and feel confident to play a great game tomorrow.""

Saturday night's game is Texas' and Mississippi State's fourth meeting this season. The Bulldogs recorded an 8-3 win Feb. 20 in the opener for both schools. Texas opened its 37th appearance at the CWS last Sunday with a 2-1 loss.

Mississippi State is playing in its third straight CWS.

Through a team spokesperson Pierce declined to name a starting pitcher for Saturday night. Although he said he was still assessing his options Lemonis admitted there was ""a good chance"" that Will Bednar would start for Mississippi State.

Bednar struck out 15 Longhorns in the CWS opener.

Around the bases: Ty Madden struck out eight over a six-inning start. He allowed only one hit after Mississippi State's two-run three-hit first inning. ... Texas struck first when Zubia went deep with two outs in the first inning. With that solo shot he became the ninth player to hit 30 homers in a Texas uniform. ... Antico drove in two runs. ... Mississippi State used seven pitchers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaGFsbHN2aWxsZS1ncmFkdWF0ZS10by1wZXJmb3JtLW5hdGlvbmFsLWFudGhlbS1vbi1mbHV0ZS1hdC1zdW5kYXktdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1nYW1lL2FydGljbGVfOTdiOTc1OGMtZDVjYi0xMWViLTg5OTctNGI5YmJhYjAwNTk4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hallsville graduate to perform national anthem on flute at Sunday Texas Rangers game,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The results? Pretty freaking stellar. In fact Nike shares surged more than 15% and hit a record intraday high of $154.59 the very next day.

2021 Earnings Call Highlights

Words you could use to describe what The Swoosh did to The Street’s estimates: beat crushed smashed demolished eviscerated. Your choice.

Nike outperformed expectations by about every metric possible:

North American revenue up 141% vs. 2020

North American digital sales up 54% vs. 2020 and 177% vs. 2019

Chinese sales up 17% year-over-year with the driver being equipment sales

Gross margins up 850 bps or 8.5% (which is like…a lot of basis points)

Earnings per share of $0.93 beating estimates by $0.42

Take a deep breath. That’s a lot to unpack. (Imagine how I felt listening to CEO John Donahoe wax poetic about margins strategic positioning and omni-channel distribution on Nike’s earnings call. But I digress.)

Here were my three main takeaways:

1. Women’s Apparel Is The Future

In 2021 Nike women’s products outperformed men’s (20% growth vs. 11%) and represented 24% of the total merchandising revenue for the company.

Year-over-year growth for the women’s segment was clearly a point of pride for the company as they spent ample time discussing initiatives like revamping WNBA merchandise for the 2021 season.

An $8 billion revenue figure is a huge indication of things to come — and Nike appears fully committed to innovating in women’s sports.

2. The Situation in China Is Unprecedented

Nike’s growth in the Chinese market should not be underestimated. Revenue in the nation jumped 51% year-over-year in Q3 2021 alone.

Prior to the pandemic Nike had already experienced periods of double-digit growth in China from 2015-2019 and also benefited from the Chinese government’s investment in sports and the country’s growing middle class.

However disputes over alleged forced cotton production in the western region of Xinjiang have still been a large point of contention.

Earlier in the year Nike and H&M independently made statements of concern over their potential involvement in the controversial supply chain.

China vehemently denounced the claims and jabbed back.

Chinese celebrities cut ties with brands like Nike who participated in the Better Cotton Initiative.

H&M was removed from various e-commerce stores in the country.

Nike was also removed from many of the largest Chinese e-commerce apps — a clear push from the government to boycott the Swoosh.

All of that said Q4 results indicate that demand for Nike is alive and well in China.

3. Digital Digital and More Digital

Nike made it clear back at its 2017 investor day that shifting toward a DTC-centric model was a top priority.

A move away from traditional retail and its price segmentation strategy — shipping exclusive sneakers to high-end boutiques while Air Monarchs are relegated to DSW — was at the time a big decision for Nike.

How has it worked? Splendidly.

Digital revenue grew from $34 billion in 2017 to $42 billion in 2021. The percentage of Nike’s revenue coming from DTC sales jumped from 28% to 39% in the same period.

Q4 of fiscal 2020 was a dark spot though — Nike’s worst quarter of the pandemic:

Earnings per share dropped by $0.51

$6.31 billion in Q4 2020 revenue vs. $10.1 billion in Q4 2019

Net income sank to $790 million vs. $989 million a year earlier

But the push to digital was a saving grace. In that same miserable quarter Nike’s e-commerce sales grew 54%.

Digital is at the forefront of top dog Donahoe’s strategy.

In late 2019 Nike cut ties with a little known online retailer based out of Seattle: Amazon. This past March Nike went through another round of cuts — DSW Urban Outfitters Macy’s Olympia Sports and Big 5 were all dropped in favor of the company’s OneNike digital strategy.

On the other hand Nike beefed up its relationships with Dick’s Foot Locker and Nordstrom. These retailers allow Nike to uniquely position the brand — with a heavy emphasis on in-store initiatives that drive engagement.

Nike is opening up to 200 new owned and operated stores that are intended to be smaller more intimate and most importantly — more digital. Competitors are on a similar trajectory.

Adidas stated in March that its sales would be 50% DTC by 2025.

Puma’s DTC sales were up 19.2% YTD in April — e-commerce made up 57.2% of that total.

In an age where digital commerce is ubiquitous Nike is going about as all-in as possible.

Where Do We Go From Here?

All in all the question remains whether or not Nike’s investment in digital will allow it to scale the same way its wholesaler price segmentation model did.

My bet would be that it absolutely can and will. The moat created by Nike is so wide that it will be difficult for anyone to impede on the brand’s progress.

The companies will also help with Glaxo’s defense against the possibility of an activist campaign from Elliot Investment Management which is helmed by billionaire Paul Singer.

Emma Walmsley the head of Glaxo said the division which is known for its production of things like Aquafresh toothpaste and Nicorette gum would be listed in mid-2022 on the London Stock Exchange.

The company also plans to keep as much as 20 percent of the business intending to sell at a later date. And with the remainder of the company GlaxoSmithKline plans to cut down on its dividend for the rest of the business by 30 percent which will include a bigger strategy by the company to narrow its focus — now it will work more intensely on cancer and HIV drugs as well as drugs for other diseases.

Elliott has built up a formidable position in the drug-making company although the New York-based hedge fund hasn’t said what types of change it plans to seek at the company. The firm’s history is steeped in things like the healthcare space where it’s advocated for the sale of Alexion Pharmaceuticals before its sale to AstraZeneca last December and sought changes for companies including Alkermes Allergan Beyers and others.

Citi has recently put out a new unit devoted just to cryptocurrency according to a report from The Block Crypto.

That report said the new group will be called the Digital Assets Group and will sit within the company’s wealth management division. The unit will be led by Alex Kriete and Greg Girasole and will make Citi the newest bank behind companies like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to roll out ways for wealthy clients to utilize cryptocurrency.

The Block Crypto said the new unit will “work in tandem with our functional partners and the broader Capital Markets and Citi Investment Management teams to develop a robust and scalable value proposition.”"

Police in Memphis say they have arrested two customers for starting a shooting in a Burger King restaurant after being served a chicken sandwich with too much hot sauce FOX13 reported.

Two people were hit by the gunfire the outlet reported citing police records.

An affidavit shows police received a call to a Burger King in the Hollywood area of Memphis on June 6 FOX13 reported.

A female passenger later identified as 20-year-old Keonna Halliburton in a car had an ""altercation"" with staff over a spicy chicken sandwich per the affidavit the publication reported.

After the altercation Halliburton left the store in a car with driver Tavarus Mckinney 22 FOX13 reported citing records.

They then returned in a car and fired multiple shots from the road into the parking lot at four people the publication reported citing the affidavit. Two were hit by the gunfire it said.

Halliburton and Mckinney were charged with four counts of attempted first-degree murder and four counts of employment of a firearm during the commission of a felony FOX13 said.

The outlet spoke to an uncle of one of the people Halliburton and Mckinney shot at who said that his niece had told him that Halliburton complained that her chicken sandwich had too much hot sauce on it.

It is the latest in a series of violent incidents taking place at food and drink chains. On Sunday a Florida man was accused of pulling a gun on a Starbucks employee who turned out to be the local police chief's daughter over not having cream cheese for his bagel.

Submitted

Chabad House of Greater Hartford announced this past week the appointment of Lee Gold of West Hartford as the new chairman of the Board. An attorney with Butler Norris & Gold in Hartford Gold presently serves on the West Hartford Town Council and was its minority leader.

The Gold family has supported Chabad House of Greater Hartford for close to 40 years. Lee Gold officially joined the board in 2018 showing tremendous dedication and interest in seeing the Chabad grow and develop. He will succeed Alan Lazowski who has led Chabad’s board of directors for 16 years. Lazowski will continue to serve as a senior member of Chabad’s board.

“It has been a great honor to serve as Chabad’s Chairman of the Board” said Alan Lazowski. “I am incredibly proud of our accomplishments especially during the pandemic. I am confident that Lee’s leadership will be an asset as Chabad continues to grow and expand in our local community.”

“Lee will bring a new vision to the Chabad House of Greater Hartford which is in a state of expansion” said Chabad’s Director Rabbi Joseph Gopin. “Throughout the pandemic Chabad House of Greater Hartford has been on the front lines of providing social humanitarian and spiritual support to the local community. We are now seeing new families moving to this area and joining our Chabad programs the Hebrew School summer camp adult education and other programs offered. We have established ten centers in the Greater Hartford area with special focus on youth and college campuses. We are about to embrace new teen and young professionals divisions adding new staff to lead these programs. Lee’s leadership and strategic vision will help us go to the next level” said Rabbi Gopin.

The Chabad Emergence a study documented by a new Pew Report shows that Chabad is continuing to grow. Thirty eight percent of all U.S. Jews have engaged in some ways with Chabad programs. This is clearly a result of Chabad’s massive expansion in the three youth sectors: teens college students and young professionals. The shift of millennials has been documented in a series of studies that reveal that more Jews age 35 and younger are involved with Chabad than any other Jewish groups.

“I look forward to Chabad’s continued expansion and growth I am excited about this opportunity and know that with the help of all those involved we can achieve great success in the present and future” said Gold.

Attorney Gold is licensed to practice law in Connecticut at the state and federal district court levels. He graduated from Lehigh University Bethlehem PA with a bachelor’s degree in history and membership in Phi Beta Kappa the National Leadership Honor Society. He attended The University of Connecticut School of Law during which he served as a legal intern for the State’s Attorney’s office in Norwich and New London.

In addition to serving on West Hartford’s Town Council Gold currently serves on the Kingswood-Oxford Alumni Council. He is active in a number of bar associations including the Connecticut Bar Association the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association and the Hartford County Bar Association.

The Texas-based outfit is making its long-awaited series debut in this weekend’s Sahlen’s Six Hours of The Glen with a Ligier JS P30 Nissan for Theodor Olsen Dominic Cicero and Ben Devlin.

It comes nearly four years after initially announcing a LMP2 program for the 2018 season that never materialized although work continued in the background with the father-and-son operation.

Dawson Racing made a lone appearance at the 2018 Roar Before the Rolex 24 pre-season test with its Ligier JS P3 Nissan car with Olsen in IMSA Prototype Challenge but had been absent from the IMSA paddock since.

“It took a bit of time” Dawson told Sportscar365. “Hasbro always wanted to come in with the Transformers brand. We sort of nearly got there in 2019.

“We were going to actually go in ’20 and then COVID came so it was [delayed] another year.

“Then really it took a bit of settling.”

Dawson explained that the program was to go ahead only if it made sense commercially citing Hasbro’s continued involvement as well as its new partner Chevron.

“It’s not a driver-funded project” he said. “I always said that when I stopped I wouldn’t do this again (relying on driver funding).”

With no available parts to upgrade its existing Ligier JS P3 chassis to 2020 LMP3 specification Dawson said they’ve had to lease a Ligier JS P320 from Ligier Automotive North America for this weekend’s debut.

“Max [Crawford] and I got our heads together” he said. “It was a car they upgraded but they haven’t run it since last year.

“It had to be wrapped. We had to put our motor in it because there’s a shortage of motors.

“We were going to lease another car but it fell through after two weeks. We got caught so the only way was to try and lease [the Ligier NA-owned] car.”

While having gotten off to a challenging start to the weekend on Friday Dawson said he feels better prepared after working through a number of items overnight.

“It’s just been a battle” he said. “No timing no driver IDs no this or that.

“We were here until 2 a.m. and did a setup on it and found loads of things. We’re now in the mix.

“It’s been brutal not having been in it for six or seven years.”

Team Planning to Complete LMP3 Season

While having initially announced a two-race program around the pair of Watkins Glen races Dawson said they are in for the remainder of the WeatherTech Championship season.

Olsen and Cicero will pilot the car for the remaining sprint races with Devlin returning for the season-ending Motul Petit Le Mans in November.

“We’re going to run the rest of the season” Dawson said. “The goal is to run LMP3 next year. But I want to see what happens. I been caught [out] in the past.

“What I’ve learned with this is that we need stability. But this weekend has been a bit of an eye-opener actually.

“It’s a struggle but I’m not going to do it wrong and I’m not going to hemorrhage tons of money at it.

“We’ve got corporate partners we have to give value to.”

Dawson said they recently extended its partnership with Hasbro through 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hlcmUtdG8tYnV5LW1vbm9wb2x5LXRhcmdldC1lZGl0aW9uLWdhbWUtc3VtbWVyLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where To Buy Monopoly: Target Edition Game Launching In August 2021,"Target and Hasbro teamed up for an epic collaboration that’ll remind you of your fave place to bargain hunt.

And with Hasbro now back in charge of toys for the entirety of the Ghostbusters franchise they’re bringing back the toys from the last time they had the rights. The Plasma Collection still cranks out movie figures but through Kenner retro branding the original The Real Ghostbusters toys based on the TV cartoon return to stores this season. The original four action figures already arrived on Walmart shelves. Recently however they’ve been joined by The Real Ghostbusters Ecto-1 along with two fan-favorite classic ghost figures: Bug-Eye and Fearsome Flush. Though they sport subtle differences so real collectors can tell them apart from the originals they look close enough to the untrained eye. And as such are likely to hurt the value of the originals. But Hasbro/Kenner made these to play with folks not sit in boxes like the Lost Ark.

Like many toys of the ’80s and ’90s these all feature action play gimmicks. Before the revival of Star Wars and the advent of McFarlane companies deemed such things more important than elaborate sculpts. And for kids that was the correct choice. Even for adults fidgeting at a desk it’s surprising how much more fun these things can create.

Take Fearsome Flush memorable because it’s a haunted toilet. (Oddly one with a Ghostbusters logo on it — maybe it hides out in their HQ a ruse that might work exactly once.) The toy comes with wheels. Roll it forward and the monster eyes and tongue pop out. Keep rolling and they pop back in again. Repeat. It’s fun.

(Special thanks to He Uses Toys! for the loaner of the Egon and Winston figures.)

Bug-Eye’s gimmick is a little different. In fact as a kid it was tough. One basically has to punch or karate chop him in the back and his eye shoots out pop-gun style. It’s much easier as an adult to make that happen. His body is made of soft plastic to allow for said thumping and squeezing. And both his articulated arms can hold the eyeball. The sculpt overall looks more elaborate than a typical animated style figure with a creepy grin like a Boglin and a body with veins all over.

The Real Ghostbusters Ecto-1 of course was the must-have centerpiece of any collection back in the day and the perfect way to display the rerelease figures now. Packaged mostly assembled and with a couple of fun features it’s a great toy even if it may not be the most accurate Ecto-1 ever. It even has a sculpted undercarriage unlike some more recent toys that ostensibly aimed higher.

The car seats two figures in the front and has a back holding area that can fit a lot of stuff. A weapon-enhanced jumpseat attaches either on top of the car or in a groove in the back that allows it to move in and out. This quite likely inspired the side-jumpseat in the new movie’s Ecto-1.

The Real Ghostbusters toys came out during a brief period where all vehicles for action figures suddenly seemed to mandate seat belts. The belt here fits super-tightly and getting it just right may challenge the fingers. But Winston will not fall off. Ironically the front seat has no belt. But getting the driver figure in feels tough enough already.

In an odd design choice the back window is just a sticker. But then the front doors have no windows at all. Clear plastic must just cost more.

Notice the crooked tailpipe? That’s the control lever for the ghost capture claw. (Claws wouldn’t capture vaporous apparitions but kids don’t know that.) Flip it to one side and the claw pulls out on a string. Flip it back and pushing the car forward will reel in the claw. A small orange ghost comes in the box and fits the claw neatly enough.

For around $40 that’s a pretty fun toy. But maybe less so if none of the figures for it seem easy to come by. The Ghostbusters figures came in a standard scale for the time but compared to the modern default of six inches they look little indeed.

The two ghosts on the other hand come in at $14.99 when they show up in stock. That may numerically sound like twice the original price but by current standards it’s downright cheap.

Take a look in the gallery below for many more looks at these toys. Will you pick any up? Let us know in comments.

Defibrillators should be placed in every gym school and sports venue in the country to save people dying from sudden cardiac arrest a leading cardiologist has said.

Professor Guido Pieles a sports cardiologist at the Institute of Sport Exercise & Health (ISEH) also called for mandatory CPR training in the workplace. He suggested health officials should capitalise on the surge of interest in CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation – following Christian Eriksen’s collapse from cardiac arrest while playing for Denmark at Euro 2020 this month.

“CPR is extremely important and can save lives” he told i. “Anyone can do it with a bit of training and we still need to work on creating awareness also providing CPR training to the public. It’s straightforward you don’t need to have any medical knowledge – and knowing what to do when someone has a cardiac arrest will save lives. Every minute without CPR the chance of survival goes down by 7 per cent every minute counts.”

St John Ambulance said it had received a tenfold increase in calls about learning the life-saving technique since Eriksen’s collapse two weeks ago. Searches for CPR advice and defibrillator guides are up 565 per cent and 1900 per cent respectively the charity revealed.

Professor Pieles who is also honorary senior lecturer in congenital and sports cardiology at the Bristol Heart Institute as well as consulting sports cardiologist for Manchester United FC said: “CPR training and life-support courses need to be mandatory maybe in most professions. Then there is funding – it is much cheaper for the Government to provide secondary preventative tools than it is to treat the consequences of cardiac arrest.

“We need to do more to have defibrillators in public places such as schools in sports venues – and I’m not talking about [United stadium] Old Trafford. I’m talking about grassroots sports – in local gyms where we have to really work hard. Definitely at least one in every gym and school. I work in the NHS seeing children with inherited cardiac conditions so it’s equally important to have these in schools which have sports facilities too of course.

“And it’s more important to have it in schools because inherited cardiac diseases are more difficult to detect in children because the heart has not fully grown so you cannot see the diseases [in screening].”

New mobile heart lab launched A mobile cardiac laboratory launched in a drive to protect the cardiovascular health of the nation’s elite athletes is the brainchild of Professor Pieles at The Institute of Sport Exercise & Health in partnership with HCA Healthcare UK and Canon Medical Systems who provide the state-of-the-art imaging equipment While athletes are known for their extraordinary levels of fitness a small yet notable proportion die from an undiagnosed heart disease. Consequently cardiac screening is often recommended for athletes wishing to take part in competitive sport. The laboratory is available to attend any sporting venue in the UK and Europe providing highly specialised cardiac performance evaluations to large numbers of athletes. The lab’s design enables the team of experts to measure athletes’ exercise performance aerobic capacity and heart rhythm alongside live 4-D imaging of the heart during exercise. The heart imaging offers a host of analysis tools to allow for in-depth assessment of cardiac anatomy and function to monitor the athletes’ overall cardiac risk. Professor Pieles said the mobile heart laboratory is available to attend any sporting venue in the UK and Europe. (Photo: HCA Healthcare UK) Professor Pieles said: “The innovative sports cardiology service aims to identify pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and ensure optimal management and follow up thereby reducing the potential for adverse events and loss of life. This will help to provide athletes and their families with peace of mind and offer valuable time and cost efficiencies for sporting organisations.”

The ISEH cardiology team in partnership with HCA Healthcare UK has evaluated more than 30000 athletes and Professor Pieles suggested schools could learn from Premier League academies which have pioneered heart screening for youth team players over the last decade where players are screened from the age of 12.

“Over 90 per cent of heart disease we can pick up in screening many of which can lead to cardiac arrest. There’s a small number which we cannot pick up but with children there’s still a lot of work to do” he said.

The family of a man who suffered a cardiac arrest at a gym and was brought back to life has also called for more defibrillators to be installed at sports venues. Teaching assistant Vinnie Brett 38 from Ramsgate Kent has since been fitted with a heart-starting device like Eriksen has had following tests in hospital. The former Spurs midfielder would have been screened for heart problems every year as a professional footballer but nothing was detected.

Professor Pieles said: “I know the team at Tottenham Hotspur [where Eriksen played for seven years until moving to Inter Milan in 2020] and he would have been screened every year with great expertise. We know screening will not pick up every single case but it is without doubt that screening reduces the risk of cardiac death.”",,,,,,

Major food companies employ virtual armies of chefs food scientists and marketing gurus dedicated to developing test-marketing and (if all goes well) eventually rolling out new products. Both salty and sweet and sometimes both at once these items tend to tempt consumers into eating more sugar salt and/or fat that is good for them. (These are the stories behind America’s favorite cookie brands.)

Along the way though they also please us with their vivid flavors and attractive textures — and when they eventually disappear from the shelves as many of them do we end up missing them even though we realize that they’re not exactly constituents of a healthy diet. (Here though are some healthy versions of old-school junk-food snacks you’d like to try.)

Why do such snack foods get discontinued? In most cases it’s simply a matter of sales. They just don’t generate the revenue that projections called for and so are phased out in favor of the tried-and-true or of other new introductions that might end up doing better.

24/7 Tempo consulted numerous snack food fan pages company histories and rating sites to compile this list of chips candies and other such items that we wish we could eat again right now.

Sometimes we get the chance. Scrapped products may be brought back in some cases either in their original form or with slight variations (or new names). Sometimes the snacks are still made in other countries too such as Mexico Canada or Australia and these may be available by mail order. Collectors also sell unopened packages of the original on eBay and other sites — and some aficionados turn to crowd-sourcing platforms like change.org and ipetitions.com to beg companies to gear up production of their favorites again.

The project is part of the Payara development project which is the third Exxon-led development within the Stabroek block about 200 kilometers offshore Guyana.

According to a statement issued by SBM the project financing was secured by a consortium of 11 international banks and the loan will be drawn in full phased over the construction period of the FPSO.

In addition it was stated that the financing will become non-recourse once the FPSO is completed and the pre-completion guarantee has been released.

The Prosperity FPSO will utilize a design that largely replicates the design of the Liza Unity FPSO. As such the design is based on SBM Offshore’s industry leading Fast4Ward® program that incorporates the company’s new build multi-purpose hull combined with several standardized topsides modules. The FPSO will be designed to produce 220000 barrels of oil per day will have associated gas treatment capacity of 400 million cubic feet per day and water injection capacity of 250000 barrels per day. The FPSO will be spread moored in water depth of about 1900 meters and will be able to store around 2 million barrels of crude oil.

Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited an affiliate of ExxonMobil Corporation is the operator and holds a 45 per cent interest in the Stabroek block Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd. holds a 30 per cent interest and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited holds a 25 per cent interest.

In October 2020 Exxon awarded the Prosperity contract to SBM for the next phase of the Payara development project. Under those contracts SBM will construct install and then lease and operate the Prosperity FPSO for a period of up to two years after which the FPSO ownership and operation will transfer to EEPGL. The award followed completion of front-end engineering and design studies completion of the multi-purpose hull receipt of requisite government approvals and the final investment decision on the project by ExxonMobil and co-venturers in the Stabroek Block.

In January Greg Hill Chief Operating Officer at Hess Corporation said that the hull for the Prosperity FPSO was complete. “Topside construction activities are underway and we expect integration of the hull and topsides to begin at the Keppel Yard in Singapore by year end” he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2007 the 88-acre land parcel has had two owners and for eight years was an unfinished structure that sat untouched.

Thursday evening’s grand opening celebration for Malaysia-based Genting Berhad’s $4.3 billion property included a traditional Asian lion and dragon dance drum performances and a ribbon cutting. But the big event in the porte-cochère of the Conrad Hotel portion of Resorts World will not be the last ceremonial event at the property.

Three areas – a 5000-seat theater in partnership with AEG Zouk Nightclub and the property’s spa – are being held back until the fall and winter months while additional enhancements are completed. Singer Celine Dion will open the theater in November.

Genting Chairman KT Lim during his prepared remarks also teased that the company is already planning for a second phase on the undeveloped portion of the site.

Lim was praised in remarks during the event by Resorts World Las Vegas President Scott Sibella Hilton Hotels CEO Chris Nassetta Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) Clark County Commission Chairwoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick and County Commissioner Tick Segerblom whose district includes the hotel-casino complex.

Segerblom complimented the construction workers who continued to build the resort during the pandemic. Sisolak said following the ceremony that maintaining construction as an essential business last year when other businesses including gaming were ordered closed turned out to be the correct decision.

During the pandemic construction workers finished – along with Resorts World – Allegiant Stadium the Las Vegas Convention Center’s West Hall expansion Circa Casino Resort in downtown and a remodel of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

“All those properties have opened and we’re on our way back” Sisolak said. “That is something no other city can say they have.”

Sisolak has attended every event associated with Resorts World site: The implosion of the Stardust and the subsequent groundbreaking for Boyd Gaming’s Echelon both in 2007; the announcement of the sale of the halted Echelon project and site to Genting in 2013; and a ceremonial groundbreaking for Resorts World in 2015.

“It’s done and (Genting) went through a lot with the property” Sisolak said. “Who back then would have thought we would have a pandemic to also deal with?”

During Thursday evening and well into Friday morning Genting and Resorts World executives basked in the adulation from several thousand invited guests participating in a VIP extravaganza throughout the 117000-square-foot casino. The party progressed onto the five-and-half-acre pool deck where guests were entertained by celebrity DJs on the sixth-floor outdoor pool area that overlooks the Strip. Images from the evening were shown on the property’s 100000 square foot LED screen attached to the south facing hotel tower.

During the evening party guests sampled items from many of Resorts World’s 40 restaurants including breakfast-centric Sun’s Out Buns Out Japanese-themed Kusa Nori and Los Angeles chef Ray Garcia’s Mexican oriented Viva!

Resorts World’s food court dubbed Famous Foods Street Eats offered guests items of Filipino Japanese South Indian Chinese and Singapore origin as well as Texas barbecue and Italian cuisine.

Shortly after a fireworks display from atop Resorts World Las Vegas’ roof the doors were opened for thousands of visitors waiting to visit the Strip’s first new resort in more than a decade.

Within hours of the Cuban Revolution the US crime figure Meyer Lansky known as the “mob’s accountant” telephoned one of his closest confidants in Cuba Jaime Casielles and asked him to hasten to the Nacional. “Lansky knew that [former Cuban president Fulgencio] Batista and his family had fled the country. He said to me: ‘Jaimito we need to go around all the casinos and collect the money before the hordes are out on the street.” Everything on the island had changed.

For over a year the Nacional remained in the hands of its American owners but it wasn’t long before conflicts with the new government arose and the aristocrats and Hollywood stars started to disappear although a new clientele would arrive to bear witness to a new era. On February 20 1960 French writers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir checked into the Nacional having been invited to Cuba by the editor of Revolución magazine Carlos Franqui. Their objective was to see first-hand the political process that was unfolding.

Jean-Paul Sartre and Fidel Castro in 1960. Cortesía del State de Alberto Korda.

“We lived in one of the best neighborhoods in the Hotel Nacional a luxury fortress flanked by two crenelated square towers. Of its guests who came from the United States only two qualities were required: wealth and taste. As these are rarely reconcilable if they possessed the first it was assumed with few inquiries they had the second” Sartre would write on his return to France. “I turn the air conditioning up all the way to enjoy the cold of the rich. With 30 degrees in the shade I go to the windows and watch with sumptuous shudders how those that are passing by perspire. It has not taken me long to find the reasons behind the still indisputable supremacy of the Nacional. It was enough to open the curtains when I arrived: I saw long graceful ghosts stretching toward the sky.”

The palm trees. The same ones that had dazzled Lucky Luciano and other famous guests. But Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir had not come to Cuba for the trees. The following day the couple left for Santiago and from there they went to Holguín where Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro was inaugurating a school in what had once been a military barracks. There they met the Cuban leader and Argentinian guerilla Che Guevara.

The Hotel Nacional which is included on UNESCO’s Memory of the World list. Yander Zamora.

Once back at the Nacional they were told that Guevara would grant them an audience in his office at the National Bank the institution he headed at midnight. “I was still lucky” recalled Sartre. “Journalists and foreign visitors are received warmly and at length but at two or three in the morning.” That meeting was immortalized by the photographer Alberto Korda and later described by Sartre in one of the articles he published over the following months in France Soir and later compiled in the book Hurricane Over Sugar.

“The night did not enter that office. In those men in full wakefulness the best of them sleep did not seem to be a natural necessity but rather a routine that they had more or less freed themselves from. I don’t know when Guevara and his colleagues sleep. I suppose it depends: performance decides; if it dips they stop.” Sartre was also surprised and moved by the youth of the revolutionaries – Castro was 33 and Guevara 31. “The biggest scandal of the Cuban Revolution is not expropriating farms and lands but to have brought boys to power” he said. “Given that a revolution was necessary circumstances dictated that youth should carry it out. Only youth had experienced sufficient anger and angst to undertake it and had sufficient purity to carry it out.”

Guevara told them that night that Cuba’s was a “contrecoup revolution” and Sartre came to the conclusion that it was a process with an ideology “free from elaboration” perhaps “the most original revolution in the world” based on “a direct democracy.” When he was asked in an interview what that meant the author of Being and Nothingness replied: “This Fidel Castro who is continuously on the move in a helicopter or automobile; who often speaks three times a week on the television for hours on end; who explains everything his government does; who discusses every realization; who listens to the peasants and takes note of their complaints; who opens schools in forgotten corners and who argues passionately with his ministers: this is direct democracy.”

Part of the trench system dug on the grounds of the Hotel Nacional during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Yander Zamora.

Sartre and Beauvoir traveled all over the island often accompanied by Castro and on one of those journeys one of the great anecdotes of their trip took place. Arriving at a popular tourist spot they asked for a lemonade. It was lukewarm and Fidel complained asking why Cubans should be subjected to such poor service. The woman replied that her refrigerator was broken and the person who was supposed to fix it had not turned up. As Fidel continued to ask questions the woman cut the conversation short with a phrase that augured what was to come: “You know how it is.”

On March 4 the explosion of La Coubre in the port of Havana was clearly audible from the Hotel Nacional. The French steamer was anchored there with a cargo of 76 tons of weapons and ammunition for the revolution: 136 people were killed and the following day during the memorial Castro gave a famous speech during which for the first time he used his slogan “Homeland or death.” In the stand that day were Sartre Beauvoir and the main leaders of the revolution and it was there that Korda took his signature photograph of Guevara with his beret and defiant gaze which turned the guerrilla into a global revolutionary icon.

The French intellectuals remained in Havana until March 15 1960 and a week after they departed the Nacional was expropriated. When Sartre and Beauvoir returned in October of the same year the hotel had started to fill with literacy teachers frontline revolutionary workers and rural villagers from the mountains who had come to Havana to study. The guests at the Nacional were no longer America’s rich and famous.

In July 1961 three months after his trip into space Soviet astronaut Yuri Gagarin arrived in Cuba and met several times with Castro exchanging caps and participating in the events to mark the anniversary of the 1953 assault on the Moncada barracks. Before delivering his welcome speech Castro asked Gagarin: “How long did it take you to go around the earth?” The cosmonaut replied: “An hour and a half comandante.” Fidel smiled and said: “Then start counting.” Today a bust of Gagarin adorns one of the bars in the hotel in front of portraits of Venezuelan leaders Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro and the former president of Brazil Luiz Inácio da Silva who have all been guests.

The same gardens at the Nacional where Gagarin had strolled were filled with anti-aircraft batteries and trenches a year later during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The location of the hotel on Taganana Hill made it a key strategic point for the defense of Havana if the situation had escalated something which did not occur due to the removal of Soviet warheads from the island by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev without consulting Fidel. This did not go down well with the Cuban leader and soon crowds of protestors thronged the seaside promenade on Havana’s shoreline chanting: “Nikita sissy you don’t take away what you’ve given.”

As the revolution became more radicalized and the US imposed its embargo the Cuban economy was Sovietized and tourism became viewed as an evil while culture on the island entered its gray quinquennium. The jailing of the poet Heberto Padilla in 1971 on charges of “subversive activities” provoked the rupture of a section of the Latin American and European intelligentsia with the revolution. Among the first signatures on a letter of protest over the Padilla case were those of Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.

By the mid-1980s Cuba was welcoming only 150000 tourists per year half of them from Socialist countries and the hotels were falling into disrepair. A story did the rounds: a hotel guest was showering when he felt the bath move beneath his feet. Fearing an embarrassing episode he wrapped himself in a towel and went downstairs to complain. “Look knowing how things are here you’re lucky you didn’t end up in the lobby” the receptionist told him.

A lack of maintenance also started to tell on the Nacional and it was forced to close its doors from 1990-92 to carry out a vast remodeling. When it was reopened Cuba was in the midst of an economic crisis due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union which was known as the “Special Period.” Attracting tourists and foreign currency had become a national priority. Cubans were prohibited from staying in hotels so that rooms could be reserved for dollar-paying guests. The crisis hit Cubans hard with power outages lasting 12 to 14 hours a day and a scarcity of food medicine and public transportation exacerbated by the toughening of the US embargo. Some American humanitarian organizations started to send aid to the island and one of these missions in 1996 was headed by US boxing legend Muhammad Ali. Half a million dollars’ worth of medical supplies were distributed and among the party was the US journalist Gay Talese who had been commissioned to produce a report. In Ali in Havana Talese recounted the difficulties encountered on that five-day trip where the former heavyweight champion was feted as a hero wherever he went.

Ali’s hands shook and he could hardly speak due to the effects of Parkinson’s disease but he was friendly toward his admirers who stopped him in the great lobby of the Nacional to ask for his autograph. “It took him 30 seconds to write his name on whatever card or piece of paper” Talese said. “But he wrote it in full ‘Muhammad Ali.’ He didn’t just write ‘Ali’ to save some time. He has never short-changed his fans.”

The night before they were due to return to the US Castro invited the group to the Palace of the Revolution. Ali and Fidel mocked up a few punches for the cameras and as they were leaving Ali’s wife Yolanda Williams told the Cuban president he would be welcome in their home if he ever visited the US. Castro said that he had been to the US before to participate in a United Nations General Assembly but he had not been allowed to leave his hotel room. “But things change” he added.

However Fidel Castro was mistaken. Things did not change tensions mounted and a year later a bomb went off in the Hotel Nacional.

It’s a better-than-expected start on the path back to normalcy said the general manager of the city-owned hotel that largely serves the Baltimore Convention Center.

“Every week we’re becoming more optimistic in our outlook on the future” said Greg Brown the hotel’s general manager.

Baltimore’s travel and tourism industry is looking to regain its footing after being decimated by the health crisis. In the city and elsewhere lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings and travel wiped out the hospitality business leading to mass layoffs and loss of tourism-related revenue.

The Baltimore Convention Center hasn’t hosted events for more than a year instead serving as a COVID-19 field hospital and mass vaccination and testing center hurting downtown hotels that depend on group and business travelers. Laid off hospitality workers say most jobs have yet to return.

By most accounts leisure tourism is expected to recover more quickly than the meeting and conference business projected to rebound sometime next year at the earliest.

“The last 14-15 months months has been really devastating to our industry here in Baltimore city” Al Hutchinson CEO of Visit Baltimore told city council members during budget hearings earlier this month. “Obviously very little hotel tax revenue has been coming in. And small business hoteliers restaurateurs museums everyone has been really impacted by the pandemic of a lifetime.”

How Baltimore hotels weathered the pandemic

Baltimore hotels weathered the pandemic differently. Some like the Hilton closed during much of the crisis but have reopened. Others remain closed including The Holiday Inn Baltimore Inner Harbor which had been in receivership and shut its doors in November and Embassy Suites by Hilton at St. Paul Place which says it plans to reopen in September.

Last year’s cancellations and postponements cost the Hilton what otherwise would have been a strong year of group and meetings business. But the bulk of events were re-booked for future dates and planners have become more comfortable as vaccines rolled out and restrictions were lifted Brown said. The earliest of those events have been booked for the last three months of this year and into the first quarter of 2022. The Pratt Street hotel has returned to about 30% of pre-pandemic staffing.

“We see a strong return of business the group business in 2022” with some groups finding their first-choice rebooking dates already taken Brown said.

In the wake of lockdowns and global travel restrictions in March 2020 occupancy at the Hyatt Regency Baltimore plummeted from 90% to nearly nothing in a matter of days. The Inner Harbor hotel shut down before resuming limited operations in July 2020. Local leisure travel on weekends helped sustain the business said Ilemona Salifu Hyatt’s area director of sales marketing and events.

The Baltimore Convention Center hasn’t hosted events for more than a year. During the pandemic it served as a COVID-19 field hospital and mass vaccination and testing center.

As restrictions loosen hotel bookings are on the rebound

Now amid loosening restrictions Salifu said “occupancy levels are slowly on the rebound and the hotel is getting back to hosting more weddings social events and mid-size group meetings.”

“The pent-up demand for travel is immense” he added “and with the number of fully vaccinated people growing each day Hyatt is seeing strong demand for its hotels into summer and fall.”

Even group and business travel is returning earlier than expected Salifu said especially in the pharmaceutical information technology and banking and finance industries. New group business booked in the first quarter of this year for future dates is up 55% compared with bookings in the last quarter of 2020 for future dates he said.

Leisure travel appear to be on the mend. Over Memorial Day weekend Baltimore hotels topped 60% average occupancy resulting in the best weekly performance since COVID-19 hit Hutchinson said.

“It does show that there’s a lot of pent-up demand and leisure visitation is beginning to come back” he said. But “it’s definitely going to be a slow grind.”

He is encouraged that seven out of 10 Americans plan to take vacations this summer according to the U.S. Travel Association. To attract East Coast travelers Visit Baltimore created a 30-second TV spot showing scenes of the city that’s airing on Hulu and other streaming platforms in Washington Philadelphia New York City Richmond and Boston.

Baltimore will host its first major event since the start of the pandemic in July when 400 to 800 people come to town for the Destinations International Annual Convention. Attendees will use ballrooms in the Hilton and the convention center and are expected to generate about $800000 in economic impact.

The hotel has welcomed back guests and even hosted about 20 meetings since reopening in April after a year-long closure. Brown says “We think it will be a pretty quick recovery.” In July visitors from two large conventions will stay at the hotel. June 17 2021.

Larger citywide conventions however remain a ways off. The first is scheduled for mid-October when the American Society for Reproductive Medicine is expected to fill area hotels and boost restaurants and attractions. Large conventions will once again be possible after the state closes the coronavirus vaccination and testing site at the convention center by Oct. 1.

The center’s use as a field hospital has added to the booking challenges. Even though the hospital is physically separated from the rest of the facility the presence of patients in the building has deterred some customers.

The convention center has not been given a definitive date for the hospital’s closing that could then be communicated to groups looking to book said Peggy Daidakis the center’s executive director.

The convention center is working with smaller group clients to be able to finalize space in meeting rooms this year as soon as it has a definitive closure date for the hospital Daidakis said. She said her staff has been making plans to prepare the building for re-opening almost since the day it shut down.

“We do have other customers we’re working with now to confirm that they’re still a go to use meeting rooms and ballrooms” she said. “When the customers come back we’ll be ready for them.”

The industry’s slow recovery has been especially difficult for its workers.

Vilma Licona a banquet server and bartender at the Hilton since 2008 who was laid off in March 2020 was only recently called back but only for about four days a month.

“All this time it’s been so hard” Licona said. “At this point we have no business.”

Licona 51 said she has been unable to send as much money as she normally would to help support her parents in her native Honduras. The Columbia resident also is worried about her unemployment benefits decreasing next month when Maryland is set to stop participating in pandemic-related unemployment programs.

When will business return to pre-pandemic levels?

Pre-pandemic levels of business won’t return until next year according to 46% of respondents in a winter survey by Meeting Professionals International. Another 29% expect a recovery to stretch into 2023. Yet that’s more optimistic than a U.S. Travel Association outlook that says it could take three more years to return to 2019 business levels.

“Now that the vaccine has rolled out people want to meet” said Melinda L. Burdette director of events for Meeting Professionals International. But “we all have to still get over our fear of gathering together because we’ve been shuttered for all of this time.”

To capture business as it rolls out hotels are stepping up health and safety protocols to ease people back into large meetings. They are working with meeting planners to tailor health protocols to specific groups’ needs and comfort levels. And they’re looking to new technology to add more options for virtual components to complement in-person meetings.

Hilton calls its new meetings and events program EventReady offering features such as sanitizing stations room set ups and meal services customized for physical distancing more space for attendee flow and contactless check in and check out.

Hyatt recently launched “Together by Hyatt” to train planners to design in-person or hybrid events and to offer artificial intelligence technology to enhance the remote experience.

And since February Marriott International has hosted more than 3000 meeting planners at Marriott hotels in cities around the country allowing them to step into a “hybrid meeting” during a 90-minute tour.

More than 500 planners attended tours at a Marriott hotel in Bethesda where the company is based for demonstrations such as how to set up on-site COVID testing and temperature screening areas how to keep general and break-out sessions socially distanced how to re-design food and beverage areas and how to best use technology for remote attendees.

Kathy Mouw Marriott’s vice president of global sales for the U.S. and Canada said Marriott launched the program because “we were getting the sense that customers were reluctant to travel or companies had policies preventing them from attending in-person meetings.

The hope was to allow people planning events for groups or corporations to see in person how hybrid and COVID-safe events can be put together and customized.

Mouw said the sessions are making a difference.

“We do believe these labs are influencing decisions… to return to in-person events sooner than we than expected” Mouw said. “We’ve seen a significant decrease in cancelations of meetings already booked.”

For the foreseeable future meeting planners will need to work with venues to “create a safe bubble” Burdette said coordinating vaccine mask wearing and COVID testing policies and becoming familiar with mandates in states that are candidates for hosting events.

“We’re stepping our toes in the water at this point from a meeting standpoint” she said. “We’ll have to figure out what is their comfort level and present a compelling reason for them to come.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8wNi8yNi9oaWx0b24tdG8tb3Blbi1seHItYW5kLWN1cmlvLXByb3BlcnRpZXMtaW4tdGVsLWF2aXYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton to open LXR and Curio properties in Tel Aviv – Business Traveller,"Hilton has announced plans for two new properties in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.

Police Break Up ‘Exorcism' in Home Depot Lumber Aisle,"Straight out of a Conjuring movie? Police in Lackawanna County announced they broke up a reported 'exorcism' that happened inside a Home Depot in Dickson City Tuesday.

According to a Dickson City Police Department Facebook post the paranormal incident happened around 3:26 p.m. Monday when police were called to reports of disorderly people in the store's lumber aisle.

Once they arrived police say a group was reportedly performing an 'exorcism' for the dead trees within the aisle.

The Department's Facebook post has upwards of 300 comments and 746 shares with some people commenting that the group 'really wanted to take possession of that lumber'.

The Equality Act passed the House of Representatives in February but is yet to be passed by the Senate.

All but three Republicans in the House voted against LGBTQ+ equality. Those 206 politicians were bolstered in part by huge donations from US corporations.

Amazon for instance donated over $450000 to politicians who voted against the Act according to data from The Center for Responsive Politics for the 2020 election cycle.

But the company is still happy to garner profits from queer identities. The company offers a special Pride store offering unicorn pool floats and rainbow-striped K-Swiss sneakers.

Fran Tirado a writer and LGBTQ+ strategist is critical of these advertising efforts. “In an ideal world there would be no Pride campaigns. Brands and companies profiting off marginalized identities with bad rainbow-washed advertising ploys is an abhorrent tradition of this country” he said.

It’s not just products. Tirado watches his inbox get flooded every June with work requests. “Most queer and trans folks who get wrapped into any kind of marketing initiative this month often end up feeling exhausted underpaid tokenized and exploited. But because we exist under capitalism Pride campaigns are obligatory – and often a key source of income for queer and trans people in media and entertainment spaces.”

Walmart has also donated over $400000 to politicians that sought to block equality. The food giant has changed its Twitter avatar this month to be a rainbow colored-version of its logo.

Reporting record earnings (tied to pandemic-induced home improvement projects) Home Depot has also shown support for politicians that blocked the Equality Act. The company’s billionaire co-founder Ken Langone is a longtime donor to the Republican party.

Like Amazon and Walmart Home Depot also makes donations to Democratic candidates (for instance giving a quarter of a million dollars to the Biden campaign). Many firms donate to candidates from both parties to hedge their bets when it comes to political influence.

AT&T also provided a huge boost to Republican politicians trying to prevent a federal law that would protect LGBTQ+ people. The company donated over $1m to 163 different Republicans including Steve Scalise ($22150) and Kevin McCarthy ($20881).

These totals only include donations to politicians that voted against the bill. But many corporations also made large donations to Mitch McConnell (for example AT&T gave him $56295 in the 2020 cycle) despite his persistent obstructions to the Equality Act. In 2020 McConnell then the Senate majority leader refused to bring the act to the Senate floor.

There has been widespread anger in the LGBTQ+ community in recent years over the perceived corporate hijacking of Pride marches. In 2019 the Reclaim Pride Coalition launched the Queer Liberation March as an “antidote to the corporate-infused police-entangled politician-heavy Parades that now dominate Pride celebrations in a grotesque expression of societal forms of marginalization and oppression for Queer and Trans people”.

For Tirado engaging with big brands is often necessary but “holding them accountable is a crucial part of how we ethically engage with these campaigns”. He adds that’s why it’s added salt to the wound for any company to brag “allyship” and a rainbow logo while also donating to anti-queer efforts. “If you’re going to perform advocacy we need to see it matched on your dollars too resourcing queer and trans communities year-round.”

This year’s Queer Liberation March in New York will take place on Sunday the same day as New York City Pride one of the largest annual Pride marches in the world. Amazon Walmart Home Depot and others will not be welcome.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raXJvNy5jb20vbmV3cy90cmVuZGluZy9ncm91cC1ob2xkaW5nLWV4b3JjaXNtLWRlYWQtdHJlZXMtYXNrZWQtbGVhdmUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLWhvbWUtZGVwb3QvM0VNTTQ1Q1E2UkFTTkxETVo3NktWWlY3REUv0gGUAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyZW5kaW5nL2dyb3VwLWhvbGRpbmctZXhvcmNpc20tZGVhZC10cmVlcy1hc2tlZC1sZWF2ZS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtaG9tZS1kZXBvdC8zRU1NNDVDUTZSQVNOTERNWjc2S1ZaVjdERS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Group holding ‘exorcism’ for dead trees asked to leave Pennsylvania Home Depot,"We’re Sorry!

At the beginning of summer 2020 the founder of An Angel's Choice Adoption Agency Inc. became the first Black president of the Rotary Club of Sherwood ... and while some Rotary clubs shut down their operations because of covid-19 she increased her club's membership substantially and increased its service-project output.

Not bad for someone who became involved in Rotary only four short years ago when she and her husband were invited to attend an informational meeting.

""It has been a blessing even though it was a pandemic"" says Oglesby 61. ""I had [club members] think outside the box on a lot of things; we accomplished a lot of things.""

Instead of losing people as she at first feared she would Oglesby welcomed 21 new members. She even started a new Rotarian pet lover's satellite club. Meanwhile the Rotary Club of Sherwood won seven district Rotary awards for the first time including Club of the Year. Oglesby received two personal awards: President of the Year and the Rotary Opens Opportunities award for starting the pet lover's club. That club made its public debut with an early-June pet parade that included about 24 dogs including Oglesby's 7-year-old rat terrier Electra -- ""She had her little dress on.""

The club members usually do a fundraiser at Outback Steakhouse serving customers at the restaurant and keeping a portion of ticket sales to raise scholarship money for Sherwood high-school seniors. This year they switched to a takeout format and brought their proceeds to an all-time high. They also made more money than ever before with their 5K another Rotary fundraiser that went all-virtual. They increased their collection of gift cards for the needy.

Then they sent about $350 to Rotary International to provide wheelchairs in India to those in need. They took books to the schools. They did Healthy Smiles introducing in the schools a video about dental care by a local dentist delivering dental-care packets to students and reaching more schools than in the past.

""So this was a very very good year"" Oglesby says. ""We will adapt a lot of those things that we did during the pandemic for the future because it worked.""

Oglesby hands over the gavel on Wednesday but won't have time to rest on her laurels. She is preparing to assume the role of assistant governor in her district a role she takes on Thursday. She will be a liaison to the district governor to help the five clubs of which she's in charge.

'EXUDES CONFIDENCE'

Oglesby ""exudes confidence and is very driven"" says Beverly Williams Sherwood City Council member and fellow Rotarian. ""As president of a Rotary club you take your passion and lead your team of fellow Rotarians on projects of service. Well one or two projects was not enough. Everywhere Michelle looked she found another service idea that she thought we must do. She was not afraid of wearing us out.""

Veronica Neal Oglesby's friend of about a decade finds herself impressed with ""Michelle's ability to break down barriers as an African-American woman and do it with such boldness and confidence. I love that she always takes the initiative and achieves things that some only dream of and do with such grace.""

A major reason Oglesby had all the time and energy she did for her club: An Angel's Choice was put on hold. Covid-19 halted adoptions just as it halted nearly everything else. The last baby whose adoption she arranged was born in September 2020.

""I have to think that God put a pause on the adoption [agency] for me to focus on Rotary"" she says. ""I spent a lot of time a lot of hours learning researching encouraging to get our criteria done because it was more of a challenge.""

PAYING LIFE FORWARD

An Angel's Choice -- which offers private adoptions including semi-open closed and open adoptions -- has its origin in Oglesby's personal story.

She and her twin brother spent their first 13 months of life in St. Vincent's Hospital and Infant Asylum known to Chicagoans as St. Vincent's Orphanage. They were adopted by a couple who raised them on Chicago's South Side. ""Although it was indeed a good home we lived in a very strict home where children [were] to be seen and not heard"" she recalls. ""There wasn't a lot of conversation about life -- things that I believe should have been revealed.""

Oglesby was 12 when she found out she'd been adopted. She and another child were on the playground seesaw and another girl wanted to get on. ""I said 'Well it's not your turn yet' or something."" The other girl became angry and lashed out: ""'That's why nobody likes you because you was adopted.'

""And I remember running home and [saying] 'Mom! Mom! Somebody said I was adopted'"" Oglesby says.

Her parents sat her and her brother down and told them the truth that their birth mom was unable to take care of them ... ""but you know you're ours; we love you"" they emphasized.

At age 17 Oglesby found herself pregnant by a young man who was in the military and didn't want the pregnancy to endanger his career.

""He said 'get an abortion' and it was more like ... threatening."" She felt she couldn't go to her parents who had not discussed the birds and the bees with her. So she had the abortion and kept silent about it for years. ""It's that shame factor ... You've already [done] something against the Ten Commandments"" and Oglesby didn't want to be judged.

The now anti-abortion Oglesby speaks openly about her experience certain that God has forgiven her for what she did in her past.

""Since I've come out with my story my gosh [I've found that] there's so many women that have had abortions. ... I did the March for Life and so many came and said 'Thank you for sharing that. I've never told anybody that I had an abortion.' I say 'Well it's freeing ... because one thing you know is God has forgiven you. What man says I don't care.'""

Oglesby graduated in 1977 from the former Unity High School in Chicago. She had aspirations to be an obstetrician- gynecologist ""because I love babies"" she says. She attended college for one year but wasn't feeling it so she moved to Memphis to pursue a modeling career instead. She did runway as well as print modeling but eventually decided not to take that career any further due to industry demands. It was also in Memphis meanwhile that she her met and married her former husband and father of her son.

Ultimately Oglesby decided to switch gears and go to business management school and as a backup cosmetology school. She didn't finish her business management degree. ""Life happens -- you get married you have a child. And I just went to work."" She limited her cosmetology work to pedicures.

ONWARD TO ARKANSAS

Oglesby also taught modeling in Memphis as well as Mobile Ala. and in Arkansas. That's not what brought her to the Natural State however -- AutoZone the car-parts retailer did. She'd become a regional loss prevention manager for the company and was tapped to oversee 62 stores in Arkansas. Oglesby moved to Malvern in 1999.

""[When] we were driving to Malvern we passed by Sherwood. I said 'Oh Sherwood -- that sounds like a nice town.'"" Oglesby told herself that she was going to live there one day.

Sure enough in 2000 she made Sherwood her home.

Meanwhile she'd gotten to know her now-husband Mason Oglesby in 1999; he too was working for AutoZone. Both had marriages that were troubled; both went through divorces in 2000. Mason Oglesby was also in the military serving nearly 30 years in the Army as a sergeant and drill instructor. After the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks he was sent to help train soldiers who were about to be deployed. He spent a year at Fort Sill Okla. doing so and the couple married there. (They will celebrate their 20-year anniversary in December.)

When AutoZone downsized Oglesby went to work for Home Depot. Later her widowed adoptive father became ill in Mobile where he lived at the time. She brought him to Arkansas to care for him. Leaving Home Depot to lighten her load a bit she went on to spend three years working for a family medical center.

Then came an opportunity to work with another adoption agency which she did until it closed in 2013. A friend in North Carolina who also works with people wishing to adopt encouraged Oglesby to open up her own adoption agency.

Oglesby and her husband ""prayed about [An Angel's Choice] in May of 2013"" and began the process she remembers adding that they raised money for the agency by cooking chicken dinners. They received their license in August and handled their first adoption case in September of that year. To date An Angel's Choice has placed 49 babies in 47 homes. ""That's not a lot but ... I want to be hands-on"" Oglesby says. ""I want quality not quantity. I go to every birth"" even providing limited assistance in a couple of cases.

PROVIDING SHELTER

The adoption agency wasn't Oglesby's only vision. So many of the young women she worked with were homeless. She wanted to provide a place where they could come and live while going through the adoption process. In 2018 the Oglesbys came up with Angel's Choice Haven. They rented a house and began temporarily housing expectant mothers starting with a woman and her two children.

Maintaining the home proved difficult. ""We moved four different times because of different situations. And we just moved again this past April."" The Oglesbys are now looking to get a duplex to house more than one mother at a time. And Oglesby plans to teach life skills to future Haven residents.

Jason Bogardus pastor of Cornerstone Bible Fellowship and Oglesby's pastor remembers that one of his first conversations with Oglesby ""concerned her desire to start a place to help young pregnant girls get established.

""Her faith drives her to action"" he says. ""Getting Angel's Choice Haven ... off the ground was a very difficult task. Despite numerous setbacks she continued to pursue her goal of providing this safe space.""

Neal has witnessed firsthand Oglesby's care for a pregnant homeless woman.

""She provided food clothes and shelter for her to get her where she needed to be. Daily she checked on this young woman and ultimately gave her another option for her soon-to-be-born child to be placed in a loving home.""

Also on Oglesby's to-do list: carrying on with An Angel's Choice and its mission not just to shepherd adoptions but to educate people about adoption.

""When I speak about adoption the first thing that people [think about] is foster care or DHS"" the state Department of Human Services. ""That's the misconception"" Oglesby says. ""There's private adoption which is totally different from foster-care adoption.""

Needless to say Oglesby has on more than one occasion talked an expectant mother out of having an abortion when called in by a pregnancy counselor to explain the adoption option.

""I tell them my story. I tell them the difference between the adoptions and then a lot of times they'll go for it.""

HOME LIFE

At home Oglesby enjoys rock painting -- a visit to her home and a view of the front and backyards makes this evident -- and canvas painting. She's hosted paint-and-sip parties and with pandemic conditions improving hopes to start those back up.

Empty nesters with five grown children between them Oglesby and her husband serve on the praise team at Cornerstone Church. They're big cruisers and plan to resume that soon.

And she's getting the agency back up and running doing some speaking doing several radio spots that are running right now making herself visible on social media and seeking (and getting) donations for the Haven duplex.

""I just feel something big is going to happen"" Oglesby says. ""And I think maybe [God] was waiting for me to get this Rotary [duty fulfilled]"" -- wanting to see how well she could occupy her time while not getting paid.

""It's a reason that it's happened. God knows what it is and [I] just have to keep in prayer. And he'll send me the person or persons that really need that help.""

It began as an informal class titled the “Homosexual Revolution” at a coffee shop in May of 1969. Koreen Phelps and Stephen Irhig talked about “homosexuals’” role in the sexual revolution and used the class to connect with gay people in their community.

“Because of their vulnerability Irhig and Miss Phelps have asked other homosexuals to band together” the Minnesota Daily reported on June 6 1969. “If someone loses his job because an employer finds out his sex preferences the group will picket the business. If somebody is arrested for his activities we will protest.”

It quickly transformed from a class to an official University of Minnesota student group in the fall of 1969 titled FREE (Fight Repression of Erotic Expression).

“This group that they created was created out of love and compassion” said Noah Barth public historian and creator of the documentary “FREE You: Minnesota’s Fight for Gay Liberation.”

FREE was short-lived as it disbanded by the mid-1970s but it was deeply influential according to Barth. Barth said the group sparked the LGBTQ+ rights movement in Minneapolis.

“[FREE] was part of a larger movement for LGBTQ rights that emerged” said Rachel Mattson curator of the Tretter Collection for GLBT Studies.

The fight around employment discrimination

In 1970 Michael McConnell and FREE president Jack Baker publicly applied for a marriage license in Hennepin County but were denied. Before attempting to get married McConnell had been offered a job at the St. Paul campus but after the Board of Regents found out that McConnell was gay they took the job offer back.

FREE wanted to do more than protest hiring discrimination 一 the group aimed to create change within the University as well. In 1970 they sent out letters to several large corporations asking if they’d hire a “homosexual” person. Honeywell said they would not knowingly hire someone who was gay.

FREE then began lobbying the University to bar not only Honeywell from recruiting students but any organization that discriminated against “homosexual” people. In 1971 the University announced that they would bar companies from recruiting on campus if they would deny a student a job based on factors other than their academics.

Twenty years later Minnesota became the first state to outlaw discrimination based on gender or sexuality in 1993.

“FREE has this lineage of very tangible activism that catapults the state into its LGBTQ progressivism” Barth said.

FREE’s impact on today

Despite decades of activism LGBTQ people still face many barriers.

“I don’t think [FREE’s goal] has been accomplished” Mattson said.

There’s more work to be done but Minneapolis has come far since 1969. There’s a well-known Pride festival many LGBTQ people feel safe to publicly express affection toward their partners throughout various parts of the city and younger people are more comfortable with gender-neutral pronouns.

What began as two gay friends searching for a community developed into a group that would influence LGBTQ activists for years to come.

“The difference between a gay person and a hip gay person is self-acceptance. A hip person is not ashamed of what he is nor does he see himself as sick” FREE founder Ihrig told the Minnesota Daily in 1969.

*The Minnesota Daily has chosen to use the word “homosexual” in some places throughout this article to authentically represent how the original activists in FREE described themselves.

Author’s note: FREE has a lively history and this article barely scratched the surface. If you want to learn more check out Noah Barth’s documentary Bruce Johansen’s article or contact Rachel Mattson and visit the Jean-Nickolaus Tretter GLBT Archives.

The appellate court in a lead judgment by Justice Obietonbara Daniel-Kalio ordered the return of the winding-up petition to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court Justice John Tsoho for re-assignment to a new judge.

Justice Daniel-Kalio’s April 1 2021 judgment whose certified true copy was obtained by our correspodent on Friday was consented to by Justices Obande Ogbuinya and Onyakachi Otisi who were other members of the three-man panel.

Justice Jude Dagat of the Federal High Court had in 2016 struck out Ecobank’s winding-up petition after upholding the argument by Honeywell’s lawyer Mr Bode Olanipekun (SAN) that the winding-up petition amounted to an abuse of court processes in view of a pending suit marked FHC/L/CS/1219/2015 which three subsidiaries of Honeywell Group Limited had earlier filed against Ecobank to challenge the bank’s claim that they were indebted.

Displeased with Justice Dagat’s decision Ecobank had through its lawyer Mr Kunle Ogunba (SAN) gone on appeal contending that Justice Dagat was wrong to have struck out its winding-up petition against Honeywell Group Limited.

Ogunba in the appeal contended that the winding-up petition by Ecobank did not constitute an abuse of court processes because the parties in the winding-up petition were different from the parties in the earlier suit filed by Honeywell Group Limited’s subsidiaries – Anchorage Leisures Limited; Siloam Global Services Limited; and Honeywell Flour Mills Plc.

But Honeywell’s lawyer Olanipekun urged the Court of Appeal to dismiss Ecobank’s appeal and uphold Justice Dagat’s decision.

However the three-man panel agreed with Ecobank rather than Honeywell and reversed Justice Dagat’s ruling.

In the panel’s lead judgment Justice Daniel-Kalio said he found that contrary to Justice Dagat’s decision the parties in the winding-up petition were different from the parties in the earlier suit by Honeywell’s subsidiaries before Justice Mohammed Idris. He said Justice Dagat was wrong to have tagged the winding-up petition as an abuse of court processes and dismiss it.

Justice Daniel-Kalio held “The appellant’s petition for winding-up was filed by the appellant Ecobank Nigeria Limited against Honeywell Group. In the matter before Idris J in suit No: FHC/L/CS/1219/2015 on the other hand the parties were Anchorage Leisures Limited; Siloam Global Limited; and Honeywell Flour Mills Plc. Straightaway the parties are clearly not the same… The ruling of the lower court striking out the petition is wrong as there was no abuse of court processes as there was no multiplicity of suits involving the same parties.

“The ruling of the lower court is therefore hereby set aside. It is ordered that the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court shall re-assign the hearing of the appellant’s petition to another judge of the Federal High Court.”

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

The ultrasonics business that originated in Jim Bullen’s garage in 1971 is now an “ultrasonic machining powerhouse” and globally recognized leader in the production of high-quality components used in semiconductors MEMS transportation defense & aerospace medical & life sciences industries. Half a century later Bullen Ultrasonics remains a privately held company owned by Jim’s son-in-law Steve Brown and daughter Vicki Brown and their family.

“I know that Jim would be proud to see the company doing what it’s doing today staying true to our values and committed to excellence in every way” Brown said. “Because we’ve remained committed to our family values Bullen has been able to accomplish so much more than technical output over the last 50 years. The beauty of a family business means that we have the freedom to push the boundaries and innovate uniquely. We’ve built things no one else has built; we’ve reached markets others hadn’t touched and created value for our customers in unique and innovative ways.”

Fifty years ago Bullen Ultrasonics began as a small group of engineers that repaired old ultrasonic machines and sold them globally to in-need countries like India. In the early 1990s led at the time by Steve Brown and Mary Bullen the business started working alongside IBM and Howmet Aerospace and took on a newfound trajectory.

Around that same time Bullen’s engineers began working with Lam Research (LRCX) in California. What started as a small job with Lam quickly turned into a more significant project and Bullen acquired even more customers through a network of semiconductor manufacturers looking for similar ultrasonic solutions.

This series of events propelled Bullen to dive deep into the silicon production world which ultimately led to the company’s differentiation in the ultrasonics space. The Bullen team decided to alter its supply chain by growing its own silicon crystal in 1997. Despite its small size and humble roots Bullen was the only crystal grower in the world growing wafer-quality silicon for non-wafers at the time. By 2006 they had 13 crystal growers. They eventually sold these silicon growing and processing assets to Lam Research now known as Silfex. It continues to experience growth at its Eaton and Springfield Ohio facilities.

Today Tim Beatty serves as the company’s president proudly preserving the DNA of the company. “While I embrace the opportunity to carry on the legacy of the Bullen family as the company’s president I also recognize that everything that’s happened in these last 50 years can be traced back to our employees” said Beatty. “We have incredibly talented people working for us. Everywhere I turn our employees strive to make a difference for our customers in their homes and within their communities. This positive culture I believe is created by people and fostered by leadership.”

HPQ,HP Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcml0aG9sdHouY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvd2hhdC1pZi13ZS1oYWQtMTk4MHMtYW5kLTkwcy1pbmZsYXRpb24taW5zdGVhZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What if we had 1980's and '90s inflation instead? - The Big Picture,"Peter Boockvar is the CIO of Bleakley Advisory Group and Editor of The Boock Report.

So Powell was asked yesterday if he sees the possibility of 1970’s style inflation. He of course said no but his problem and that of the Fed takes place if we just see 1980’s and 1990’s inflation. In the 1980’s core CPI averaged 6.1%. In the 1990’s it averaged 3.2% only to ‘slow’ further to 2.2% in the aughts. By the way core inflation averaged 6.4% in the 1970’s where the high print was 11.7% in 1975 and the peak in the cycle was 13.6% in June 1980.

Zero short rates QE running at a $1.4 Trillion annualized pace and a 1.47% 10 yr yield does not mix well with a 3% inflation rate on any consistent basis. At least a level of 2% the markets have been trained like a dog by the Fed but even at 2% the Fed’s current policy is way off sides relative to rates are now. If we had a fed funds rate of 3-4% and a 10 yr yield just above that we’d at least have a market shock absorber to any inflation surprise. That no longer exists globally.

Those that think that the excessive rise in inflation is just a temporary thing seem to be relying on used car prices and lumber missing what is going on everywhere else where every day there seems to be more stories about price increases. If you didn’t see in yesterday’s WSJ “The global chip shortage is pushing up prices of items such as laptops and printers and is threatening to do the same to other top selling devices including smartphones. Price increases are snowballing their way through suppliers and key materials in chip making.”

“A laptop geared toward videogamers – made by Taiwanese manufacturer ASUSTek Computer Inc – that Amazon lists as its bestseller rose from $900 to $950 this month according to Keepa a site that tracks prices. The cost of a popular HP Inc. Chromebook rose to $250 from $220 at the beginning of June. HP has raised consumer PC prices by 8% and printer prices by more than 20% in a year according to Bernstein Research…Digi-Key Electronics one of the US’s largest electronic component distributors has raised prices of semi related components by roughly 15% this year…Certain components now cost as much as 40% more.”

There is a story on BN today saying “US restaurants faced with higher food and labor costs are raising menu prices at a much faster pace than historical rates insistent on preserving profits after an arduous year. From local restaurants to national chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill owners have boosted prices by as much as 5% in the past few weeks alone. Even at fast food companies that were locked in price wars just a couple of years ago to win over cost conscious customers increases aren’t taboo anymore.” They interviewed Andrew Koumi an owner of 6 Green Market Cafe’s in Tampa Florida and he said he “isn’t too worried about standing out with his price increases because ‘everyone’s doing it. Some people are doing it really drastically.”

The inflation breakeven in the 5 yr TIPS has rebounded by 9 bps in just the past two days after last week’s FOMC meeting induced drop as people this week question the resolve of the Fed to remove its extreme policy in a timely fashion relative to the economic realities.

Shifting to the June global PMI’s ahead of the US one in a few hrs Japan’s manufacturing and services index fell 1 pt m/o/m with manufacturing slipping by 1.5 pts while services rose .7 pts but is still below 50 at 47.2 in response to the still uneven reopenings. Markit said “Panel members commonly associated disruption to operating conditions to ongoing Covid restrictions coupled with severe supply chain pressures notably for manufacturers.” Businesses though became more optimistic “that business conditions would improve in the year ahead and to a greater extent than that seen in May” as the vaccine rollout ramps up and more restrictions are eased.

In Australia their composite index fell 2 pts m/o/m with both components lower. Markit said similar to the Japan commentary “Renewed movement restrictions in the Victorian state and supply constraints stood out as two key reasons weighing on the growth momentum for Australia.” Stagflationary situations are global.

In the Eurozone its manufacturing and services PMI composite index rose to 59.2 from 57.1 and was all led by services as the manufacturing component was unchanged m/o/m but still a growth driver. Services was helped by “the easing of virus fighting measures in many eurozone member states notably in hospitality.” Here were the comments on inflation: “Average input prices rose at a rate exceeded only once (in September 2000) over the 23 yr survey history. A record increase in manufacturers’ material prices was accompanied by the steepest increase in service costs since July 2008 the latter reflecting widespread reports of higher supplier prices increased fuel and transport costs plus rising wage pressures.” As for the ability to pass this on? “Average prices charged for goods and services meanwhile rose at by far the fastest pace since comparable data for both sectors were first available in 2002 with prices rising in each sector at rates not exceeded for approximately two decades.” And the ECB is still conducting emergency QE on top of regular QE on top of negative rate policy.

In the UK its composite index fell 1.2 pts m/o/m with both components lower m/o/m although the index is still above 60 at 61.7. Optimism remained about the outlook but did moderate to a 5 month low. As for prices “The rate of input cost inflation accelerated for the 5th month running and was the joint-fastest on record equal with that seen in June 2008. While inflation continued to be led by the manufacturing sector service providers also posted a marked increase in input prices. In turn the rate of output price inflation hit a fresh record high for the 2nd month running.” The Bank of England meets tomorrow.

Inflation breakevens are bouncing too in Europe in response and I will say this I’m amazed at the broad level of nonchalance on inflation and that just magically in the face of the most widespread inflation pressures being seen in 40+ years that it is just going to all of a sudden flame out back to pre Covid trends.

Finally mortgage apps were up slightly w/o/w but remain sharply lower y/o/y. With the 7 bps increase in the average 30 yr mortgage rate to 3.18% purchases rose .6% w/o/w but are still down 14.2% y/o/y. Refi’s were up by 2.8% w/o/w but down 9.4% y/o/y. We know crystal clear what is going on in the housing market so I’m not going to pontificate again here ahead of new home sales later today.

Aerodynamics have played a key part in the design of the bike dubbed the WMC250EV and as such it has a massive hole in it that runs from the very front through to the rear. Ordinarily the engine of a motorcycle is located directly beneath the fuel tank but as the WMC250EV doesn’t have a fuel tank nor does it have a big combustion engine there is a massive void beneath the seat and handlebars.

White Motorcycle Concepts refers to this feature as the V-Air and claims that it reduces drag by up to 70 per cent compared to a normal motorcycle.

Located beneath the V-Air is the powertrain the company dubs ‘D-Drive.’ It consists of two 20 kW electric motors at the front wheel and two 30 kW AC motors that power the rear wheel. That results in a combined 100 kW (134 hp) with power fed through a 15 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. Top Gear notes that most components are made from either carbon fiber or aluminum to reduce the weight.

All up the bike weighs 300 kg (661 lbs) which is heavy by motorcycle standards but as the bike is so aerodynamic it will be very fast. Robert White the man behind the company wants to break both the British and world electric land speed records over the coming 12 months. To do so he will need to top the current two-way record of 245.10 mph (394.4 km/h) and one-way speed of 253 mph (407 km/h).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy82MjctaHAtYm13LW01LWNzLWlzLXNsb3dlci10aGFuLTYxNy1ocC1tOC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,627-HP BMW M5 CS Is Slower Than 617-HP M8 Competition,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy82MjctaHAtYm13LW01LWNzLWlzLXNsb3dlci10aGFuLTYxNy1ocC1tOC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3Rha2UtYS1sb29rLWF0LXRoaXMtbmV3LW1lcmNlZGVzYW1nLTIyNTAtaHAtYm9hdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take A Look At This New Mercedes-AMG 2250 Hp Cigarette Racer,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3Rha2UtYS1sb29rLWF0LXRoaXMtbmV3LW1lcmNlZGVzYW1nLTIyNTAtaHAtYm9hdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The firm was also selected as the “Most Inspiring Team” in the People’s Choice Award.

The IBM Watson AI XPRIZE Challenge was launched in 2016 to promote the use of AI to solve the world’s most pressing problems.

Aifred Health a Montreal-based digital health company focused on providing support for clinical decisions for mental health won second place getting a $1 million prize. Marinus Analytics a Pittsburg US-based firm that uses AI to quickly turn big data into actionable intelligence helps fight human trafficking by saving hours and sometimes days of investigative time to find traffickers and recover victims. Marinus came in third getting a $500000 prize. A total of over 150 global teams took part in the competition.

The jury evaluated each team based on its performance in four parameters: achieved technical impact evidenced real-world impact scalability of real-world impact and ethics and safety the XPRIZE and IBM Watson statement said.

Malaria kills more than 400000 people yearly most of whom are children under the age of five and greatly impedes developing economies. The disease has been eliminated from many countries through large-scale operations that targeted the water bodies in which the malaria-bearing mosquitoes breed.

However similar operations have failed in several African countries due to planning and operational complexities stemming from dispersed geography and tropical climate. Zzapp tries to solve this problem through technology that increases the cost-effectiveness of such operations enabling them to go ahead even when only limited budgets are available and “under the most challenging environmental conditions” Zzapp said in a statement last week announcing the win.

The app developed by Zzapp creates custom models built with AI-based tools of IBM Watson to predict the number of small water bodies caused by weather helping optimize the timing for launching operations to kill the larvae of mosquitos deposited in these waters.

Zzapp uses AI to tailor malaria-control strategies per village or neighborhood then breaks down these strategies into tasks the Jerusalem startup said in a statement. These tasks are given to fieldworkers via the mobile app which guides them in the field and enables them to easily upload data to a designated dashboard. All of this helps monitor and orchestrate the elimination campaign.

ZzappMalaria’s machine learning capabilities continuously improve the system’s efficacy from one operation to the next the startup said in its statement.

The app was designed specifically to address local needs: it has low battery consumption does not require continuous internet connectivity and works well even on less advanced smartphones. The technology has been tested in six countries across Africa and has been proven to increase coverage of water bodies shorten work time improve coordination between the workers and “significantly increase the effectiveness of the operation” the statement said.

“We will dedicate the prize money to one ambitious goal: demonstrating that rapid malaria elimination is possible in Sub Saharan Africa” said Arnon Houri-Yafin CEO and founder of ZzappMalaria in the statement.

Zzapp founded in 2016 is a subsidiary of Sight Diagnostics a company that has developed an AI-based medical device to detect and diagnose malaria via a finger prick of blood and the maker of the Sight OLO a hematology analyzer that performs blood count (CBC) tests in minutes using only two drops of blood from a finger prick or venous blood sample.

Zzapp’s malaria initiative has won several grants among them from the Gates Foundation and the Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC) and has been conducting anti-malaria operations in Ghana Zanzibar Kenya and Ethiopia the statement said.

In a report released on Friday U.S. State Department released an assessment reviewing the transparency of the transitional government in Sudan led by Abdallah Hamdok during the first fiscal year 2020.

“The government made significant progress by publishing the budget within three months of enactment.? It also made significant progress by breaking down expenditures by the ministry and for the office of the president for the first time” reads the report.

The assessment said that the budget for the first time included information on debt obligations adding that even if budget estimates deviated from budget execution the government made significant progress by producing and publicly issuing revised budget estimates.

“However budget documents were not substantially complete?because they did not include off-budget revenue from military-owned enterprises and military expenditures continue to be underreported and opaque” stressed the report.

The State Department further called to “establishing greater civilian oversight over military and intelligence budgets” saying it would improve Sudan’s fiscal transparency.

The Sudanese military resist calls by the government Abdallah Hamdok to limit their economic activities to the military industry taking advantage of the fragility of his government but also the regional instability and the border dispute with Ethiopia.

Final Minigames Standings

There were eight minigames put in the Decision Dome. The teams needed to use their power-ups and best judgment to influence which Minecraft minigame is chosen in each round of the Minecraft Championship.

The ticket to victory is collecting the most amount of coins. Coin multipliers will start to increase on minigames played later in the tournament so teams will often vouch for Minecraft minigames they're not particularly skilled at earlier on in the competition.

The Minecraft Championships (MCC) are an invite-only event held and created through Noxcrew. It features ten teams of four competitors who compete in eight different minigames chosen by the participants.

Instead of advancing from Minecraft Championship 14 to Minecraft Championship 15 there was a specially-themed championship held in honor of June's Pride Month. The event was dubbed Minecraft Championship Pride 2021.

Minecraft Championship Pride 2021 marked the first special event of the second season of tournaments.

The Aqua Axolotls placed first at the end of the tournament with team member Kye ""Illumina"" placing first individually.

The heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) industry has several exciting long-term trends behind it. As such the leading players like Carrier (CARR 1.45%) Trane Technologies (TT 1.62%) and Johnson Controls (JCI 0.77%)will benefit from them. It may not seem like the sexiest industry to invest in but who cares? Sometimes it's the under-the-radar growth industries that generate the best returns. Here's why these HVAC stocks are set for substantial growth for many years to come.

Key growth trends

The growth catalysts come in three buckets:

Long-term end market megatrends including urbanization rising city temperatures and emerging middle class in the developing world demanding HVAC.

Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and the need to reduce carbon emissions will drive customers toward higher-quality HVAC providers like Carrier Trane (Trane American Standard) and Johnson Controls (York).

The growth in connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices and digitalization will shift demand toward leading players rolling out digital tools.

In addition to these trends the post-pandemic environment will likely create an increased awareness of the need for healthier cleaner buildings -- something that starts with the ""V"" in HVAC.

Megatrends

It's not a coincidence that all three companies have been restructured in recent years. The tailwinds behind these industrial businesses are so strong that all three companies have been significantly restructured to focus on investing in them in recent years. For example Carrier was formerly part of a much larger company United Technologies that was split up in 2020.

The split enabled Carrier's management to focus on significantly reducing costs and seek to increase market share through targeted initiatives like growing revenue in emerging markets  and developing its services revenue through its digital initiatives -- more on that later.

Trane Technologies was formerly part of Ingersoll Rand until the latter merged its industrial business with Gardner Denver to create the new Ingersoll Rand company leaving the climate segment to trade as Trane.

Johnson Controls was also a much larger company a few years ago. However its automotive seating business Adient was spun off in 2016 and it sold its power solutions (automotive batteries) business in 2019. Here again the main idea is to focus on its core growth business of HVAC and its complementary building systems (fire and safety) solutions.

Regulatory requirements and reducing carbon emissions

Given that buildings are responsible for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions globally it's clear that HVAC suppliers have a key role to play in helping companies reduce their carbon footprint. In fact at a recent Morgan Stanley conference Trane CEO Mike Lamach said that ""a quarter of the world's emissions happen as a result of HVAC systems in buildings and through food loss and the cold chain"" and he believes that figure will grow to 35% by 2030.

Lamach sees HVAC systems as being responsible for ""40% to 60% of the energy used in the building."" Carrier Trane and Johnson Controls own substantive refrigerated transportation businesses that can help reduce food waste.

Meanwhile Johnson Controls CEO George Oliver believes his company has an opportunity to benefit from the hundreds of billions worth of investment necessary in commercial buildings in order for companies to achieve their aim of net-zero carbon emissions.

Digitization and IoT

The solution to helping companies meet regulatory requirements and meeting demand for HVAC comes from the more efficient pump and refrigerant technology offered by these three companies. However it also comes from the increasing use of digital applications in connected buildings.

By using digital technology such as Johnson Controls OpenBlue solutions building owners can use artificial intelligence to improve a building's performance and better predict maintenance requirements.

That's a win-win scenario for building owners and high-quality HVAC suppliers alike. The owners get more efficient buildings and the HVAC companies get to sell value-added digital solutions. Moreover the addition of digital technology will create more loyal customers and improve attachment rates leading to improved service revenue over the long term -- a key aim for Carrier.

As such digitization will improve revenue growth and profit margins for the leading HVAC players.

Valuation matters

The growth prospects are not lost on Wall Street analysts and the consensus is for mid-single-digit revenue growth for all three for the foreseeable future. Based on the analyst consensus for free cash flow Johnson Controls and Carrier look like a good value right now.

All told the HVAC industry offers a compelling combination of long-term revenue growth and margin expansion. There's a definite need to provide HVAC and ensure it complies with carbon emission aims while adding value through digital technology. That environment should favor Carrier Trane and Johnson Controls for many years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,
PODD,Insulet,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHNjYXBlLmNvbS92aWV3YXJ0aWNsZS85NTM4MjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Omnipod 5 'Artificial Pancreas' Shows Benefit in Type 1 Diabetes,"Insulet's investigational Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system improves glycemic control in people with type 1 diabetes as young as 2 years of age new data suggest.

The Omnipod 5 system combines a tubing-free insulin-filled delivery ""Pod"" with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor and an algorithm built into the Pod connecting the two devices via a smartphone app to semiautomate insulin delivery. It is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration. The company expects to launch it in limited release during the second half of 2021.

Results from a pivotal trial of the system in children aged 2 to 5.9 years with type 1 diabetes were presented during the virtual American Diabetes Association (ADA) 81st Scientific Sessions.

Follow-up data at 6 months were also presented for another pivotal study of 112 children aged 6-13.9 years and 129 adults aged 14-70 years. Those primary 3-month data were reported earlier this year at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting and subsequently published online June 7 in Diabetes Care. Another study presented at ADA looked at quality of life in children using Omnipod 5 and their caregivers.

If approved by the US Food and Drug Administration the Omnipod 5 would be the third commercially available automated insulin delivery system — also called hybrid closed-loop or artificial pancreas systems — in the United States. It would be the second approved for children as young as 2 years of age and the first to deliver insulin subcutaneously without tubing.

""No Tubing"" Feature Will Be a Draw for Parents of Young Children

Asked to comment pediatric endocrinologist Laura M. Jacobsen MD of the University of Florida Gainesville told Medscape Medical News: ""I think the big advantage for the Omnipod 5 is that [if approved it will be] the only tubeless automated insulin delivery system in the US.""

""The automated delivery systems have just been wonderful for helping patients achieve time in range especially overnight. And the fact that this goes down to such a young age where that can be very difficult is wonderful.""

Another difference between the Omnipod 5 and other systems is the ability to adjust glucose targets (from 110 to 150 mg/dL) although newer versions of the currently available hybrid closed-loop systems are expected to include that feature as well. ""They're all slightly different in the way the algorithms work but I think the end result is similar"" Jacobsen said.

But she said the no-tubing feature might be particularly helpful for some very active young kids. ""A lot of small kids do use the tubed pumps and you can make it work with a lot of kids but with some kids it just won't...the tubing gets caught. I think this really helps parents make the step. A lot of them don't want to try the tubing whereas they see the Omnipod and might feel a little more confidence to try a pump.""

Overall said Jacobsen who has no financial disclosures with Insulet Dexcom or any of their competitors ""I think any addition to the technology field to improve quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes is important and people need choices.""

Pivotal Data Show Benefit in ""Difficult to Manage"" Preschool Children

Pivotal 3-month data for the Omnipod 5 in children aged 2-5.9 years with type 1 diabetes were presented on June 26 by pediatric endocrinologist Jennifer Sherr MD PhD Yale School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut.

""As a pediatric endocrinologist I can attest to the difficulty of managing this age group due to grazing eating patterns and erratic physical activity. Oftentimes care providers may fear hypoglycemia as these youth can not verbalize or self-treat lows"" she remarked.

A total of 80 children were enrolled at 10 institutions across the United Sates. There was a single 14-day standard therapy phase (baseline) followed by 3 months of automated insulin delivery during which the children's eating and exercise were unrestricted.

At 3 months average A1c had fallen from 7.4% at baseline to 6.9% a significant difference (P < .05). The proportions achieving the target A1c of less than 7% were 54% at 3 months versus 31% at baseline. The reduction was even greater among the 25 with baseline A1c of 8% or greater although it was significant even among the 55 who started with a lower A1c (–1.06 vs –0.31 percentage points; both P < .05).

Time in range rose from 57.2% at baseline to 68.1% at 3 months (P < .05).

""These youngsters are spending an average of 2.6 more hours/day in range"" Sherr commented noting that the difference became apparent shortly after study start and was maintained during the 3 months.

Sherr noted that this 10.9% improvement in time in range with Omnipod 5 was similar to improvements in the previously reported pivotal study of older children and adults. Data from that study showed improvement in time in range from a gain of 15.6% for the 6 to 13.9 year olds to 8.0% for those aged 26-49 years. Interestingly she noted improvements in time in range were seen even in the oldest group aged 50-70 who increased from an already high baseline of 69.9% to 79.1% with Omnipod 5 after 3 months.

In her current study in the youngest age group the improvement in time in range was achieved primarily by a reduction of time above range from 2.4 fewer hours/day above 180 mg/dL while time below 70 mg/dL was reduced by 4 minutes/day. Overnight time in range improved by 1.4 hours/night with most of the improvements in reduction of hyperglycemia.

The proportions meeting the combined goals of less than 4% time below range and greater than 60% time in range rose from 29% to 65%.

There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis during the 3-month study phase.

Another important related metric sleep quality for parents/caregivers also improved. The percentage reporting overall sleep quality of ""very good"" or ""fairly good"" increased from 65% at baseline to 90% with Omnipod 5 while ""very bad"" sleep quality fell from 8.8% to 0%.

All 80 patients completed the study and elected to continue in a 12-month extension phase.

Ongoing Benefit Seen in Older Children and Adults

In a late-breaking poster presented on June 25 Anders L. Carlson MD medical director at the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet Minneapolis Minnesota presented more follow-up data to the previously reported 3-month pivotal study including 108 older children and 109 adults from the original study.

A1c remained lower after 6 months than at baseline for both children and adults (P < .001). In the children A1c levels weren't significantly different at the end of 6 versus 3 months while in the adults there was an additional 0.1 percentage point decrease (P < .01).

There was one episode of diabetic ketoacidosis and no severe hypoglycemic episodes in the 3-month extension. ""Sustained reduction of A1c indicates the potential long-term benefit of the Omnipod 5 System"" Carlson and colleagues concluded.

Reduced Diabetes Distress Don't Forget Parents' Quality of Life

Meanwhile psychologist Korey K. Hood PhD of Stanford University California presented quality of life data at the meeting for 83 children aged 6-11.9 years and 42 teens aged 12-17.9 years using the Omnipod 5 from the larger study population and their parents.

Significant improvements were seen for both the youth and their caregivers in the Problem Areas in Diabetes score a measure of diabetes-related emotional distress. Changes were less dramatic on the Hypoglycemic Confidence Scale although improvements were significant for the caregivers of the younger children.

""We know this is a group that is really worried about hypoglycemia across a lot of situations not just sleep but also school and outside of the home. So to increase their confidence to this extent I think is a pretty important finding"" Hood commented.

There were nonsignificant trends in improvement across groups on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index but overall sleep quality did significantly improve among parents of the younger children. And on the World Health Organization-5 quality of life survey significant improvements again were seen among the caregivers of young children.

""Reduced diabetes distress and improved quality of life are key benefits of using the Omnipod 5 [automated insulin delivery] system that are complementary to the glycemic benefits achieved"" Hood said.

Jacobsen has reported no relevant financial relationships. Sherr has reported being an advisor for consultant for and/or grant recipient from Bigfoot Biomedical Cecelia Health Insulet Medtronic Diabetes Eli Lilly Lexicon Sanofi and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Hood has reported being a consultant for Cecelia Health Havas and Cercacor.

Things haven’t been going especially well for Intel in the past few years. It has had multiple setbacks with its fabrication processes that has considerably set back its chipset timeline. This has severely hampered its ability to deliver chips that can deliver a combination of power and efficiency that is especially important in laptops. Most notably this has led to Apple abandoning Intel for its entire product portfolio as it shifts to its own custom Arm-based chip designs.

Ironically Intel once owned XScale which made Arm-based SoCs that once powered the Pocket PCs and PDAs of yesteryear. Unfortunately for Intel it sold its XScale business in 2006 the year before Apple launched the iPhone and paved the way for Arm-based chips to dominate the mobile market. Intel’s own x86-based Atom competitors simply couldn’t match the more efficient RISC architecture underpinning Arm-based designs. Intel is now investigating a possible ‘Plan B’ in a new partnership between it and RISC-V fabless chip designer SiFive.

The partnership will see Intel license SiFive’s IP to create its own SiFive P550-based 64-bit SoC that it will fabricate on its new 7 nm node. It will form the basis of a new development platform Intel is calling Horse Creek and will be made available to customers interested in exploring its potential in various applications involving embedded SoC tech. This could mean smartphones but also cars IoT products and the like. If Intel gets enough interest it could take the relationship further. Intel hasn’t yet revealed the technical specifications of the SoC so we don’t know whether it will be a single-core or multi-core platform although the latter is likely. It's GPU tech is also unknown at this time but Xe-based graphics are likely.

While the first Horse Creek SoCs will be ready next year it isn't likely we will see any Intel RISC-V-based chips in commercially available products until 2023 at least. SiFive has received investment from Intel in the past and it has been mooted as a potential acquisition target for Intel so it is a case of ‘watch this space’ at this stage as far as this particular development goes. The announcement of the SiFive partnership also marks the commencement of the Intel Foundry Services business (IFS). This will see Intel beginning to fabricate chips as a contractor and has even mooted fabricating chips for Apple. It marks another avenue Intel is exploring as it hedges its bets against any declines in its own in-house chip design and manufacturing business.

Buy an unlocked Intel Core i7-11700K 125 W octa-core chip from Amazon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbHMtbGdhMTgwMC1zb2NrZXQtc3BvdHRlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's LGA1800 Socket Spotted: LGA1700's Relative,"Hardware blogger @momomo_us has published a photo of an LGA-17xx/LGA-18xx socket cover indicating the two sockets will have some similarities like the same physical dimensions and cooling mounts.

Intel's upcoming Alder Lake processors for desktop PCs will use a brand-new LGA1700 form-factor and an appropriate socket marking Intel's first radical upgrade of its sockets for mainstream desktop CPUs since 2004. The new LGA1700 socket will retain the 37.5mm width of today's sockets but it will be longer at 45mm. That means it could need different cooler mounting mechanisms. More importantly the new CPUs are expected to be 0.8mm shorter than today's processors making most existing coolers obsolete.

Unlike Intel's LGA1700 which has been discussed for quite a while now the company's LGA1800 has only been mentioned once — by Igor Walossek from Igor'sLab. Walossek didn't say if the LGA1700 and LGA1800 sockets would co-exist or the latter will succeed the former. Because the photo's origins are unknown take any information about the LGA1800 form-factor with a grain of salt.

There are a few different theories about the LGA1800 form-factor:

Intel could use LGA1800 for CPUs with some exceptional capabilities. For example unlocked parts CPUs with a built-in high-performance GPU or Xeon processors that could use the socket to enable better power delivery and performance. This will create quite some headache for PC makers and motherboard designers so it's unlikely that Intel will go this route.

LGA1800 might be used for future processors that will require a radically different power delivery system and will be shorter than Alder Lake designs. For example Intel's Meter Lake CPUs will feature a multi-tile design and the tiles will be made using different process technologies. These chips are two years out so they might be shorter too.

Intel's LGA115x/LGA1200 sockets have shared mechanical parts and cooling mounting mechanisms since the early 2010s but they had different pin assignments and power delivery circuity. Furthermore special ledges prevent installing a CPU into the wrong socket. Meanwhile makers of motherboards and systems can continue using the same mechanical components they are accustomed to. That said it isn't surprising that Intel will unify as many components as possible between its LGA1700 and LGA1800 form factors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZWwtY2VvLXNheXMtcmV0dXJuLXRvLW5vcm1hbC1zdXBwbHktZGVtYW5kLWZvci1jaGlwcy13aWxsLWNvbWUtaW4tMjAyM19pZDEzMzEzONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel CEO says chip shortage will continue throughout this year,"As many of you know we are in the middle of a chip shortage that has been impacting automobile and consumer electronic manufacturers. Bloomberg reports that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger sees the shortage continuing throughout the remainder of this year bottoming out during the second half of 2021 before things start to improve. In fact the executive doesn't expect the supply-demand picture to return to normal until 2023.





Gelsinger said ""I don’t expect the chip industry is back to a healthy supply-demand situation until ’23. For a variety of industries I think it’s still getting worse before it gets better."" Last month we told you that the lead time the time it takes between placing an order for semiconductors and actually receiving them hit 17 weeks in April; that was the longest lead time recorded by Susquehanna Financial since 2017 and was a big jump compared to the previous year's 12.53 figure.





Unlike fabless manufacturers like Apple  Qualcomm MediaTek and others Intel owns its own factories (aka fabs short for fabrication plants). A company like Apple designs its own chips but without the means to manufacture them itself the company turns to the world's largest contract foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC Ltd.) to produce them.





Gelsinger says that thanks to Intel's ownership of its fabs it is more able to keep up with demand for chips than those who are outsourcing production to another foundry. The executive says that demand for chips will continue to be strong over the next 10 years thanks to expected growth in demand for 5G smartphones AI and electric vehicles. Intel's CEO is on the side of those industry executives who see the current demand for chips continuing into the future.





Other executives don't believe that the industry can sustain growth of more than 5% on an annual basis. Broadcom Inc. CEO Hock Tan is one such executive. Even though his firm reported a 15% revenue hike for its latest quarter Tan says chip production is a mature industry that will revert back to low growth.

A photo of the LGA17XX/1800 socket cover has been shared by @momomo_us. It appears that the same cover could be used for both types of sockets which suggests they could be the same size.

While LGA1700/LGA1718 sockets have already appeared in the leaks quite extensively the LGA18XX had only appeared once. Intel 12th Gen Core series codenamed “Alder Lake” as well as its successor”Raptor Lake” are both to support the LGA1700 socket. Meanwhile AMD’s Zen4 based “Raphael” series is also to feature an LGA socket except with more pads (LGA-1718).

Over at Twitter @momomo_us shared a photo of the socket cover also listing LGA-18XX as compatible. At this moment it seems unclear which product could feature this socket but one would guess that it might be Raptor Lake’s successor Meteor Lake the first 7nm architecture from Intel.

LGA-17XX/LGA-18XX socket Source: @momomo_us

The LGA1800 socket was first mentioned by Igor Wallossek from Igor’sLAB who revealed that Intel developed a new mounting mechanism for LGA1700 and LGA1800 sockets indicating that there are compatible to some degree. But more importantly it would confirm that LGA18XX is an Intel socket not AMD’s.

First a few basics about the new cooling system. With the new LGA1700 and LGA1800 sockets Intel also introduces a new mounting system and deliberately changes the hole patterns for the screw and backplate. With the increased distances of the holes by a few millimeters one wants to understandably avoid that someone puts an old cooler on the new system. Because not only the structure width of the new CPUs becomes smaller but also the height of the complete package. — Igor Wallosek Igor’sLAB

Another theory is that the LGA-18XX socket could be for a different series such as Xeon Workstation or a product that we don’t know about yet. There were rumors that Intel might want to keep the LGA1700 socket for at least three generations which would also include Meteor Lake as LGA1700 compatible. However at this point here has been no confirmation of this claim either from the leaks or from Intel themselves.

This breathes some speculation into compatibility between the upcoming LGA-1700 and the LGA-1800 sockets. The LGA-1700 series has mostly materialized in a large amount of leaked photos and information but this the firs time we are seeing a picture of the LGA 1800 socket.

Is LGA18XX the successor to Intel's LGA-1700 socket series? And will this be used for Intel's 7nm Meteor Lake CPUs?

Igor Wallossek our colleague over at igor'sLAB introduced the LGA-1700/1800 socket in his extensive preview of Intel's Alder Lake-S with boxed cooler and cryo cooler including Peltier element.

Wallossek has this to say about the LGA-1800 sockets in his preview:

With the new LGA1700 and LGA1800 sockets Intel also introduces a new mounting system and deliberately changes the hole patterns for the screw and backplate. With the increased distances of the holes by a few millimeters one wants to understandably avoid that someone puts an old cooler on the new system. Because not only the structure width of the new CPUs becomes smaller but also the height of the complete package. – Igor Wallossek

Now keep in mind that Intel has multiple upcoming products and at least two different sockets (LGA 1700 and LGA 1800). Considering they have the same cooler mounting standard it is very much likely that they will feature the same socket cap. Intel's ""Alder Lake"" their 12th generation core series and its successor titled ""Raptor Lake"" are probably going to utilize the LGA-1700 series socket while LGA 1800 could be used by Meteor Lake. AMD's ""Raphael on the other hand will be using the LGA-1718 socket - which interestingly only has 18 more pins than Intel's LGA 1700.

All that said this is of course educated speculation and we are not a 100% sure at this point what will utilize the LG-17XX/LG-18XX socket but ""WhyCry"" at VideoCardz suggests that it could be for Intel's introductory 7nm architecture codenamed ""Meteor Lake"" which comes soon after ""Raptor Lake"" (Alder Lake's successor). It is also speculated that the LGA-18XX socket could be manufactured for the Intel Xeon Workstation. Unfortunately there is not enough information to know which product this corresponds to for certain right now.

The following table shows the current Intel CPU generations. Note that Alder Lake Raptor Lake and Meteor Lake were thought to use the LGA-1700 sockets except for Lunar Lake which has yet to have any information leaked.

We are also hearing that Intel wants to take a leaf out of AMD's book and continue using the LGA-1700 socket series for three more generations but there is no conclusive data to support this claim (at this time). But even if that rumor is true Meteor Lake would be exactly 3 generations after and the company would likely shift to a new socket - which is why LGA 1800 being for Intel's 7nm Meteor Lake actually makes a lot of sense."

What is LIBOR and why is it going away?

Administered by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) LIBOR has provided the global

reference rate for unsecured short-term borrowing between banks for 40 years. It analyzes

five currencies (Swiss francs euros British pounds Japanese yen and U.S. dollars) and seven different maturities that range from overnight to one year to create its benchmark. These interbank transactions have decreased over the years making the index less reliable as

a result.

Plan auditors may question this transition. Companies should assess potential exposure points and develop a transition strategy to identify and replace references and dependencies on LIBOR. Although more than $300 trillion in loan contracts and financial assets worldwide are underpinned by a LIBOR reference over the years banks have moved away from funding through the interbank market (it became a theory rather than a practice). New market participants (such as debt funds insurers and the like) now fund themselves from other sources.

What to use instead

The Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC) created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggested transitioning LIBOR references to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The ARRC published wording market participants may want to use to amend existing facility agreements or prepare new financing documentation. The ARRC’s recommendations do however leave several important factors for agents or lenders to decide at the time of the switch.

Next steps

Organizations should develop a flexible approach to identify and monitor LIBOR-linked product exposure through the transition period and understand where transition issues may exist. Obtain and review all existing arrangements including any underlying agreements to identify exposure points. If your organization has voluminous not standard and/or decentralized agreements leverage technology to locate and harvest relevant data such as effective dates rate dependencies fallback language amendment capabilities and termination.

Farley who is the current CEO of Far Point Acquisition Corp. served as the President of the NYSE Group (which owns the New York Stock Exchange) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) between November 2013 and May 2018.

He made his comments about crypto while being interviewed on June 23 by Andrew Ross Sorkin a co-anchor of CNBC’s “Squawk Box”.

Farley told Sorkin:

“I think of Bitcoin as being a sub trillion dollar market cap. I think the upper bound for now is gold which is about a ten trillion dollar market cap. In order for Bitcoin to someday exceed gold it’ll have to be more of an accepted form of currency. I’m not sure frankly if it ever gets there.

“With respect to the recent price moves I’m kind of sanguine about them. Bitcoin’s a very volatile asset class in part because it’s a new asset class. I have no doubt it’ll go up it’ll go down over the long term. I still think it’s a lower left to upper right trend and I think we’re gonna see that play out over five years.

“I think this kerfuffle about energy usage is an interesting conversation but by and large I think it’ll be resolved because I think the blockchain at its core adds to efficiency and in fact we’ll add to energy efficiency over time and so I’m still very optimistic about the whole asset class.“

The writer is a bond portfolio manager at Barksdale Investment Management and co-author of ‘Undiversified: The Big Gender Short in Investment Management’

“What’s a day trader?” My godson calls to ask me this just after his 18th birthday newly in possession of a Schwab brokerage account flush with high school graduation cash.

When I define the term he confesses to me that yep he has become a day trader with a $1000 paper profit in his first week as a legal adult. I say “confesses” because he has done what I recommended against doing: perusing Reddit forums and gambling on stocks that dominate them such as retailer GameStop.

My godson is not going to the poorhouse if he bets wrong. I doubt most day traders are. And I am sure he is learning a lot from his experience.

But as someone who makes a living out of managing investments I worry about the broader impact of the hype around day trading in so-called meme stocks.

It perpetuates a number of myths about the very different “real job” of investment management which in turn perpetuates the lack of gender diversity in the industry. The breathless coverage of meme stocks signals that investing is the purview of high-testosterone risk-taking fence-swinging “bros” who yell in online forums and go to war with rich hedge fund managers. It suggests successful investors rely primarily on instinct not analysis.

The reality of course is very different. As a portfolio manager I can personally attest to the fact that the majority of us male and female are by and large analytical stodgy nerdy folks who would not consider buying a stock or bond without having deeply researched the company. It would be reckless otherwise not to mention a violation of fiduciary duty to clients.

The concentrated bets on very few stocks by meme stock traders defies Investing 101’s principle of diversification. The day trading approach requires tremendous risk appetite and acceptance of daily unpredictable fluctuations in your life savings.

Research shows that women typically have a different approach to risk from that. That is not to say they are incapable of taking it — just that they tend to have a more balanced view of risk-reward.

I worry a young woman reading the meme stock coverage could conclude either that she is no match for the hyped traders and/or that she has no interest in working in an industry dominated by this personality type.

Women are already being deterred from entering fund management in vast numbers. The industry gender imbalance is severe.

To cite a few numbers only 10 per cent of US portfolio managers (the people investing your money if you own a mutual fund or ETF) are women according to a Morningstar research report. And only 16 per cent of financial advisers (the people recommending the mutual funds and ETFs for you) are women.

Investment management interviews often lionise actual investing experience which is a troubling way to screen candidates. In addition to the obvious baseline of investable wealth required which eliminates people who grew up in modest homes how do you verify this prerequisite?

Let’s say a woman enrols in an MBA programme the traditional pipeline into the investment manager career path. Her interest in an investment job might be piqued. Yet she might be derailed by a recruiting process that almost always asks candidates about their investing experience. She could be interviewing alongside the earnest young man who tells the story of his “ten-bagger” — an investment that goes up 10 times in value — on a stock beloved by the meme crowd such as movie chain AMC Entertainment.

And then the hype over what it takes to be a day trader crops up again. A well-known Harvard Business Review study suggests that women only apply for a job if they have 100 per cent of the qualifications versus men who apply with 60 per cent. That may suggest that a job for which a “killer instinct” is touted as a qualification will necessarily attract fewer women.

Much more attention needs to be paid to the tremendous gender and racial inequities in the ranks of portfolio managers and investment analysts than putting out the umpteenth meme stock piece. Taken as a whole this meme coverage likely contributes to these inequities by discouraging women and people of colour from joining the investment industry.

My latest call from my godson was another update about his paper profits (up 45 per cent or $4500 now). He was with one of his classmates who’s also a self-styled day trader. On a whim I asked them if they knew any female day traders. They replied: “Um no.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hlbGVyb2Jzb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi93aGljaC1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtdG8tc3RheS1hdC1pbi0yMDIxLWluLW1hbHRhLWFuZC1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LXRoZS1iZXN0LXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Luxury Hotel To Stay At In 2021 In Malta And How To Get The Best Price,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelerobson/2021/06/26/which-luxury-hotel-to-stay-at-in-2021-in-malta-and-how-to-get-the-best-price/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hlbGVyb2Jzb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi93aGljaC1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtdG8tc3RheS1hdC1pbi0yMDIxLWluLW1hbHRhLWFuZC1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LXRoZS1iZXN0LXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cGlvbmVlci5jb20vMjAyMS90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy9wZXRyb2wtLWRpZXNlbC1vbi1hLXJvbGwtLXJhdGVzLXJpc2UtYnktc2hhcnAtMzUtcC1sdHIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petrol diesel on a roll rates rise by sharp 35 p/ltr,"Global cues pushed fuel prices to increase again across the country on Saturday adding more misery for the common man already grappling with rising food prices amidst shrinking income.



The retail prices of both petrol and diesel rose by a sharp 35 paise per litre on Saturday to touch new high of Rs 98.11 and Rs 88.65 per litre respectively in Delhi.



With the rise petrol price has reached very close to hitting the century mark all across the country extending the scope of historic high prices that had already made the fuel rate cross the Rs 100 per litre mark in certain cities and towns of Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Telangana Andhra Pradesh.



In the city of Mumbai where petrol prices crossed Rs 100 mark for the first time on May 29 the fuel price reached new high of Rs 104.24 per litre on Saturday. Diesel price also increased in the city to reach Rs 96.13 a litre the highest among metros.



Across the country as well petrol and diesel prices increased on Saturday but its retail prices varied depending on the level of local taxes in different states.



Petrol prices in three other metros apart from Mumbai have also reached closer to Rs 100 per litre mark and OMC officials said that if international oil prices continue to firm up this mark could also be breached in other places by month end.



With Saturday's price hike fuel prices have now increased on 30 days and remained unchanged on 27 days since May 1. The 30 increases have taken up the petrol prices by Rs 7.72 per litre in Delhi. Similarly diesel has increased by Rs 7.92 per litre in the national capital.



With global crude prices also rising on a pick up demand and depleting inventories of world's largest fuel guzzler - the US retail prices of fuel in India are expected to firm up further in coming days. The benchmark Brent crude reached multi year high level of over $76 on ICE or Intercontinental Exchange.

This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 34.52%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72 delivering a surprise of -4%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

International Flavors  which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter ended March 2024 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

But reformist and conservative media diagonally differ on what is happening next door to Iran which is still digesting what the result of its latest presidential election might entail.

While former diplomat Ali Khorram wrote in a commentary in the centrist Arman daily that the Taliban's onslaught as well as its bomb attacks in various parts of Afghanistan have mainly targeted the Shia Hazaras the hardline Kayhan wrote in a commentary by Jafar Bolouri that ""the Taliban have not committed any crime against the Shia population of Afghanistan.""

Iran has had a measure of mixed relations with the Taliban and Afghan government officials have often accused Tehran of supporting the militant group. In January a large Taliban delegation visited Tehran and held talks with Iranian officials with information scarce over what they really discussed.

Meanwhile another former diplomat Fereidoun Majlesi said in an article on proreform Fararu website that ""the attacks on various Afghan provinces are part of a conspiracy against Iran."" According to Majlesi the plot aims at dividing Afghanistan and creating a new country named Pashtunistan.

According to Khorram the attacks by Taliban in various Afghan cities have killed many innocent people including children and young adults. Khorram criticized the Islamic Republic of Iran as “the main defender of Shias all over the world” for keeping silent in the face of Taliban's attacks.

He pointed out that some Iranians even encourage Afghans not to resist against the occupation of 15 provinces by the Taliban. Iran's hardliners believe Taliban is an anti-Western ""revolutionary movement” he wrote. The former diplomat asked: ""Do we expect our neighbors to call on us to remain silent if God forbid a rebel group occupies Iranian provinces one by one?""

""The Taliban have pushed back Afghan women to the stone age and violated their rights as well as the rights of other parts of the Afghan nation"" Khorram said and added that it was the Taliban that gave rise to groups such as Al-Qaedah and the Islamic State.

He further quoted Iranian security officials as having said that ISIS is training suicide bombers in Afghanistan to deploy them into Iran across the border. Khorram said turning a blind eye to all that would be ""a major miscalculation and negligence in the face of threats against Iran's national security.""

Kayhan funded by the office of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tried to lessen the potential dangers of a Taliban takeover. ""The Taliban today is different from the Taliban that used to behead people” the daily said and claimed that Taliban's advances have not led to ISIS-style massacre of civilians and destruction of homes. The daily claimed that in many of the operations Afghan government forces have joined the Talban forces.

The daily further claimed that the US is withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan to give a hard time to Iran. Nonetheless it said it was too early to assess how dangerous current developments in Afghanistan can be for Iran.

The daily also raised the alarm that as the people of Afghanistan have been taking arms to confront the Taliban onslaught the coming weeks may witness a bloody civil war that can soon turn into a Shia-Sunni conflict.

Apart from the military aspect this might also bring an influx of Afghan refugees into Iran causing further economic burdens for the Iranian government. Nonetheless Kayhan suggested that Tehran should wait and see what happens next door before taking any active measure.

Khorram however says a military strategist such as former Qods Force commander Qasem Soleimani would have not waited while Iran's enemies are preparing a major regional war against it. He warned Iranian officials: ""Thinking that the Taliban will come under Tehran's command is tantamount to growing a snake up your sleeve. As far as Iran's national interests are concerned the liberal government of Ashraf Ghani is a hundred times better than a radical ISIS-Taliban government. You were deceived by Russia and Israel in Syria. Take care not to fall in a bigger trap laid out in Afghanistan for you by the West Israel Turkey and other regional players.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjEvanVuLzI2L2ppbW1pZS1ub3Jzd29ydGh5LTIwMjEtMDYtMjYtNzE3NDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jimmie Don Norsworthy Obituary,"Jimmie Don Norsworthy after 36 years of heart disease Jimmie Don Norsworthy passed away on Tuesday June 22 2021.

His RuPaul's Drag Race empire has already been expanding with numerous international iterations that dropped in the past year. And now the show is doing a major crossover event we never knew we needed called ""Dragging the Classics: The Brady Bunch.""

Six of Ru's legendary children will be starring alongside five cast members of the original iconic television sitcom. For the show they'll be recreating the 1971 season 2 episode ""Will the Real Jan Brady Please Stand Up?"" In the episode Jan is tired of living in her sister Marcia's shadow and thinks that she's been shunned by people at school because of her blonde hair. She then decides to buy a black wig to show off the ""New Jan Brady"" at her classmate Lucy Winters' party.

Shea Couleé will be playing Marcia Brady Kylie Sonique Love is going to be Jan BenDeLaCreme is stepping out of drag to play Greg Bianca Del Rio will be their mom Carol Nina West will be the housekeeper Alice and Kandy Muse will transform into Cindy. RuPaul and Drag Race judge Michelle Visage are also expected to make appearances.

Meanwhile Barry Williams who played Greg Brady will be the family patriarch Mike Christopher Knight and Mike Lookinland will be reprising their roles as Peter and Bobby Eve Plumb who played Jan is going to play Lucy and Susan Olsen who played Cindy is going to be a classmate named Margie.

""For so long The Brady Bunch has represented the idyllic aspirational mixed family but by mixing the stars of the original cast with the stars of RuPaul's Drag Race we have been able to remind folks of the true meaning and value of family"" he told Variety. ""It's also thrilling for us to have the opportunity to showcase the talents of so many of the Drag Race girls and to see their work alongside iconic actors! Hopefully this project will help encourage folks to create even more opportunities for artists who don't always get called upon.""

The show is going to air exclusively on Paramount Plus on June 30.",,,,,,

Keystone Electrical Manufacturing Company is closing its Brookhaven doors.

The company which expanded to the Home Seekers Paradise in early 2020 designs and manufactures customized turnkey systems for electrical power grids to protect transmit and distribute energy from the source through the grid to the consumer.

The Des Moines Iowa-based Keystone EMC has been purchased by Systems Control headquartered in Iron Mountain Michigan. Systems Control made the announcement this week.

“I have followed Systems Control since I entered this industry over 24 years ago” said Keystone owner Fred Buie. “I have always admired their innovative spirit and limitless commitment to customer satisfaction. Their overall philosophy of doing business aligns well with Keystone’s culture.”

Buie a Brookhaven native announced the expansion of Keystone to his hometown in February 2020. More than 200 people including city and county leaders and Gov. Tate Reeves attended the event where Buie outlined his purchase of a spec building in the Linbrook Industrial Park and the hiring of approximately 30 workers for the local plant. He said at the time that he hoped to hire as many people as possible as the local production grew.

Buie said this week his original intent with the company was to sell it one day and retire and that the offer from Systems Control pushed his retirement much closer on his personal timeline.

“They are the 500-pound gorilla in the industry. They approached us and wanted to buy the business” Buie said. “It basically accelerated my retirement plan. I was looking to spend a couple of years getting this up and going but my exit strategy was always to sell eventually. I just didn’t expect it to come this quickly.”

Buie and his wife maintain a Brookhaven home and a timber business in Lincoln County. He said they plan to spend more time in Brookhaven and with their three adult children.

When the purchase was originally discussed Systems Control leadership was excited about the Brookhaven location and having an operation in the South Buie said. At some point the company decided it would be better served to move all operations to Iowa and Michigan.

“We’re essentially shutting down the Brookhaven operation” Buie said. “We’ve offered all of the employees here the opportunity to transfer to Des Moines and we’ve put together what I think is a generous severance package for those who choose not to.”

Health insurance and continued support including help finding new employment will be provided for those leaving the company Buie said.

“This was a very very tough decision for me but it came down to what was best for the greater good and it was a business decision” he said.

“We really do appreciate Brookhaven and Lincoln County. We found a very very good workforce here in Brookhaven and I’m saddened that we were not able to continue” Buie said. “But business is business and sometimes you have to take the names and faces off the table to make a clean business decision.”

“He’s been a good business partner” Lincoln County Board of Supervisors president and District 4 Supervisor Eddie Brown said of Buie. “I hate to see it not go further but we’ll just keep on working on development with our Chamber and Industrial Park.”

The building already has garnered some professional interest Brown said as well as the other Linbrook spec building. Buie is working with the county city Chamber and state to repay investments into the local business and structure.

Buie retains personal ownership of the spec building in Linbrook and plans to lease or sell it.

“It’s the goal right? Everyone wants to be able to do well and then retire” said Brookhaven Mayor Joe Cox. “Fred Buie has done a good job he did what he said he would do and he’s repaying grants and incentives Keystone received a year ago. I wish him well in his retirement.”

Decoding Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Market Leadership and Innovation: Jack Henry & Associates Inc (NASDAQ:JKHY) stands out in the financial technology sector with its robust suite of products and services. The company's revenue growth of 5.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as reported in the latest 10-Q filing is a testament to its strong market presence and the successful adoption of its solutions by nearly 1000 banks and over 700 credit unions. This growth is further bolstered by JKHY's strategic focus on innovation as evidenced by its significant investments in research and development which amounted to $35993 for the quarter. These investments are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and fostering long-term customer relationships.

Financial Health and Profitability: JKHY's financial health is a cornerstone of its strength with a solid balance sheet and an increase in net income to $87099 for the third quarter up from $81549 in the prior year. This financial stability is supported by a disciplined approach to cost management as seen in the total expenses of $426463 which have been effectively controlled in relation to the revenue growth. The company's profitability is not only a sign of operational efficiency but also provides the necessary capital to reinvest in growth initiatives and shareholder returns.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Financial Sector Clients: A primary weakness for JKHY is its reliance on the financial sector with a customer base predominantly composed of banks and credit unions. While this focus has contributed to the company's deep expertise and strong market position it also exposes JKHY to sector-specific risks such as regulatory changes and economic downturns that disproportionately affect the financial industry. Diversifying its client portfolio could mitigate this risk and provide more stability during industry fluctuations.

Increasing Operating Expenses: Despite robust revenue growth JKHY's operating expenses have also risen with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This uptick in expenses particularly in selling general and administrative costs which climbed by 7.0% may squeeze margins if not carefully managed. JKHY must continue to seek efficiencies and control costs to maintain its profitability and invest in strategic areas.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: The ongoing digital transformation in the financial services industry presents significant opportunities for JKHY. By continuing to invest in cutting-edge technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence JKHY can offer innovative solutions that address the evolving needs of its clients. The company's commitment to research and development as indicated by the $35993 investment in the third quarter positions it well to capitalize on these technological trends and expand its product offerings.

Market Expansion: JKHY has the opportunity to expand its market reach by targeting larger financial institutions and exploring international markets. With its strong product portfolio and expertise in the financial sector JKHY can leverage its reputation to attract a broader clientele. Additionally strategic partnerships or acquisitions could accelerate this expansion and introduce JKHY's solutions to new customer segments.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The financial technology industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. JKHY faces the threat of emerging fintech startups and established technology firms that are expanding their financial services offerings. To remain competitive JKHY must continue to innovate and differentiate its products while delivering exceptional customer service.

Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns can significantly impact JKHY's client base leading to reduced spending on technology solutions and services. The company's dependence on the financial sector makes it vulnerable to such macroeconomic factors. JKHY must maintain a strong financial position and adapt its offerings to help clients navigate challenging economic conditions.

In conclusion Jack Henry & Associates Inc (NASDAQ:JKHY) exhibits a strong financial performance with notable revenue and net income growth. The company's strategic investments in technology and product development position it well to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities. However JKHY must address its reliance on the financial sector and manage operating expenses to mitigate weaknesses and threats. By continuing to focus on innovation and market expansion JKHY is poised to maintain its leadership in the financial technology space and deliver value to its stakeholders.

The designer who skipped the last two seasons is presenting his fall collection at 7pm at the New York Public Library and it will be projected simultaneously on the facade of Bergdorf Goodman at 57th Street and 5th Avenue.

The event marks the beginning of a new partnership between the designer and the New York store which will be the exclusive global retailer to sell his runway collection when it lands for the fall.

The live viewing experience will also be an opportunity for fans to experience the collection in real time a concept Jacobs has toyed with before. For his Spring 2016 “One Night Only” show at the Ziegfeld Theatre the designer had models starting their runway walk on a red carpet on West 54th Street to the delight of passers by.

The fall 2021 show will be projected on a loop on the outside of the Bergdorf Goodman store from 7 to 11 pm on Monday.

True to form for Jacobs who has become a social media star during the pandemic the news was announced on Instagram to his 1.6 million followers. He noted how the store has been a supporter of his since the mid-1990s following his exit from Perry Ellis adding “I could not imagine a better partnership between two New York City brands.”

Buoyed by the 2020 success of Marc Jacobs Perfect Coty Inc.’s biggest fragrance launch in 15 years the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton-owned brand began plotting a return to growth earlier this year.

The runway collection debuting Monday will not be available in Jacobs’ own stores however which suggests that the 130 doors the designer currently has globally will now solely feature his contemporary The Marc Jacobs line his streetwear line Heaven or off-price merchandise.

In April a new retail concept for Heaven launched on Fairfax Avenue’s streetwear row in Los Angeles featuring creative director Ava Nirui’s cheerfully subversive mix of clothing and lifestyle products steeped in grunge anime rave culture and Marc’s own ’90s fashion history now being discovered by a new generation.

“We are concentrating our focus on U.S. retail this year. Every month we will be opening a new store and each time the format will be adapted to the local customer” chief executive officer Eric Marechalle told WWD at the time. He joined from Kenzo in 2017 and in 2020 managed to guide the Marc Jacobs brand to profitability for the first time in five years.

“I feel very secure with Eric. I think he’s doing an incredible job” said Jacobs. “The changes we’ve made with online with creating more accessibility and from a financial sense are setting us up to be able to do runway” the designer added sharing that his collection would incorporate learnings from the brand’s new digital savvy and swing to more accessible product.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpbGJlcnRzdW5uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dwcy1waWNrcy1mb3VyLWdvdmVybmluZy1ib2FyZC1ub21pbmVlcy9hcnRpY2xlXzM4MDg5Y2QyLWQ2MGYtMTFlYi04ODNhLTVmOTBkODJhOTJmZi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GPS picks four governing board nominees | News | gilbertsunnews.com,"You have permission to edit this article.

Scott played Jacob father to Kate Kane (Ruby Rose in Season 1 Wallis Day in Season 2) Mary (Nicole Kang) and Alice (Rachel Skarsten). In his final episode Jacob disbanded the Crows. He was arrested for helping Alice (who ended up in prison) and was transferred to Metropolis to await trial."

Ira Acree to serve on the board of the Regional Transportation Authority after a tense hearing that focused on the problems facing public transportation in Chicago.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th Ward) and Ald. Scott Waguespack (32nd Ward) were the only members of the city’s Transportation and Public Way Committee on Wednesday to vote against Acree’s nomination which advanced on a voice vote to the full City Council. A final vote could come as soon as May 22.

Acree the politically connected pastor of the Greater St. John Baptist Church on the West Side faced unusually pointed questions from alderpeople who are under increasing pressure to make significant changes to the CTA which has yet to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The system which saw its ridership plummet during the pandemic as crime and violence increased is facing a $730 million deficit in early 2026 once federal relief expires.

Acree repeatedly struggled to articulate exactly what changes he would make if confirmed to the RTA board to serve a five-year term declining to answer questions about Johnson’s specific transit agenda and how he would implement it as a member of the 16-person board charged with financial oversight. Board members earn $25000 annually and meet once per month.

Acree could not answer Waguespack’s question about how he would address that massive budget gap which has sparked proposals to merge the Chicago area’s three separate public transit agencies — the CTA suburban bus system Pace and commuter rail system Metra — into a single agency.

The fiscal cliff looming for Chicago’s public transit system has been in the spotlight for months along with efforts to make CTA bus and train service more reliable and safer.

“Well No. 1 this is my first time hearing about a $735 million shortfall” Acree said repeating the incorrect budget deficit number mentioned by Waguespack.

The proposed merger would be a “serious undertaking” with arguments on both sides of the issue Acree said.

In addition Acree declined to tell Vasquez whether he thought CTA President Dorval Carter should be fired saying he would examine his performance if confirmed.

Acree told Vasquez he drove to City Hall to appear at his confirmation hearing to sit on the board overseeing the CTA Pace and Metra — although he added that he relied on the CTA as a teen and now uses it to get to the Loop to avoid paying for parking.

“I don’t have to use CTA” Acree said. “I’m fortunate to have a car. But I use CTA often when I come downtown because even though I am a working pastor these parking tickets are super high.”

Acree who endorsed Johnson during the 2023 election after backing former Mayor Lori Lightfoot in 2019 said if confirmed he would use his seat on the RTA board as an extension of his work as a civil rights leader.

“Instead of holding protests I’ll be on the inside and be very instrumental in making changes” Acree said adding that his “diverse voice” and “unique skill set” will be an asset to the board.

“This is an opportunity to help my city be better” Acree said.

Acree was a thorn in the side of former Mayor Rahm Emanuel leading efforts to reform the Chicago Police Department after a White Chicago police officer murdered Laquan McDonald a Black teen in 2014.

A longtime advocate for efforts to reduce gun violence Acree delivered the benediction at the January 2023 inauguration of Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

After Johnson’s election as Chicago mayor Acree unsuccessfully applied to replace him on the Cook County Board of Commissioners. That position is now held by Commissioner Tara Stamps who won the Democratic primary in March to serve out the remaining two years of Johnson’s term.

Acree is also a close ally of the Rev. Jesse Jackson who attended Wednesday’s hearing in a very public show of support.

Acree’s nomination exposed tension between two critical parts of Johnson’s political base: progressive Chicagoans who have championed public transportation as a critical function of city government and Black Chicagoans who wish to see longtime leaders elevated to positions of power.

Ald. Chris Taliaferro (29th Ward) and Ald. Michelle Harris (8th Ward) passionately defended Acree’s nomination telling committee members that Acree would represent Black Chicagoans who live on the South and West sides.

Taliaferro said it was “absolutely wrong” to say that Acree was unqualified to serve on the RTA board despite his lack of transit experience or expertise.

“I need someone who is going to stand up for my community” said Taliaferro who proposed renaming a Chicago street after Acree in 2016. That proposal never came to a vote and the City Council soon after changed the rules to prevent the brown and white signs from honoring living people.

Acree is Johnson’s third appointee to the boards that oversee the city's public transportation systems and the second West Side pastor tapped by the mayor to oversee Chicago’s buses and trains without having transit-specific experience.

Without debate the City Council in April confirmed Johnson’s appointment of pastor Michael Eaddy to the CTA board. Like Acree Eaddy has no record on transit issues.

Johnson’s first pick for the CTA board urban planner and transit advocate Roberto Requejo took his seat Wednesday. Requejo served as the executive director of Elevated Chicago which advocates for residential and commercial developments designed to encourage residents to use public transportation.

But there was more geniality than specificity in private meetings with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders just three weeks before a self-imposed May 24 spring session adjournment date.

Democrats were prepared to talk to Johnson about his Monday reference to $1 billion owed to Chicago Public Schools due to years of underfunding under the state’s school funding formula — but the issue wasn’t even broached during a nearly 30-minute meeting with the governor.

And the mayor’s controversial support for a new lakefront Chicago Bears stadium also wasn’t a focal point of the meeting.

Johnson told reporters he reminded Pritzker and legislative leaders that Chicago is the economic engine of the state and deserves its “fair share of resources.

“It’s also to continue to build relationships with the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity injustice. This is a unique chance for us to do that” Johnson said of his trip. “So it’s a level-setting. It’s making sure that we’re building on relationships but it’s also clear that in order for the state of Illinois to be the great state that it is that the city of Chicago has to have its fair share of resources.”

Johnson called discussions with the Illinois General Assembly about the Bears “ongoing” dubbing Soldier Field a “structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.” The Bears last week met with Pritzker aides who highlighted their opposition to the plan. The governor’s office last week called the proposal a “nonstarter” after the meeting.

“And that’s what this is about providing solutions to a problem … like everything else I’ve inherited” Johnson said.

It was the Chicago mayor’s first trip to the state capitol since taking office. Johnson also met with Pritzker and legislative leaders in Springfield in April 2023 in a ceremonial visit weeks before he was sworn in.

Johnson defended the timing of his visit — and his late-in-the-game budgetary asks — saying “We’re at the right time.”

“You know when stuff gets done. So we’re down here at the right time” Johnson said.

Several members of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus also met privately with Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch on Wednesday in what was dubbed an informal city lobbying day. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) the mayor’s hand-picked Education Committee chair said it marked the first time in five years that members of the caucus had come to Springfield.

“The thing we’ll do next year is we’ll come in January. We come earlier. We get earlier access” Taylor said. “We can get a lot of those things that we’re looking for.”

Taylor said her requests included funding for infrastructure and investments in education some narrower than the mayor’s.

“He’s advocating for some of the same things we are but remember it’s 50 other folks. It’s just 20 of us as the Black Caucus and so he’s advocating on the entire city. We have specific asks for the South and West sides” Taylor said.

“Him coming down is a great thing. Him coming down with us didn’t make or break us because now the other caucuses have to do their due diligence to come down here as well.”

During Johnson’s closed-door meetings the Illinois Senate Executive Committee quietly cleared an education measure that Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union had opposed.

The bill was initially intended to stop the Chicago Board of Education from closing or making any changes to selective enrollment schools until 2027 when the board will be fully elected. It was a response to a resolution passed by the CPS board that called for a plan to invest in neighborhood schools and move away from school choice.

The measure the Senate committee passed Wednesday cleared the House last month. It included a moratorium on all Chicago school closings until 2027 — and it would also stop the Chicago Board of Education from changing standards of admission for selective enrollment schools. The measure must still clear the full Senate.

Johnson said he has had discussions with lawmakers to amend the measure: “Those amendments are being assessed and analyzed now.”

As for whether he felt snubbed by the Senate’s approval during his visit the mayor countered that he understood the “process.”

“There’s a process that the General Assembly goes through” Johnson said. “I understand that process and we’re going to stick to that process.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene’s effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.

One of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of “transgressions” she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.

Greene of Georgia criticized Johnson’s leadership as “pathetic weak and unacceptable.”

No sooner than Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office the Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling first for a vote to table it.

An overwhelming majority 359-43 kept Johnson in his job for now.

“As I’ve said from the beginning and I’ve made clear here every day I intend to do my job” Johnson said afterward. “And I’ll let the chips fall where they may. In my view that is leadership.”

It’s the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.

The tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson’s hold on the gavel and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.

All told 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene’s effort more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers — any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.

Johnson said he hoped it “is the end of the personality politics.”

As Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels including Trump GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.

The Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.

But in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.

Johnson of Louisiana marched on saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the “right side of history.”

In a highly unusual move the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York whose leadership team had said it was time to “turn the page” on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene’s resolution — almost ensuring Johnson’s job is saved for now.

“Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems” Jeffries said after the vote.

Trump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump’s hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.

Ahead of House voting Trump said on social media “I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene” but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene’s motion.

“At some point we may very well be but this is not the time” Trump said to oust the speaker.

The move now poses its own political risks for Greene a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.

Greene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote – putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.

“I’m proud of what I did today” Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.

While reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.

Rep. Dusty Johnson R-S.D. said of those trying to remove the speaker “They’re pretty good at getting attention but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.”

He said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker “I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.”

Reps. Carlos Giménez a Florida Republican said of Greene: “She doesn’t represent the Republican Party. I’m tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That’s all she wants is the attention.”

Rep. Mike Lawler R-N.Y. called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.

Had Democrats not taken the unusual move to help the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times with no votes to spare.

Last year the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker’s office and Democrats declined to help save him.

Ousting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.

Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Co. announced Friday that a Starbucks will be in the office building under construction at the west end of Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.

The Starbucks location will be operated by AVI Foodsystems based in Warren. The coffee shop is expected to be open later this year and will have a football theme that matches other parts of the planned development.

The Constellation Center for Excellence is part of the $300 million second phase of development at Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls.

Starbucks is the first announced tenant at the four-story office building. Hall of Fame Resort is working with commercial real estate firm CBRE to seek tenants for the building which has up to 40000 square feet of office space along with retail space.

The company expects to announce additional tenants in the coming months said Anne Graffice executive vice president for public affairs. The building is being marketed as a sports and research facility.

Still in the works for the second phase is a 180-room Hilton Tapestry hotel a football-themed water park and a retail promenade. Work on those buildings is supposed to begin this year and most of it should be finished by the end of 2022 the company has said.

Graffice said the company is locking in financing for the remaining construction projects.

""Given our environment we're feeling very good about the process"" she said adding that the company has capital in place to keep building.

In recent months construction has focused on building infrastructure — such as waterlines sewers and other utilities — as well as preparing the property for construction.

The coronavirus pandemic has bogged down the development Graffice said. She noted that steel for the new construction projects has been ordered but is being delayed because of supply issues that developed during the pandemic.

Starbucks joins other national brands as part of the retail mix planned for Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls. The Don Shula’s restaurant chain and Topgolf Swing Suites already have signed on for space for the 82000-square-foot retail center which will stretch between the hotel and the Constellation Center for Excellence.

The first phase of Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls included construction of the stadium and several youth football fields south of McKinley high school.

Redevelopment of the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in downtown Canton was part of the second phase as is the Center for Excellence. When that building is finished Hall of Fame Resort officials expect it will serve as ""an innovative hub"" for tenants ""dedicated to improving professional football player health and the mind and body through research and technology.""

A third construction phase estimated at $300 million is in the planning stages and scheduled to start after the second phase is completed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L3RoZXNlLTMtc3RvY2tzLWJlbmVmaXQtZnJvbS1yZWQtaG90LW1lZ2F0cmVuZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Stocks Benefit from Red-Hot Megatrends,"Investors shouldn't overlook the host of revenue and earnings growth drivers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning industry right now.

The heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) industry has several exciting long-term trends behind it. As such the leading players like Carrier (CARR 1.45%) Trane Technologies (TT 1.62%) and Johnson Controls (JCI 0.77%)will benefit from them. It may not seem like the sexiest industry to invest in but who cares? Sometimes it's the under-the-radar growth industries that generate the best returns. Here's why these HVAC stocks are set for substantial growth for many years to come.

Key growth trends

The growth catalysts come in three buckets:

Long-term end market megatrends including urbanization rising city temperatures and emerging middle class in the developing world demanding HVAC.

Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and the need to reduce carbon emissions will drive customers toward higher-quality HVAC providers like Carrier Trane (Trane American Standard) and Johnson Controls (York).

The growth in connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices and digitalization will shift demand toward leading players rolling out digital tools.

In addition to these trends the post-pandemic environment will likely create an increased awareness of the need for healthier cleaner buildings -- something that starts with the ""V"" in HVAC.

Megatrends

It's not a coincidence that all three companies have been restructured in recent years. The tailwinds behind these industrial businesses are so strong that all three companies have been significantly restructured to focus on investing in them in recent years. For example Carrier was formerly part of a much larger company United Technologies that was split up in 2020.

The split enabled Carrier's management to focus on significantly reducing costs and seek to increase market share through targeted initiatives like growing revenue in emerging markets  and developing its services revenue through its digital initiatives -- more on that later.

Trane Technologies was formerly part of Ingersoll Rand until the latter merged its industrial business with Gardner Denver to create the new Ingersoll Rand company leaving the climate segment to trade as Trane.

Johnson Controls was also a much larger company a few years ago. However its automotive seating business Adient was spun off in 2016 and it sold its power solutions (automotive batteries) business in 2019. Here again the main idea is to focus on its core growth business of HVAC and its complementary building systems (fire and safety) solutions.

Regulatory requirements and reducing carbon emissions

Given that buildings are responsible for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions globally it's clear that HVAC suppliers have a key role to play in helping companies reduce their carbon footprint. In fact at a recent Morgan Stanley conference Trane CEO Mike Lamach said that ""a quarter of the world's emissions happen as a result of HVAC systems in buildings and through food loss and the cold chain"" and he believes that figure will grow to 35% by 2030.

Lamach sees HVAC systems as being responsible for ""40% to 60% of the energy used in the building."" Carrier Trane and Johnson Controls own substantive refrigerated transportation businesses that can help reduce food waste.

Meanwhile Johnson Controls CEO George Oliver believes his company has an opportunity to benefit from the hundreds of billions worth of investment necessary in commercial buildings in order for companies to achieve their aim of net-zero carbon emissions.

Digitization and IoT

The solution to helping companies meet regulatory requirements and meeting demand for HVAC comes from the more efficient pump and refrigerant technology offered by these three companies. However it also comes from the increasing use of digital applications in connected buildings.

By using digital technology such as Johnson Controls OpenBlue solutions building owners can use artificial intelligence to improve a building's performance and better predict maintenance requirements.

That's a win-win scenario for building owners and high-quality HVAC suppliers alike. The owners get more efficient buildings and the HVAC companies get to sell value-added digital solutions. Moreover the addition of digital technology will create more loyal customers and improve attachment rates leading to improved service revenue over the long term -- a key aim for Carrier.

As such digitization will improve revenue growth and profit margins for the leading HVAC players.

Valuation matters

The growth prospects are not lost on Wall Street analysts and the consensus is for mid-single-digit revenue growth for all three for the foreseeable future. Based on the analyst consensus for free cash flow Johnson Controls and Carrier look like a good value right now.

All told the HVAC industry offers a compelling combination of long-term revenue growth and margin expansion. There's a definite need to provide HVAC and ensure it complies with carbon emission aims while adding value through digital technology. That environment should favor Carrier Trane and Johnson Controls for many years to come.",,,,,,,,,

When writer Allison Hope first entered the job market she chose to work for smaller independent Dyke TV rather than NBC because she believed that the community needed more representation. Hope has been actively fighting for that representation in a number of ways throughout the years. “As I’ve moved through my career path I’ve been privileged to raise the platform on which my queer voice is shared” she tells GO. “I’ve been fortunate that my LGBTQ identity has been viewed as an asset and one I’ve been able to leverage to help drive equity and inclusion.” Her writing which focuses on LGBTQ+ women’s rights social issues parenting and lifestyle trends has appeared in The New York Times The Washington Post CNN Buzzfeed Cosmopolitan and New York Magazine. Hope also boasts over 17 years of marketing and digital media experience working with brands including Mastercard JetBlue JPMorgan Chase and the ACLU focusing primarily on diversity equity and inclusion. In addition to writing Hope currently teaches marketing and communications classes at Hunter College CUNY and SUNY Purchase. “I’ve always had a strong sense of justice and the sense that I must speak up and out on behalf of those who are being silenced or marginalized” says Hope. “It was natural for me to lean into journalism and communications whether for a civil rights cause niche LGBTQ outlet or at a large company or media entity focused on inclusion work.” —IL",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L3RkLWJlY29tZXMtbGF0ZXN0LWJhbmstdG8tYWRkcmVzcy1vdmVyZHJhZnQtZmVlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TD becomes latest bank to address overdraft fees with new account option policies - Philadelphia Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2021/06/26/td-becomes-latest-bank-to-address-overdraft-fees.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L3RkLWJlY29tZXMtbGF0ZXN0LWJhbmstdG8tYWRkcmVzcy1vdmVyZHJhZnQtZmVlcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJhbmtlci5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1QcmVzcy1SZWxlYXNlLVdvcmxkLXMtdG9wLWJhbmtzLXdlYXRoZXItcGFuZGVtaWMtc3Rvcm0tMTYyNDgzNDkyNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International Press Release: World's top banks weather pandemic storm,"28 June 2021: The world’s largest banks have withstood the pressures from the Covid-19 pandemic adding 12.7% to their collective Tier 1 capital to reach the highest ever level of $9.9 trillion according to The Banker’s latest ranking of the Top 1000 World Banks. In addition total assets increased by 16.0% to $148.6 trillion while the deposit base expanded by 17.1% to $93.9 trillion.

Compared to the global financial crisis in 2007-09 there is more resilience in the banking sector. Overall the Top 1000 World Banks increased the allowance for loan losses (or the reserve to cover bad debts) by 25.8% to $1.7 trillion which is a bigger increase than the aggregate loan book which grew by 11.4%. However as many jurisdictions have extended their Covid-19 support packages into 2021 the true impact of the pandemic has not hit the banks’ loan books yet.

Despite challenging economic conditions banks have been able to generate pre-tax profits (see table: Top 10 Countries’ profit change). However most countries recorded a reduction in pre-tax profits with just 16 countries increasing aggregate profits. While the Top 1000’s combined profits dropped by 19.2% year-on-year it is not as catastrophic when compared to the fallout from the financial crisis when profits plummeted 85.3% in 2009.

China continues to be the engine of growth for the world’s banking industry increasing aggregate Tier 1 capital and total assets by 18.6% and 18.4% respectively. China with 144 banks in the ranking now holds almost double the amount of Tier 1 capital ($2.96 trillion) than the US ($1.58 trillion) with 178 banks in the ranking.

The four largest Chinese banks – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China – have consolidated their positions at the top of the ranking and have extended their lead over US counterparts (JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Citigroup and Wells Fargo) with double-digit growth in Tier 1 capital (see table: Top 20 World Banks 2021). Overall Chinese banks increased their aggregate Tier 1 capital by 18.6% against 8.5% for US banks.

In addition profits continued to grow in China by 5.2% year-on-year while falling by 31.5% in the US and 41.8% in western Europe.

Joy Macknight editor of The Banker said: “During a challenging year for the world’s banking industry the top Chinese banks have extended their lead over US counterparts with double-digit increases in Tier 1 capital as well as expanding their asset base and increasing profits. The global banking industry overall has exhibited impressive resilience in such a difficult time.”

However western Europe had another difficult year – due to low economic growth and the interest rate environment hitting the profitability of the region’s biggest lenders. Of the largest European economies banks’ aggregate pre-tax profits shrank by 43.71% in Germany 75.72% in Italy and 47.67% in Netherlands while France experienced a more modest decline of 11.61%. Spain recorded negative pre-tax profits at an aggregate level with two of its largest banks Banco Santander and Bankia moving from profit to loss in this period (see table: Ten largest moves from profit to loss).

The Asia-Pacific region generated more than half (55.1%) of the world’s profits based on net income data up from 43.5% in the 2020 ranking and was the only region to increase its share of profits.

Tier 1 capital is the core measure of a bank’s financial strength under the Basel regulatory framework.

Here’s who emerged as winners losers,"For Dallas-Fort Worth’s public companies there may never be another year like 2020.

With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the economy in every way many of the region’s biggest corporate players shrank dragged down by a slump in oil prices a reluctance to fly or the complete shutdown of live events and other entertainment.

It also was the year Exxon Mobil Corp. the region’s perennial king of the hill fell a notch in The Dallas Morning News’ annual ranking compiled with the assistance of Bloomberg data analysts.

McKesson Corp. one of North Texas’ California transplants surpassed the Irving-based oil giant to gain the top spot with revenue exceeding $231 billion compared with Exxon’s $178 billion.

But don’t count Exxon out.

With oil prices on the rebound this year the global player could ascend once again based on the strength of early 2021 results that saw Exxon book $59 billion in revenue in the first three months. McKesson which operates on an April to March fiscal year has already set the 2021 target recording $238 billion in revenue.

After the top two it was a textbook example of winners and losers.

Health care companies homebuilders financial firms and consumer products makers — especially toilet paper supplier Kimberly-Clark — all turned in revenue wins. Arlington-based D.R. Horton the nation’s largest homebuilder saw a 15% spike in its revenue and its subsidiary that develops residential lots Forestar Group soared more than 117%.

North Texas homebuying surged 21% in January from the previous year and never really slowed down after that. Credit low mortgage rates and a seller’s market for driving home prices to unprecedented levels.

Airlines oil and gas retailers and hotel and restaurant chains took massive hits feeling the pandemic’s hibernation-inducing grip for much of the year. Fort Worth-based American Airlines watched its revenue plummet 62% and its crosstown rival Dallas-based Southwest Airlines didn’t fare much better — sinking nearly 60%.

But as vaccination rates pick up and consumers confined to their homes much of last year begin to revenge spend 2021 is shaping up as a year of recovery for nearly every corner of North Texas’ highly diversified economy.

Who came out on top?

McKesson’s rise to the top marks the first time one of the region’s California transplants led the Top 150 ranking. The medical and pharmaceutical supplier moved to North Texas in April 2019.

Now headquartered in Irving McKesson saw its revenue soar almost $17 billion in its 2020 fiscal year. And that didn’t include much of the financial lift it got from lucrative government contracts to deliver vaccine supplies around the country.

At the start of the pandemic people scrambled to stock up on prescriptions to prepare for government-ordered lockdowns said Ashtyn Evans a health care equity analyst at the Edward Jones investment firm. Drug volumes dipped later in the year as the pandemic dragged on.

“Health care typically holds up better because it’s harder to delay health care products” said Evans who noted that McKesson distributes one-third of all prescriptions in the U.S.

Other locally based health care companies also benefited from the nation’s pandemic response.

Retractable Technologies Inc. a Little Elm-based maker of syringes saw its 2020 revenue nearly double from the previous year on the strength of government contracts to ramp up production for the vaccine rollout. Its two contracts totaled $137. 4 million last year.

Addus HomeCare Corp. a Frisco-based caregiver business that operates 215 locations in 23 states posted a nearly 18% revenue gain as Americans turned to home care rather than in-person visits to the doctor or hospital.

But 2020 wasn’t universally positive for all health-related companies. Farmers Branch-based Tenet Healthcare for example saw its revenue fall 4.5% primarily from a pause in elective surgeries — an increasingly important part of its business.

Wedbrush financial adviser Chris Mooney said elective surgery postponements weighed heavily last year on the U.S. health care industry’s financial results. The businesses “were hurt overall besides the [government] grants that helped” he said.

Mooney pointed to Orthofix a Lewisville-based medical device company that manufactures implants and screws used in surgeries and the $53 million revenue hit it took last year.

Patient volumes are rebounding this year and hospital stocks are soaring. Tenet’s shares are up around 70% year-to-date.

The biggest winners in 2020 were any companies involved in building homes as the red-hot housing market accelerated throughout the pandemic.

Builder D.R. Horton Inc. posted a 15.5% revenue gain in 2020 and homebuilding supplier Builders FirstSource’s sales spiked 17.6%. D.R. Horton’s affiliated company Forestar Group Inc. had that triple-digit revenue gain.

Edward Jones consumer analyst Brian Yarbrough called it a “perfect storm” year for the residential real estate industry with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates low and the health crisis causing many urban residents to seek land and space in suburban or rural areas.

“The pendulum swung toward [the industry]” Yarbrough said. “How big does it swing back toward entertainment? As people get back to normal they may not have as much cash laying around.”

Last year’s divisive presidential election also played a role in driving up revenue for another North Texas company. Irving-based Nexstar Media Group the nation’s largest owner of local television stations moved into the ranking’s top 30 as its revenue soared by $1.5 billion. It cited political advertising as a key contributor.

Who took the hardest hits?

The pandemic and resulting recession had a predictably disastrous impact on industries and companies involved in oil and gas production or anything to do with travel and hospitality.

Exxon pipeline operator Energy Transfer and its related gasoline distributor Sunoco refiner HollyFrontier and Irving-based independent oil and gas explorer Pioneer Natural Resources all recorded revenue drops ranging from 27% to 36%. High oil prices early in 2020 followed by a falloff in driving during the pandemic are mostly to blame.

Petroleum consumption by the transportation sector declined 16% last year according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Transportation typically accounts for 70% of all U.S. petroleum use.

Despite a troubled 2020 the energy market is almost back to where it was before the pandemic Mooney said. Some analysts are forecasting $100 oil by the end of the year.

“If that happens that would certainly pull capital back into the Texas oil industry” according to a monthly report compiled by Robert Dye Comerica Inc.’s chief economist. “By the third week of June the Texas rig count had improved to 221 active rigs more than double the level from a year earlier.”

The air travel industry is also coming back.

On June 20 the most recent Sunday travel day passenger traffic through U.S. airports had rebounded to 77% of pre-pandemic levels according to data from the Transportation Security Administration. That was up nearly 256% from 2020′s dismal number on the same day.

A year ago Dallas-Fort Worth’s two major airlines were worried about simply surviving as multibillion-dollar losses led to an industry bailout by the federal government. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines both took billions of dollars in grants and loans to stave off mass layoffs that could have sunk the country into a deeper recession.

Both companies tumbled in The News’ annual ranking. American fell from the fifth-largest company in D-FW by revenue to ninth. Southwest slipped from sixth to 19th.

Rivaling the travel industry for hardest hit by the pandemic were the hotel restaurant and entertainment sectors.

Revenue declines recorded by Dallas hotelier Monty Bennett’s empire especially Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc. and Braemar Hotels and Resorts Inc. were typical across that industry. Ashford Hospitality Trust’s revenue evaporated by 66% while Braemar saw 53% of its revenue disappear.

For a finer point on the pandemic’s impact look no further than amusement parks and movie theaters. Shelter-in-place orders and germ spread fears led to silenced rides and empty seats.

Arlington-based Six Flags Entertainment Corp. which operates 26 theme parks in North America watched its revenue dwindle from nearly $1.5 billion in 2019 to $356 million last year — a 76% drop.

Plano-based Cinemark Holdings Inc.’s decline was even more dramatic. Revenue for the movie theater chain plummeted from $3.28 billion in 2019 to $686 million last year — a 79% dive.

Both companies are building back this year with amusement parks and movie theaters reopened. Cinemark has even tapped into new ways to use its theaters — as esports venues for public gaming.

New faces and the soon-to-be departed

Corporate headquarters relocations initial public offerings and direct listings through special purpose acquisition companies brought a handful of new names to this year’s ranking.

Real estate titan CBRE Group made Dallas its official corporate home leaving California behind and taking a spot among D-FW’s five largest companies. Financial services firm First Foundation also left the Golden State.

Drive Shack a golf entertainment business similar to Dallas-based Topgolf or ClubCorp’s Big Shots arrived from the East Coast moving its headquarters from New York to Dallas.

Thryv Holdings Alkami Technology Vine Energy Signify Health RumbleOn and Berry Corp. are also first-timers in the ranking. Thryv’s 2020 revenue topped $1.1 billion making it one of 67 D-FW companies to top the billion-dollar mark.

Next year’s ranking also stands to lose some longtime names through go-private deals or mergers.

Plano-based At Home Group Inc. Irving-based Michaels Cos. Inc. Euless-based U.S. Concrete Inc. Dallas-based RealPage Inc. and Grand Prairie-based Neos Therapeutics all have closed deals or are in the process of leaving the public company ranks.

Looking forward

So what’s ahead for the remainder of 2021?

In May the Dallas-Plano-Irving side of the metro area created 17400 jobs last month accounting for half the new jobs statewide. But the eastern side of D-FW is still 75000 jobs shy of its pre-pandemic level.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had projected that Texas would add over 800000 jobs this year which would have recouped all the positions lost during the pandemic. It has since cut its forecast to 510500 this year in part because of new COVID-19 fears.

“The forecast was revised down this month primarily due to an upward revision in the anticipated path of COVID-19 hospitalizations” said Keith Phillips Dallas Fed assistant vice president and senior economist. “While the percentage of Texans vaccinated against COVID-19 continues to increase the pace of vaccinations has slowed and the more contagious Delta variant is spreading. Together these two patterns have changed the outlook for COVID-19 hospitalizations in the third quarter from a consistent downward trend to a slight increase through September.”

Supply-side complications such as difficulty finding workers widescale shortages of materials long lead times and transportation issues also threaten to restrain economic growth according to Dallas Fed senior business economist Laila Assanie and research analyst Carlee Crocker.

Waco economist Ray Perryman remains bullish on Texas’ rebound.

“We can reasonably expect a solid comeback as the global economy is able to reopen and both business and leisure travel resume” Perryman said. He noted that prices are rising too — a positive sign for businesses trying to make up lost ground.

“The fortunes of individual companies will vary based on specific circumstances but there should be ample opportunities for expansion and innovation going forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90ZWNoL20taXBob25lLXBvd2VyLXVzZXItZXZlbi0xNDMzMjQ4ODAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm an iPhone power user but even I didn't know this great iOS trick,"After using the iPhone for well over a decade stumbling across a new iOS feature or setting I wasn’t aware of isn’t all that common. Still with Apple rolling out new iOS updates with dozens upon dozens of new features every single year the simple reality is that iOS is brimming with features that can even catch seasoned iPhone users by pleasant surprise.

As a prime example just a few months ago I came across a simple way to record video footage while simultaneously playing music in the background via Spotify or Apple Music. For years it was a feature I was wishing for and little did I know Apple already had it baked into iOS.

As another example Gadethacks alerted me to the fact that you can easily stop your iPhone from offering up irrelevant Siri Suggestions. Siri Suggestions as the name implies is a feature that offers up simple shortcuts for actions that your device based on previous behaviors thinks you might want to do.

A few examples listed by Apple include:

Create email and events: When you start adding people to an email or calendar event Siri suggests the people you included in previous emails or events.

Receive calls: If you get an incoming call from an unknown number Siri lets you know who might be calling—based on phone numbers included in your emails.

Leave for an event: If your calendar event includes a location Siri assesses traffic conditions and notifies you when to leave.

See your flight status: If you have a boarding pass in Mail or Wallet Siri shows your flight status in Maps. You can tap the suggestion when you’re ready to get directions to the airport.

Type: As you enter text Siri can suggest names of movies places—anything you viewed on iPhone recently. If you tell a friend you’re on your way Siri can even suggest your estimated arrival time.

Search in Safari: Siri suggests websites and other information in the search field as you type.

Above the keyboard Siri also suggests words and phrases based on what you were just reading.

Confirm an appointment or book a flight on a travel website: Siri asks if you want to add it to your calendar.

Read News stories: As Siri learns which topics you’re interested in they’ll be suggested in News.

While this is all well and good and typically helpful some Siri Suggestions just miss the mark entirely. And as it turns out if you see a Siri Suggestion that isn’t something you’re interested in you can long-press on the shortcut whereupon you’ll see a “Suggest Shortcut Less” option that you can select.

You’ll see that prompt for shortcuts on the home and lock screen. This trick works the same for contact suggestions in your share sheet but the prompt here is “Share Less” since the suggested contacts aren’t shortcuts.

You can also adjust where Siri Suggestions appear entirely by going to Settings > Siri & Search and then toggling on or off any of the following options:

Suggestions while Searching

Suggestions on Lock Screen

Suggestions on Home Screen

Suggestions when Sharing

From my own experience Siri Suggestions are typically helpful. Still the tweaks above can come in handy on the rare occasion that a suggestion is way off-base or even outdated. As an illustrative example you might not be too thrilled to see Siri Suggestions giving you a quick shortcut to message a significant other you recently separated from.

And while we’re on the topic of interesting iOS features make sure to take a look at our list of awesome iOS 15 features Apple didn’t have a chance to highlight during its WWDC keynote last week.

That’s huge news for investors in the junior explorer Reconnaissance Energy Africa (TSXV:RECO OTC:RECAF) that slipped into this massive play before the supermajors had time to blink.

What looks to have been a brilliantly timed acquisition based on a treasure trove of government-held data few knew existed is now hoping to help reshape poverty-stricken Namibia’s future.

And at a mammoth 8.5 million acres this basin spans an area comparable to the largest projects in the Lone Star state. And Recon Africa holds petroleum exploration licenses for the entire basin.

If you’re not sure how big 8.5 million acres is Stocktwits has superimposed it on the State of Florida for perspective:

Recently some oil majors have been flocking to Africa since it’s considered to be among the last underexplored areas on Earth…

Low production costs in frontier oil plays have led to some exciting opportunities that have helped put countries like Suriname and Guyana on the proverbial map.

And Africa may be the final frontier with an oil boom emerging as drilling spreads across the continent according to one report.

But while companies like Shell and Exxon have latched onto offshore opportunities in one of the continent’s most stable and friendliest governments…

We think they completely missed the Namibian government’s treasure trove of data including a potentially valuable high-quality aeromagnetic survey data that had never been interpreted.

And when this junior discovered what the government had so skillfully acquired...

They scooped up exploration rights for the entire Kavango Basin giving them exclusive petroleum licenses to an area that’s millions of acres in size.

This may truly be the final frontier of onshore oil exploration among the last Permian-sized basins that have never been drilled.

And it’s opportunities just like these that have produced impressive gains in recent years for other explorers that made a discovery.

Africa Oil scored 379% gains after reporting a discovery of oil in Kenya.

Valeura Energy Corp’s shares skyrocketed for 1000% gains after reporting a discovery in Turkey.

Now in Namibia ReconAfrica is already up 377% in less than a year having found indicators of the existence of a working petroleum system in its first well (6-2) in April and then encountering oil and gas again in the shallow section of its second drill (6-1) which is still ongoing.

We think it would be flying far north of its 377% gain right now but naked short sellers appear to have latched onto the stock producing what look to be hit pieces in a desperate attempt to cover huge naked shorts before potential results confirm what we believe could end up being the last great onshore oil discovery in the world.

The short sellers are running out of time to cover …

Here’s why we think you should be keeping a close eye on Reconnaissance Energy Africa.

First Well Successes Rarely Reverse

On April 15th Recon Africa (TSXV:RECO OTC:RECAF) in a joint press release with the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Namibia announced the results of its first of three drills (6-2) showing clear evidence of an active petroleum system for this nearly 9-million-acre basin. The samples provide over 200 meters of light oil and natural gas indicators/shows over three discrete intervals in a stacked sequence of reservoir and source rock.

The results were unexpected by the company as this was just the first of three stratigraphic planned wells but there would be another surprise just weeks later as RECO got started on its second well ...

On June 3rd the first section of its second well (6-1) provided further evidence of a working petroleum system.

At shallow depths the well encountered 134 meters of light oil and gas.

""In these first two wells the many oil and gas shows with such variety is certainly remarkable. It is highly encouraging to see clastic and thick carbonate sections which appear to have similar reservoir characteristics as observed in many other petroleum provinces” ReconAfrica director Dr. Jim Granath said in a statement.



Recon Africa have since put out a further update letting investors know that a further 685 feet of hydrocarbon shows comprising a variety of light oil and natural gas have been discovered so far in the second section of well 2.



With intermediate casing operations reportedly now complete and the company stating that everything is on schedule RECO expects to finish drilling its 6-1 well during the first week of July.

The company also unveiled its commitment to allocate a minimum of $10 million in ESG expenditures to the Kavango region in which it operates.

While RECO is a high-risk/high-reward oil exploration play exploration patterns from the past suggest that success in the first wells typically means a high potential of continued success.

The former Vice-President and Head of Global Oil and Gas Research at CIBC World Markets G. DeWolf Shaw CFA notes that “during the modern era of the great oil discoveries a geological success on the first well or a geological failure was rarely reversed. First wells with successes like 6-2 mean progressively less risk for next 4 wells because of an exponential increase in new data.”

And it helps that RECO has world-class geologists on its team ...

The Kavango Basin is an enormous area spanning millions of acres across Namibia and Botswana.

And at 8.50 million acres that’s nearly the size of the massive Midland Basin in the Permian which is owned by countless different producers today.

So for this vast area’s exploration licenses to be held by one company is almost unheard of especially for a junior explorer.

That means the potential upside for this opportunity is unlike most we’ve seen in a decade.

After acquiring rights to Namibia’s Aeromag data Recon Africa (TSXV:RECO OTC:RECAF) quickly had this analyzed by some of the most experienced experts in oil exploration.

This data reportedly shows that the sedimentary basin could run as deep as 30000 feet.

That would make it as deep as the Permian Basin in West Texas which has been estimated to contain a potential 46.3 billion barrels of oil.

And the most exciting part for us is that the majority of any potential production is expected to be conventional which means no fracking and none of those exorbitant costs associated with unconventional plays.

This could all add up to even greater potential for profits for Recon Africa and their investors if a major discovery is made.

But while this may be a small-cap explorer to us there’s nothing small about the names behind it.

When this all began experienced geological interpreter Bill Cathey said the data on Kavango showed some of the best data he’d ever seen…

“Nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that has not produced commercial quantities of hydrocarbons” he said.

Then they called in Daniel Jarvie president of Worldwide Geochemistry LLC and a highly experienced geochemist previously named “Hart Energy’s Most Influential People for the Petroleum Industry in the Next Decade” in 2010.

After analyzing the data Jarvie estimated that ReconAfrica could be sitting on a basin that could generate up billions of barrels of oil…

Based on only 12% of their holdings.

These numbers might seem unbelievable but Jarvie actually said this could be a conservative estimate of potential.

“Given the nature of the basin and the tremendous thickness this is pretty much a no-brainer...It will be productive and I’m expecting high-quality oil” he said.

That was before RECO’s first two announcements in April and June.

Now both Cathey and Jarvie--not to mention the entire RECO team and all of its investors--could be vindicated.

Not only does Recon Africa (TSXV:RECO OTC:RECAF) hold petroleum licenses to the entire Kavango Basin but one expert after another has stepped up to indicate the potential of this opportunity.

Nick Steinberger for example has also joined ReconAfrica’s team as their Senior Vice President Drilling and Operations.

After spending over 30 years helping to lead an oil and gas company that was sold for a reported $3.1 billion he could have gone wherever he liked in the industry.

So to have someone of his caliber on the team speaks volumes about how confident many are in the future of their drilling program. The entire management team are also reported to be shareholders.

Steinberger has observed several similarities between the Kavango and the Permian basin noting “It’s the same setting the same geological time frame and looks like the same type of thickness.

“The top of the Permian section of Kavango is expected to be 6000-8000 feet in depth which is the same as the Permian in Texas.”

Haywood Securities initiated coverage on RECO in November and has adjusted its price target three times since. They also participated in RECO’s C$25-million bought deal financing. See latest news release…the financing closed at $41+mm

A discovery success says Haywood would present manifold opportunities for strategic joint ventures for further de-risking--without additional shareholder dilution. This play “has all the ingredients to establish the existence of a working hydrocarbon system (in a relatively short cycle time) and subsequently evaluate and exploit the potential of the Kavango Basin” Haywood wrote in its most recent report.

That includes “a fully-funded three well program nearly 100% working interest in acreage across a vast relatively straightforward land access an owned drilling rig a committed and capable management and technical team stable governments with attractive fiscal terms and proven commitment to responsible development” … among other things.

Even without the recent positive first and second drill results showing indicators of a petroleum system Haywood sees material upside as Kavango is further de-risked and have recently moved their short term price target up to $16.00 CAD.

In a further boost of confidence Wood Mackenzie compared RECO’s Kavango basin to the Midland Basin in Texas which has a development value of $540 billion.

More News Could Be Just Days or Weeks Away

RECO’s second announcement that it encountered indicators of oil and gas in the second drill (6-1) was only in the shallower section…

There’s more to come.

Drill no. 2 is expected to be completed by the end of this month …

And the preliminary analysis of all results from the wells 6-1 and 6-2 are anticipated at the end of July.

From the first well (6-2) over 150 sidewall cores have been taken to Core Labs in Houston and 37 sidewall cores are on their way there as well from the shallower section of the 6-1 well.

Then we’ve got drill three and possibly four which is expected this year too.

And that’s just in the near term. Further out the news flow could get even more exciting because this is a huge basin. If a commercial discovery is established in the future we may be looking at a juicy potential JV deal that could be the biggest reward for investors.

In the meantime while they’re hoping for great success by turning Kavango into the last major onshore oil play in the world they’re not forgetting Namibia and they’re committed to ensuring that the people of Namibia don’t become victims of yet another African “resource curse”.

ReconAfrica isn’t operating in a vacuum here. They seem fully aware of what this could mean to the people of Namibia.

For starters RECO’s founder Craig Steinke says the carbonates they found so far “look like carbonate rocks seen in northern Africa where basically conventional completion methods will make them productive. No fracking.”

And for Namibia a huge conventional oil play could be “transformational” particularly for the 250000 people in the Kavango region 40% of whom live in generational poverty.

“This will provide the local citizens with good-paying jobs upwardly mobile jobs that will help pull them out of poverty provide access to fresh water and basic medical services” Steinke says. RECO reports it is already employing 200 people in the area.

Water is also a major problem that RECO recognized from the start.

“One of the glaring problems in the region is the local population don’t have the wherewithal to drill water wells but there is a freshwater aquifer right under their feet. They have to walk up to 10 km per day with 45 lbs of water on their heads” Steinke says.

And to that end RECO has committed a minimum of C$10 million for ESG expenditures in Namibia.

As soon as RECO’s rig hit the ground in Kavango the company reported it set up shop with the local authorities to drill water wells. They’ve announced drilling of four water wells so far and are permitting sixteen more.

The Final Word

RECO scooped up licenses for an 8.5-million-acre play the size of Belgium in the Kavango Basin before supermajors had a chance to blink.

Then they started drilling water wells for the local communities and have committed to allocating millions to ESG performance standards.

They’ve got veteran geologists on their team. One says “nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.” The other estimates the basin could have generated billions of barrels of oil and gas.

Wood Mackenzie compares it to the Midland Basin which has a development value of $540-billion.

Market value is already up 377% year-to-date with potential to increase if results keep coming in as they have been and short sellers may have a hard time covering.

RECO has encountered oil and gas indicators in its first 2 drills so far and they aren’t even done with the second of three.

They appear well-funded for this 3-drill campaign and beyond. After the three-well program and 2D seismic they estimate they’ll have over $50 million remaining in the treasury.

More news looks set to come at the end of this month when RECO is expected to complete its second drill and then again in July when lab analysis is anticipated back …

Other companies looking to capitalize on an increase in oil prices:



ConocoPhillips Company (NYSE:COP) as the largest pure upstream company has performed relatively well in this depressed market generating ample free cash flow and returning a good chunk of it to shareholders. Unlike many of its peers who continued to expand aggressively during the shale boom COP has taken several steps to lower costs and fortify its balance sheet.

Like many of its peers ConocoPhillips has been gradually offloading non-core assets including the sale of its North Sea oil and gas assets for $2.7 billion and the planned sale of its Australian assets for $1.4B. Its asset portfolio however remains healthy.



Thanks to a global recovery in demand Conoco has seen an increasingly bullish look on the industry and it was one of the few companies which did not partake in the mass-layoffs seen in the industry last year. In addition Conoco has also seen a fairly decent about of insiders buying into its stock which is a good sign.



Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) is focused on developing its pre-salt operations. And it’s easy to see why. Those upstream projects being approved for development must have a breakeven price of $35 per Brent or less. Brazil’s national oil company has budgeted capital spending for exploration and production activities of $46.5 billion from 2021 to 2025.

Clearly while the pandemic has hit Brazil’s oil industry causing production to fall because of savage budget cuts and well shut-ins it appears to have done no material long-term damage. Demand for Petrobras’ low sulfur content fuel is firm and will grow because of the global push to significantly reduce emissions which will ultimately make Petrobras even more valuable over time.



Petrobras remains one of the most underrated oil majors in the world. It’s got desirable crude oil a massive footprint in its domestic industry and a growing amount of interest from investors. It’s also bouncing off of low share prices like the rest of the industry indicating there could be some upside left.



Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is a leader in the industry and the second-largest oil company on the New York Stock Exchange. Chevron is also betting big on Africa particularly Nigeria and Angola. The supermajor ranks among the top oil producers in the two African nations. Other areas on the continent where the company holds interests include Benin Ghana the Republic of Congo and Togo. Chevron also holds a 36.7 percent interest in the West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited which supplies Nigerian natural gas to customers in the region. With bets on both oil and natural gas the company is looking to take advantage of both fossil fuels. Though prices are still depressed at the moment as fuel demand returns to normal Chevron could be a big winner as prices climb back up to pre-pandemic levels.



While Chevron still has not fully recovered from the massive hit it took back in March 2020 where it dropped to a 5-year low of just $59 the oil giant has made some progress thanks to recovering oil prices. Sitting at $104 at the time of writing Chevron is slowly recuperating some of its losses and is positioned well to benefit in the mid to long term



Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) is the third largest NYSE-listed company coming in just under Chevron. And similar to Chevron Shell has also made some big bets in Africa. In fact it is one of the leaders in the region. The Dutch oil giant began drilling in the region over 70 years ago and now has energy assets in over 20 countries across the continent. Though it has sold off a number of its prized plays in the region in recent years it continues to maintain a strong presence especially in South Africa.



Africa in particular South Africa is key for Shell because the government has been significantly more stable than some of the other big bets on the continent. Moreover the country has been very open to Shell in its projects. The company’s operations in South Africa include retail and commercial fuel lubricant chemical and manufacturing. It’s also heavily invested in upstream exploration. It even holds the exploration rights to the Orange Basin Deep Water area off the country’s west coast and has applications for shale gas exploration rights in the Karoo in central South Africa.



Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) a major North American pipeline operator  has been particularly upbeat in recent months. In fact in early December it issued optimistic updates planning higher dividends and expecting more profits in 2021 after the challenges the oil industry has faced last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the wider market crash. Kinder Morgan also expects to raise its dividend for 2021 by 3 percent compared to this year.

Kinder Morgan Inc's chief executive officer Steve Kean noted ""With budgeted excess coverage of that dividend we expect also to be able to engage in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis.”



Kinder Morgan is a must-watch in the industry. With dividends on the rise oil prices increasing and bullish sentiment returning to the oil industry there could be some significant upside left for this pipeline operator especially as oil begins flowing at pre-pandemic levels.



Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ; TSX:CNQ) has been able to do what many of its Canadian counterparts haven’t been able to keep its dividend intact after swinging to a loss for the first half of the COVID pandemic while Canada's producers are scaling back production by around 1 million bpd amid low oil prices and demand. Though Canadian Natural Resources kept its dividend it withdrew its production guidance for 2020 however. It also said it would curtail some production at high-cost conventional projects in North America and oil sands operations and carry out planned turnaround activities at oil sands projects in the second half of 2020.

Though there is a lot of negative press surrounding Canada’s oil sands the industry is starting to clean up its act a bit. And Canadian Natural Resources is leading the charge. And if analysts are right about Canada’s comeback Canadian Natural Resources could be in for a big year.



Though the Canadian energy giant has seen its stock price slump this year it could provide a potential opportunity for investors as oil prices rebound. It is already up over 170% from its March 2020 lows but it is just getting started. If oil prices continue to climb it could be huge news for investors that held on.



Enbridge (NYSE:ENB TSX:ENB) is a giant in Canada’s oil industry and it is in a great position as oil and gas stages its 2021 comeback. As one of the more potentially undervalued companies in the sector it could be set to win big this year. But that’s only if it can overcome some of the challenges in its path. Most specifically its Line 3 project has faced scrutiny from environmentalists.

The massive multi-billion project plans to replace Enbridge's existing 282 miles of 34-inch pipeline with 337 miles of 36-inch pipe. The new Line 3 would have the capacity to move 370000 barrels of oil per day alleviating the takeaway capacity constraints that Canadian oil producers have been struggling with for years now. Line 3 is one of two pipeline projects in the works that are—in their unfinished state—keeping Canada's oil industry from reaching its potential.



Though this challenge seem prove difficult for Enbridge to overcome the overall health of the Canadian oil industry is improving and with it the outlook for Canadian producers such as Enbridge. Enbridge started the year off with a bang and if oil prices continue the upward trajectory they’ve seen over the past few months the Canadian giant could see some upside still.



TC Energy Corporation (NYSE:TRP TSX:TRP) is a Calgary-based energy giant. The company owns and operates energy infrastructure throughout North America. TC Energy is one of the continent’s largest providers of gas storage and owns and has interests in approximately 11800 megawatts of power generation. It’s also one of the continent’s most important pipeline operators. With TC Energy’s massive influence throughout North America it is no wonder that the company is among one of Canada’s strongest and well-known companies.



Like a number of its peers one of TC Energy’s biggest challenges in recent years was grappling with the particularly difficult approval process for its Keystone Pipeline. But that’s all history now and with the bounce back in oil and gas demand TC Energy could stand to benefit. While TC Energy’s stock price has yet to recover from pre-pandemic levels it is one of the few industry giants which has managed to keep high dividends rolling in. With quarterly payouts exceeding 6% TC has remained appealing for investors in the industry.



Suncor Energy (TSX:SU) is another giant in Canada’s industry. It has set itself apart from some of its peers through a number of high-tech solutions for finding pumping storing and delivering its resources. Not only is it big in the oil sector but it is also a leader in renewable energy. Recently the company invested $300 million in a wind farm located in Alberta showing that it is committed to reducing its carbon footprint.



Now that oil prices are finally recovering giants like Suncor looking to capitalize. While many of the oil majors have given up on oil sands production – those who focus on technological advancements in the area have a great long-term outlook. And that upside is further amplified by the fact that it is currently looking particularly under-valued compared to its peers especially as lithium which is present in Canada’s oil sands becomes an even more desirable commodity.



CNOOC Limited (TSX:CNU) is one of the world’s most interesting oil and gas companies. It is China’s most significant producer of offshore crude oil and natural gas and may well be one of the most controversial oil stocks for investors on the market. A label that has nothing to do with its operations however.



The relationship between the United States and China has admittedly been better and if things were to take a turn for the worst it could have a major impact on global natural gas given that CNOOC is China's largest importer of LNG. But the Biden administration has been working to improve relations and as such Chinese companies including CNOOC are likely to breathe freely once again and it be great news for investors in Chinese stocks.

However there is no assurance that Recon's future exploration and development efforts will result in the discovery or development of commercial accumulations of oil and natural gas. In addition even if hydrocarbons are discovered the costs of extracting and delivering the hydrocarbons to market and variations in the market price may render uneconomic any discovered deposit. Geological conditions are variable and unpredictable. Even if production is commenced from a well the quantity of hydrocarbons produced inevitably will decline over time and production may be adversely affected or may have to be terminated altogether if Recon encounters unforeseen geological conditions. Adverse climatic conditions at such properties may also hinder Recon's ability to carry on exploration or production activities continuously throughout any given year.

But how does that work?,"The news came to Tampa Bay on billboards in mailboxes and through radio and TV ads: Residents can now get groceries delivered by the well-known Cincinnati-based 138-year-old Kroger grocery store.

But how exactly can customers get their bacon broccoli and baby food delivered by a chain that doesn’t have actual stores here?

This month Kroger made an e-commerce foray into Florida with a 375000 square-foot “customer fulfillment center” in Groveland a Lake County town west of Orlando. That high-tech facility serves as the base for deliveries in Tampa and St. Petersburg Orlando and Jacksonville.

Credit the pandemic which skyrocketed online grocery shopping in the Sunshine State something Kroger appears ready to bet on.

But notably America’s largest grocery store chain is not taking on Florida’s uncontested king Publix with traditional brick-and-mortar stores.

“We’re really focusing on the e-commerce and delivery service right now” said Andrea Colby e-commerce corporate affairs and communications manager for Kroger.

And what’s going on in that warehouse — a highly-automated system of a thousand busy robots whizzing around fulfilling customer requests — will be closely watched by the industry particularly post-pandemic.

“It’s really going to be fascinating to see how well Kroger is going to be able to break into that market just with an online delivery approach” said Gary Hawkins CEO of the Center for Advancing Retail & Technology.

Here’s how it works: A customer places an order at Kroger.com or on the store’s app for next-day delivery. Regular groceries fresh food adult beverages and personal care products are available. Delivery is $9.95 tip not required.

At the Groveland center a system developed by the UK-based e-commerce technology company Ocado Group fulfills the order using rectangular robots on 3-D grids “orchestrated by proprietary air-traffic control systems” according a news release. The Groveland facility also employs 400 humans.

“I would say Kroger is leading the industry with their innovations in the fulfillment center there’s no doubt about that just from a sheer dollar amount and time amount” said Mark Thompson of GroceryAnchored.com.

Orders are driven in semi-trucks to “spoke” facilities in Tampa and Jacksonville. (Orlando is close enough to be served by the Groveland center.) Tampa’s spoke is in an industrial park between U.S. 301 and the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway and employs about 180 people. There products are loaded into vans and delivered.

Grocery retailers had been exploring delivery options well before the pandemic. But enthusiasm for ordering groceries accelerated in a pandemic that had people leery of going into stores.

“We saw online grocery explode” Hawkins said.

Online shopping which used to constitute 1 to 3 three percent of sales went as high as 10 percent Hawkins said. When the world slowly reopened and more people started shopping live again e-commerce decreased some but is still “way above what it was pre-pandemic” he said.

And now that people are more comfortable with grocery delivery it’s expected to grow Hawkins said.

“The general consensus is that as an industry we’re probably going to see 20 to 25 percent of total sales to be online in the next four or five years” he said. The trend may lean toward cross-shopping or “omnichanneling” — customers getting some items like bulky bags of diapers or dog food delivered to their doors but going into stores to pick out their own produce.

Kroger may be banking on that as well — as Florida visitors who are comfortable with their name from back home.

While Kroger is “certainly investing that is much much less than what it would cost them to go in and build six or eight or ten brand new stores” Hawkins said.

Publix could not be reached for comment for this story.

““It’s really going to be interesting to watch how this plays out down there” Hawkins said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhzdG9kYXkudXMvc3ViamVjdC1tYXR0ZXItYXJlYXMvY291bnRlcnRlcnJvcmlzbS9rcm9nZXItc2hvb3Rlci1zZW50ZW5jZWQtdG8tbGlmZS1pbi1wcmlzb24tZm9yLWhhdGUtY3JpbWUtbXVyZGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hstoday Kroger Shooter Sentenced to Life in Prison for Hate Crime Murders - HS Today,"A Kentucky man was sentenced in federal court to life in prison without parole in connection with his racially motivated murder of two Black patrons at a Kroger grocery store and his attempted murder of a third in Jeffersontown Kentucky.

Gregory A. Bush 53 of Louisville Kentucky previously pleaded guilty-but-mentally-ill to state charges for murder attempted murder and wanton endangerment arising out of the shooting and was sentenced to a life term in state prison.

During his federal plea hearing Bush admitted that on Oct. 24 2018 he drove to a Kroger grocery store in Jeffersontown armed with a Smith & Wesson model 411 .40-caliber pistol. In the store Bush followed a Black man who was shopping with his grandson for the length of an aisle before pulling the gun from his waistband and shooting the victim in the back of the head. Bush then shot the victim several more times in the torso killing him. Bush had no prior relationship with the victim and chose to shoot him because of the victim’s race. Bush then re-holstered his gun and calmly walked out of the store.

In the parking lot Bush walked up to a Black woman and shot her several times in the head and body killing her. Bush had no prior relationship with this victim and chose to shoot her because of her race.

Seconds later Bush encountered a Black man who was in lawful possession of a handgun. The third victim asked Bush what was going on and Bush without responding began walking toward him with the gun drawn. The third victim fired at Bush and Bush returned fire. After about a minute Bush stopped shooting and walked away. Bush had no prior relationship with the third victim and chose to shoot at him because of his race. Bush next encountered a white man who was legally armed with a firearm. Bush told him “Don’t shoot me [and] I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites.”

“The defendant is being held accountable for his vicious racially motivated attack on three Black individuals who were targeted because of the color of their skin resulting in the untimely death of two of his victims and irreparable harm to the third” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Racially motivated acts of violence must not be tolerated in our country today. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will continue to work with our federal state and local partners to ensure that individuals who commit bias-motivated crimes are brought to justice for their actions.”

“Life in prison is appropriate in light of the brutal acts committed by the defendant against our fellow citizens” said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael A. Bennett of the Western District of Kentucky. “The initial law enforcement response and investigation collaboration by federal and state prosecutors and the sentence imposed serve notice to all that race-based violence will be met with swift and exacting justice.”

“Today Mr. Bush was held responsible for his vile conduct” said Special Agent in Charge Robert Brown of the FBI Louisville Field Office. “We are a diverse city and country bound together by shared values and beliefs. We are also a nation of laws. When those like Mr. Bush betray our shared values and violate our laws the FBI and its Department of Justice partners will be ready to hold them accountable. This is just one example of how hate and violence will not be tolerated and have no place in our community.”

“This was a heinous crime where innocent victims were gunned down for no other reason than the color of their skin” said Special Agent in Charge R. Shawn Morrow of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Louisville Division. “The ATF Louisville Division worked tirelessly alongside our law enforcement partners to seek justice for the victims their families and the community at large impacted by this hate crime. Today’s life sentence in prison demonstrates law enforcement’s stance against race-based violence and our commitment to justice.”

This case was investigated by the FBI Louisville Office the ATF Louisville Field Division and the Jeffersontown Police Department and was prosecuted by Special Litigation Counsel Christopher J. Perras of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Gregory of the Western District of Kentucky.

Both ideas fit The Hemet Grocery Outlet in the mini-mall at San Jacinto Street and Florida Avenue on the Eastside of Hemet.

The Grocery Outlet in Hemet has been there for as far back as I can remember. The company was established in 1946 and today claims 300 thriving stores. They stand up against Ralph’s Kroger or Safeway any day of the week. I doubt a lot of people know anything about their origins or products. Their patrons sure know about the quality of their product.

I was in the local store last week when one of the cashiers told me it would be the last day of the current owners.

Why I asked. It seems that the current owners Darryl and Barbara Salkele are retiring. Did that mean the store was shutting down? No and here’s why.

Grocery outlets are not individually owned. It is a partnership company. Folks who would like to operate a food business can apply and join up with the Grocery Outlet Company by taking over an existing store or perhaps open one where there is a need.

Hemet for instance recently opened a new store at the busiest corner in Hemet an area that is growing with great speed – Florida Avenue at Sanderson on the west side.

I arranged an interview with the new owners curious to know why we would have two stores in Hemet and what made them attractive to the community. Chad and Leslie Trask the new husband and wife management team were anxious to tell me all about themselves the store and the company.

They have been with Grocery Outlet for only 3 years. Why I asked did you choose Hemet? Chad has some relatives here but that was not his reason. He and his wife were located in Camarillo (Ventura County) prior to relocating in Hemet.

If you buy for a big name company whether it be Levi Straus or Kroger Grocery Company you pay for all that expensive advertising. That can become quite expensive in a year’s time. That’s not the way it is with Grocery Outlet. Chad explains.

“We are 40 to 70 percent off of standard prices offering premium gourmet items from Europe and around the world.”

Come to find out it is no secret. “There is no middle man. We buy directly from the source. For instance if a company wants to introduce a new product they will start with a company like us to see how the public responds and accepts the product before they move into the more conventional markets. We are not stocked with insurance company buyouts of fire sales—nothing like that. Sometimes we get overruns when too much of the product is brought to the market and is not being sold in certain markets. If a company buys like 1200 cases of green beans – and they are not moving fast enough elsewhere we can buy them at a discount and they are not stuck with the overload. The prices are drastically reduced; we buy and pass the savings on to our customers. That’s a win-win situation.”

The company was originally started by the Read family in 1946 and is now a third-generation in the business.

How do they maintain the business with such large discounts?

According to the company history the idea took off like a prairie fire and has yet to be contained. Jim Read took advantage as the stores spread across the country with 300 stores active now with more to come. Today they boast 1.5 million customers per week which makes Grocery Outlet the nation’s largest extreme value retailer.

How did they do it?

“With the help of brilliant buyers who shop the world traveling thousands of miles each year to find the most thrilling deals on brand name groceries. Whether it is through packaging changes surplus inventory or product overruns our buyers source it all – everything from fresh meat and produce to our natural and organic NOSH item to the WOW deal we can hardly believe ourselves.”

Their public relations office says Of course we wouldn’t be anywhere without the hundreds of local families who own and operate their own Grocery Outlet stores allowing us to deliver superior customer service personalized to each of the local communities we serve.”

Chad explains the situation in Hemet. “It is a great community. Everyone has been extremely kind in welcoming us into the community.”

Do they plan any changes in the store?

“Anything to facilitate a good shopping experience from the moment a customer enters the front door until they leave. We deliver a variety of gourmet foods cleanliness and customer accommodations. All produce is fresh as are our bakery and meat products – at less cost than places like Trader Joe’s and other whole food outlets.”

Will they have a grand opening?

“You bet. Probably sometime during the first week of July. Nothing set in concrete today. Also as to community personal involvement. We will have an Independence from Hunger program underway starting in late June where we team up with local non-profits. For a donation of $5 we will provide the customer a coupon for $5 on any purchase so it really is costing them nothing. We donate that $5 to a community partner – right now we are partnered with Valley Community Pantry.

“Our intent is to connect with the community more and more as they get to know us and we learn of their needs.” The new owners admit that it will take some time to be recognized and known here in the San Jacinto Valley; they have already been contributing toward organizations coping with the vast homelessness problem here. Here’s something new – to me at least – when asked how they will deal with the fragrant shoplifting Chad shrugged his sounders. “If we catch them we with treat them with respect and invite them not to return.”

By the way they are hiring. Just sayin’ [email protected].

What You Need To Know The company 80 Acres Farms has the ability to control and change the environment of each of the rooms where produce is growing



The farm doesn't see itself as competition with other conventional farms but instead aims to help feed a growing population



Its produce is now being sold in Kroger locations in Ohio

The company 80 Acres Farms in Hamilton 20 miles north of Cincinnati is one of just a handful of “vertical farms” in the world.

Farm Manager Noah Zelkind was working on Wall Street before making the switch to 80 Acres which houses 20 different growing rooms.

“We have 10 levels stacked on top of each other 10 rows long and 10 tables inside of each row” said Zelkind.

The company is able to control and change the environment of each of the rooms where produce is growing. It’s technology that’s years in the making.

“We went through and tried to study nature and replicate everything that’s important about it and really make sure we’re giving the plant exactly what it needs but in the most efficient way possible” said Zelkind.

It's a method Zelkind said gives the company ultimate control.

""This really is the next generation of farming"" he said. ""We have a completely different level over the control of the entire process of growing than anything anyone has done before.”

“You're going to get the same healthy fresh lettuce whether you're in the middle of winter and it's snowing outside or you’re in the middle of the summer” he said.

But he said the company is not trying to compete with conventional farmers.

""We don’t see ourselves competing with farmers at all” said Zelkind. “If you look we’re supposed to have 10 billion people in the world in the next 20 to 30 years and in order to feed the population we’re going to need 70% more arable land.”

The farm's produce is now available in Kroger stores across the state."

While the Army does not announce the competitors the field naturally includes some of the largest and most well known weapons developers. One team is comprised of an interesting industry conglomerate looking to synergize the best in German armored vehicle engineering

with world-leading U.S. combat vehicle expertise and production capacity. American Rheinmetall Defense is the U.S. extension of Germany’s Rheinmetall defense a well known combat vehicle leader responsible for contributing to the Leopard tank and Puma Infantry

Fighting Vehicle. Led by Rheinmetall the “Lynx” team is building a distinct U.S. “variant” intended to align specifically with U.S. Army requirements. While based upon Rheinmetall expertise the vehicle will incorporate major U.S. industry participation and emerge as an entirely new “U.S. variant” of the Lynx. The Rheinmetall team includes Raytheon Textron L3Harris and Allison Transmission.

Building on Rheinmetall’s manufacturing experience Team Lynx will manufacture the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) structure. It will assemble and test the U.S. Army’s OMFV at the Textron Systems manufacturing facility in Louisiana.

“Our land vehicle production facility in Louisiana where we have about 158000 square feet of total manufacturing space with an additional 30000 square feet of onsite warehousing has been used to manufacture over 10000 vehicles” Clark Lindner the director of Global Military Sales Strategy Textron Systems told the National Interest. “The facility includes end-to-end vehicle testing tailored to meet program requirements.”

Textron Systems is known for producing the operational Armored Security Vehicle for the U.S. Army. Its developers say they are also drawing heavily upon their experience in engineering and manufacturing unmanned aerial systems such as the Shadow® for the U.S. Army and more recently their participation in the RCV Medium program. Naturally the RCV Medium program is heavily focused upon autonomy and manned-unmanned coordination something likely to figure prominently in the developmental process.

Allison Transmission which has more than three million square feet of manufacturing facilities in the United States manufactures transmissions for the Army’s Abrams tank Mobile Protected Firepower vehicle Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The company has been manufacturing electric hybrid propulsion systems for commercial markets since 2003.

“We have a large presence in Indiana and the partnership with Team Lynx represents a new product development opportunity that takes advantage of Allison’s considerable manufacturing capability and technical expertise” Dane Rodgers the director of New Product Development Allison Transmission told the National Interest.

The Lynx will be equipped with Allison’s Next-Generation Electrified Transmission to provide the benefits of reduced detection by the enemy and increased soldier survivability.

“We are not only anticipating new product development opportunities but we’re talking about a transformation of a workforce that becomes far more digital and allows for faster cycles Integrating new capabilities onto the vehicle so they can stay competitive against threats” Rodgers added.

The Lynx team has emphasized the need to engineer a vehicle suited for the immediate need of the warfighter and also to optimize the vehicle’s design configuration sensing weapons performance and computing technologies to be ready to respond to future threats. The concept all participants say is to engineer a vehicle that is ready and easily adaptable for necessary growth with the knowledge that major power adversaries will be moving quickly to try to outpace the United States and Lynx must be able to keep up developers say.

In carrying out this developmental work Rheinmetall developers say that they will naturally draw upon and evolve their substantial experience in building armored combat vehicles such as tanks and infantry carriers. Mike Milner the director of business development and strategy for American Rheinmetall Vehicles said. “The U.S. Lynx will draw upon some of the most recent innovations and combat vehicle developments in Europe and combine that experience with considerable U.S. expertise.”

There are many facets plans and technical nuances to the Lynx team’s industrial approach including U.S. production and technology development. The project will entail the introduction of a vast number of new U.S. engineering science and manufacturing jobs as well as a decided developmental emphasis upon bringing new opportunities in modeling simulation and digital engineering.

Rheinmetall is also looking at other U.S. production expansion opportunities as part of the OMFV program. “As we continue throughout the program and different contracts are awarded this does allow us the opportunity to expand the supply base into other areas and additional locations within the U.S. very similar to what we have successfully implemented in Australia and Hungary” Milner said.

Overall the large team of industry players seeks to engineer a vehicle in alignment with Army requirements expand into new modernized U.S.- based manufacturing facilities to create new jobs and build a vehicle of unique value to the Army. An extraordinary effort is likely needed given that the OMFV is drawing a large number of industry competitors.

The ultrasonics business that originated in Jim Bullen’s garage in 1971 is now an “ultrasonic machining powerhouse” and globally recognized leader in the production of high-quality components used in semiconductors MEMS transportation defense & aerospace medical & life sciences industries. Half a century later Bullen Ultrasonics remains a privately held company owned by Jim’s son-in-law Steve Brown and daughter Vicki Brown and their family.

“I know that Jim would be proud to see the company doing what it’s doing today staying true to our values and committed to excellence in every way” Brown said. “Because we’ve remained committed to our family values Bullen has been able to accomplish so much more than technical output over the last 50 years. The beauty of a family business means that we have the freedom to push the boundaries and innovate uniquely. We’ve built things no one else has built; we’ve reached markets others hadn’t touched and created value for our customers in unique and innovative ways.”

Fifty years ago Bullen Ultrasonics began as a small group of engineers that repaired old ultrasonic machines and sold them globally to in-need countries like India. In the early 1990s led at the time by Steve Brown and Mary Bullen the business started working alongside IBM and Howmet Aerospace and took on a newfound trajectory.

Around that same time Bullen’s engineers began working with Lam Research (LRCX) in California. What started as a small job with Lam quickly turned into a more significant project and Bullen acquired even more customers through a network of semiconductor manufacturers looking for similar ultrasonic solutions.

This series of events propelled Bullen to dive deep into the silicon production world which ultimately led to the company’s differentiation in the ultrasonics space. The Bullen team decided to alter its supply chain by growing its own silicon crystal in 1997. Despite its small size and humble roots Bullen was the only crystal grower in the world growing wafer-quality silicon for non-wafers at the time. By 2006 they had 13 crystal growers. They eventually sold these silicon growing and processing assets to Lam Research now known as Silfex. It continues to experience growth at its Eaton and Springfield Ohio facilities.

Today Tim Beatty serves as the company’s president proudly preserving the DNA of the company. “While I embrace the opportunity to carry on the legacy of the Bullen family as the company’s president I also recognize that everything that’s happened in these last 50 years can be traced back to our employees” said Beatty. “We have incredibly talented people working for us. Everywhere I turn our employees strive to make a difference for our customers in their homes and within their communities. This positive culture I believe is created by people and fostered by leadership.”

Beatty and the rest of the Bullen Ultrasonics team believe that their work extends beyond just the technology and day-to-day production. Bullen has gained a reputation of service both locally and globally over its 50 years in business and was most recently awarded Dayton Business Journal’s 2020 Business of the Year. It contributes 10 percent of its profits to global charitable organizations in Cambodia Mumbai and the Philippians. It continues to serve those in Preble County as a longstanding affiliate of the Preble County Development Partnership and Home is the Foundation.

“We want our employees to know they are making a difference when they come to work every day. We give a portion of our profit back to our employees and people in need worldwide. This has been a part of our DNA ever since the beginning and that’s something that will define us for years to come” adds Beatty.

Bullen continues to seek opportunities to create value for its customers by improving operational excellence in everything from engineering to quality assurance. It has created a system built around supporting its employees to focus on delivering value and quality services to its customers. The company plans to diversify its technology to open new markets while allowing them to better serve existing customers in the semiconductors aerospace and MEMS industries. Bullen continues its growth and is currently hiring for various positions which can be viewed at bullentech.com/careers.

Bullen leadership is inviting any current and former team members as well as their families to a 50th-anniversary celebration which will be held on Saturday Sept. 11 at the Bullen facility. Find out more about Bullen’s celebration and history at bullenultrasonics.com/anniversary.

Metallica are celebrating 40 years since Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in LA paper The Recycler saying ""Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam."" James Hetfield answered and became the second founding member of a band that has sold over 125million records. Their relationship offstage is characterised by the clash of the pair's extremely contrasting personalities and in 2017 Hetfield said: ""Lars and I got through some really horrible times. A lot of bands don’t."" However onstage Hetfield says something special always happens: ""All four of us are OK musicians but when we get together there is a fifth element of Metallica. It’s a magic key.""

In a classic interview Hetfield also talked about the legendary guitarists who have inspired him. He said: ""My rhythm gods are (Black Sabbath's) Tony Iommi (The Scorpions') Rudolf Schenker and (AC/DC's) Malcolm Young – guys who just keep it steady. ""The Misfits too and even the Ramones with their simplicity. It’s all downpicking!

Metallica: James Hetfield with guitar hero Tony Iommi

Hetfield went on to explain how his ""percussive"" guitar style and the extraordinary way he and Ulrich play off each other are all rooted in his own drumming skills. He told Total Guitar: ""I love playing drums so a lot of the rhythms come from beats that I have in my head... With Metallica Lars is always playing a little against the riff. It’s almost like I’m the drummer and he does counter beats to the rhythm. ""Onstage the only thing Lars has got in his ear monitors is my guitar and some vocals. So I’m kinda keeping the tempo of the song and he’s able to get a little crazier on the drums.” DON'T MISS

Here's What You Need To Know: The plane will be a drone and will also be able to launch attacks in addition to spying.

Long a source of speculation throughout the defense commentary sphere the SR-72 “Son of Blackbird” next-generation drone has been mired in mystery for over a decade.

The SR-72 is the planned successor to the SR-71 the iconic Cold War-era reconnaissance plane that shattered world records for the fastest manned airbreathing jet engine aircraft. Initial reports emerged as early as 2007 but it was only in 2013 that Lockheed Martin official Robert Weiss publicly confirmed that the company had made significant headway into developing a hypersonic plane that he called the “SR-72.” Lockheed Martin proceeded to release widely shared concept art for the project—the SR-72 appears to be an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) boasting a groundbreaking purported top speed approaching Mach 6.

In yet another difference with its manned SR-71 predecessor the SR-72 is a reconnaissance and surveillance craft that doubles as a strike weapon. The UAV will reportedly support hypersonic armaments such as Lockheed Martin’s High Speed Strike Weapon (HSSW) making the SR-72 a potent tool for delivering precision strikes against agile or otherwise hard-to-reach targets.

Following a four-year information drought Lockheed Martin dropped the announcement that the SR-72 will enter development by the early 2020s. Lockheed rationalized this prolonged interlude on the grounds that the technologies required to produce a plane that fast were not yet sufficiently mature: “Without the digital transformation the aircraft you see there could not have been made. In fact five years ago it could not have been made” said Lockheed Vice President Jack O’Banion referencing an artist’s SR-72 rendering presented at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ annual SciTech Forum in 2018. O’Banion’s statement seemed to imply that an SR-72 prototype or concept demonstrator already exists prompting fevered interest from defense observers. Lockheed refused to clarify his comments adding to what increasingly seems to be the company’s purposely cultivated aura of mystery surrounding the SR-72.

“We couldn’t have made the engine itself—it would have melted down into slag if we had tried to produce it five years ago” O’Banion added. “But now we can digitally print that engine with an incredibly sophisticated cooling system integral into the material of the engine itself and have that engine survive for multiple firings for routine operation.”

Lockheed Martin maintains that an SR-72 concept demonstrator will take to the skies by the mid-2020s possibly entering service as soon as 2030. However unanswered questions—and serious design challenges—linger. For one it remains unclear exactly how the SR-72 is piloted; will it be operated in real-time by remote pilots or will it boast a sufficiently robust artificial intelligence (AI) suite to run missions with either no or minimal manual control? Further still scramjet engine development is notoriously costly and complex. It will likely take many years and colossal investment for a possible SR-72 prototype to be realized as a serially-produced model.

It remains to be seen whether or not Lockheed manages to secure the considerable funding required to mass-produce a product as complex and cutting-edge as the SR-72 especially when it’s unclear what specific pressing operational purpose it is supposed to fill. From sophisticated satellite surveillance methods to the next-generation B-21 bomber and Northrop Grumman’s new RQ-180 stealth drone the U.S. military seems to have somewhat covered many of the individual capabilities being offered by the SR-72.

Gus Vratsinas of Little Rock chairman of the Arkansas Economic Development Foundation said Friday that the private nonprofit foundation's board on Thursday night approved a $54810 bonus for Preston recommended by Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

Preston performed well during the coronavirus pandemic in the past year Vratsinas said.

He said the Air Force's selection of Ebbing Air National Guard Base as the preferred facility to set up a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II training center for Foreign Military Sales participants and the new home for a Singaporean General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon training unit ""is huge.""

""Just that in itself I would say it was a great year.""

Vratsinas said he expects Preston will receive his check from the foundation early this week.

Asked about that bonus Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey R-Texarkana said Friday ""Personally I don't have any heartburn over it.""

""I'm OK with the bonus since it is not taxpayer funded and also as long as no special favors are being given due to this arrangement"" he said.

Vratsinas said the bonus is part of the compensation package agreed to in 2015 when Preston was hired. Hutchinson evaluates Preston's performance each year.

""Tell him that's it no different than the Razorback Foundation paying the football coaches"" Vratsinas said.

Preston also serves as secretary of the state Department of Commerce created in July 2019 under Hutchinson's consolidation of 42 executive branch state agencies into 15 departments.

The department includes the Economic Development Commission Development Finance Authority Bank Department Division of Workforce Services Insurance Department Securities Department Division of Aeronautics Wine Producers Council Waterways Commission and Office of Skills Development.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

In a letter dated June 11 to Vratsinas Hutchinson said he conducted Preston's annual performance evaluation and recommended awarding the ""full bonus"" of $54810.

Preston is eligible for a performance bonus of up to 30% of his total salary under a memorandum of understanding he has with the foundation. His salary for fiscal 2021 which ends Wednesday is $182700. The state pays $155295.09 of that according to the Arkansas Transparency website. The foundation pays the rest according to the governor's office.

Preston will receive a 2.8% increase in his state-paid salary to $159954 in fiscal 2022 said Shealyn Sowers a spokeswoman for the governor.

Hutchinson said in his letter to Vratsinas that the commission's accomplishments under Preston's leadership during a particularly difficult year included:

• Managing programs that disbursed $9 million in Quick Action Bridge Loans to 483 businesses resulting in the retention of 6610 jobs.

• $10 million in Community Development Block Grants to 27 rural hospitals resulting in the retention of 7800 jobs.

• $130 million in Ready for Business grants to 11409 businesses affecting 225000 employees.

• $7.8 million provided to developmental disability providers for paycheck protection resulting in the retention of 4000 employees.

""In a year when unemployment rates skyrocketed across the nation Arkansas reached an unemployment rate of 10.2% before dropping back down to 4.4% a full percentage point below the national average"" the governor wrote.

The commission also distributed $118 million in grants for broadband deployment resulting in 130000 Arkansans gaining access to broadband and spent $2 million in grant funding for the Arkansas Accelerator Program in the past year Hutchinson said.

Hutchinson said the commission in the past year signed 47 incentive agreements that yielded 2242 new jobs with a proposed average hourly wage of $20.87 and a capital investment of $830.9 million. These competitive projects represent new payroll of $97.3 million and yield a positive cost-benefit analysis on the tax dollars spent he said.

""Since 2015 the total number of competitive projects won is now over 524 bringing in more than $10.5 billion in new capital investment and more than 25000 new jobs.""

Hutchinson wrote ""I would also be remiss if I did not recognize Secretary Preston's extraordinary leadership in securing the new foreign F-35 and F-16 training mission at Ebbing Air National Guard base in Fort Smith (Ebbing).

""This was a highly competitive project that was bolstered by a commitment to extend the base's runway by more than 1000 feet"" he wrote.

""This major announcement will result in hundreds of jobs and more than $800 [million] in annual economic impact to the region"" the governor said. ""Secretary Preston and AEDC's Global Business and Military Affairs Team were instrumental in identifying incentives that ultimately led to Ebbing's selection.""

As with last year Hutchinson said he has worked closely with Preston.

""Throughout Secretary Preston's tenure I have been impressed with his professionalism determination focus energy and character"" wrote in his letter to Vratsinas. ""He has poured himself into Arkansas and has gone the extra mile every day to assure that our state is an economic engine for growth and increased opportunities for Arkansans.""

Before Preston started working at the development commission he spent 6½ years as vice president of government relations for Enterprise Florida the state's primary economic development organization.

LEGISLATIVE CRITICS

In April of this year Sen. Trent Garner R-El Dorado told senators that he had lost confidence in Preston and Preston should be replaced.

Garner urged senators to vote against the Department of Commerce's appropriation which required a three-fourths vote for approval. In its fourth try the Senate approved the appropriation. The House approved that appropriation on its second vote.

At that time Hutchinson said ""Mike Preston is one of the most successful economic developers in the nation and Arkansas is fortunate to have him at the helm of the Department of Commerce.""

Garner's call to replace Preston was made after Garner's bill that would have barred the development commission from having an office in China failed to clear a House committee.

In the 2020 fiscal session the Joint Budget Committee rejected Garner's proposal to close the office after Preston said the department already planned to trim the office's budget from $285000 to $125000 a year starting in July 2020 and employ an American citizen as a liaison in China.

In February Rep. Fran Cavenaugh R-Walnut Ridge attempted to stop the foundation from paying additional salary to Preston.

She failed to get a motion in a House committee for her bill.

Cavenaugh said her bill would bar a Cabinet-level secretary from taking funding for a salary from an outside source for performing the secretary's duties.

Special language in the Commerce Department appropriation allows the foundation to use private funds to provide extra pay to the development commission's executive director while special language in the Department of Education appropriation bars the education commissioner from accepting any additional salary from any other source ""so there is a double standard"" she said.

State officials have said that numerous states particularly in the South maintain employment contracts with state employment directors that include additional private funds in the director's overall salary.

In the 2005 session the Legislature gave then-Education Commissioner Ken James a raise in his state pay from $122295 to $204620 and banned him from receiving outside income. When James was hired in 2004 a private group the State Board of Higher Education Foundation agreed to provide him $81000 a year. James also made $122295 from the state so his total salary amounted to $203295.

The salary for the state's current education commissioner and education secretary Johnny Key is $239361.20 according to the Arkansas Transparency website.

According to that website the highest-paid executive branch department leader is Human Services Secretary Cindy Gillespie whose salary is $287042.06. Health Secretary Jose Romero's salary is $273779.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmFtYmxlLm5sL21pbGl0YXJ5LW5ld3MvZnkyMS1jaC01M2sta2luZy1zdGFsbGlvbi1vcmRlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FY21 CH-53K King Stallion order,"FY21 CH-53K King Stallion order

On 25 June 2021 Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Co. Stratford (CT) was awarded a USD 7359 modification contract that increases the scope for nine Lot 5 low-rate initial production (LRIP) CH-53K King Stallions with associated aircraft programmatic and logistical support.

The nine King Stallions destined for the US Marine Corps are expected to be completed in December 2024 and are part of the US Navy Fiscal Year 2021 aircraft procurement funds.

The contract also provides a sentence in which Sikorsky must bring down the King Stallion cost of each heavy-lift helicopter. The manufacturer is gaining more experience building them so they will manage that.

On top of that the US Navy is taking an option for a Lot 6 contract (must be executed not later than February 2022) that includes another nine helicopters. The Lot 5 King Stallions will cost some USD 976 million apiece (helicopter without engine or other government-furnished equipment) the Lot 6 will bring that amount down to USD 947 million. NAVAIR reported that the Lot 4 helicopters were USD 1021 million apiece. Earlier Lots saw prices of USD 148 million per CH-53K!

According to Air Force Magazine the State Department has approved the potential sale of F-16 Fighting Falcon jets AGM-84 Harpoon missiles AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles along with other equipment to the Philippines the Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced.

All told the sales would total up to nearly US$2.9 billion with the majority of those funds going to the sale of a dozen F-16 aircraft and accompanying weaponry and equipment. Two of the jets will be two-seat F-16Ds and 10 will be F-16Cs the report said.

Other weapons potentially being sold to the Philippines include a dozen Harpoon missiles and 24 Sidewinder missiles.

Lockheed Martin will be the primary contractor for the jets while Boeing will handle the Harpoon missiles and Raytheon will handle the Sidewinders the report said.

Eric Sayers a visiting fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute said it appeared to be “a proactive effort by Washington to ensure the United States remains the security partner of choice for Manila.”

The US Department of Defense (DoD) announced that the State Department has cleared the sale on June 24 2021 Aerotime online reported.

According to the press release the purchase will enable “the Philippines to deploy fighter aircraft with precision munitions in support of counterterrorism operations in the southern Philippines increasing effectiveness and minimizing collateral damage.

“The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.”

The Philippine government is locked in a bitter war with Maoist rebels which has been running since the 1960s and is one of the longest still-ongoing conflicts in the world.

The first F-16s are expected to roll off the production line in 2022 and production is expected to increase after the first year. The aircraft will be delivered to multiple foreign military partners including Bahrain Slovakia Bulgaria Taiwan and others many of whom have expressed interest beyond the first deliveries.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte this week announced his intention to form his own “death squad” that will hunt Maoist rebels and their sympathizers Arab News reported.

The announcement came during his visit to an army camp in the town of Carmen in Bohol province.

Duterte said government troops remain vulnerable to attacks from the communist New People’s Army (NPA) hit squad known as the Special Partisan Unit (SPARU) or “sparrow.”

He said he would be satisfied if each member of his proposed death squad would identify one or two NPA rebels for liquidation.

“I’m trying to make peace with them. They refuse then they kill our policemen and soldiers” he added.

“What I lack is a sparrow unit… so I’ll create a sparrow — Duterte Death Squad – against the sparrow. There’s no problem because they’re our enemy. Why should we hide?”

The country has also found itself clashing with Chinese interests over the South China Sea.

Since March 2021 Philippine Air Force has been sending its FA-50 light fighter jets to monitor Chinese vessels that have been building military installations in what Philippines claims as its exclusive economic zone.

The sale of F-16s if concluded would almost double the combat potential of the Philippine Air Force whose main combat aircraft is the South Korean KAI T-50 Golden Eagle advanced trainer employed as a fighter jet.

The country also possesses several North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco and Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano light attack aircraft.

In December 2020 Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Gen. Gilbert Gapay told reporters in a press briefing that he planned to add a multirole fighter to the fleet before Duterte’s term ended in 2022 according to the Inquirer.

The F-16 will be the Philippines’ first multirole fighter Air Force Magazine reported.

Lockheed Martin has a backlog of more than 100 F-16s for foreign military sales to five countries including Bahrain Bulgaria Slovakia and Taiwan and a fifth Lockheed Martin has declined to name potentially putting the aircraft’s sunset years into the 2070s or even later.

To support the growing demand for new F-16from partner nations the US Air Force teamed with Lockheed Martin to open a new production line to build the F-16 Block 70/72 fighter aircraft at the company’s facility in Greenville South Carolina.

“F-16s are operational across the globe and are a key capability fortifying the security of our international partners” said Brig. Gen. Dale White Fighters and Advanced Aircraft program executive officer.

“Every F-16 we equip our foreign partners with improves their ability to defend their interests and support our mutual security interests. The caliber and talent of our foreign military sales program office teams is top-notch and their impact is felt globally.

“The F-16 is an enduring highly capable compact fighter that will have a large role in many partner nations’ security for years to come.”

Sean is one-half of one of the franchise’s few success stories. He married his wife who he met on the show Catherine Giudici and they’re parents to their three adorable kids Samuel Isaiah and Mia. But according to Catherine Sean is refusing to watch Katie Thurston’s season of The Bachelorette because of the Chris Harrison controversy.

“I’m watching it. My husband is kind of boycotting it because of the Chris Harrison stuff” Catherine recently told Us Weekly in an interview adding “but I’m watching it this season to support the girls.”

Huh. That’s an interesting stance to take tbh. It always baffles me when people seem to be more upset about Chris leaving the show after almost 20 years (with a reported $9 million payout I may add!) than him straight-up making excuses for racist behavior. But hey we all have different priorities I guess!

Even though Catherine is watching the show she told Us Weekly in May that she also wants Chris to return. “I want to see him come back” she said. “I think he will. I hope he does because I know so many Bachelor fans out there rely on him to be the voice of The Bachelor.”

Catherine added “Chris is a good base that everyone could kind of rely on.” Again interesting stance to take.

Upon Chris’s exit ABC released a statement including “As we continue the dialogue around achieving greater equity and inclusion within The Bachelor franchise we are dedicated to improving the BIPOC representation of our crew including among the executive producer ranks. These are important steps in effecting fundamental change so that our franchise is a celebration of love that is reflective of our world.”

Chris was obvs a staple of the franchise but it can still go on (and be amazing) without him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvc2Vhbi1sb3dlLWJveWNvdHRpbmctYmFjaGVsb3ItZnJhbmNoaXNlLWNocmlzLWhhcnJpc29uLWV4aXTSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3NlYW4tbG93ZS1ib3ljb3R0aW5nLWJhY2hlbG9yLWZyYW5jaGlzZS1jaHJpcy1oYXJyaXNvbi1leGl0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sean Lowe boycotting ‘Bachelor’ franchise after Chris Harrison exit,"Maybe Sean Lowe needs to take a moment and say his goodbyes.

The former ""Bachelor"" has stopped watching the franchise following Chris Harrison’s exit according to his wife Catherine Giudice. The 35-year-old revealed the news at an event on Wednesday according to Us Weekly.

""I’m watching it. My husband is kind of boycotting it because of the Chris Harrison stuff"" Giudice said adding ""but I’m watching it this season to support the girls.

QUEEN ELIZABETH SISTER PRINCESS MARGARET STRUGGLED AS A ‘SPARE' PRINCESS DIANA'S BIOGRAPHER CLAIMS

Though the mother of three — Samuel 4 Isaiah 3 and daughter Mia 18 months — didn’t elaborate further on her husband’s decision to sit out season 17 of ""The Bachelorette"" this isn’t the first time she’s spoken out publicly about Harrison’s stepping back from his hosting duties.

In early May Giudice said she wanted to see Harrison return to the franchise at some point.

""I want to see him come back. I think he will"" she told Us Weekly in an interview. ""I hope he does because I know so many ‘Bachelor’ fans out there rely on him to be the voice of ‘The Bachelor.'""

Lowe’s support comes after it was reported Harrison received a $9 million payout to leave the series despite the controversy behind his departure.

In February Harrison issued an apology for ""perpetuating racism"" by suggesting that disgraced contestant Rachael Kirkconnell deserved ""grace"" and ""understanding"" after she was accused of interacting with racially insensitive material on social media as well as being photographed at a plantation themed college party in 2018.

Several ""Bachelor"" alums spoke out about Harrison’s misguided comments including Rachel Lindsay — who threatened to leave the franchise once she was no longer ""contractually obligated"" to be associated.

Two days after his first apology Harrison released a statement saying he was taking a temporary leave from the franchise. In June it was confirmed that Harrison would in fact not be returning. Comedian David Spade was hired to take his place.

After Pearl gave birth to Daisy Gavin was made godfather and at the time it was believed that the model was the daughter of the fashion designer's ex-boyfriend Bronner Handwerger.

When Daisy was 14 she found out that neither her mother or Bronner shared her O-type blood which was when she asked for a paternity test to be taken.

Hall's 'Dexter' Globes Win To Cancer,"I never knew much about Bill Paxton other than he was an absolute gem as the bullying older brother Chet in Weird Science and obviously near-perfect in the should-be-iconic blockbuster Twister. Rob Lowe however was very dear friends with Paxton and so he is frequently mentioned in Rob Lowe’s podcast Literally. Given the way that Lowe frequently talks about Paxton who died of a stroke at the too-early age of 61 in 2017 I think he could best be described as a “colorful character.” I would also say in the way that Lowe affectionately caricatures him that Paxton was very Texan.

In this week’s episode of Literally with Rob Lowe Lowe spoke to Jimmy Kimmel but in the course of his conversation Lowe got off on a tangent while speaking about how “quotable” his friend Bill Paxton was. To wit Paxton’s last major role was Det. Frank Rourke — the Denzel Washington role — in the CBS television adaptation of Training Day. “Bill had never done a network TV show” Lowe said” and when Lowe asked him how it was going Paxton gave Lowe one of his memorable quotes. “Well yeah Rob we’re making widgets on this one. I wish the scripts were better.”

Lowe also spoke of a talk show appearance that Paxton once made on Jay Leno’s The Tonight Show around the time that Apollo 13 was released. “He was clearly playing to the Academy voters” Lowe said. “He couldn’t give a crap about getting the audience to come to the movie. It was purely he wanted those votes for that movie. He was like “God it’s Apollo 13. The technology that went into putting that rocket into space. I mean COME ON. It’s the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences” he said emphasizing “science” under the belief that it would get him more Oscar votes for a movie about space. “He thought that was the way in. There was science in the movie.”

Lowe also spoke about the 2010 Golden Globes and his “obsession” with the “box moments” when the nominees are all pictured in a box on a telecast as the reader is being read. “My two favorite ‘box moments'” Lowe said “were Burt [Reynolds] losing for Boogie Nights where everybody thought he was going to win he thought he was going to win and his face! If he had an actual thought balloon it could not have been more clear” and his face would have said “‘I knew these guys would f**k me.” That is his exact face although he lost to a very worthy nominee Robin Williams for his role in Good Will Hunting.

The other one however was “my dear departed friend Bill Paxton. When he was nominated for Big Love. Big Love was out and he was opposite a lot of great people including Dexter the serial killer show on Showtime and Michael C. Hall who is great. And Michael C. Hall had bravely battled and won a lymphoma battle. Remember that?”

“So the show is off the year come back and he’s sitting [in the audience] and they got the box on him and they go ‘And the winner is … Michael C. Hall.’ Bill turns to his wife and I can remember it because I’m a lip reader. Clear as day he goes ‘Aww. the cancer card.”

Lowe is not wrong. If you rewatch it it’s fairly obvious that is what Paxton is saying at the 48-second mark.

“It was right before social media is what it is today” Lowe said “Because today for sure [he’d have been called out] because you don’t get away with anything.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYmFjaGVsb3Itc2Vhbi1sb3dlLWNhdGhlcmluZS1ib3ljb3R0LWNocmlzLWhhcnJpc29uLWV4aXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bachelor: Sean Lowe Boycotting Show After Chris Harrison Exit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYmFjaGVsb3Itc2Vhbi1sb3dlLWNhdGhlcmluZS1ib3ljb3R0LWNocmlzLWhhcnJpc29uLWV4aXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and received the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment.

The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,"“With regards to the gift and the processing of it and so forth in terms of future processing we’ve already decided it’s in our best interest to put that on hold” Robinson said during the meeting.

The alleged windfall donation to FAMU came from Batterson Farms Corporation’s Gregory Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust and would’ve almost tripled the school’s endowment helping students and faculty for generations. But after the announcement was made — with major fanfare during a Saturday commencement ceremony — skepticism quickly quelled the celebration.

For one Batterson Farms Corporation appears to be a relatively small outfit based in Texas selling hydroponic hemp farm products leading some to question how its stocks could be worth millions. The doubts have been heightened by reports about Gerami’s past dealings including a $95 million donation to Coastal Carolina University in 2020 that was terminated by school officials only weeks after it was publicly announced.

FAMU foundation members raised these points during Thursday’s emergency meeting while venting frustrations about how school staff transacted a nine-figure donation without telling them or the board of trustees. Some board members claimed to have learned about the donation from the university’s press release or from friends after graduation. The board of trustees had already called a special meeting for next week to discuss the donation before Thursday’s shock announcement.

“How did we get this far without knowledge of the transaction or the donor?” asked Chekesha Kidd a foundation member who is co-founder and CEO of Kinumi a concierge service.

School leaders — including Robinson and Shawnta Friday-Stroud FAMU’s vice president for university advancement — said they were barred from discussing the gift publicly due to a non-disclosure agreement. They defended accepting the donation from Batterson Farms Corporation noting the potential upside should the company go public. Batterson Farms did not respond to a request for comment about the potential future value of its stock.

Still the shares could be worth “$500 million or it could be zero” Laurence A. Humphries a member of the foundation’s board noted at the meeting.

“Yes there is clearly risk and we are seeing that in everything that has shaken out” Friday-Stroud said during the meeting. “But at the time that was the decision.”

FAMU did not reach out to Coastal Carolina University as they vetted Gerami’s gift officials confirmed Thursday.

That failed donation was one of several red flags that should have been raised during the vetting of FAMU’s gift according to finance experts.

The gift would have been paid out over the next decade according to an agreement obtained through a records request Thursday by the Tallahassee Democrat. The agreement shows that Gerami “donated 14 million shares of stock of intrinsic value worth at least $239000000 and will donate an additional $61000000 over 10 years” — valuations that don’t match what the school announced only days ago.

The agreement though does not specifically name a company and it’s unclear where and how the stocks were valued.

“Where does this valuation come from?” Rebel Cole a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University said in an interview. “It raises more questions than it answers. If I were a dog my hackles would be up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Solid Previews Around $6M – Thursday Night Box Office,"EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios‘ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles."

FINDLAY Ohio — Habitat for Humanity of FIndlay and Hancock County held a special ceremony in Findlay on Saturday to honor the efforts of two local organizers.

They also celebrated the completion of their forty sixth and forty seventh homes when they handed over keys to some brand new homeowners.

The two homes were built at the same time and are the culmination of some seven hundred volunteers' hard work.

The event also served as an opportunity to honor Gary and Jane Heminger - organizers who have served with Habitat for Humanity for over a decade.

""We've been involved all along together in the fund-raising exercise and really trying to provide the leadership in the community to get involved” said Gary.



Before retiring in March of last year - Gary was the Chairman and CEO of Marathon Petroleum.

He and his wife used their resources and connections to help raise funds for multiple Habitat homes.



""When you see their mission and you see the need that we have here in the community it’s not a hard decision to decide to help make a lot of these dreams come true” said Jane.

The work the Hemingers and all the volunteers do have very real effects on the Findlay community.

Lori Campbell the new owner of one of the homes that was dedicated on Saturday says it's not just going to help her it's going to help her grandkids as well.

“Me and the grandkids have been living in a one bedroom for almost four years now” said Lori. “Falling apart been flooded little bit of everything. Mold. So this is much welcomed and much needed.""



At the ribbon cutting the Hemingers handed Lori Campbell the key to her new home.

They say providing for people like Lori is an unparalleled experience.



""To see the joy and the opportunity they're having - there are no words for it really” said Gary.



A tree in the backyard of one of the homes is dedicated to the continuing work of the Hemingers.

They helped the families cover it in soil; quite literally planting roots for them in their new forever homes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9jb21lLWNsZWFuLXBhcnQtNS13aHktZXZlcnlvbmVzLXRhbGtpbmctYWJvdXQtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWRpZXNlbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Come Clean Part 5 - Why Everyone's Talking About Renewable Diesel,,,,,,,

It’s a better-than-expected start on the path back to normalcy said the general manager of the city-owned hotel that largely serves the Baltimore Convention Center.

“Every week we’re becoming more optimistic in our outlook on the future” said Greg Brown the hotel’s general manager.

Baltimore’s travel and tourism industry is looking to regain its footing after being decimated by the health crisis. In the city and elsewhere lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings and travel wiped out the hospitality business leading to mass layoffs and loss of tourism-related revenue.

The Baltimore Convention Center hasn’t hosted events for more than a year instead serving as a COVID-19 field hospital and mass vaccination and testing center hurting downtown hotels that depend on group and business travelers. Laid off hospitality workers say most jobs have yet to return.

By most accounts leisure tourism is expected to recover more quickly than the meeting and conference business projected to rebound sometime next year at the earliest.

“The last 14-15 months months has been really devastating to our industry here in Baltimore city” Al Hutchinson CEO of Visit Baltimore told city council members during budget hearings earlier this month. “Obviously very little hotel tax revenue has been coming in. And small business hoteliers restaurateurs museums everyone has been really impacted by the pandemic of a lifetime.”

How Baltimore hotels weathered the pandemic

Baltimore hotels weathered the pandemic differently. Some like the Hilton closed during much of the crisis but have reopened. Others remain closed including The Holiday Inn Baltimore Inner Harbor which had been in receivership and shut its doors in November and Embassy Suites by Hilton at St. Paul Place which says it plans to reopen in September.

Last year’s cancellations and postponements cost the Hilton what otherwise would have been a strong year of group and meetings business. But the bulk of events were re-booked for future dates and planners have become more comfortable as vaccines rolled out and restrictions were lifted Brown said. The earliest of those events have been booked for the last three months of this year and into the first quarter of 2022. The Pratt Street hotel has returned to about 30% of pre-pandemic staffing.

“We see a strong return of business the group business in 2022” with some groups finding their first-choice rebooking dates already taken Brown said.

In the wake of lockdowns and global travel restrictions in March 2020 occupancy at the Hyatt Regency Baltimore plummeted from 90% to nearly nothing in a matter of days. The Inner Harbor hotel shut down before resuming limited operations in July 2020. Local leisure travel on weekends helped sustain the business said Ilemona Salifu Hyatt’s area director of sales marketing and events.

The Baltimore Convention Center hasn’t hosted events for more than a year. During the pandemic it served as a COVID-19 field hospital and mass vaccination and testing center.

As restrictions loosen hotel bookings are on the rebound

Now amid loosening restrictions Salifu said “occupancy levels are slowly on the rebound and the hotel is getting back to hosting more weddings social events and mid-size group meetings.”

“The pent-up demand for travel is immense” he added “and with the number of fully vaccinated people growing each day Hyatt is seeing strong demand for its hotels into summer and fall.”

Even group and business travel is returning earlier than expected Salifu said especially in the pharmaceutical information technology and banking and finance industries. New group business booked in the first quarter of this year for future dates is up 55% compared with bookings in the last quarter of 2020 for future dates he said.

Leisure travel appear to be on the mend. Over Memorial Day weekend Baltimore hotels topped 60% average occupancy resulting in the best weekly performance since COVID-19 hit Hutchinson said.

“It does show that there’s a lot of pent-up demand and leisure visitation is beginning to come back” he said. But “it’s definitely going to be a slow grind.”

He is encouraged that seven out of 10 Americans plan to take vacations this summer according to the U.S. Travel Association. To attract East Coast travelers Visit Baltimore created a 30-second TV spot showing scenes of the city that’s airing on Hulu and other streaming platforms in Washington Philadelphia New York City Richmond and Boston.

Baltimore will host its first major event since the start of the pandemic in July when 400 to 800 people come to town for the Destinations International Annual Convention. Attendees will use ballrooms in the Hilton and the convention center and are expected to generate about $800000 in economic impact.

Greg Brown general manager of Hilton Baltimore inside the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor. The hotel has welcomed back guests and even hosted about 20 meetings since reopening in April after a year-long closure. Brown says “We think it will be a pretty quick recovery.” In July visitors from two large conventions will stay at the hotel. June 17 2021.

Larger citywide conventions however remain a ways off. The first is scheduled for mid-October when the American Society for Reproductive Medicine is expected to fill area hotels and boost restaurants and attractions. Large conventions will once again be possible after the state closes the coronavirus vaccination and testing site at the convention center by Oct. 1.

The center’s use as a field hospital has added to the booking challenges. Even though the hospital is physically separated from the rest of the facility the presence of patients in the building has deterred some customers.

The convention center has not been given a definitive date for the hospital’s closing that could then be communicated to groups looking to book said Peggy Daidakis the center’s executive director.

The convention center is working with smaller group clients to be able to finalize space in meeting rooms this year as soon as it has a definitive closure date for the hospital Daidakis said. She said her staff has been making plans to prepare the building for re-opening almost since the day it shut down.

“We do have other customers we’re working with now to confirm that they’re still a go to use meeting rooms and ballrooms” she said. “When the customers come back we’ll be ready for them.”

The industry’s slow recovery has been especially difficult for its workers.

Vilma Licona a banquet server and bartender at the Hilton since 2008 who was laid off in March 2020 was only recently called back but only for about four days a month.

“All this time it’s been so hard” Licona said. “At this point we have no business.”

Licona 51 said she has been unable to send as much money as she normally would to help support her parents in her native Honduras. The Columbia resident also is worried about her unemployment benefits decreasing next month when Maryland is set to stop participating in pandemic-related unemployment programs.

When will business return to pre-pandemic levels?

Pre-pandemic levels of business won’t return until next year according to 46% of respondents in a winter survey by Meeting Professionals International. Another 29% expect a recovery to stretch into 2023. Yet that’s more optimistic than a U.S. Travel Association outlook that says it could take three more years to return to 2019 business levels.

“Now that the vaccine has rolled out people want to meet” said Melinda L. Burdette director of events for Meeting Professionals International. But “we all have to still get over our fear of gathering together because we’ve been shuttered for all of this time.”

To capture business as it rolls out hotels are stepping up health and safety protocols to ease people back into large meetings. They are working with meeting planners to tailor health protocols to specific groups’ needs and comfort levels. And they’re looking to new technology to add more options for virtual components to complement in-person meetings.

Hilton calls its new meetings and events program EventReady offering features such as sanitizing stations room set ups and meal services customized for physical distancing more space for attendee flow and contactless check in and check out.

Hyatt recently launched “Together by Hyatt” to train planners to design in-person or hybrid events and to offer artificial intelligence technology to enhance the remote experience.

And since February Marriott International has hosted more than 3000 meeting planners at Marriott hotels in cities around the country allowing them to step into a “hybrid meeting” during a 90-minute tour.

More than 500 planners attended tours at a Marriott hotel in Bethesda where the company is based for demonstrations such as how to set up on-site COVID testing and temperature screening areas how to keep general and break-out sessions socially distanced how to re-design food and beverage areas and how to best use technology for remote attendees.

Kathy Mouw Marriott’s vice president of global sales for the U.S. and Canada said Marriott launched the program because “we were getting the sense that customers were reluctant to travel or companies had policies preventing them from attending in-person meetings.

The hope was to allow people planning events for groups or corporations to see in person how hybrid and COVID-safe events can be put together and customized.

Mouw said the sessions are making a difference.

“We do believe these labs are influencing decisions… to return to in-person events sooner than we than expected” Mouw said. “We’ve seen a significant decrease in cancelations of meetings already booked.”

For the foreseeable future meeting planners will need to work with venues to “create a safe bubble” Burdette said coordinating vaccine mask wearing and COVID testing policies and becoming familiar with mandates in states that are candidates for hosting events.

“We’re stepping our toes in the water at this point from a meeting standpoint” she said. “We’ll have to figure out what is their comfort level and present a compelling reason for them to come.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hlbGVyb2Jzb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi93aGljaC1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtdG8tc3RheS1hdC1pbi0yMDIxLWluLW1hbHRhLWFuZC1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LXRoZS1iZXN0LXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Luxury Hotel To Stay At In 2021 In Malta And How To Get The Best Price,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelerobson/2021/06/26/which-luxury-hotel-to-stay-at-in-2021-in-malta-and-how-to-get-the-best-price/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL21pY2hlbGVyb2Jzb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNi93aGljaC1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtdG8tc3RheS1hdC1pbi0yMDIxLWluLW1hbHRhLWFuZC1ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LXRoZS1iZXN0LXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2hvdGVscy1hbmQtcmVzb3J0cy9hbGwtaW5jbHVzaXZlLXJlc29ydC1oYWNrcy10aGF0LWNhbi1oZWxwLXlvdS1zYXZlLWJpZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All-Inclusive Resort Hacks That Can Help You Save Big,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/gallery/hotels-and-resorts/all-inclusive-resort-hacks-that-can-help-you-save-big on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5L2hvdGVscy1hbmQtcmVzb3J0cy9hbGwtaW5jbHVzaXZlLXJlc29ydC1oYWNrcy10aGF0LWNhbi1oZWxwLXlvdS1zYXZlLWJpZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbWVkaWFpbmRpYS5ldS9zb2NpZXR5L2RydWctYWRkaWN0aW9uLWEtZGlzZWFzZS1ub3QtYW4taWRlbnRpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drug addiction a disease not an identity,"Drug addiction a disease not an identity

Experts say drug addiction stigma biggest hurdle in recovery

Society

The World Health Organisation declared drug addiction as a disease and the American Medical Association classified alcoholism as an illness as long ago as 1956 but nearly 70 years later in India few treat it as a disease.

The road to recovery for drug addicts is already a perilous one aggravated by physical pains of withdrawal and mental agony. In India however it is made worse due to familial and social stigma that leaves addicts fighting for their life while being completely isolated from their loved ones.

“If it is treated as a disorder there will not be a prejudice. But instead of support people who don’t know about the subject are busy giving feedback saying they are non-cooperative labelling stigmatising so people who are addicted get even more depressed without support and they continue to drink or do drugs” Girish Kurra founder and director of Umeed Wellness Centre a rehabilitation centre for drug and alcohol addiction in Delhi tells Media India Group.

Often this is simply because people do not have the necessary knowledge to help or understand the science behind addiction or even how serious it actually is in India. The theme for International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking for 2021 is ‘Share Drug Facts to Save Lives’ which is aimed at combating misinformation and finding solutions to the global drug problem through prevention and rehabilitation.

Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment of government of India conducted the first National Survey on Extent and Pattern in India in 2018 and found that “more than 57 million individuals are affected by harmful or dependent alcohol use about 2.5 million suffer from cannabis dependence and approximately 7.7 million individuals need help for their opioid use problems.”

Kurra explains that what families do not understand is that recovery is not simply dependent on willpower. Patients are often seen as useless persons who use drugs simply for fun or pleasure.

“It is all about compulsion and obsession; the urge is so strong and so intense that one is not able to stop it because of a chemical reaction within the body and mind. It is not the same with everybody. Emotional reactions are so intense that it can convert into self-harming as well” says Kurra.

In India cases have also risen during the Covid-19 pandemic. For example in 2020 there was a 23 pc rise in number of people registered to receive de-addiction treatment in Punjab. Experts attribute this rise in demand to mental health deterioration caused by social isolation and being cooped up indoors due to prolonged lockdowns.

“The pandemic has been a huge trauma for all of us. To get through this either you need counselling or you need somebody to talk to. But in our country there is also a stigma attached to counselling so if people are unwilling and unable to connect with others or engage in a dialogue then they may turn to drugs or alcohol” explains Sunil Vatsyayan founder and chairperson of Nada India Foundation another NGO that deals with addiction treatment.

Nada’s treatment strategy is unique in that it emphasises a peer-based people-centred model that is supported by the United Nations Drug Control programme. At the end of the day only a drug addict can truly understand the mental stress of rehabilitation and Vatsyayan believes that if they are able to help each other this will allow for more long-lasting self-sustaining recovery and help prevent future relapses.

“Often the patients’ voices are not being heard. It is the therapists and doctors who decide what’s best but we never ask the patient what they need. All health facilities should be available and accessible but should be acceptable also” says Vatsyayan.

An especially worrying concern in India is the growing number of minors who are becoming addicts. According to a study conducted by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights the most common form of substance abuse amongst adolescents is tobacco and alcohol followed by inhalants and cannabis.

“Addiction often starts in adolescence and because it is a chronic disease it continues into adulthood and causes health problems. Nowadays there is a culture among young people and marijuana is seen as something ‘cool’ but what they don’t realise is that it can be a dangerous gateway drug. Like painkillers tolerance eventually increases so they start to look for something else that will enhance the experience” explains Vatsyayan.

The effect of substance abuse is highest on the psychological health of adolescents. However with the taboo against mental health therapy in India adolescents are often left with no one to talk to.

“Drugs are not the initial problem. They are the solution to a problem” says Vatsyayan explaining “Even our education system does not give children chance to speak or participate in their own decision making. So we need to engage young people in our conversations and think about how to give them a safe space so that they can speak about themselves and their experience in a more productive way. Then they may not need drugs for that purpose.”

The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has announced a 2020-2021 annual plan called Nasha Mukt Bharat (Addiction-free India) for the most affected districts in India which will involve building more de-addiction centres increasing awareness among the youth and community participation.

A study report by the Integrated Rehabilitation Centres for Drug Addicts (IRCAs) reported that out of 398 de-addiction centres across India only 3 had female inhabitants. Despite desperate need women are reluctant to avail of these services because of social taboos and fear of all-male staff

Vatsyayan also believes that the law should adequately protect families of drug users as well who are adversely affected.

“Violence in the family of a drug user is very high and they always protect him regardless. It’s the mother and the wife who has been beaten and they are the people who bring them to a de-addiction centre but when it happens to them the man does not do the same so major gender discrimination is there. So separate centres are needed for women also” he says.

Although Vatsyayan commends the measures taken by the government he underscores the important role that family and society have to play and emphasises the importance of changing misconceptions about drug addicts in Indian society.

“They’ve been identified not as a human being but as the disease they have. They are in the last ladder of social strata despite wealth cast or privilege. This is the biggest barrier. In de-addiction centres the person has been treated like a patient but once they come out the conversation becomes ‘Oh you are a drug user so we must keep you away from us because you may be a thief.’ This aspect of empathy and understanding is missing in our system.” say Vatsyayan.

Outsiders may imagine that the pain and health issues associated with getting off addictive substances are the hardest parts of recovery. But Kurra also explains that the main roadblock in treating patients is not in the rehabilitation centres itself but once the patient is back in the society again.

“Their families do not want to bring any change in their mindset. They are under the impression that they are perfect and just the person who is using is an idiot. Employers also think that drug users are entirely dysfunctional and they do not want to give them a chance to recover don’t want to train them. Once they come to know they have a history of alcohol abuse or drug use they only focus on that and immediately reject them” says Kurra.

Because of this social stigma and discrimination by families and employers a lot of addicts do not get the chance to rebuild their lives and integrate back into society even after the arduous journey of recovery. Awareness programmes initiated by NGOs and government schemes will hopefully help clear misconceptions about these people who experts say should not be defined by the disease they have but be treated as human beings with proper rights."

In a rematch of last season’s PBA Tour Finals title match Simonsen avenged his 2020 loss and claimed his first title since he won twice in 2019.

“I wanted to get out and bowl well” said Simonsen. “If you bowl well and you lose it’s a little easier to accept than when you bowl badly and lose. I was able to just bowl today and not have to manipulate everything.”

In the race-to-two points format Troup took the first game and Simonsen responded with a 279 in game two to force a ninth-and-10th-frame roll-off.

“We’re bowling two games for a reason in this format” said Simonsen. “I wanted to get myself lined up and find a clear mindset going into the next game. Once I got into a rhythm it was on from there.”

Simonsen the higher seed elected to have Troup start the roll-off. Troup struck. Simonsen spared and then filled the 10th with three strikes forcing Troup to get two strikes and a single pin to win. Troup struck on his first shot but left a 10 pin on the second shot giving Simonsen his eighth career title.

“My double in the 10th was huge” said Simonsen. “Making him have to get up and double on a lane that didn’t seem like any of us were super comfortable on. He made two really good shots but the 10 pin is hard to knock over.”

Simonsen and Troup made it to the championship match by winning their respective groups during yesterday’s four-game qualifying block then surviving the group stepladder finals earlier today.

Simonsen led Group 2 into the stepladder then defeated Kris Prather in a roll-off in the Group 2 final match to advance to the championship against Troup.

Troup qualified as the second seed after four games of qualifying then defeated Chris Via in a single game and Bill O’Neill in a roll-off to win the Group 1 stepladder and get to the championship match.

In the opening match of the Group 1 stepladder Chris Via rolled the 32nd televised 300 game in a PBA Tour title event knocking out two-time PBA Tour Finals champion EJ Tackett. Via who joined Sean Rash and François Lavoie as the only players in PBA history to roll two televised perfect games in title events also became the first player ever to bowl two televised perfect games in the same season having rolled his first during the PBA Players Championship East Region Finals earlier this year. Via received a $10000 bonus for the feat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVuLzI2L3VrLW1vdmUtdG8taW5jcmVhc2Utd2VtYmxleS1mYW5zLXF1ZXN0aW9uZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK move to increase Wembley fans questioned | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"LONDON -- The British government faced accusations of mixed messaging Wednesday that could threaten its plan to fully lift lockdown restrictions in England next month after it decided to allow more than 60000 people inside Wembley Stadium for the latter stages of soccer's European Championship.

Following discussions with UEFA European soccer's governing body the government increased the number of fans allowed inside the London stadium for the semifinals on July 6 and 7 and the final on July 11.

Wembley which can take 90000 will now be allowed to be at about 75% capacity for the three matches making them the largest sporting gatherings since the coronavirus pandemic took root in the country in March 2020. In contrast only around 20000 people were inside the stadium on Tuesday night when England beat the Czech Republic 1-0.

The decision to increase Wembley's capacity has stoked worries it will fuel the current wave of infections in the U.K. which has already endured Europe's second-worst pandemic death toll of 128000.

Professor Lawrence Young a virologist at the University of Warwick warned allowing 60000 fans to crowd into Wembley is a ""recipe for disaster"" given the prevalence of the delta variant first identified in India which scientists say is 40% to 80% more contagious.

""We are so close to getting on top of this virus with the success of the vaccination program -- why put the end of lockdown on July 19 at risk?"" he said.

Although infections are less likely in an outdoor environment public health experts warned that the virus could still find a way to spread notably as tens of thousands of fans travel to and from the stadium.

""Yes being outside will offset the risk -- but there is no zero risk"" said Dr. Catherine Smallwood senior emergency officer at the World Health Organization's Europe office in Copenhagen. ""It's not limited to the stadia themselves. It's also around the stadia the gatherings that happen outside of it in bars and clubs in households.""

Smallwood said scenes like those in a rocking Budapest stadium last Saturday when Hungary drew 1-1 with world champion France were ""something that we should be worried about."" She urged tournament organizers to put in ""every effort"" to reduce the level of risk.

The U.K. government already knows the potential negative impact of large-scale events. After all there is evidence a European Champions League soccer match between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid and the Cheltenham horse racing festival helped seed the virus in 2020.

Unlike most other countries in Europe the U.K. has seen a spike in infections over the past few weeks despite a widely lauded rollout of vaccines. The virus has been largely spreading among younger age groups most of whom have yet to receive a dose of vaccine. On Wednesday government figures showed another 16135 new cases the highest daily rate since Feb. 6.

The Conservative government hopes its rapid rollout of vaccines will keep the current outbreak in check and limit the number of covid-19 patients requiring hospital treatment thereby paving the way for it to lift remaining restrictions on social contact on July 19. Wednesday's figures showed that around 65% of Britain's population has received one dose of vaccine while 47% have had two.

It says the increased capacity for the Wembley matches -- and the finals at the Wimbledon tennis tournament on the weekend of July 10 and 11 -- will be part of its Event Research Programme on holding mass events safely that it has been running. It also said all ticket-holders for the matches must show evidence of a negative covid-19 test or proof of two vaccine doses -- something that's not required when fans go to a watch a match in a pub.

Media Minister John Whittingdale said the test events so far including music's Brit Awards ""have shown very successful results"" and analysis will be published soon.

Whittingdale also indicated the government will grant UEFA's request for around 2500 VIPs -- such as officials politicians and sponsors -- to be allowed to enter the country for the latter stages of the tournament without having to quarantine. He said however their movements will be severely constrained.

Right now most travelers returning to the U.K. face 10 days of quarantine at home and those from high-risk countries must quarantine at special hotels.

""Those who are allowed to come into the country in order to attend the match come in for precisely that"" he told broadcaster ITV. ""They're not allowed to just go on a tour of Britain whilst they're here. They come in they stay in a designated place they attend the match and then they leave.""

Stephen Reicher a professor of social psychology at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland warned that people could easily get confused about the messaging at a critical time in the pandemic.

""If we live in a society which tells us 'Well it's fine for 60000 people to meet at Wembley' it's very hard at the same time to say to people 'Look there's still a pandemic out there and we've still got to be careful'"" he told BBC radio.

If England's national team makes the latter stages of the tournament then concerns over the capacity issues at Wembley may be overridden by other ways of spreading of the virus as fans celebrate or commiserate together.

After all England has not won a major tournament title let alone made a final since it hosted the 1966 World Cup.

As one of the most impressive teams in the Euro 2021 group stage Italy is the heavy favorite in its Round of 16 match at Wembley Stadium standing just one game away from setting the all-time record for consecutive undefeated matches for the Italian men’s team.

Italy put on a show in its opening three group matches played at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Roberto Mancini’s side is blowing up the longstanding image of Italian soccer based on sophisticated tactical defensive mastery. Instead his side has become an attacking force. The Italians go vertical and fast sending multiple players forward in full-out sprints.

Those waves of blue shirts have proven overwhelming for opposing teams to deal with. That’s what’s awaiting an Austria side which wasn’t exactly convincing during the group phase in advancing to its first-ever Euros knockout stage.

Italy: “Toughest game awaits us”

That’s what head coach Roberto Mancini called the Round of 16 match against Austria. He’s clearly expecting an opponent who’ll make life tough on the Italians as underdogs are known to do in single-elimination tournament matches.

Austria was able to frustrate the Netherlands the best team it faced in the group stage. The Dutch used an early penalty kick to break through and despite the 2-0 final score it was an even match the rest of the way.

“If we can get past Austria things will go better for us” Mancini said looking ahead to the upcoming rounds. The winner of the Belgium vs. Portugal match will be waiting in the quarterfinals.

How will Austria play?

Austria’s German head coach Franco Foda who happens to be of Italian descent can be tactically flexible but his team has opted for a three-man center back formation during group play with wing backs taking on an important role.

Austria is undoubtedly a talented team and the group stage has shown it especially when the Austrians are on the front foot and attacking the opposition. The moments Austria has gotten into trouble are when it cedes control and retreats into a more speculative stance. There might not be any other choice against an Italian team that’s on a roll.

The Austrians’ star player is David Alaba who has played in that three-man back line although he regularly featured higher up the field for his most recent club team Bayern Munich. His best and most productive position has been a topic of debate and it will resurface again when he joins Real Madrid this summer.

Italy make changes

With qualification to the Round of 16 already locked up Mancini was able to rest most of his starters in the group-stage finale. He made two subs to his starting XI against Austria: Francesco Acerbi was confirmed to replace injured central defender Giorgio Chiellini and Marco Verratti took over for two-goal scorer Manuel Locatelli on the left side of central midfield. It will be interesting to see if the latter move potentially takes some steam out of the Azzurri attack.

Don’t expect the Italians to veer away from their high speed high pressing game with quick combinations around the opposition penalty area. The three forwards will set the tone and will need to have inspired performances with the help of the fullbacks' aggressive play down the flanks.

Forward Marko Aranautovic is Austria’s most dangerous attacking player and it will be interesting to see if Foda decides to start him or bring him off the bench. That decision will make it clear what Austria’s approach will be.

Either way the Italian defense should be able to handle Arnautovic. And if the Italians can also avoid any major lapses on set pieces they should be able to give their attackers the opportunity to decide the game.

The Austrian resistance will be fierce but Italy has the talent to come up with the moment of magic it will need to move on to the quarterfinals.

Prediction: Italy 2 Austria 0

The match is set to take place in Jerusalem’s Teddy Stadium on August 4 a day after the team lands in the country.

Beitar one of Israel’s top soccer clubs finished third in the premier league in the 2019-2020 season.

The Jerusalem Municipality will host the match and the team is expected to visit holy sites in the city Hebrew-language media reports said. Incoming president Isaac Herzog who will enter office in July may meet with the Spanish team during their visit media reports said.

In May before the recent fighting in the Gaza Strip between the Israeli military and Hamas terror group the Spanish team was in talks to play in Israel. But the hostilities — which ended with a ceasefire on May 21 — were said to have caused some reluctance within the club over travel to Israel at the time.

If the August 4 game materializes it will be the first time Barcelona plays a preseason game in the country.

The team led by Argentine superstar Lionel Messi in 2013 played a friendly match in Jaffa before a crowd of young Israelis as part of a two-day “peace tour.”

Messi also traveled to Israel in 2019 for a friendly match between the Argentinian and Uruguayan national teams which saw him square off against his then-Barcelona teammate Luis Suarez.

That game was also put in doubt due to fighting the week before the match between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad the second-largest terror group in Gaza after the Strip’s Hamas rulers.

The year before Argentina and Messi were scheduled to play the Israeli national team in Jerusalem before traveling to Russia for the World Cup but the squad canceled the trip on short notice after intense pressure from Palestinian officials and activists.

Beitar is one of the country’s most storied franchises winning 13 trophies and counting Israeli presidents and prime ministers among its fans. But it also has drawn negative attention for being the only major club never to have an Arab player. Israel’s Arab minority makes up roughly 20% of the population and Arab players star on rival teams and the country’s national squad.

Club officials have in the past said their hands were tied by a hardcore base of far-right fans who wield significant clout over personnel decisions. A small group of fans known as La Familia has been known to whoop like monkeys when an opposing team’s player from Africa would touch the ball and chant “death to Arabs” toward opposing Arab players.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVlZmEuY29tL3VlZmFldXJvcGFjb25mZXJlbmNlbGVhZ3VlL3N0YW5kaW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Groups & Standings,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.uefa.com', port=443): Read timed out.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."

Now Doe v. McKesson has been narrowed to a matter of state policy.

The legal battle dates back to 2016 when a Baton Rouge police officer maimed by a rock during a Black Lives Matter protest sued one of the demonstration’s more prominent organizers.

A trial court rejected the claim but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals thought it should go to trial.

It became a free speech issue a few years later when the defendant — Baltimore native DeRay Mckesson — teamed up with the ACLU and took it to the U.S. Supreme Court under the banner of protecting the First Amendment.

But U.S justices last fall refused to hear the case until Louisiana’s high court weighed in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy01NzYyODMyMtIBLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy01NzYyODMyMi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson & Johnson to pay $230m to settle opioid claim,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9sb2NhbC1jb21wYW5pZXMvMjAyMS8wNi8yNy8yMDIwLWZvcmV2ZXItYWx0ZXJlZC1kYWxsYXMtZm9ydC13b3J0aHMtYmlnZ2VzdC1jb21wYW5pZXMtaGVyZXMtd2hvLWVtZXJnZWQtYXMtd2lubmVycy1sb3NlcnMv0gGsAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2xvY2FsLWNvbXBhbmllcy8yMDIxLzA2LzI3LzIwMjAtZm9yZXZlci1hbHRlcmVkLWRhbGxhcy1mb3J0LXdvcnRocy1iaWdnZXN0LWNvbXBhbmllcy1oZXJlcy13aG8tZW1lcmdlZC1hcy13aW5uZXJzLWxvc2Vycy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2020 forever altered Dallas-Fort Worth’s biggest companies. Here’s who emerged as winners losers,"For Dallas-Fort Worth’s public companies there may never be another year like 2020.

With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the economy in every way many of the region’s biggest corporate players shrank dragged down by a slump in oil prices a reluctance to fly or the complete shutdown of live events and other entertainment.

It also was the year Exxon Mobil Corp. the region’s perennial king of the hill fell a notch in The Dallas Morning News’ annual ranking compiled with the assistance of Bloomberg data analysts.

McKesson Corp. one of North Texas’ California transplants surpassed the Irving-based oil giant to gain the top spot with revenue exceeding $231 billion compared with Exxon’s $178 billion.

But don’t count Exxon out.

With oil prices on the rebound this year the global player could ascend once again based on the strength of early 2021 results that saw Exxon book $59 billion in revenue in the first three months. McKesson which operates on an April to March fiscal year has already set the 2021 target recording $238 billion in revenue.

After the top two it was a textbook example of winners and losers.

Health care companies homebuilders financial firms and consumer products makers — especially toilet paper supplier Kimberly-Clark — all turned in revenue wins. Arlington-based D.R. Horton the nation’s largest homebuilder saw a 15% spike in its revenue and its subsidiary that develops residential lots Forestar Group soared more than 117%.

North Texas homebuying surged 21% in January from the previous year and never really slowed down after that. Credit low mortgage rates and a seller’s market for driving home prices to unprecedented levels.

Airlines oil and gas retailers and hotel and restaurant chains took massive hits feeling the pandemic’s hibernation-inducing grip for much of the year. Fort Worth-based American Airlines watched its revenue plummet 62% and its crosstown rival Dallas-based Southwest Airlines didn’t fare much better — sinking nearly 60%.

But as vaccination rates pick up and consumers confined to their homes much of last year begin to revenge spend 2021 is shaping up as a year of recovery for nearly every corner of North Texas’ highly diversified economy.

Who came out on top?

McKesson’s rise to the top marks the first time one of the region’s California transplants led the Top 150 ranking. The medical and pharmaceutical supplier moved to North Texas in April 2019.

Now headquartered in Irving McKesson saw its revenue soar almost $17 billion in its 2020 fiscal year. And that didn’t include much of the financial lift it got from lucrative government contracts to deliver vaccine supplies around the country.

At the start of the pandemic people scrambled to stock up on prescriptions to prepare for government-ordered lockdowns said Ashtyn Evans a health care equity analyst at the Edward Jones investment firm. Drug volumes dipped later in the year as the pandemic dragged on.

“Health care typically holds up better because it’s harder to delay health care products” said Evans who noted that McKesson distributes one-third of all prescriptions in the U.S.

Other locally based health care companies also benefited from the nation’s pandemic response.

Retractable Technologies Inc. a Little Elm-based maker of syringes saw its 2020 revenue nearly double from the previous year on the strength of government contracts to ramp up production for the vaccine rollout. Its two contracts totaled $137. 4 million last year.

Addus HomeCare Corp. a Frisco-based caregiver business that operates 215 locations in 23 states posted a nearly 18% revenue gain as Americans turned to home care rather than in-person visits to the doctor or hospital.

But 2020 wasn’t universally positive for all health-related companies. Farmers Branch-based Tenet Healthcare for example saw its revenue fall 4.5% primarily from a pause in elective surgeries — an increasingly important part of its business.

Wedbrush financial adviser Chris Mooney said elective surgery postponements weighed heavily last year on the U.S. health care industry’s financial results. The businesses “were hurt overall besides the [government] grants that helped” he said.

Mooney pointed to Orthofix a Lewisville-based medical device company that manufactures implants and screws used in surgeries and the $53 million revenue hit it took last year.

Patient volumes are rebounding this year and hospital stocks are soaring. Tenet’s shares are up around 70% year-to-date.

The biggest winners in 2020 were any companies involved in building homes as the red-hot housing market accelerated throughout the pandemic.

Builder D.R. Horton Inc. posted a 15.5% revenue gain in 2020 and homebuilding supplier Builders FirstSource’s sales spiked 17.6%. D.R. Horton’s affiliated company Forestar Group Inc. had that triple-digit revenue gain.

Edward Jones consumer analyst Brian Yarbrough called it a “perfect storm” year for the residential real estate industry with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates low and the health crisis causing many urban residents to seek land and space in suburban or rural areas.

“The pendulum swung toward [the industry]” Yarbrough said. “How big does it swing back toward entertainment? As people get back to normal they may not have as much cash laying around.”

Last year’s divisive presidential election also played a role in driving up revenue for another North Texas company. Irving-based Nexstar Media Group the nation’s largest owner of local television stations moved into the ranking’s top 30 as its revenue soared by $1.5 billion. It cited political advertising as a key contributor.

Who took the hardest hits?

The pandemic and resulting recession had a predictably disastrous impact on industries and companies involved in oil and gas production or anything to do with travel and hospitality.

Exxon pipeline operator Energy Transfer and its related gasoline distributor Sunoco refiner HollyFrontier and Irving-based independent oil and gas explorer Pioneer Natural Resources all recorded revenue drops ranging from 27% to 36%. High oil prices early in 2020 followed by a falloff in driving during the pandemic are mostly to blame.

Petroleum consumption by the transportation sector declined 16% last year according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Transportation typically accounts for 70% of all U.S. petroleum use.

Despite a troubled 2020 the energy market is almost back to where it was before the pandemic Mooney said. Some analysts are forecasting $100 oil by the end of the year.

“If that happens that would certainly pull capital back into the Texas oil industry” according to a monthly report compiled by Robert Dye Comerica Inc.’s chief economist. “By the third week of June the Texas rig count had improved to 221 active rigs more than double the level from a year earlier.”

The air travel industry is also coming back.

On June 20 the most recent Sunday travel day passenger traffic through U.S. airports had rebounded to 77% of pre-pandemic levels according to data from the Transportation Security Administration. That was up nearly 256% from 2020′s dismal number on the same day.

A year ago Dallas-Fort Worth’s two major airlines were worried about simply surviving as multibillion-dollar losses led to an industry bailout by the federal government. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines both took billions of dollars in grants and loans to stave off mass layoffs that could have sunk the country into a deeper recession.

Both companies tumbled in The News’ annual ranking. American fell from the fifth-largest company in D-FW by revenue to ninth. Southwest slipped from sixth to 19th.

Rivaling the travel industry for hardest hit by the pandemic were the hotel restaurant and entertainment sectors.

Revenue declines recorded by Dallas hotelier Monty Bennett’s empire especially Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc. and Braemar Hotels and Resorts Inc. were typical across that industry. Ashford Hospitality Trust’s revenue evaporated by 66% while Braemar saw 53% of its revenue disappear.

For a finer point on the pandemic’s impact look no further than amusement parks and movie theaters. Shelter-in-place orders and germ spread fears led to silenced rides and empty seats.

Arlington-based Six Flags Entertainment Corp. which operates 26 theme parks in North America watched its revenue dwindle from nearly $1.5 billion in 2019 to $356 million last year — a 76% drop.

Plano-based Cinemark Holdings Inc.’s decline was even more dramatic. Revenue for the movie theater chain plummeted from $3.28 billion in 2019 to $686 million last year — a 79% dive.

Both companies are building back this year with amusement parks and movie theaters reopened. Cinemark has even tapped into new ways to use its theaters — as esports venues for public gaming.

New faces and the soon-to-be departed

Corporate headquarters relocations initial public offerings and direct listings through special purpose acquisition companies brought a handful of new names to this year’s ranking.

Real estate titan CBRE Group made Dallas its official corporate home leaving California behind and taking a spot among D-FW’s five largest companies. Financial services firm First Foundation also left the Golden State.

Drive Shack a golf entertainment business similar to Dallas-based Topgolf or ClubCorp’s Big Shots arrived from the East Coast moving its headquarters from New York to Dallas.

Thryv Holdings Alkami Technology Vine Energy Signify Health RumbleOn and Berry Corp. are also first-timers in the ranking. Thryv’s 2020 revenue topped $1.1 billion making it one of 67 D-FW companies to top the billion-dollar mark.

Next year’s ranking also stands to lose some longtime names through go-private deals or mergers.

Plano-based At Home Group Inc. Irving-based Michaels Cos. Inc. Euless-based U.S. Concrete Inc. Dallas-based RealPage Inc. and Grand Prairie-based Neos Therapeutics all have closed deals or are in the process of leaving the public company ranks.

Looking forward

So what’s ahead for the remainder of 2021?

In May the Dallas-Plano-Irving side of the metro area created 17400 jobs last month accounting for half the new jobs statewide. But the eastern side of D-FW is still 75000 jobs shy of its pre-pandemic level.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had projected that Texas would add over 800000 jobs this year which would have recouped all the positions lost during the pandemic. It has since cut its forecast to 510500 this year in part because of new COVID-19 fears.

“The forecast was revised down this month primarily due to an upward revision in the anticipated path of COVID-19 hospitalizations” said Keith Phillips Dallas Fed assistant vice president and senior economist. “While the percentage of Texans vaccinated against COVID-19 continues to increase the pace of vaccinations has slowed and the more contagious Delta variant is spreading. Together these two patterns have changed the outlook for COVID-19 hospitalizations in the third quarter from a consistent downward trend to a slight increase through September.”

Supply-side complications such as difficulty finding workers widescale shortages of materials long lead times and transportation issues also threaten to restrain economic growth according to Dallas Fed senior business economist Laila Assanie and research analyst Carlee Crocker.

Waco economist Ray Perryman remains bullish on Texas’ rebound.

“We can reasonably expect a solid comeback as the global economy is able to reopen and both business and leisure travel resume” Perryman said. He noted that prices are rising too — a positive sign for businesses trying to make up lost ground.

“The fortunes of individual companies will vary based on specific circumstances but there should be ample opportunities for expansion and innovation going forward.”",,,,,,
MDT,Medtronic,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGNibWFnLmNvbS9uZXctbWVkdHJvbmljLWNlby1tYXBzLW91dC1zdHJhdGVneS10by1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLWlubm92YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Medtronic CEO Maps Out Strategy to Accelerate Innovation,"Medtronic’s board of directors gave Geoff Martha the luxury and burden of eight months of time to think about how he would succeed Omar Ishrak as CEO of the medical technology giant.

When Medtronic announced its leadership succession in August 2019 the board praised Ishrak for doubling company revenue during his tenure and expressed confidence in Martha’s “ability to take Medtronic into its next chapter of growth.”

Martha took the reins from Ishrak in April 2020 when Medtronic’s health care customers were in the early stages of battling the Covid-19 pandemic. A month earlier Medtronic had announced it would give manufacturers access to the company’s proprietary design specifications for ventilators which hospitals badly needed.

Yet the pandemic didn’t interfere with Martha’s change-agenda timetable. He unveiled a new organizational structure last year. It divides Medtronic’s work into 20 operating units such as cardiac rhythm management and respiratory interventions. Martha contends Medtronic had become too bureaucratic which had slowed its introduction of products into the market.

He’s pushing profit-and-loss accountability and product development decision-making down to the operating unit level. He argues this new structure will allow Medtronic to grow more rapidly and compete more intensely with other medical-technology businesses.

He’s also excited about a wide range of new Medtronic products and procedures. He points to renal denervation as a procedure that can revolutionize treatment of high blood pressure.

Martha had a 19-year run with GE Healthcare and GE Capital before he joined Medtronic in 2011. Most recently he led Medtronic’s Restorative Therapies Group and in 2014 he had a key role in Medtronic’s acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien the largest acquisition in the company’s history. He became Medtronic’s board chairman in December.

Martha who grew up in a Pittsburgh suburb honed his competitive drive when he was captain of the Penn State hockey team. While he was earning a bachelor’s degree in finance Martha says his hockey experience taught him about team dynamics humility and work ethic.

Now Martha 51 leads a workforce of more than 90000 employees including 11000 based in Minnesota. On May 27 Medtronic reported $30.1 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2021 up from $28.9 billion for fiscal 2020. Martha noted a strong finish for the 2021 fiscal year that ended on April 30. He said Medtronic is now poised for “accelerated revenue growth.”

In a recent interview with Twin Cities Business Martha discussed how he plans to grow Medtronic which new products hold the most promise how he’s addressing diversity issues and why Medtronic is the subject of high-profile litigation. The following are edited excerpts of the interview.

Q: You recently spoke at a Medical Alley virtual meeting that focused on diversity equity and inclusion. During a 45-minute conversation with the moderator you brought up the importance of humility three times. Why is it important for a CEO to try to maintain some level of humility?

Humility is one of the core things that I look for in people and try to emulate myself. Humble people tend to listen more and learn more. The people who have the highest impact are active learners. My predecessor Omar Ishrak is a very humble guy and also a lifelong active learner. How do I try to get the rest of the organization to think that way? One is to lead by example and look I’m not perfect at this.

I don’t really like arrogance. In high-performing people who don’t display a level of humility we’ve moved them out of [Medtronic]. People don’t like to work with arrogant people.

Q: It can be difficult to succeed a longtime CEO. About a year into your CEO tenure what would you say is the biggest change to the Medtronic business that you’ve led?

A: We’re a biomedical engineering company but we don’t just invent products for technology’s sake. Our products are designed to have a measurable impact on patients and health systems around the world. The [business] environment has progressed becoming much more global fast moving and competitive. We decided to make some changes to the operating model of the company. The goal was to decentralize a lot of the decision-making—around innovation and our go-to-market—into our operating units.

These operating units are set up around specific therapies like diabetes or spine surgery. We’ve tried to empower them to move faster to make decisions and also to be accountable for their performance. We eliminated some layers of bureaucracy within the company. We’ve added some new cultural traits around competitiveness being bold with our plans and creating a sense of urgency.

Q: You’ve aligned 19 operating units under three portfolios—cardiovascular neuroscience medical-surgical—and diabetes is a free-standing unit. By granting more decision-making to these 20 operating units what is the No. 1 problem you are trying to solve?

A: Speed. We need to move faster in everything we do. We’ve got smaller very focused [competitor] companies. These companies are well funded and able to move faster. They are very focused [sometimes on just one product or therapy]. At Medtronic we’re trying to get at the speed of decision-making speed of innovation. If it took us four years to create a new product under the new organizational model I want that to be two and a half years or so. Also we can measure the [financial performance of] Medtronic operating units against their business competitors much easier when we look at the company this way.

Q: As people get Covid-19 vaccinations how does that affect Medtronic’s business going forward? In a less-restrictive health care environment what do you expect will happen within your cardiovascular portfolio?

A: We are very optimistic bullish that in the U.S. in particular we’re going to see a pretty rapid snapback of elective procedures. We’re going to get back to a normal prepandemic level of procedures we anticipate here in the next several months.

We innovated during Covid along with our hospital partners to manage many of our patients remotely. Pacemaker patients regularly go into the hospital to get their pacemaker checked out to make sure it’s working properly. [During] Covid hospitals started to really utilize the full extent of the Medtronic cardiovascular technology to manage devices remotely. Doctors were hesitant to do that but because of Covid they had to use it and patients liked it better.

Q: Many people live their daily lives with high blood pressure or diabetes and others deal with irregular heartbeats. If we look at these three common areas what types of innovative products has Medtronic put on the market relatively recently? And do you have any new products in late-stage development to treat these three ailments?

A: Let me take high blood pressure first. Over the last decade we invested more than a billion dollars in a therapy that is called renal denervation. [The procedure delivers energy to overactive nerves near the kidneys.] We have a mountain of evidence here that shows that it safely and effectively lowers your blood pressure without the side effects that the drugs have.

And it’s permanent. We have one big pivotal trial that we should get the results back from this calendar year in the fall. If those results are positive where we expect them to be then soon after that we should get FDA and other approvals. We will be launching this commercially in the next two years. This could be the biggest thing in the medical technology industry because hypertension is the No. 1 contributor to death around the world. This could be a real big disruptor and game changer that could really reposition Medtronic.

In addition to the growth—the number of patients we would serve and the resulting growth of the company— it would move us more in a big way to marketing to consumers. We’ve got to do that get that word out to cardiologists to primary care physicians and directly to the consumer that this therapy is out there and what it does.

Q: What about treating irregular heartbeats and diabetes?

A: An atrial fibrillation is another big condition that is primarily served by pharmacological products first. We have a product that’s an ablation therapy that freezes the tissue in your heart. It’s called cryoablation. The New England Journal of Medicine just published data that shows that for a large segment of patients you should use cryoablation first instead of drugs. It’s that effective.

In diabetes we’ve got a number of new products coming to market. Today we focus on insulin-dependent diabetes so this is severe Type II and Type I patients. And we’ve got a whole new system that we launched in Europe first because the European regulators approved it faster. It is sitting in the FDA right now and it’s our next-generation diabetes pump system with new algorithms. And it is getting just fantastic results on patients in Europe and in Latin America.

We also bought a company in August that serves more insulin-dependent patients and it’s a smart pen that delivers insulin vs. the pump. So it’s a much cheaper solution. You don’t have a pump tied to you and it does replace the multidaily injection shot. It works with glucose sensing so we can have a closed loop between your body and the insulin delivery device which is this pen. You see a theme here—where our therapies in many cases are not only better than the prior version but it opens us up to a whole new set of patients.

Q: At the core of Medtronic’s mission statement is producing products and therapies that alleviate pain restore health and extend life. Within that fundamental context of doing good how does Medtronic end up in a fair number of high-profile lawsuits and Department of Justice investigations?

A: As a company our intentions are pure. It’s very mission-driven and for those who have worked here and partners of ours such as health care systems and physicians if you surveyed them you would get that feedback.

We’re creating new therapies new standards of care things that have not been done before. That’s what really separates Medtronic from the competition. We are pioneers and then people tend to follow us.

From time to time we find out unfortunately after the fact that there was some sort of design flaw or some sort of mistake that was made which results in a product that doesn’t work quite the way over the long term that we expected it to. It’s something that we strive so hard to avoid but when [these circumstances] happen we are very transparent about that. We move quickly. Sometimes you get caught up in lawsuits and around your product liability.

Regarding the Department of Justice look we have over 90000 Medtronic employees all over the place. Unfortunately there is somebody somewhere doing something that they shouldn’t. Sometimes we find it and self-report sometimes other employees find these things and tell us about it and again we suffer for it. Or they call the government themselves. These things pop up. We work very hard on our culture to prevent these things. When they happen we act decisively and swiftly.

“People don’t like to work with arrogant people.”

Q: In 2019 Medtronic agreed to create a $35 million fund to compensate those who said they were harmed by the SynchroMed II an implantable drug pump. What were the lessons from that particular case?

A: It gets back to simplifying our organizational structure. Information flow from the patient through the health care provider and to our senior leadership could have been faster when there were product issues.

Sometimes this information was filtered [by layers of management at Medtronic] and we didn’t act decisively enough to address those issues. You’ve got to make sure that you have very good systems in place to pick up what we call “signals in the field” that the products aren’t working right. It may appear to be innocuous things in these reports you are getting back from physicians. But when you look at patterns they turn out to be problems that are brewing. We’ve gotten more sophisticated in recording these signals proactively asking the right questions analyzing these signals and predicting problems not just discovering problems.

When you hear these things you’ve got to be decisive and move quickly even when there are unknowns. But I’ll tell you that [SynchroMed II] context. That’s an implantable drug pump that provides tiny dosages of the drug directly to where it’s needed inside the body vs. the patient having to take that through pills with all kinds of side effects. It’s a super-complicated medical device maybe the most complicated one out there. And guess who’s the only one that does it? It’s us. Others have tried it and failed.

There’s a huge need out there. When we got into issues and created that fund and we got in trouble with the FDA and got a consent decree the easy thing to do would have been to shut that business down. Keeping that business alive and continuing to innovate that business has cost more money. If you look at it strictly from a return on investment it doesn’t provide nearly the returns that we would normally get. But because we are the only ones we stayed with it and we serve those patients. It’s part of our mission. If we had shut the business down we would have stranded a lot of patients and that’s just not who we are.

Q: Medtronic has achieved diversity by race ethnicity and gender in its top corporate leadership and on its board of directors. You were an executive leader of the Medtronic African Descent Network yet the Wall Street Journal reported in October that Medtronic had paid settlements to several Black employees who alleged racial discrimination in the company’s promotion process. What actions are you taking as CEO to make the Medtronic culture and promotion environment more hospitable for Black employees?

A: We’re going to keep going on the journey that we’ve been on. If you would have said in 2013 or 2015 that we would have as many vice presidents and senior vice presidents of African descent that we have today people would have thought that to be a pipe dream.

We’ve made tremendous progress but that doesn’t mean that we’re good enough. There are individuals who feel like it’s still not inclusive for them at Medtronic. We’re continuing to get better and work on that.

Omnipod 5 AID system is safe and effective for people with type 1 diabetes of all ages

Promising results from three pivotal studies showed that Omnipod 5 Insulet’s new automated insulin delivery (AID) system can help people of all ages manage type 1 diabetes. Among children teens and adults with type 1 diabetes the system is found to be safe and easy to use at three months – and early results from the 12-month extension phases of the trials show that the glucose effects can be sustained for six months.

The table summarizes three-month results from all three trials and we explain the data in more detail below.

Adolescents and adults Pediatrics Young pediatrics Study sample 128 people ages 14-70 113 youth ages 6-14 80 kids ages 2-6 Baseline Study Baseline Study Baseline Study Time in Range 65% 74% 52% 68% 57% 68% A1C 7.2% 6.8% 7.7% 7% 7.4% 6.9% Time >180 mg/dl 32% 25% 45% 30% 39% 30% Time >250 mg/dl 10% 6% 19% 10% 15% 9% Time <70 mg/dl 2% 1.1% 1.4% 1.5% 2.2% 1.9% Time <54 mg/dl 0.2% 0.2% 0.1% 0.2% 0.24% 0.26%

Dr. Jennifer Sherr presented three-month pivota data from the young pediatrics trial (children ages two to six):

A1C was reduced from 7.4% at the start of the trial to 6.9% after three months of Omnipod 5 usage. ​The majority of the children (54%) achieved an A1C below 7% at the end of the study compared to 31% of the participants who had an A1C below 7% at baseline. Twelve of the 80 participants were on multiple daily injections of insulin at baseline.

Time in Range (TIR) improved by 2.6 hours per day using Omnipod 5 from 57% to 68% TIR. This was largely driven by less time spent in hyperglycemia – time with glucose levels above 180 mg/dl fell by 2.4 hours per day from 39% to 30%.

Overnight Time in Range (defined as midnight to 6am) increased significantly from 58% to 81%. That translates to an additional 1.4 hours each night spent in range. This came from a reduction in the time spent with glucose levels above 180 mg/dl which fell from 38% to just 17%. The percentage of parents or caregivers who reported “very good” or “fairly good” sleep quality increased from 65% to 90% with Omnipod 5; on the other end the percentage reporting “very bad” sleep quality went from 9% to 0%.

No severe hypoglycemia or DKA events were recorded in the three-month study – the Omnipod 5 system was shown to be safe for this group of young children.

Dr. Korey Hood presented quality of life outcomes from the Omnipod 5 trial in children and teenagers (ages 6 to 18). The results reported by participants and one parent before starting Omnipod 5 and after three months of use showcased the value of AID systems for reducing the burden of diabetes and improving quality of life.

Diabetes distress decreased significantly with Omnipod 5 for the 250 participants across all groups – children parents of children teens and parents of teens. This was exhibited by lower scores (which indicate lower distress) in the results from the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) survey that measures diabetes-specific emotional distress.

Among parents of children hypoglycemia confidence (feeling comfortable with avoiding and being able to avoid low blood sugar problems) increased. This was exhibited by higher scores (which indicate higher confidence) in the results from the Hypoglycemia Confidence Scale that measures how comfortable people feel staying safe from hypoglycemic problems.

In terms of sleep parents and caregivers of children saw significant improvements in sleep duration sleep disturbances and overall sleep quality. This was exhibited by lower scores (which indicate better sleep) in the results from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index that measures how sleep quality and distrubances.

Mental well-being increased most among parents of children – the group that had the highest baseline rates of diabetes distress and low mental well-being. This was exhibited by higher scores (which indicate better mental well-being) in the results from the World Health Organization 5 that measures psychological well-being.

Following the initial three-month pivotal results from Omnipod 5 92% of adults and adolescents and 99% of children chose to continue using Omnipod 5 in a one-year extension phase of the trial. After six months of Omnipod 5 use:

A1C reductions were maintained. Average A1C for children improved from 7.7% to 7.0% during the first three months of the trial and was 6.9% after six months. Average A1C for adolescents and adults fell from 7.2% to 6.8% during the first three months and was 6.7% after six months. 54% of the children and 73% of the adolescents and adults recorded an A1C below 7% after six months of Omnipod 5.

Time in Range improvements were also maintained. Among children Time in Range improved from 52% to 68% during the first three months; after six months TIR was 67%. For adolescents and adults Time in Range improved from 65% to 74% during the first three months; after six months TIR was 73%.



Omnipod 5 has been submitted to the FDA for people ages 14 and older in the US and will hopefully become available later this year.

New results on Medtronic’s Extended-Wear Infusion Set

Exciting new results were shared from the US pivotal trial for Medtronic’s Extended-Wear Infusion Set. The study enrolled 259 people with type 1 diabetes using the MiniMed 670G system and found:

The extended infusion set had a seven-day survival rate of 75%. That means that 75% of the time users were able to wear the infusion set for a full seven days. As a comparison Medtronic’s two-day or three-day infusion sets had a survival rate around 67% for two or three days which means only 67% of the time does the set last the full two or three days.

Rates of device failure were low. Of more than 3000 extended-wear sessions in the trial there were only eight device-related cases of hyperglycemia and no cases of device-related hypoglycemia or DKA.

Users saw a slight improvement in glucose management. Average Time in Range improved from 72% using the control infusion sets to 74% with Extended-Wear Infusion Set (that’s about 36 more minutes per day spent in range).

People reported being very satisfied with the new infusion set with greater convenience of use ease of insertion and comfort of wear.

Medtronic’s Extended-Wear Infusion Set is approved in Europe and launched in Finland. In the US the device has been submitted to the FDA.

Control-IQ leads to major Time in Range increases in older adults with type 1 diabetes

Dr. Elena Toschi presented an analysis of real-world data from older adults with type 1 diabetes who started using the Control-IQ automated insulin delivery system. The sample included data from 39 adults with an average age of 70 years and a baseline glucose management indicator (GMI) of 6.9%. Researchers compared CGM data from two weeks prior to starting Control-IQ with data from three months after initiating the automated insulin delivery system. Participants’ Time in Range (TIR) increased from 64% to 87%. This is about 5.5 more hours spent in range each day!

Time in hyperglycemia (above 180 mg/dL) fell from 29% to 18% about 2.6 fewer hours per day.

Time in hypoglycemia (below 70 mg/dL) fell from 2.8% to 1.9% a decrease of almost 30 minutes.

GMI fell slightly to 6.8% and glycemic variability fell from 34% to 28%. Some may wonder why the GMI change was only 0.1 percentage point given the impressive Time in Range imporvements – we are checking this but are assuming that the lower time in hypoglycemia means less time in the lower glucose level range correspond to only a small reduction in GMI.

All of these adults had prior experience with continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps.",,,,,,,,,

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes. For example with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation Merck for Mothers created the Hear Her campaign to disseminate critical information on pregnancy and childbirth-related complications reaching more than 1.5 million people to date across the campaign’s website and social media channels."

What does Zuckerberg know that we don't?

According to The Verge nearly 20% of Facebook's (META 0.60%) employees are working exclusively on virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Plus the company has been acquiring small VR studios for years most recently BigBox VR (creator of Population: One the Fortnite of VR) and Unit 2 Games (creator of Craya a Roblox-esque VR gaming platform) for undisclosed sums.

These continuous investments in talent and studio acquisitions may seem steep for a business segment that accounts for less than 3% of Facebook's top line. But Mark Zuckerberg's ambitious vision for VR is powering a shopping spree that likely won't stop anytime soon. Is Facebook ahead of the game or will its Oculus VR venture fail to move the needle?

The future of VR gaming

Zuckerberg has been talking up VR more than usual lately partly thanks to accelerated adoption of the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset (according to Facebook -- but the company does not explicitly report figures for sold VR hardware). The CEO's first major talking point in Facebook's latest earnings report was VR and AR predicting ""augmented and virtual reality to unlock a massive amount of value both in people's lives and the economy overall.""

His excitement about the technology is not unwarranted -- Fortune Business Insights forecasts that the global market for VR gaming will reach $45.2 billion by 2027 (from $5.1 billion in 2019). This translates to a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.8% compared to a CAGR of only 5.3% for the overall gaming console market over the same forecast period.

How Facebook got ahead

Facebook's strategy for VR gaming domination starts with laying a solid foundation of technology and developer talent. In classic Facebook fashion its primary tactic has been acquiring existing VR hardware and software companies.

Since acquiring Oculus VR for $2 billion in 2014 the company has made significant progress in improving its VR hardware to better suit customers' needs. The current Oculus Quest 2 is a stand-alone headset (i.e. no wires to trip on or tangle up while playing) and requires no external device (such as a console or PC). Conversely Sony's (SONY -1.12%) wired PlayStation VR headset requires a PlayStation console. The Quest 2's wireless low-hardware conveniences combined with its lower price point relative to any other major headset on the market give Facebook a competitive edge when it comes to hardware.

But even the best VR headset is useless without great games making Facebook's VR studio acquisitions crucial to building up its VR ecosystem. By acquiring small yet high-performing studios Facebook is securing revenue from already-popular VR games on Oculus and retaining top software developers to create exclusive content within the Oculus platform. Considering the company's standard four-year stock option vesting schedule it's unlikely that developers from studios like BigBox or Unit 2 will jump ship to work for a competitor anytime soon.

Why it'll stay ahead

If you know Facebook's business model you're probably wondering when ads come into play. The company has announced that it will begin testing ads in select games on the Oculus platform but it's still up in the air what exactly the ad experience will look like once testing begins -- and how VR gamers will react.

If the company can manage to integrate ads without breaking the immersive gaming experience it will help developers earn more revenue (thus attracting more developers to the Oculus platform) and could even make games more realistic. For example real ads appearing on in-game TV screens and billboards would not break players' immersion in their gaming world while still driving revenue for developers and Facebook.

Beyond attracting developers for top-tier content Facebook has a unique edge in attracting consumers as well -- its massive social networking user base. No other VR headset can offer such easy accessibility (low price point with no required console purchase) and such a high potential for network effects.

For example it would be much easier for a friend to influence you to purchase a $300 all-in-one VR headset than a PlayStation console and headset which would total more than twice the cost of the Quest 2. Don't get me wrong -- Sony is a leading competitor in the VR gaming space and has shipped the most VR hardware units to date but the company's network effects are arguably limited to existing PlayStation owners (about 15.7 million monthly active users between the PS4 and the PS5).

Facebook's 2.8 billion monthly active users have much more potential to add value to the Oculus platform by sheer volume of players especially when it comes to popular social VR games like Population: One Craya and Beat Saber Multiplayer (developed by yet another Facebook-acquired studio Beat Games). Social gaming experiences are inherently more valuable with more players.

While some VR multiplayer games are cross-platform (i.e. an Oculus player can game with a PS VR player) Facebook will likely tighten up its exclusive content offerings to attract and retain players. As long as the company rolls out ad content in a way that feels relatively organic to Oculus players Facebook is set up for success in rapidly gaining market share in VR gaming.

What to watch for

While Facebook's VR gaming revenue isn't reported explicitly (yet) the company's ""other revenue"" business segment is primarily Oculus. In Facebook's first-quarter 2021 earnings report this segment grew 146% year over year to $732 million implying an impressive growth rate for the company's VR business. Further the Quest 2 has become the most used VR headset on popular gaming platform Steam and by many estimates the Quest 2 is selling at least twice as fast as PlayStation VR despite lagging behind in current overall market share.

Keep an eye on this ""other revenue"" segment in future earnings reports as well as any hard figures reported by the company on VR gaming revenue. More cautious investors may also want to wait for Facebook to complete its in-game ad testing process before investing based on the company's growth potential in VR. It is undoubtedly a risk to user growth if ad content is not executed smoothly.

It's impossible to dive into every point in Facebook's value and growth story in one sitting but the stock seems fairly valued given its growth potential -- FB is even rated ""undervalued"" by Morningstar. The company's wide economic moat in social gaming is unmatched thanks to a massive user base and vast user data and these competitive advantages can easily translate to driving profits and market share for its VR gaming business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L3R1cmtpc2gtcG9saWNlLWZpcmUtdGVhci1nYXMtZGlzcGVyc2UtcHJpZGUtbWFyY2gtaXN0YW5idWwtMjAyMS0wNi0yNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turkish police fire tear gas to disperse Pride march in Istanbul,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkish-police-fire-tear-gas-disperse-pride-march-istanbul-2021-06-26/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L3R1cmtpc2gtcG9saWNlLWZpcmUtdGVhci1nYXMtZGlzcGVyc2UtcHJpZGUtbWFyY2gtaXN0YW5idWwtMjAyMS0wNi0yNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhYmlvbWVkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVWaWV3Lmh0bWw_aWR4bm89MTE0NzfSAUBodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb3JlYWJpb21lZC5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlVmlld0FtcC5odG1sP2lkeG5vPTExNDc3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Special] Metaverse in operating room is changing medicine rapidly,"Metaverse a convergence of virtual and physical space is changing medicine.

Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) built the metaverse platform in a smart operating room.

The word metaverse is made up of the prefix “meta” meaning virtual and “universe” meaning the real world. It is a more advanced concept than the existing virtual reality (VR). The core technology of the metaverse is extended reality (XR) which encompasses VR augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR).

On May 29 the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery (ASCVTS) provided lung cancer surgery training through a metaverse platform at an online conference. The surgery took place at the SNUBH’s smart operating room and over 200 Asian thoracic surgeons received the training in a virtual environment. All the equipment they needed was a head-mounted display (HMD).

Recently the upgraded platform does not even require HMD. Surgeons can see the operating room with a 360-degree camera through a laptop.

Professor Jheon Sang-hoon of the Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Department at the SNUBHl who is president of ASCVTS pushed to install the smart operating room when he was president of the SNUBH.

The smart operating room made it possible for ASCVTS to offer such training.

The hospital completed the smart operating room to produce 4K or 3D video and 8K VR video using 360-degree cameras in 2019.

In the smart operating room surgeons can perform image-guided surgery (IGS) using near-infrared rays and displays that simultaneously support 4K and 3D surgical endoscopes.

They can also share opinions in real-time using a “Tele-Pathology” system.

After experiencing the “reality” of VR realized at the SNUBH’s smart operating room through ASCVTS the Singapore General Hospital decided to apply the system to create a similar operating room.

In other words the SNUBH exported the smart operating room to Singapore.

The SNUBH plans to use the metaverse in local medical training – not only for clinical training for medical school students but for surgical training for interns residents and fellows. As early as the second half of the year the SNU College of Medicine will provide the metaverse clinical training.

In an interview with Korea Biomedical Review Jheon said the metaverse applied to various clinical settings and medical training.

However the nation’s outdated health insurance program is not catching up with rapid healthcare technology changes which could hamper advancement in clinical care he said.

Professor Jheon Sang-hoon of the Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Department at SNUBH speaks during an interview with Korea Biomedical Review.

Question: You provided lung cancer surgery training in the VR realized by the metaverse in the online conference of the ASCVTS. The training was organized by the Automotive Technical Education Program (ATEP) which you established.

Answer: I established the ATEP in 2011 to teach video-assisted thoracic surgery to Asian surgeons. We held workshops once or twice a year mainly for those from developing countries. We rented education centers in Korea or Japan to provide surgical training for two days free of charge in the early days. Forty people in groups of two received surgical training using animals. However this kind of training costs quite a lot.

Q: Did the ATEP change the training method from offline to online due to the Covid-19 pandemic?

A: After I took office as president of ASCVTS in 2019 I started ATEP’s surgical training in the lung field. We introduced VR in surgical training because offline surgical training costs a lot. Then the outbreak of Covid-19 pushed us to offer timely VR education.

Trainees needed only HMD so ATEP purchased 40 sets of HMD and sent them to Vietnam once. In late June we will give one more training session in Moscow.

The technology has advanced compared to the early days. So surgeons can experience the VR 360-degree through a laptop without HMD.

Q: Live broadcasting of the surgical procedure has been around for a long time. What is different about VR training realized by the metaverse?

A: It shows the surgical scene perfectly. Instead of offering one scene unilaterally it can show you everything happening in the operating room if you put on HMD. Trainees can see what anesthesiologists and nurses are doing in more detail than in the operating room. This is possible because of XR technology and it helps trainees to concentrate more.

Q: Is the metaverse used for training for specialists or residents?

A: Residents do not have many chances to operate these days. The thoracic surgery department normally uses animal hearts or lungs to educate specialists but this is also not easy. So we provide surgical training virtually.

Technology has been so advanced that it can even reproduce tactile sensations in virtual environments. We are conducting a pilot study to apply the metaverse to the clinical practice education for students at SNU College of Medicine.

In the second half of this year we plan to apply it to clinical training. Under the MOU between SNU College of Medicine and the National University of Singapore and between SNUH and the Singapore General Hospital the National University of Singapore will use the metaverse in medical education. We are also making VR for intensive care units where clinical training opportunities are scarce.

Q: What other healthcare areas can you use the metaverse except for medical training?

A: There are many. For example patients on chemotherapy play with their mobile phones or read magazines while getting the injection. But their minds will be somewhere else because they are anxious. So we’re preparing a trial to realize a virtual environment where cancer patients can receive chemotherapy comfortably. During a trial clinicians will identify and solve problems and find a good technology while doing so.

Q: Some said the medical community’s opposition to telemedicine could hamper Korea’s technology advancement. What do you think?

A: Providing education in a virtual environment through VR or XR technology is one thing and telehealth is another. But we need to introduce telemedicine. So we have to discuss sufficiently what merits telemedicine could bring and what the potential risks are. We can’t oppose it indefinitely.

The medical community and the government and citizens should make efforts to solve problems one by one. If you think doctors oppose telemedicine to keep their vested interests there will be more misunderstandings. The times are changing.

Q: Are there any institutional areas that need to be improved?

A: The government says it will ease regulations but it makes another regulation to do so. When it comes to national health insurance it’s more frustrating. Rather than deciding on something and announcing it first the government should listen to what clinicians have to say. If the government says doctors oppose telemedicine “to keep vested interests of doctors’ group” the damage will be inflicted on the public. It is the same with the controversy of installing mandatory CCTV surveillance cameras in operating rooms.

In Korea medical care is viewed as a public good. So the government controls reimbursement rates. If doctors provide new technology for patients the government should guarantee it with the health insurance program. There should be a method to introduce new technology into the existing system so that medical institutions can use it more actively. Otherwise medical institutions would find it hard to invest in developing new technology and applying it to clinical care. National university hospitals may do so out of commitment but other private hospitals may not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pd21idXp6LmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsL2NlbGVicml0aWVzLWRpZ2l0YWwvYXNoaXNoLWNoYW5jaGxhbmlzLWluc3RhZ3JhbS1pcy1xdWl0ZS1hLXRyZWF0LWZvci1hLWJhZC1kYXkteWF5LW9yLW5heS8yMDIxLzA2LzI30gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml3bWJ1enouY29tL2RpZ2l0YWwvY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMtZGlnaXRhbC9hc2hpc2gtY2hhbmNobGFuaXMtaW5zdGFncmFtLWlzLXF1aXRlLWEtdHJlYXQtZm9yLWEtYmFkLWRheS15YXktb3ItbmF5LzIwMjEvMDYvMjcvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ashish Chanchlani’s Instagram Is Quite A Treat For A Bad Day: Yay Or Nay?,"Ashish Chanchlani’s Instagram Is Quite A Treat For A Bad Day: Yay Or Nay?

He said the latest data available on the afrobarometer score cards that tracks the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demonstrated an improved 33 per cent access to toilet in the country.

“The latest data showed a 12 per cent increase from 2017 to May 2021 on open defaecation a testament that some gains are being made in that sector.”

The Deputy Director made these statements at the second Graphic-Zoomlion Sanitation Awareness Campaign dubbed “Keep Ghana Clean” in Ho.

He said the Sector was mandated to set policy direction on environmental sanitation which led to ceding 80 per cent of participation by the private sector.

He said the negative impact of sanitation on the economy medicals and the environment cost the country some $290 Million annually for negligence on the sector amounting to 1.6 per cent of the gross domestic product computation.

Mr Quansah said there was need to change attitudes subscribe to Zoomlion waste bins and build infrastructure to contain the 17000 tons of solid waste generated daily in the country half of which were treated.

Professor John Owusu Gyapong Vice-Chancellor of the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) observed that the serene and clean environment that heralded the entry into Ho some years ago had begun to deteriorate and appealed to stakeholders to step up environmental issues in the Municipality.

He said there was close inter-relationship between sanitation and health and data showed that every $1 investment into the sector yielded six positive economic and health outcomes drawing an inseparable link between water and sanitation.

He said UHAS and the Ho Technical University could collaborate to design local lasting solutions as part of a GHC 5 million grant available for tertiary institutions to find acceptable strategies for maintaining clean environmental sanitation.

Togbe Tepre Hodo IV the President of the Volta Region House of Chiefs said traditional authorities were well-placed to inculcate the sense of hygiene and environmental sanitation in children as chiefdom is still wielded powers to undertake social issues.

He said chiefs were empowered to sanction subjects who failed to heed communal activity according to the Chieftaincy ACT and this could be explored to instill attitudinal changes that would turn a positive consciousness towards the environment.

Mr Ato Afful Managing Director Graphic Communication Group said the partnership seeks to impact on the wellness of the country and export the commendable lessons on environmental sanitation cleanliness from Ho to the rest of the country.

He said it was important to pay attention to sustainable environmental sanitation and believing that Clean Ghana was achievable.

He said “Clean cities must be safe liveable and green” saying Ho is what it takes to become a clean city.

He said spatial planning was key for human and vehicular movements but siting of illegal structures signages and littering degraded the environment and a reward scheme was fashioned out to honour a clean city and region at the end of the exercise.

Dr Archibald Letsa Volta Regional Minister said the regional Coordinating Council would support the partnership stating keeping Ghana Clean must start from the home setting.

He urged the media to lead the crusade and name and shame culprits who denigrated the environment to serve as deterrence and urged MMDAs to refocus on developing by-laws making sure they were well-crafted gazetted and enforced.

Mr Adams Mahama Senior Communication Officer of Zoomlion said government and the private player collaboration was key for environmental sanitation and the distribution of the one-million chip-embedded bins had started urging the MMDAs to subscribe for guaranteed waste collection."

MGM Resorts International will flip on the switch Monday to a 100-megawatt solar array that will power 13 Strip properties and 36000 hotel rooms.

The power-up plan will provide a long stride toward the company’s energy sustainability goals.

The Mega Solar Array project was developed in partnership with Invenergy — a privately held developer and operator of sustainable energy projects — and structured through a 20-year power purchase agreement.

In early 2021 Invenergy sold a 75 percent interest in the MGM Resorts Mega Solar Array to AEP Renewables a subsidiary of American Electric Power one of the nation’s largest electric companies. Invenergy Services a subsidiary of Invenergy will provide operations and maintenance and balance-of-plant services under a long-term agreement.

The array is the largest maintained by a resort company and is expected to provide 90 percent of MGM’s daylight power needs.

“With MGM Resorts’ significant scale and resources we’re positioned to make a meaningful difference in the fight against climate change and we recognize our responsibility to build a more environmentally sustainable future” said Bill Hornbuckle CEO and president of MGM Resorts. “Today we’re marking a significant step forward in our environmental sustainability initiatives in Las Vegas and our long-term vision to protect the planet and achieve an enduring positive impact in our communities worldwide.”

MGM’s Mega Solar Array is located on 640 acres in the desert north of Las Vegas. It has 323000 solar panels and provides the equivalent of power used by 27000 homes. Among the resorts that will benefit from the power grid are Bellagio Aria Mandalay Bay MGM Grand and The Mirage.

Several dignitaries and MGM executives will attend the launch of the use of the array.

In attendance will be Gov. Steve Sisolak Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen D-Nev. Michael Polsky founder and CEO of Invenergy and Greg Hall executive vice president of AEP Energy Supply.

From MGM will be Jyoti Chopra chief people inclusion and sustainability officer Rose McKinney James chair of the MGM board of directors sustainability committee and Hornbuckle.

When Resorts World Las Vegas opens to guests and gamblers late Thursday card players will bet with house chips implanted with sensors at tables that take cashless transactions and track every bet split double-down and side wager.

""It's all RFID"" casino operations chief Rick Hutchins said referring to radio-frequency identification technology built into the first new Las Vegas resort to open since 2010. ""The table knows exactly what I'm betting.""

Cashless technology was retrofitted in recent years at existing properties. It was made part of Resorts World from the start executives told reporters during a preview tour Tuesday.

Doors of the $4.3 billion resort open to the public at 11 p.m.

""We're really excited"" property President Scott Sibella said. ""It's been a decade since a property like this has opened. We kind of broke the mold.""

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas debuted in 2010. Among other major Strip resorts The Bellagio opened in 1998 Wynn Las Vegas in 2005 and Wynn's Encore tower in 2008. MGM Resorts' multi-resort City Center complex opened in 2009 at an overall cost of $1.6 billion.

Resorts World is expected to boost a tourism-dependent local economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic but rebounding since closures imposed in March 2020 were lifted and travel restrictions eased.

Customers who are vaccinated against COVID-19 do not have to wear masks according to local and state regulations. Employees at many businesses still do.

""Resorts World is certainly a contributing factor to the expectation for improved economic conditions during the second half of 2021"" said Jeremy Aguero principal at Las Vegas-based Applied Analysis.

""Historically the opening of new large-scale resorts has tended to grow the tourism sector and the Las Vegas economy"" Aguero said. ""Visitors staying at Resorts World will benefit the entire market and Resorts World will undoubtedly benefit from visitors staying in the region's 146000 existing hotel rooms that will want to experience all the new property has to offer.""

At a blackjack table Hutchins said players still can use cash. But those with member rewards accounts and wireless wallets will be able to scan their phones with the dealer instead of visiting casino cages.

""I have $25 on the spot the RFID chip knows that and the (table) antenna underneath it. And if I bet these side bets it also knows that as well"" Hutchins explained. ""I can cash out at the table I can walk with my chips I can get a (paper ticket-in ticket-out voucher) here or I can put it back on my (cellphone) wallet.""

Slot machine players who have the app also can scan cellphone QR codes to play.

A player's stake will be spendable throughout the resort — except sports wagering which is handled under a different regulatory process by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The immense high-ceiling main gambling floor is longer than two football fields and honeycombed with slot machines. It's the gambling centerpiece.

Marbled halls lead to separate registration entries for three Hilton-branded hotels. They total 3506 rooms in two curved red-colored towers.

A hall leading to self-parking displays some of collector Michael Fux's whimsically colored Rolls Royce sedans.

A Sky Casino salon is on the top 66th floor. A nearly ground-to-roof LED facade faces the Las Vegas Strip.

Parts of the complex are still under construction including developer Elon Musk's underground Tesla vehicle transit system that will connect with the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center.

For now the daytime view beyond the resort's infinity pool is of tractors and trucks and landscape grading operations. At night the view will be the lights of the Strip.

Malaysia-based Genting Group an operator of resorts and casinos around the world bought the big 88-acre (35.6-hectare) property in 2013 from Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming for $350 million. Construction began in May 2015.

The site used to be the Stardust an iconic Las Vegas landmark that opened in 1958 as the largest hotel in the world at 1500 rooms. Its 32-story tower was imploded in 2007.

The Stardust's smoky mirror-walled casino was a playpen for ""Rat Pack"" members including Frank Sinatra. Its showroom hosted comedians Don Rickles Tim Conway and Phyllis Diller; groups like The Temptations and Four Tops; and the duo Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. Wayne Newton was the resident headliner at the 920-seat Stardust Theater before the casino closed in 2006.

Celine Dion will open the new 4700-seat Theatre at Resorts World still under construction on Nov. 5 said John Nelson senior vice president of AEG Presents the venue manager. Residencies by Carrie Underwood Katy Perry and Luke Bryan will follow.

DJs including Zedd and Tiësto will headline at the 2000-capacity Zouk Nightclub and the outdoor AYU Dayclub.

At the hotels amenities increase from the 1774-room Las Vegas Hilton at Resorts World to the 1496-room Conrad Las Vegas and the exclusive 236-suite Crockfords where general manager Whitney Mulaj noted its tie to the luxury LXR Hotels brand.

Each hotel has a separate lobby.

""We're using completely ticketless technology"" said Prescott Yee front office director for Resorts World. When guests arrive at valet parking they will receive a digital QR code letting them bypass registration and go straight to their room.

""No more tickets. No more paper"" Yee said. ""That is the essence throughout the entire guest experience.""

The design shows the rising importance of room rentals conference space entertainment dining and shopping to a tourism destination where Aguero said non-gambling revenues in fiscal 2019-2020 accounted for more than 70% of revenue. Twenty years ago gambling accounted for 60% of revenues.

Hutchins at the blackjack table said everything a guest does will be bundled into the Resorts World mobile app. Wireless connectivity and a customer's cellphone also eliminate the need for a physical member rewards card he said.

""The things that you do within the property we're going to be able to recognize you reward you for that or incentivize you"" the casino operations chief said.

""If you ate at the steakhouse maybe you want a dessert at Wally's later"" Hutchins said referring to one of the resort's nearly 40 restaurants and eateries. ""We'll be able to serve up a badge digitally that says. 'Hey try a dessert on us.'""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmRzY2hhdC5jb20vbmV3cy9taWNoaWdhbi13b21hbi1zdWVzLWJldG1nbS1mb3ItMy0yLW1pbGxpb24taW4tb25saW5lLWdhbWJsaW5nLXdpbm5pbmdzLTEwMTc1Ny_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan Woman Sues BetMGM For $3.2 Million in Online Gambling Winnings,"A Michigan woman has filed a lawsuit against BetMGM alleging the site is refusing to allow her to cash out the vast majority of more than $3.2 million she won while playing online casino games on the state-regulated site. Jacqueline Davis 36 of Detroit claims that BetMGM has refused to allow her to withdraw most of her winnings alleging a glitch occurred in one of the games that she played.

Davis successfully withdrew $100000 of her winnings at the end of March when she visited MGM Grand Detroit in person after playing the site’s “Luck o’ the Irish” game for five straight days in March. However Davis then discovered that her account which still contained roughly $3.18 million had been frozen. According to a copy of the complaint obtained by PlayMichigan BetMGM allegedly contacted her in April asserting that the game had malfunctioned and that her earlier winnings were null and void.

Davis ran $50 deposit to more than $11 million

According to Fox 2 Detroit which broke the story of Davis’s dispute with BetMGM she deposited $50 on March 18 and her first wager on the St. Patrick’s Day-themed game was for $4.50. She repeatedly increased her wager after logging numerous large wins and was soon wagering $5000 per bet the maximum allowed in the game.

Davis was up to more than $11 million at her highest point but stopped after dropping to a little above $3.2 million. During the five days that she played the game she gambled around-the-clock. “Who sleeps when they’re winning money?” she reportedly asked a Fox 2 Detroit writer.

MGM Grand paid Davis her initial $100000 withdrawal request then later notified her that she wouldn’t receive the majority of her winnings. That led to her retaining a lawyer who stated that BetMGM offered Davis a one-sided settlement: She could keep the $100000 but only if she signed a confidentiality agreement about the supposed glitch that occurred.

Civil complaint offers extra details

The 57-page complaint originally obtained by PlayMichigan sheds more light on the conflict. Davis’s lawsuit alleges that BetMGM violated its own user agreement and accuses BetMGM of fraud conversion and breach of contract. Davis’s attorney David S. Steingold filed the lawsuit on June 9 in Wayne County Circuit Court.

The lawsuit also details additional contacts between Davis and BetMGM that occurred between her initial win and $100000 withdrawal in late March and her filing of the $3.2 million lawsuit in June. The complaint asserts that a BetMGM representative contacted her through the online app and congratulated her on her big win. The complaint also asserts that in addition to the “keep the $100000 but sign a confidentiality agreement” demand BetMGM later made a marginally better offer in which she could keep the $100000 and would receive either $23000 in cash or $75000 in gaming credits. Davis declined that offer as well.

The lawsuit which asks for a jury trial offers some interesting questions. Michigan gaming laws allow for gambling transactions that contain malfunctions to be declared null and void. However Davis and her attorney will argue that BetMGM’s payout of the initial $100000 which occurred at leas five days after Davis’s initial wagers signify that the the site and company had accepted the results of her wagers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXNpbm9zLWdhbWluZy9iZWZvcmUtcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1jb3Ntb3BvbGl0YW4td2FzLWxhc3QtbmV3LWhvdGVsLW9uLXRoZS1zdHJpcC0yMzg4NDI1L9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXNpbm9zLWdhbWluZy9iZWZvcmUtcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1jb3Ntb3BvbGl0YW4td2FzLWxhc3QtbmV3LWhvdGVsLW9uLXRoZS1zdHJpcC0yMzg4NDI1L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Before Resorts World Cosmopolitan was last new hotel on the Strip,"The market for new casinos in the famed resort corridor was shaky long before the pandemic hit.

With Las Vegas’ real estate market roaring New York developer Ian Bruce Eichner held a ceremonial groundbreaking in 2005 for a towering resort on the Strip: The Cosmopolitan.

A midmorning thunderstorm didn’t stop him from holding the event either.

“About six people in the last two minutes told me a little rain brings good luck” Eichner said at the time.

Three years later with the economy spiraling downward and the real estate market cratering its lender foreclosed on the partially built resort. It finished construction opened the multibillion-dollar project in late 2010 during the worst recession in decades and after the resort lost plenty of money sold it at a steep discount.

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was the last newly built hotel-casino to debut on the Strip until Thursday when the $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas opened to huge crowds. The market for new casinos in the famed resort corridor was shaky long before the pandemic devastated tourism last year and like countless other projects around the valley The Cosmopolitan got started during the frenzied real estate bubble and later ran into steep financial problems.

Eichner 76 told the Review-Journal in a recent interview that people have often said real estate is all about “location location location.”

He offered another description: “It’s timing timing timing.”

Mixed results

Before the pandemic shut off much of the economy last year Las Vegas had spent about a decade crawling back from the Great Recession. The construction industry — which was all but wiped out after the easy-money-fueled boom of the mid-2000s screeched to a halt — mounted a comeback as developers put up housing tracts apartment complexes and other projects.

Along the Strip investors have developed retail projects and bought malls casinos and land over the past several years but resort construction has seen mixed results.

Resorts World was initially supposed to debut in 2016 but its expected opening kept getting pushed back as the project showed little progress for a while after developer Genting Group bought the site in 2013. Other plans for new supersized resorts on Las Vegas Boulevard have since come and gone or stalled.

Las Vegas real estate broker Michael Parks a hotel-casino specialist with CBRE Group noted that megaresorts on the Strip cost billions of dollars to build and that major financial backers have been “hesitant to invest in Las Vegas” for such projects coming out of the Great Recession.

“The costs of these projects have grown exponentially” Parks said.

Southern Nevada has a long history of developers pitching big plans and never following through and one of multiple ideas on the Strip to go nowhere in recent years was Alon Las Vegas.

Parks said that Alon a proposed 1100-room hotel-casino on the former New Frontier site would have been a great project. But Australian billionaire James Packer who was behind the plans reportedly had trouble raising project funds.

The resort was never built and the land went up for up sale in 2017. As Parks described it capital markets “didn’t cooperate” with the project.

The site purchased by casino operator Wynn Resorts remains empty.

‘They lost billions’

Resorts along the Strip sit on huge parcels of land — Bellagio sits on 75 acres and MGM Grand is on more than 100 — but Eichner and partners bought a vastly smaller plot for The Cosmopolitan in 2004 at about 8.5 acres.

Eichner founder of the Continuum Co. boasts of a portfolio of high-rises and said recently that the size of The Cosmopolitan’s site is like “half the city” in New York. It also meant that in Las Vegas “in a world of horizontal projects” he went vertical.

He set out to build a hotel-condo project with around 3000 rooms spread among two 50-story towers county records show. Eichner announced in early 2006 that Deutsche Bank had loaned $415 million for the project and in spring 2007 project officials held a traditional Japanese blessing and sake ceremony to mark the first piece of structural steel going up according to news reports.

But soon enough the economy started to stumble. Deutsche Bank issued a default notice in March 2008 and foreclosed on the partially built project later that year records show.

Eichner said that the German financial giant had put $1 billion into the project and bought him out for “a lot of money.” He also stated that he did not take a loss on the project.

“I personally did not lose any money” Eichner said. “The bank did; they lost billions.”

Deutsche Bank declined to comment for this story.

Discounted deal

The economy only worsened after the foreclosure and as The Wall Street Journal previously reported Deutsche Bank was unable to find new partners or investors and decided to finish The Cosmopolitan itself.

Its opening on Dec. 15 2010 drew big crowds and featured a three-song set from The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers followed a few weeks later by New Year’s Eve performances from Coldplay and Jay-Z.

The resort became known as a trendy spot with its lavish Chandelier Bar and its Marquee dayclub and nightclub. But overall the business was deep in the red.

The Cosmopolitan lost $97 million in 2011 $106.6 million in 2012 and $94.8 million in 2013 a securities filing shows.

Enter The Blackstone Group. After the economy crashed and property values plunged the New York financial giant bought real estate across hard-hit Southern Nevada including in 2014 The Cosmopolitan.

It acquired the resort for $1.73 billion — a huge sum by any measure but less than half of the project’s development cost which according to Blackstone exceeded $4 billion.

$500M in upgrades

Tyler Henritze head of real estate acquisitions for the Americas at Blackstone said in a statement to the Review-Journal that the company “had been tracking The Cosmopolitan for years prior to the acquisition” and was drawn by its quality brand and location “on the centerline” of the Strip.

He also said Blackstone has spent around $500 million in improvements including building 21 penthouse suites on four unfinished floors and full renovations of The Cosmopolitan’s guest rooms.

Patrick Nichols general manager and chief strategy officer at The Cosmopolitan told the Review-Journal that Blackstone’s five-year plan for the property totaled more than 200 pages.

Among other things several new food and beverage concepts were brought in and the casino was spruced up with new lightning carpeting and high-limit gambling areas he said.

Eichner said that he views The Cosmopolitan as a body of work and that he can’t get upset about it.

If the idea had been terrible or the project had never been finished he said there would be a certain amount of regret. But more than a decade later the resort is bustling with guests.

“There’s nobody that doesn’t know The Cosmopolitan” he said.

Fixing the Boro is hosting a Pet Microchipping event this weekend at their facility on East Inman in Statesboro. The event began on Friday and ends on Sunday June 27.

The 4th of July weekend is fast approaching and we all know what that means!

While humans are enjoying the fireworks and festivities our pets are not sure what to think.

Because of this more dogs go missing on 4th of July weekend than ANY OTHER TIME OF YEAR.

Now is the time to start preparing for the 4th!

1. Double check your back yard for escape routes. Fill in any holes and check your fences. When loud firework begin dogs can get scared and might try to escape in search of safety.

2. Make sure your pet is microchipped and that the microchip is registered! If your pet is not microchipped swing Fixing the Boro clinic Sunday June 27 from 10AM-3PM for a $25 microchip! Fixing the Boro is located at 915 E Inman Street Statesboro GA 30458.

Make sure your dog is wearing a collar with up-to-date ID tags that include your current phone number.

4. Turn on your radio or TV to distract your pet from the fireworks.

And finally enjoy your holiday with your pet!

Make sure that you set aside a little extra time to give your pet some snuggles!

Advantages of Pet Microchipping

The unthinkable happened. You thought you closed the back gate but it didn’t latch all the way and now Fido has gotten out of the backyard. While most pets will have on a collar that has all your important information on it there is a possibility that it can fall off and then how will anyone know who Fido belongs to? This is where the microchipping technology can come in and save the day.

What is microchipping?

According to the Petmate website a microchip is a small electronic chip that contains a unique preprogrammed number that is used to identify your pet. The chip is implanted just under the skin of your furry friend without the need of anesthesia.

The microchip contains a registration number for the specific registry of the chip. A scanner will read the chip and display the number to contact the specific registry of the microchip to give the information that is registered for your pet.

What are the benefits of microchipping?

1. When a lost pet is found and taken to either a vet or shelter the first things they will do is scan the animal for a microchip. Once the chip is located and scanned they can search the microchip registry to quickly locate the owner of the animal saving time for both you and the rescuer.

2. The microchip technology is designed to last your pet’s lifespan so there is no need to replace after a certain amount of time.

3. The implanting of the microchip is done right at your vet’s or clinic's office for your convenience. The process is similar to giving your animal a vaccine so it does not harm your pet.

4. Since the microchip is inserted into your pet there is not a chance of the chip becoming lost so your furry friend will always have a form of identification with them.

5. If your pet was adopted from a rescue shelter there is a high possibility that they were already microchipped.

6. Pets with microchips are more likely to be returned to their owners. A study has found that Dogs with microchips will be returned 52.2% of the time while dogs without will be returned 21.9% of the time and Cats with microchips were returned 38.5% of the time while without the microchip only 1.8% of the time.

While the microchipping technology is incredible your pet should always wear a collar with tags on them. After your pet has been microchipped you need to make sure that it is registered with the correct company and that the information up-to-date so in case of an emergency your pet can be returned to you. August 15th is also known as “Check the Chip Day” as a reminder for pet parents to update the registry information and to ensure the chip is in working condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When PCWorld asked which Surface devices would be eligible for Windows 11 a Microsoft representative responded via email with the names of just five legacy devices as well as the most modern revisions of each of Microsoft’s Surface lineup. To date Microsoft has shipped twenty-five different Surface models excluding the Surface Duo.

Microsoft didn’t comment on why it was excluding many of its Surface devices from Windows 11 but the reason most likely corresponds with the minimum Windows 11 hardware requirements listed earlier today and possibly the need for a TPM 2.0 coprocessor.

Of the 25 Surface device families that Microsoft has shipped to date only 13 will be eligible for Windows 11. Most of Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets won’t be eligible for an upgrade. Microsoft didn’t list the Surface Hub or Surface Studio among those eligible for an upgrade either. Simply put if you own a Surface device that was shipped before 2017 chances are that your device won’t be eligible for the Windows 11 upgrade.

“The following devices meet the minimum hardware requirements to test Windows 11 by joining the Windows Insider Program” the Microsoft representative said in a statement. Customers can use the PC Health Check app to see if their device meets the minimum system requirements she added.

The Surfaces that can upgrade to Windows 11

According to Microsoft the Surface devices that are eligible to upgrade to Windows 11 include the following list. We’ve added each device’s release date in parentheses.

Surface Book 3 (May 2020)

Surface Book 2: only the models with 8th-gen Intel CPUs (Core i5-8350U or Core i7-8650U not the Core i5-7300U) (Nov. 2017)

Surface Go 2 (May 2020)

Surface Laptop 4 13.5” (Apr. 2021)

Surface Laptop 4 15” (Apr. 2021)

Surface Laptop 3 13.5” (Oct. 2019)

Surface Laptop 3 15” (Oct. 2019)

Surface Laptop 2 (Oct. 2018)

Surface Laptop Go (Oct. 2020)

Surface Pro 7+ (Feb. 2021)

Surface Pro 7 (Oct. 2019)

Surface Pro 6 (Oct. 2018)

Surface Pro X (Nov. 2019)

Separately PCWorld has begun testing our Surface devices on hand to see whether they conform to the Windows 11 requirements.

Gordon Mah Ung / IDG PCWorld’s Surface Pro 3 unit failed the Windows 11 compatibility test.

Gordon Mah Ung tested the Surface Pro 3 the device that put the Surface Pro lineup on the map and found that it did not pass Microsoft’s compatibility checker.

While Microsoft has implied that you’ll want to upgrade to Windows 11 with these cool unexpected Windows 11 features it’s also implied that you’ll have plenty of time to keep working on Windows 10 if you’d like. Windows 10 will go out of support and into “retirement” in 2025. Still for a PC industry that thrives on supporting legacy devices it’s disappointing—especially if you’ve invested in a premium Surface device and hoped to get some more mileage out of it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL25ld3MvcHJpdmFjeS9oYWNrZXJzLWhpdC1taWNyb3NvZnQtY3VzdG9tZXItc2VydmljZS1zeXN0ZW0tbWFrZS1vZmYtd2l0aC1kYXRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hackers hit Microsoft customer service system make off with data,"Microsoft said Friday that hackers breached a computer used by one of its customer service agents and stole account data they then used to launch ""highly targeted"" attacks on customers. The company identified the hacking group as Nobelium the same one behind last year's major SolarWinds breach.

Microsoft has secured the computer which the hackers infected with information-stealing software and notified the ""small number"" of affected customers it said in a Friday post on its Security Response Center site.

The company sent a warning to affected Microsoft Services subscribers saying the hackers had access to information during the second half of May Reuters reported late Friday. The pilfered data included billing contact information and what services the customers pay for the news outlet said. Hackers can use such basic data in bogus emails and phone calls as part of phishing attacks that can help them gain access to more-sensitive information.

Microsoft warned the impacted customers to exercise caution regarding communications with billing contacts and suggested changing related passwords and usernames Reuters reported. The company also urged customers to be sure to use multi-factor authentication to protect against hacks. Microsoft's investigation of the breach is ongoing and it hasn't yet found that any customers were successfully compromised.

The tech giant said it discovered the breach while looking into new activity by the Nobelium group. It said just over half that activity was aimed at information-technology companies followed by government agencies and then a small percentage of nongovernmental agencies think tanks and financial services firms.

The SolarWinds hacking campaign made headlines in December 2020. It used tainted software from IT management company SolarWinds along with other hacking methods to breach thousands of organizations and tunnel deeper into at least nine federal agencies and 100 private companies Microsoft among them.

Microsoft had no further comment on the customer service breach apart from its blog post.

This driver called ""Netfilter"" is in fact a rootkit that was observed communicating with Chinese command-and-control (C2) IPs.

G Data malware analyst Karsten Hahn first took notice of this event last week and was joined by the wider infosec. community in tracing and analyzing the malicious drivers bearing the seal of Microsoft.

This incident has once again exposed threats to software supply-chain security except this time it stemmed from a weakness in Microsoft's code-signing process.

""Netfilter"" driver is rootkit signed by Microsoft

Last week G Data's cybersecurity alert systems flagged what appeared to be a false positive but was not—a Microsoft signed driver called ""Netfilter.""

The driver in question was seen communicating with China-based C&C IPs providing no legitimate functionality and as such raised suspicions.

This is when G Data's malware analyst Karsten Hahn shared this publicly and simultaneously contacted Microsoft:

The malicious binary has been signed by Microsoft (VirusTotal)

""Since Windows Vista any code that runs in kernel mode is required to be tested and signed before public release to ensure stability for the operating system.""

""Drivers without a Microsoft certificate cannot be installed by default"" states Hahn.

At the time BleepingComputer began observing the behavior of C2 URLs and also contacted Microsoft for a statement.

The first C2 URL returns a set of more routes (URLs) separated by the pipe (""|"") symbol:

Navigating to the C2 URL presents more routes for different purposes

Source: BleepingComputer

Each of these serves a purpose according to Hahn:

The URL ending in ""/p"" is associated with proxy settings

""/s"" provides encoded redirection IPs

""/h?"" is for receiving CPU-ID

""/c"" provided a root certificate and

""/v?"" is related to the malware's self-update functionality.

As seen by BleepingComputer for example the ""/v?"" path provided URL to the malicious Netfilter driver in question itself (living at ""/d3""):

Path to malicious Netfilter driver

Source: BleepingComputer

The G Data researcher spent some time sufficiently analyzing the driver and concluded it to be malware.

The researcher has analyzed the driver its self-update functionality and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in a detailed blog post.

""The sample has a self-update routine that sends its own MD5 hash to the server via hxxp://110.42.4.180:2081/v?v=6&m="" says Hahn.

An example request would look like this:

hxxp://110.42.4.180:2081/v?v=6&m=921fa8a5442e9bf3fe727e770cded4ab

""The server then responds with the URL for the latest sample e.g. hxxp://110.42.4.180:2081/d6 or with 'OK' if the sample is up-to-date. The malware replaces its own file accordingly"" further explained the researcher.

Malware's self-update functionality analyzed by G Data

During the course of his analysis Hahn was joined by other malware researchers including Johann Aydinbas Takahiro Haruyama and Florian Roth.

Roth was able to gather the list of samples in a spreadsheet and has provided YARA rules for detecting these in your network environments.

Notably the C2 IP 110.42.4.180 that the malicious Netfilter driver connects to belonged to Ningbo Zhuo Zhi Innovation Network Technology Co. Ltd according to WHOIS records:

WHOIS search for the IP address (BleepingComputer)

Microsoft admits to signing the malicious driver

Microsoft is actively investigating this incident although thus far there is no evidence that stolen code-signing certificates were used.

The mishap seems to have resulted from the threat actor following Microsoft's process to submit the malicious Netfilter drivers and managing to acquire the Microsoft-signed binary in a legitimate manner:

""Microsoft is investigating a malicious actor distributing malicious drivers within gaming environments.""

""The actor submitted drivers for certification through the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program. The drivers were built by a third party.""

""We have suspended the account and reviewed their submissions for additional signs of malware"" said Microsoft yesterday.

According to Microsoft the threat actor has mainly targeted the gaming sector specifically in China with these malicious drivers and there is no indication of enterprise environments having been affected so far.

Microsoft has refrained from attributing this incident to nation-state actors just yet.

Falsely signed binaries can be abused by sophisticated threat actors to facilitate large-scale software supply-chain attacks.

The multifaceted Stuxnet attack that targeted Iran's nuclear program marks a well-known incident in which code-signing certificates were stolen from Realtek and JMicron to facilitate the attack.

This particular incident however has exposed weaknesses in a legitimate code-signing process exploited by threat actors to acquire Microsoft-signed code without compromising any certificates.

The hacking group also compromised three entities using password-spraying and brute-force techniques which gain unauthorized access to accounts by bombarding login servers with large numbers of login guesses. With the exception of the three undisclosed entities Microsoft said the password-spraying campaign was “mostly unsuccessful.” Microsoft has since notified all targets whether attacks were successful or not.

Enter Nobelium

The discoveries came in Microsoft’s continued investigation into Nobelium Microsoft’s name for the sophisticated hacking group that used SolarWinds software updates and other means to compromise networks belonging to nine US agencies and 100 private companies. The federal government has said Nobelium is part of the Russian government’s Federal Security Service.

“As part of our investigation into this ongoing activity we also detected information-stealing malware on a machine belonging to one of our customer support agents with access to basic account information for a small number of our customers” Microsoft said in a post. “The actor used this information in some cases to launch highly targeted attacks as part of their broader campaign.”

According to Reuters Microsoft published the breach disclosure after one of the news outlet’s reporters asked the company about the notification it sent to targeted or hacked customers. Microsoft didn’t reveal the infection of the worker’s computer until the fourth paragraph of the five-paragraph post.

The infected agent Reuters said could access billing contact information and the services the customers paid for among other things. “Microsoft warned affected customers to be careful about communications to their billing contacts and consider changing those usernames and email addresses as well as barring old usernames from logging in” the news service reported.

The supply chain attack on SolarWinds came to light in December. After hacking the Austin Texas-based company and taking control of its software-build system Nobelium pushed malicious updates to about 18000 SolarWinds customers.

""The latest cyberattack reported by Microsoft does not involve our company or our customers in any way"" a SolarWinds representative said in an email.

A wide assortment of targets

The SolarWinds supply chain attack wasn’t the only way Nobelium compromised its targets. Anti-malware provider Malwarebytes has said it was also infected by Nobelium but through a different vector which the company didn’t identify.

Both Microsoft and email management provider Mimecast have also said that they too were hacked by Nobelium which then went on to use the compromises to hack the companies’ customers or partners.

Microsoft said that the password-spraying activity targeted specific customers with 57 percent of them IT companies 20 percent government organizations and the rest nongovernmental organizations think tanks and financial services. About 45 percent of the activity focused on US interests 10 percent targeted UK customers and smaller numbers were in Germany and Canada. In all customers in 36 countries were targeted.

Reuters citing a Microsoft spokesman said that the breach disclosed Friday wasn’t part of Nobelium's previous successful attack on Microsoft. The company has yet to provide key details including how long the agent’s computer was compromised and whether the compromise hit a Microsoft-managed machine on a Microsoft network or a contractor device on a home network.

Friday’s disclosure came as a shock to many security analysts.

“I mean Jesus if Microsoft can’t keep their own kit clear of viruses how is the rest of the corporate world supposed to?” Kenn White independent security researcher told me. “You would have thought that customer-facing systems would be some of the most hardened around.”"

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday added a warning to patient and provider fact sheets for the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines to indicate a rare risk of heart inflammation.

For each vaccine the fact sheets were revised to include a warning about myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose and with the onset of symptoms within a few days after receiving the shot.

Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is the inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart. Health officials said the benefits of receiving the vaccine still outweigh any risk.

DW takes a closer look.

In a measure of its ambitious efforts to be vaccine self-reliant Cuba has named one of its homegrown jabs Abdala after a famous dramatic verse by independence hero and national icon Jose Marti. In the verse the young hero Abdala heads to war to defend his fatherland full of patriotic fervor no matter how strong and powerful the enemy.

From the perspective of many Cubans it's the perfect name for the first COVID-19 vaccine to be developed in Latin America. And the perfect imagery for the story of a tiny island of 11 million inhabitants eager to show it can't be broken by a deadly virus and a 60-year economic blockade by the United States and a country that boasts several brilliant scientists of its own.

Cuba's new scientist star

One of them is Gerardo Enrique Guillen Nieto director of biomedical research at the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB) in Havana where Abdala was developed.

Last Sunday on Father's Day Cuban television ran a commercial featuring the 58-year-old Guillen Nieto. Accompanied by melodramatic music it opened with the scientist in his clinic while his son talked off camera about how his father works tirelessly for his family and the people.

Guillen Nieto said he gathered researchers from all fields to develop the vaccines Image: Televisión Cubana.

""We have worked full time since the beginning of the pandemic every Saturday every Sunday from early in the morning until late at night without even a moment's rest"" the highly respected scientist said in the clip. ""And we are very euphoric because the results have exceeded all our expectations. We knew the vaccine was very good but not even I expected such a result.""

Charting its own course

According to the state-run biotech corporation BioCubaFarma Abdala has proven about 92.28% effective against COVID-19 in clinical trials which would put it the same league as the most effective vaccines BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna. Huge applause erupted in the auditorium of the CIGB this week when the impressive results were announced.

Since then Guillen Nieto has been inundated with interview requests. The whole world wants to know Abdala's formula for success. The Cuban vaccine is neither a vector vaccine nor does it work with mRNA technology. Instead it's a so-called protein vaccine. That means it carries a portion of the spike protein that the virus uses to bind to human cells. It docks onto the receptors of the virus' own spike protein thus triggering an immune reaction. The scientists are using yeast as a receptor-binding domain.

The government vaccination program was rolled out in mid-May with Abdala and the second homegrown vaccine Soberana 2 even before the completion of the third phase of clinical trials. These are the first vaccines on the island since Cuba declined importing any shots from Russia or China. Cuba has also decided against joining the UN-backed COVAX initiative a global project aimed at getting COVID-19 shots to countries regardless of their wealth.

""We know that in the end we always have to rely on ourselves on our own strengths and abilities"" said Guillen Nieto alluding to the political isolation caused by the US embargo. ""The result is a health care system that is not only free of cost but also centrally controlled and that has perfected the ability to respond quickly to disasters be it with clinical trials with vaccination campaigns or even the production of a vaccine.""

Vaccinations to curb rising COVID infections

According to Guillen Nieto 2.2 million Cubans have already received their first vaccination 1.7 million their second and 900000 the third dose.

Abdala is administered in three doses with two weeks between each vaccination. Based on the government's ambitious plans 70% of country's population should receive their shots by August.

It's a race against time because the number of new infections on the Caribbean island is steadily rising with more than 2000 cases a day. Nearly 1200 people have died of COVID-19 in Cuba. Guillen Nieto is counting on the vaccination campaign to give him a decisive advantage over all other countries in the world in the fight against the virus.

""Here there is an unprecedented level of trust in the Cuban health system"" he said. ""For example we never have problems finding volunteers when it comes to clinical trials. In Cuba people are extremely eager to be vaccinated. No one here would think of not getting inoculated because everyone knows how important vaccinations are.""

An independent panel of experts in Havana will now scrutinize the Abdala vaccine and official emergency approval is expected in the next two weeks. After that Cuba could also apply to the World Health Organization (WHO) for approval of Abdala for international use. Bolivia Jamaica Venezuela Argentina and Mexico have already signaled interest.

WHO shares optimism

But is Abdala really the miracle vaccine that the numbers promise? Perhaps Jose Moya is the man best placed to assess this. The Peruvian doctor started out as an epidemiologist 30 years ago in his native Ayacucho and then worked for Doctors Without Borders in Guatemala Mozambique and Nigeria.

For the past two years Moya has been the representative in Cuba of PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) a regional organization of the WHO with 27 country offices. And he trusts the Cuban figures.

""The CIGB Research Institute has 30 years of experience in vaccine research. I trust the results that have been published. These are serious studies with the participation of researchers and institutions committed to science"" Moya said.

The best proof is the fact that 80% of all of Cuba's vaccines are produced in the country itself Moya said. He was not surprised by the high efficacy of Abdala saying it was simply the logical consequence of a health care system that had been performing steadily well for decades. ""Already the results published by the scientists beforehand showed a good response in terms of antibody production"" he said.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel however does not want to dwell on scientific assessments of the new vaccine. For him the country's drive to pursue homegrown solutions rather than importing foreign vaccines are a triumph of Cuba's biotech industry.

""This success can only be compared to the greatness of our sacrifices. It is an example of the pride with which a country treats its pharmaceutical industry which has been living with the US economic embargo since 1962"" he said.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added a warning about the risk of heart inflammation to fact sheets for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.

The warning on Friday noted that reports of adverse events following vaccination – particularly after the second dose – suggest increased risks of myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis or inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.

The warning update follows an extensive review of information and discussion by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC’s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on Wednesday the FDA said.

At end of the second week of June more than 1200 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have been reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

The cases reportedly appear to be notably higher in males and in the week after the second vaccine dose.

There has been no comment from Pfizer and Moderna yet."

The pilot set to commence next month will initially convert 600 tonnes of MLP waste per annum into WoW boards—that can be used to make furniture and even be applied for construction and building purposes.

The project was facilitated by Ubuntoo—a global environment solutions company set-up by former Cola-Cola India president Venkatesh Kinni.

As part of this initiative MLP waste will be collected by Hasiru Dala’s network of waste collection units and then processed and converted into recyclable material at a special unit set up in Bengaluru Mondelez said.

The technology solution is provided by waste recycling equipment manufacturer TrashCon.

“We have made a grant to Hasiru Dala that will convert waste to wealth generate employment and create a viable business model while addressing the challenges of MLP in a sustainable manner. The success of this project and its learnings will create a model for companies in India to replicate for MLP recycling at scale"" Deepak Iyer President India Mondelēz International said.

The 600 tonnes of waste represent 10% of plastic generated by the sale of the company’s products in India.

Globally the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies has committed to reducing its environmental impact—over 97% of Mondelez India’s packaging is currently designed to be recyclable. In 2019- 2020 and in 2020-21 the company achieved 100% Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) targets in India it said in a statement.

MLP packaging is used heavily by the foods industry for packaging chips biscuits chocolates shampoo sachets and candies etc. MLP packaging has least one layer of plastic along with additional layers in materials such as paper paper board metalized layers or aluminium foil.

However the material is significantly hard to fully recycle. The waste often ends up in drains and on street sides its collection remains largely unorganised.

According to a 2018 report more than 80% of plastic waste collected is of low value but brings almost nothing in terms of income to the centres. They typically end up at landfills or in co-processing in cement kilns said Nalini Shekar co-founder Hasiru Dala.

The conversion of plastic waste into WoW boards will help bring income to the waste pickers and will have applications particularly in replacing wood-based sheets said Shekar.

Companies especially those that sell processed foods have struggled to find sustainable alternatives to MLP.

“One of the key challenges in India is recycling of multi layered plastics given infrastructure constraints. While on the one hand we continue to work with the government to support collection segregation and recycling we felt it was critical to experiment and support enterprising technologies and initiatives that can recycle multi layered plastics at scale to address the issues of waste management"" Iyer said.

Iyer said finding a sustainable and a cost-effective alternative to MLP could take years of research and industry-wide efforts.

“Unfortunately today we don't have any other commercially viable material to substitute plastics but there's a lot of work happening. This is not a company initiative but an industry initiative. Till that comes we still have to solve for plastic waste recycling"" Iyer told Mint in an interview.

The initiative through funding by Mondelez India and in partnership with its impact investing arm Sustainable Futures is expected to begin commercial production in July 2021.

This pilot project is especially exciting because it has global potential to help solve not just plastic waste but also reduce the huge environmental footprint of the building and construction industry said Venkatesh Kini co-founder Ubuntoo.

TrashCon has invented patented technology to convert MLP coming from houses streets and even landfills into an alternative to plywood.

Basically a lot has happened since two years ago the last time — I wrote all this down — the last time I was in court.

'I will be honest with you. I haven’t been back to court in a long time because I don’t think I was heard on any level when I came to court the last time. I brought four sheets of paper in my hands and wrote in length what I had been through the last four months before I came there.

'The people who did that to me should not be able to walk away so easily. I’ll recap. I was on tour in 2018. I was forced to do… My management said if I don’t do this tour I will have to find an attorney'

JUDGE PENNY: 'Ms. Spears I hate to interrupt you but my court reporter is taking down what you’re saying so you have to speak a little more slowly'

BRITNEY: 'Oh of course. Yes. Okay. The people who did this to me should not be able to walk away so easily. To recap: I was on tour in 2018. I was forced to do…

'My management said if I don’t do this tour I will have to find an attorney and by contract my own management could sue me if I didn’t follow through with the tour. He handed me a sheet of paper as I got off the stage in Vegas and said I had to sign it. It was very threatening and scary...

'And with the conservatorship I couldn’t even get my own attorney. So out of fear I went ahead and I did the tour...

'When I came off that tour a new show in Las Vegas was supposed to take place. I started rehearsing early but it was hard because I’d been doing Vegas for four years and I needed a break in between...

'But no I was told this is the timeline and this is how it’s going to go. I rehearsed four days a week. Half of the time in the studio and a half of the other time in a Westlake studio..

'I was basically directing most of the show. I actually did most of the choreography meaning I taught my dancers my new choreography myself. I take everything I do very seriously. There’s tons of video with me at rehearsals. I wasn’t good — I was great. I led a room of 16 new dancers in rehearsals.

'It’s funny to hear my managers’ side of the story. They all said I wasn’t participating in rehearsals and I never agreed to take my medication — which my medication is only taken in the mornings never at rehearsal...

'They don’t even see me. So why are they even claiming that? When I said no to one dance move into rehearsals it was as if I planted a huge bomb somewhere. And I said no I don’t want to do it this way.

'After that my management my dancers and my assistant of the new people that were supposed to do the new show all went into a room shut the door and didn’t come out for at least 45 minutes. Ma’am I’m not here to be anyone’s slave. I can say no to a dance move...

'I was told by my at-the-time therapist Dr. Benson — who died [in 2019] — that my manager called him and then that moment and told him I wasn’t cooperating or following the guidelines in rehearsals...

'And he also said I wasn’t taking my medication which is so dumb because I’ve had the same lady every morning for the past eight years give me my same medication. And I’m nowhere near these stupid people. It made no sense at all.

'There was a week period where they were nice to me and I told them I don’t want to do the — They were nice to me they said if I don’t want to do the new Vegas show I don’t have to because I was getting really nervous...

'It was like lifting literally 200 pounds off of me when they said I don’t have to do the show anymore because it was really really hard on myself and it was too much. I couldn’t take it anymore...

'So I remember telling my assistant but y’know what I feel weird if I say no I feel like they’re gonna come back and be mean to me or punish me or something. Three days later after I said no to Vegas my therapist sat me down in a room and said he had a million phone calls about how I was not cooperating in rehearsals and I haven’t been taking my medication...

'All this was false. He immediately the next day put me on lithium out of nowhere. He took me off my normal meds I’ve been on for five years. And lithium is a very very strong and completely different medication compared to what I was used to.

'You can go mentally impaired if you take too much if you stay on it longer than five months. But he put me on that and I felt drunk. I really couldn’t even take up for myself. I couldn’t even have a conversation with my mom or dad really about anything...

'I told him I was scared and my doctor had me on six different nurses with this new medication come to my home stay with me to monitor me on this new medication which I never wanted to be on to begin with...

'There were six different nurses in my home and they wouldn’t let me get in my car to go anywhere for a month...

'Not only did my family not do a goddamn thing my dad was all for it. Anything that happened to me had to be approved by my dad. And my dad acted like he didn’t know that I was told I had to be tested over the Christmas holidays before they sent me away when my kids went to home to Louisiana. He was the one who approved all of it. My whole family did nothing.

'Over the two-week holiday a lady came into my home for four hours a day sat me down and did a psych test on me. It took forever. But I was I was told I had to. Then after I got a phone call from my dad basically saying I’d failed the test or whatever whatever. “I’m sorry Britney you have to listen to your doctors...

'They’re planning to send you to a small home in Beverly Hills to do a small rehab program that we’re going to make up for you. You’re going to pay $60000 a month for this.” I cried on the phone for an hour and he loved every minute of it.

'The control he had over someone as powerful as me — he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100000%. He loved it. I packed my bags and went to that place. I worked seven days a week no days off which in California the only similar thing to this is called sex trafficking...

'Making anyone work against their will taking all their possessions away — credit card cash phone passport — and placing them in a home where they work with the people who live with them. They all lived in the house with me the nurses the 24-7 security...

'There was one chef that came there and cooked for me daily during the weekdays. They watched me change every day — naked – morning noon and night. My body – I had no privacy door for my room. I gave eight vials (?) of blood a week...

'If I didn’t do any of my meetings and work from eight to six at night which is 10 hours a day seven days a week no days off I wouldn’t be able to see my kids or my boyfriend. I never had a say in my schedule. They always told me I had to do this. And Ma’am I will tell you sitting in a chair 10 hours a day seven days a week it ain’t fun… and especially when you can’t walk out the front door...

'And that’s why I’m telling you this again two years later after I’ve lied and told the whole world “I’m OK and I’m happy.” It’s a lie. I thought I just maybe if I said that enough maybe I might become happy because I’ve been in denial...

'I’ve been in shock. I am traumatized. You know fake it till you make it. But now I’m telling you the truth OK? I’m not happy. I can’t sleep. I’m so angry it’s insane. And I’m depressed. I cry every day...

'And the reason I’m telling you this is because I don’t think how the state of California can have all this written in the court documents from the time I showed up and do absolutely nothing — just hire with my money another person and keep my dad on board...

'Ma’am my dad and anyone involved in this conservatorship and my management who played a huge role in punishing me when I said no — ma’am they should be in jail. Their cruel tactics working for Miley Cyrus as she smokes on joints onstage at the VMAs — nothing is ever done to this generation for doing wrong things...

'But my precious body who has worked for my dad for the past f**king 13 years trying to be so good and pretty. So perfect...

'When he works me so hard. When I do everything I’m told and the state of California allowed my father — ignorant father — to take his own daughter who only has a role with me if I work with him they’ve set back the whole course and allowed him to do that to me...

'That’s given these people I’ve worked for way too much control. They also threaten me and said If I don’t go then I have to go to court. And it will be more embarrassing to me if the judge publicly makes the evidence we have...

'You have to go. I was advised for my image I need to go ahead [to rehab] and just go and get it over with. They said that to me. I don’t even drink alcohol — I should drink alcohol considering what they put my heart through...

'Also the Bridges facility they sent me to none of the kids — I was doing this program for four months so the last two months I went to a Bridges facility. None of the kids there did the program...

'They never showed up for any of them. You didn’t have to do anything if you didn’t want to. How come they always made me go? How come I was always threatened by my dad and anybody that participated in this conservatorship? If I don’t do this what they tell me to enslave me to do they’re gonna punish me...

'The last time I spoke to you by just keeping the conservatorship going and also keeping my dad in the loop made me feel like I was dead — like I didn’t matter like nothing had been done to me like you thought I was lying or something. I’m telling you again because I’m not lying...

'I want to feel heard. And I’m telling you this again so maybe you can understand the depth and the degree and the damage that they did to me back then.

'I want changes and I want changes going forward. I deserve changes. I was told I have to sit down and be evaluated again if I want to end the conservatorship.

'Ma’am I didn’t know I could petition the conservatorship to end it. I’m sorry for my ignorance but I honestly didn’t know that. But honestly but I don’t think I owe anyone to be evaluated.

'I’ve done more than enough. I don’t feel like I should even be in room with anyone to offend me by trying to question my capacity of intelligence whether I need to be in this stupid conservatorship or not. I’ve done more than enough.

'I don’t owe these people anything — especially me the one that has roofed and fed tons of people on tour on the road. It’s embarrassing and demoralizing what I’ve been through.

'And that’s the main reason I’ve never said it openly. And mainly I didn’t want to say it openly because I honestly don’t think anyone would believe me. To be honest with you the Paris Hilton story on what they did to her to that that school I didn’t believe any of it. I’m sorry. I’m an outsider and I’ll just be honest. I didn’t believe it.

'And maybe I’m wrong and that’s why I didn’t want to say any of this to anybody to the public because I thought people would make fun of me or laugh at me and say “She’s lying she’s got everything she’s Britney Spears.”

'I’m not lying. I just want my life back. And it’s been 13 years. And it’s enough. It’s been a long time since I’ve owned my money. And it’s my wish and my dream for all of this to end without being tested...

'Again it makes no sense whatsoever for the state of California to sit back and literally watch me with their own two eyes make a living for so many people and pay so many people trucks and buses on the road with me and be told I’m not good enough. But I’m great at what I do. And I allow these people to control what I do ma’am. And it’s enough. It makes no sense at all.

'Now going forward I’m not willing to meet or see anyone. I’ve met with enough people against my will. I’m done. All I want is to own my money for this to end and my boyfriend to drive me in his f*king car.

'And I would honestly like to sue my family to be totally honest with you. I also would like to be able to share my story with the world and what they did to me instead of it being a hush-hush secret to benefit all of them.

'I want to be able to be heard on what they did to me by making me keep this in for so long it is not good for my heart. I’ve been so angry and I cry every day. It concerns me I’m told I’m not allowed to expose the people who did this to me.

'For my sanity I need you to the judge to approve me to do an interview where I can be heard on what they did to me. And actually I have the right to use my voice and take up for myself. My attorney says I can’t...

'It’s not good. I can’t let the public know anything they did to me and by not saying anything is saying it’s OK.

'It’s not OK. Actually I don’t want an interview — I’d much rather just have an open call to you for the press to hear which I didn’t know today we’re doing so thank you. Instead of having an interview honestly I need that to get it off my heart the anger and all of it that’s been happening.

'It’s not fair they’re telling me lies about me openly. Even my family they do interviews to anyone they want on news stations. My own family doing interviews and talking about the situation and making me feel so stupid. And I can’t say one thing. And my own people say I can’t say anything.

'It’s been two years. I want a recorded call to you actually we’re doing this now — which I didn’t know that we’re doing this. My lawyer Sam (Ingham) has been very scared for me to go forward because he’s saying if I speak up I’m being overworked in that facility of that rehab place that rehab place will sue me. He told me I should keep it to myself.

'I would personally like to — actually I’ve grown with a personal relationship with Sam my lawyer I’ve been talking to him like three times a week now we’ve kind of built a relationship but I haven’t really had the opportunity by my own self to actually handpick my own lawyer by myself. And I would like to be able to do that.

'The main reason why I’m here is because I want to end the conservatorship without having to be evaluated. I’ve done a lot of research ma’am. And there’s a lot of judges who do end conservatorships for people without them having to be evaluated all the time. The only times they don’t is if a concerned family member says something’s wrong with this person.

'And considering my family has lived off my conservatorship for 13 years I won’t be surprised if one of them has something to say going forward and say “We don’t think this should end we have to help her.” Especially if I get my fair turn exposing what they did to me.

'Also I want to speak to you about my obligations which I personally don’t think at the very moment I owe anybody anything. I have three meetings a week I have to attend no matter what. I just don’t like feeling like I work for the people whom I pay. I don’t like being told I have to no matter what even if I’m sick. Jodi the conservator says I have to see my Coach Ken even when I’m sick...

'I would like to do one meeting a week with a therapist. I’ve never before even before they sent me to that place had two therapy sessions. I had a doctor and then a therapy person. What I’ve been forced to do illegal in my life. I shouldn’t be told I have to be available three times a week to these people I don’t know.

'I’m talking to you today because I feel again yes even [acting conservator] Jodi [Montgomery] is starting to kind of take it too far with me. They have me going to therapy twice a week and a psychiatrist.

'I’ve never in the past – wait they had me going yeah twice a week and Dr. Gold so that’s three times a week. I’ve never in the past had to see a therapist more than once a week. It takes too much out of me going to this man I don’t know.

'Number one I’m scared of people. I don’t trust people with what I’ve been through. And the clever setup of being in Westlake one of the most exposed places in Westlake which yesterday paparazzi showed me coming out of the place literally crying in therapy.

'It’s embarrassing and it’s demoralizing. I deserve privacy when I go and have therapy either at my home like I’ve done for eight years. They’ve always come to my home. Or when Dr. Benson — the man that died — I went to a place similar to what I went to in Westlake which was very exposed and really bad.

'Okay so where was I? It was like it was identical to Dr. Benson who illegally yes 100% abused me by the treatment he gave me to be totally honest with you I was so —

JUDGE PENNY: 'Ms. Spears excuse me for interrupting you but my reporter says if you could just slow it down a little bit because she’s trying to make sure she gets everything that you’re saying...

BRITNEY: 'OK cool… And to be totally honest with you when [Dr. Benson] passed away I got on my knees and thanked God. In other words my team is pushing it with me again...

'I have trapped phobias being in small rooms because of the trauma locking me up for four months in that place. It’s not okay for them to send me — sorry I’m going fast — to that small room like that twice a week with another new therapist that I pay that I never even approved. I don’t like it. I don’t want to do that. And I haven’t done anything wrong to deserve this treatment...

'It’s not okay to force me to do anything I don’t want to do. By law Jodi and this so-called team should honestly – I should be able to sue them for threatening me and saying if I don’t go and do these meetings twice a week we can’t let you have your money and go to Maui on your vacations...

'You have to do what you’re told for this program and then you will be able to go. But it was a very clever thing one of the most exposed places in Westlake knowing I have the hot topic of the conservatorship that over five paparazzis are going to show up and get me crying coming out of that place. I begged them to make sure that they did this at my home so I would have privacy. I deserve privacy...

'The conservatorship from the beginning once you see someone whoever it is in the conservatorship making money making them money and myself money and working – that whole statement right there the conservatorship should end...

'I shouldn’t be in a conservatorship if I can work and provide money and work for myself and pay other people — it makes no sense. The laws need to change. What state allows people to own another person’s money and account and threaten them and saying “You can’t spend your money unless you do what we want you to do.” And I’m paying them...

'Ma’am I’ve worked since I was 17 years old. You have to understand how thin that is for me every morning I get up to know I can’t go somewhere unless I meet people I don’t know every week in a office identical to the one where the therapist was very abusive to me...

'I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive and that we can sit here all day and say oh conservatorships are here to help people. But ma’am there is a thousand conservatorships that are abusive as well...

'I don’t feel like I can live a full life. I don’t owe them to go see a man I don’t know and share him my problems. I don’t even believe in therapy. I always think you take it to God. I want to end the conservatorship without being evaluated. In the meantime I want this therapist once a week...

'I just want him to come to my home. I’m not willing to go to Westlake and be embarrassed by all these scummy paparazzi laughing at my face while I’m crying coming out and taking my pictures as all these white nice dinners where people drinking wine at restaurants watching these places. They set me up by sending me to the most exposed places and I told them I didn’t want to go there because I knew paparazzi would show up there...

'They only gave me two options for therapists. And I’m not sure how you make your decisions ma’am. But this is the only chance for me to talk to you for a while. I need your help so if you can just kind of let me know where your head is. I don’t really honestly know what to say but my requests are just to end the conservatorship without being evaluated. I want to petition basically to end the conservatorship. But I don’t want to be evaluated and be sat in a room with people four hours a day like they did me before. And they made it even worse for me after that happened...

'I’m honestly new with this. And I’m doing research on all these things. I do know common sense and the method that things can end – for people it has ended without them being evaluated. So I just want you to take that in consideration...

'It also took a year during COVID to get me any self-care methods. She said there were no services available. She’s lying ma’am. My mom went to the spot twice in Louisiana during COVID. For a year I didn’t have my nails done — no hairstyling and no massages no acupuncture. Nothing for a year. I saw the maids in my home each week with their nails done different each time. She made me feel like my dad does. Very similar her behavior and my dad but just a different dynamic...

'Team wants me to work and stay home instead of having longer vacations. They are used to me sort of doing a weekly routine for them. And I’m over it. I don’t feel like I owe them anything at this point. They need to be reminded they actually work for me...

'I was supposed to be able to — I have a friend that I used to do AA meetings with. I did AA for two years. I did three meetings a week. I’ve met a bunch of women there. And I’m not able to see my friends that live eight minutes away from me which I find extremely strange...

'I feel like they’re making me feel like I live in a rehab program. This is my home. I’d like for my boyfriend to be able to drive me in his car. And I want to meet with a therapist once a week not twice a week. And I want him to come to my home. Because I actually know I do need a little therapy. (Laughing.)

'I would like to progressively move forward and I want to have the real deal I want to be able to get married and have a baby. I was told right now in the conservatorship I’m not able to get married or have a baby I have a (IUD) inside of myself right now so I don’t get pregnant. I wanted to take the (IUD) out so I could start trying to have another baby. But this so-called team won’t let me go to the doctor to take it out because they don’t want me to have children – any more children. So basically this conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good...

'I deserve to have a life. I’ve worked my whole life. I deserve to have a two to three year break and just you know do what I want to do. But I do feel like there is a crutch here...

'And I feel open and I’m okay to talk to you today about it. But I wish I could stay with you on the phone forever because when I get off the phone with you all of a sudden all I hear all these no’s — no no no. And then all of a sudden I get I feel ganged up on and I feel bullied and I feel left out and alone. And I’m tired of feeling alone...

'I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does by having a child a family any of those things and more so. And that’s all I wanted to say to you. And thank you so much for letting me speak to you today.'

JUDGE PENNY: 'Ms. Spears you’re quite welcome. And also I just want to tell you that I certainly am sensitive to everything that you said and how you’re feeling and I know that it took a lot of courage for you to say everything you have to say today and I want to let you know that the court does appreciate your coming on the line and sharing how you’re feeling.'",,,,,,,,,,,,

Alex Kasser resigns; former Navy SEAL Carl Higbie considers run for her seat,"Connecticut state Sen. Alex Kasser (D-Greenwich) abruptly resigned from her elected office citing the strain created by her efforts to divorce her husband Morgan Stanley executive Seth Bergstein whom she has publicly accused of domestic abuse.

Kasser was elected in 2018 and came out as a gay woman after taking office. In a posting on the Medium blog platform Kasser stated that she and her partner Nichola Samponaro were leaving Greenwich because of the stress created by her estranged husband.

“As all survivors of domestic abuse know emancipating ourselves is an epic struggle that takes years requires unflinching courage and all our resources ”“ mental physical and financial” she wrote. “Seth uses his powerful position at Morgan Stanley to enable his conduct so I must work even harder to fight for my freedom. Because of the enormous time and energy this consumes I can no longer serve my constituents to my fullest ability.”

Kasser also accused Bergstein of harassing Samponaro through “court motions that mention her 56 times for no relevant reason ”“ she had nothing to do with ending my marriage. The truth is that Nichola”™s love support and willingness to volunteer for me despite being publicly shamed for her presence in my life gave me the strength to endure this personal battle and fulfill my responsibility to the public.”

Kasser”™s withdrawal from Greenwich politics piqued the interest of political consultant former Donald Trump adviser and former U.S. Navy SEAL Carl Higbie to consider running for her seat.

Higbie who was elected to the Greenwich Representative Town Meeting in 2019 and hosts a Saturday morning talk show on the Newsmax cable channel conducted a poll on Twitter to see if his candidacy would generate voter interest. Higbie added that he received “lots of calls” from supporters to pursue Kasser”™s seat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzE2MDFlMzE0LTZkNmQtNDAxNC05NGRmLWYyODU4ZWU2NGU4ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UBS to let most staff mix working from home and office permanently,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Existing investors Gunosy Blume Ventures and others financed the new round in the Bangalore-headquartered startup it said.

Even as hundreds of millions of Indians today have a bank account only about 30 million have a credit card. Most people in the South Asian market are not eligible to get a credit card and even many of those who are don’t bother to get one because the experience of signing up is too clumsy time consuming and the rewards don’t make up for it.

Slice has made it easier for far more people — even those without a traditional full-time job — to get a card and the signup process doesn’t take forever.

Rajan Bajaj founder and chief executive of Slice said in an interview with TechCrunch that the startup which has already amassed over 3 million users is now bringing rewards to its app as it attempts to turn the plastic card into a larger financial instrument.

“You use your card more often than you use Uber Ola Swiggy and Zomato combined. But the payment experience on the card leaves a lot to be desired. Eventually if customers don’t see a value they will abandon the card and move elsewhere” he said.

“Banks treat credit cards like a loan product instead of a high-frequency payment instrument and make money through late charges and interest rates. You see a random charge on your credit card statement you don’t recognize it so now you have to deal with a customer representative. More than half such users give up and just accept those charges” he said.

“We are upfront about all of this. There’s no such thing as a joining fee or annual fee for Slice members and there’s no minimum amount they are required to pay each month” he said adding that the startup is also profitable. “As we were building our platform we recognized that there were many things that a credit card firm engages in that didn’t make sense for the customers so we didn’t include those” he said.

Slice’s eponymous app shows hyperlocal deals from restaurants and also offers up to 2% cash back on each transaction that is instantly redeemable to cash he said.

One of the ideas behind the rewards said Bajaj is to have people engage with the app more often so that they know how much money they are spending. Customers can also use the app to make several purchases (for instance by scanning a QR code).

“We see the card as a payment product and we are solving it as a consumer experience problem with a customer-first approach in mind” he said. Within six months of joining Slice more than 65% members credit scores climb to 730 he said.

To make it easier for members to pay their bills and not worry about any additional charges Slice now offers them the ability to split their bills and make the payments in a duration of up to three months — the longest in the industry — at no interest.

Slice has also become a formidable rival to established credit card firms in recent years. Bajaj said about 50% of new customers who are joining Slice today hold a credit card from a competing firm he said. More than half of these customers switch to Slice as their primary card he added.

“With the new features which are very competitive we expect to switch more than 80% of customers who own other cards to use Slice as their primary card in the next six to eight months” he said adding that the startup is able to offer better rewards than most credit cards because it spends just a fraction of its rivals in acquiring new customers.

“Our existing customers tell their friends about Slice. We don’t have to stand in malls and airports to advertise our product” he said.

The coronavirus pandemic has significantly shrunk people’s spending habits and hence hurt several fintech startups. But the Bangalore-based startup said not only has it recovered but it’s also growing. Slice said the month of May was its best month since inception and June has shown 25% growth.

The startup which provides users credit limit through its own balance sheet said it will deploy the fresh funding into developing more features for customers.

“Slice’s biggest advantage is how well they understand millennials and gen z. Their approach to solving their issues has been truly refreshing and building something simple and hassle-free has been a part of their DNA since inception. The Slice super card has the potential to fundamentally change the way the next generation thinks about the concept of credit cards altogether and we at Gunosy are glad to be a part of their growth story” said Shinji Kimura chairman and chief executive of Gunosy in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vbS50aGVpbnZlc3Rvci5jby5rci92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIxMDYyNzAwMDA2M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hanon Systems acquisition talks offset overvaluation concern: analyst,"Hanon Systems acquisition talks offset overvaluation concern: analyst

A logo of Hanon Systems

South Korean auto parts maker Hanon Systems’ overvaluation concern due to foreign clients‘ delay in production is being offset by acquisition talks analysts said on June 24.



This comes as a major shareholder of Hanon Systems private equity firm Hahn & Co. is considering selling a controlling stake in the thermal management automotive supplier. Hahn & Co. has named Morgan Stanley and Evercore as the deal manager six years after it took over control of the company with Hankook Tire & Technology.



Hanon Systems’ major client Ford decided to halt production due to a semiconductor shortage during the second quarter. Coupled with a slower-than-expected dollar recovery and the lasting pandemic impact on India the delay in production has highlighted concerns that Hanon Systems stocks are currently priced higher on the market than its intrinsic value.



Park Jun-ho an analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities revised down Hanon System‘s second-quarter earnings prospect on June 24. His estimate on Hanon Systems’ 2021 operating profit was lowered by 1.7 percent to 517 billion won ($456 million).



Despite such pressure the controlling stock sale procedure underway is making the case for the current valuation of Hanon Systems Park added.



“The crystalizing talks for controlling stake sale supports the current stock price” Park wrote in a note on June 24.



“A buyer‘s proposed acquisition price new financial investors’ strategy to increase the company‘s value and new strategic investors’ possible synergy effect with Hanon Systems will be variables for (Hanon Systems) stock price movement.”



Hahn & Co. holds a 50.5 percent stake in Hanon System while the second-largest shareholder Hankook Tire & Technology owns 19.49 percent voting rights of the company trading on the Korea Exchange.



The two companies teamed up to buy the controlling stake from US auto parts supplier Visteon in 2015 for 3.9 trillion won in total for a share price of 52000 won.



The same amount of shares‘ market price has gone up to as high as 6.3 trillion won on June 24. Market eyes are on how much of an acquisition premium will be represented in the forthcoming deal.



Having gone through a 5-to-1 stock split in 2016 and having acquired fluid pressure and controls business of Magna International in 2019 for 1.4 trillion won Hanon Systems was trading at 16850 won apiece in June 24‘s closing.



A bidding process was initiated this week to sell the combined 70 percent of ownership of Hahn & Co. and Hankook Tire. Auto supplier Mahle and private equity firms Carlyle Group and Bain Capital have reportedly joined the nonbinding bids to buy the stake. Another auto supplier rival Valeo had reportedly denied having made an offer to buy the company.



Hahn & Co. said in a disclosure on June 23 that nothing has been determined regarding the stake sale or other strategic decisions.



Other notable shareholders of Hanon Systems include the National Pension Service according to filings.",,,

John Samora John Samora/ The Republic

Raveen Arora was about 7 years old when Mother Teresa visited his school in Kolkata.

The Catholic nun who devoted her life to giving lined up Arora and his classmates and asked the boys to donate a rupee. One by one the students reached into their pockets pulled out change and handed it to her as she walked down the line.

Arora whose working-class family had resettled in the area years earlier as refugees slid his hand into his pocket.

But knowing he had nothing to give his hand lingered there. When Mother Teresa asked why he put his hand in his pocket a young Arora said it wasn’t to copy his classmates but because he wanted to help.

“Mother Teresa told the class ‘This is the example I want to teach. You must want to give do not have to give’” Arora said as he recounted the story.

The soft-spoken Tempe businessman is full of anecdotes from his childhood. There was the time he met Martin Luther King Jr. when he was 11 and they talked about inequality. Inequality was a familiar concept for Arora who grew up in a strict class system where lingering effects of British colonialism kept Indians out of certain places like the cricket field he and his grandfather tried to visit when he was 3 but were told that Indians and dogs weren’t allowed he said.

He doesn’t retell the stories to get a reaction though they certainly elicit one. These are moments that sparked a lifelong interest in public service and a desire to improve his community by helping people regardless of their race or status which this year earned Arora a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Service organizations from across the world banded together to recommend Arora 72 for the prize for his work in India and Tempe. Locally he has helped entrepreneurs get their start at his plaza on Apache Boulevard led water and food drives for people experiencing homelessness and donated his time through various volunteer groups.

“He epitomizes what every community or socially-minded person wants to be a servant leader in the truest sense” said Deborah Arteaga executive director of Tempe Community Action Agency or TCAA which supported his nomination.

From Kolkata India to Tempe

Arora was born in a refugee camp in India in 1948.

The country had declared independence from Britain the previous year and was split along religious lines into two countries India and Pakistan amid escalating tension between Hindus and Muslims.

The northern province of Punjab a religiously diverse area with Muslims Hindus Sikhs and Christians where Arora’s family was from was one of the hardest hit. The area was divided between Hindu-dominated India and Muslim-dominated Pakistan and fears of religious persecution led to the displacement of millions who relocated across the newly drawn borders.

Meet Dimitra McCabe: She became the resource she needed when she was a teen in Fort Defiance

Arora’s family was one of the last to leave on a refugee train that took them to a housing settlement in the newly formed India he said.

The family later resettled in Kolkata.

There he became involved with school groups and service organizations kicking off a lifelong dedication to helping people.

After secondary school he earned degrees in accounting finance and business management. He worked as an accountant and specialized in audits maritime fraud and white-collar crime before moving to Los Angeles in 1981 to pursue a doctorate degree he never completed.

Instead he opened a financial consulting firm at the encouragement of a friend.

In 2002 Arora and his wife followed their daughter to Tempe where she had enrolled at Arizona State University.

Arora who was retired and looking for a new opportunity found it in a rundown building along Apache Boulevard just east of McClintock Drive.

Raveen Arora a Tempe businessman who helped establish a community center for Indians and Indian Americans in Tempe. He has provided free space at the center to people looking to start their own businesses as a way to help them get their businesses off the ground among other work. He was recently nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. Nick Oza/The Republic

'I wanted to bring India closer to people'

At the time that stretch of Apache — once a major thoroughfare connecting Washington D.C. and San Diego — was blighted with empty motels abandoned store fronts and graffiti and there was a growing homeless population camping in the area. In some ways it reminded Arora of home he said.

“There was just something that stuck with me” he said. “I told my wife 'I think I’m going to set up something here.'”

He envisioned an Indian community center. His wife and others were skeptical.

Arora opened India Plaza in 2003 with a market gift shop yoga studio and eyebrow threading business. The tagline was “Where India comes alive” and Arora hoped to showcase different types of Indian businesses there he said.

The growing Asian population in Tempe helped support the center but its reach extended beyond that community too. That was Arora’s goal.

While the plaza became a gathering space for the East Valley’s Indian community Arora wanted to elevate the status of Indians in metro Phoenix by teaching people about Indian food music culture and values and in the process tear down stereotypes about Indians he said.

“I wanted to bring India closer to people and show people that we are peace-loving sharp intellectual and welcoming” he said.

Arora and his family opened The Dhaba restaurant in the plaza in 2008 specializing in home-style Punjabi food. The idea for a restaurant grew out of a school project his son worked on while at ASU and it helped further Arora’s goal of bringing people together this time around the dinner table. Today the restaurant is a popular meeting spot for community leaders and politicians.

In addition to promoting Indian culture the plaza has helped spur economic development in the area and served as a sort of business incubator where entrepreneurs have opened anything from a barber shop to a vintage clothing store.

TCAA which provides financial and housing assistance to residents and whose board Arora sits on has offices in the plaza too Last year they opened a daytime respite center there for people experiencing homelessness.

A desire to help

Outside of the plaza Arora found other ways to integrate himself into the Tempe community.

He joined service organizations and local business boards that provided him the opportunity to create a more equitable community by contributing his time and money.

Today he serves on 22 boards leading the United Food Bank and Tempe Chamber of Commerce boards of directors and he estimates he racks up more than 1000 volunteer hours each year he said.

Arora and his staff have handed out water bottles each summer to people experiencing homelessness who camp near the plaza since it opened in 2003 and more than 20000 meals since the restaurant opened in 2008 he said.

Undocumented and uninsured: Now she's helping thousands of kids who were just like her

He’s helped local college students with financial assistance and immigrants transition to their new home.

“He truly sees that taking care of basic needs first enables people to be who they envisioned to be productive and empowers them to give back to others” said TCAA’s Arteaga.

Arora credits that to his upbringing in Kolkata.

His father worked menial jobs and they lived in a small servant’s quarter before moving into a one-bedroom apartment. Arora walked 5 miles to school because they couldn’t afford the bus fare he said.

But what the family lacked in financial means they made up for in the lasting lessons they impressed on Arora including the value of education and the importance of treating people humanely as well as being humble empathetic and kind he said.

Nearly 70 support Arora's Nobel nomination

Seeking to honor his work in Tempe and beyond local national and international groups elected leaders and community members joined in writing letters of recommendation in support of Arora’s nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize.

The effort was spearheaded by Satish Lakhotia founder of India-based service organization Alliance International. Arora said he’s received close to 70 endorsements.

One of the supporters Neal Lester said Arora demonstrates a passion to do whatever he can to help marginalized communities — work that has become even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lester met Arora about five years ago through a mutual friend and the pair clicked over their work in the community and interest in fostering discussions that could lead to a kinder and more compassionate society said Lester founding director of Project Humanities at ASU.

Raveen Arora was selected by the National Restaurant Association as the Face of Diversity in Arizona for his leadership in promoting diversity and inclusion in the community. John Samora John Samora/ The Republic

Arora and his wife have since become involved with Project Humanities which seeks to build understanding across diverse groups through conversations about shared ideas and experiences. They’ve attended programs participated in discussions and contributed financially to the effort.

“We are excited to be part of a band of people cheering him on” Lester said.

Arora who learned of the nomination effort in January said the experience has been humbling.

“I won’t win not in my wildest dreams but the sheer fact that 60-plus people put their faith in me has made me a better Raveen” he said.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee said 329 candidates were nominated for the prize this year. Heads of state university professors and directors of policy institutes past prize winners and Nobel committee members can recommend someone for the award.

Nominations are currently under review and the Nobel Committee will vote on winners in October. The award will be presented in Oslo in December.

But if you buy individual stocks you can do both better or worse than that. Unfortunately the Ebang International Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:EBON) share price slid 38% over twelve months. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 48%. Because Ebang International Holdings hasn't been listed for many years the market is still learning about how the business performs. The share price has dropped 60% in three months.

View our latest analysis for Ebang International Holdings

Because Ebang International Holdings made a loss in the last twelve months we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth at least for now. Generally speaking companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible and it never makes a profit.

Ebang International Holdings' revenue didn't grow at all in the last year. In fact it fell 83%. That looks like a train-wreck result to investors far and wide. Meanwhile the share price dropped by 38%. We would want to see improvements in the core business and diminishing losses before getting too excited about this one.

The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.

A Different Perspective

While Ebang International Holdings shareholders are down 38% for the year the market itself is up 48%. However keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. It's worth noting that the last three months did the real damage with a 60% decline. So it seems like some holders have been dumping the stock of late - and that's not bullish. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Ebang International Holdings better we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Ebang International Holdings you should be aware of and 1 of them can't be ignored.

But on the bright side if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price you can gain well over 100%. For example the LiqTech International Inc. (NASDAQ:LIQT) share price has soared 188% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. We note the stock price is up 1.1% in the last seven days.

View our latest analysis for LiqTech International

LiqTech International isn't currently profitable so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits often of considerable size.

In the last 5 years LiqTech International saw its revenue grow at 15% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Meanwhile its share price performance certainly reflects the strong growth given the share price grew at 24% per year compound during the period. This suggests the market has well and truly recognized the progress the business has made. LiqTech International seems like a high growth stock - so growth investors might want to add it to their watchlist.

Balance sheet strength is crucial. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.

A Different Perspective

LiqTech International shareholders are up 41% for the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side that's still a gain and it's actually better than the average return of 24% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand LiqTech International better we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with LiqTech International  and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks go directly to the 5 Stocks to Buy to Profit from Post-COVID Economic Recovery.

Inflation fears and a cryptocurrency slump in recent weeks have hit some of the prospects for the post-COVID economic recovery. However with the vaccine rollout in the United States proceeding forward at a healthy pace and international travel activities resuming the post-pandemic boom is well and truly underway. Some of the stocks that investors can look towards in hopes of riding these growth catalysts include Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA).

Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) the online platform that connects renters with those who need short-term lodging can power through the coming few months with strong recovery momentum behind it. On June 21 investment advisory Baird maintained an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $200. Colin Sebastian an analyst at the firm underlined the platform improvements and focused marketing campaigns of the company that he said would enable Airbnb to capitalize through the rest of the year.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) perhaps one of the most recognizable brands in the world is also expected to be one of the big gainers of the year as theme parks reopen in tandem with relaxed social distancing rules and easing mask mandates. According to investment bank UBS theme parks could be back to pre-COVID operating levels as early as the holiday season this year. However UBS has cautioned that full-year recovery for the sector is not expected for at least another two years.

With the relaxation of lockdown rules another stock that could benefit is Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) the telecom firm that owns several broadcast channels and film studios. The relaxations would allow the company to resume filming and as cinemas reopen another source of revenue would be added to the money pipeline that would strengthen the firm in the coming weeks and months. As the internet streaming business of the firm grows it could rival other streaming giants in the space because of sheer capital backing.

The tilt towards internet streaming has been necessitated by the digitization of the world in recent years. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2% vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th.

With this context in mind here is our list of the 10 stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery. These were selected based on the upside potential they offer as the economy reopens the overall market ratings and hedge fund sentiment around the companies.

Stocks to Buy to Profit from Post-COVID Economic Recovery

10. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) is a company that owns and runs several hotels and resorts across the world. It is placed tenth on our list of 10 stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery. The company’s shares have offered investors returns exceeding 74% over the course of the past twelve months. The company has been investing heavily in Las Vegas in recent years doubling its footprint in three years with plans to expand to 30 hotels in the area by the end of this year.

On June 15 investment advisory Argus maintained a Buy rating on Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) stock with a price target of $145. The investment advisory also raised the 2021 earnings per share estimate on the hotel firm to $2.6 from $2.56.

At the end of the first quarter of 2021 47 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5 billion in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) down from 60 the preceding quarter worth $6 billion.

Just like Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) is one of the stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter LRT Capital Management an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Hilton is the second largest hotel company in the world after Marriott International (MAR). The company owns a portfolio of brands from the low end (Hampton Inn Hilton Garden Inn) through the mid-tier (DoubleTree Hilton Curio Embassy Suites Homewood Suites) to the luxury high end (Waldorf Astoria Conrad LXR). Hilton’s portfolio is almost perfectly balanced between the three categories while the majority (73%) of the company’s EBITDA geographic exposure is in the United States with Asia Pacific and Europe each contributing another 10%. Hilton today is almost exclusively a manager and franchisor of hotels not a hotel owner. The company owns 61 hotels manages 715 and franchises 5702 – in total 6478 properties with over 1 million combined rooms.8 Like all franchise based businesses Hilton requires very little capital to grow as it utilizes the investment capital of its hotel-owners/partners to expand. Hilton currently faces a difficult operating environment due to the covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty about the future of business travel. However the company is an excellent operator with a somewhat leveraged capital structure – if pent-up demand for travel materializes post-Covid as we expect it will the company will quickly go from losing money to raking in profits. Hilton last reported earnings on February 17th with both top and bottom line disappointing investment analysts’ expectations. However these poor results are not indicative of the company’s long-term outlook. In normal times Hilton generates prodigious free cash flow which we expect will resume once travel demand returns. Over the longer term we expect Hilton to grow its topline at least twice as fast as GDP due to rising revenues per room and the growing number of rooms. Most importantly the industry continues to consolidate with chain branded hotels taking market share from independent operations. With the superior marketing and loyalty programs offered by hotel chains (Hilton Honors has 112 million members) driving demand independent hotel owners see the benefits of signing up with one of the dominant hotel chains (Hilton IHG and Marriott). Furthermore the company’s main growth opportunities remain abroad as hotel chain penetration remains much lower outside the United States. Shares are up 9.34% year-to-date. We believe the shares are undervalued at 31.72x forward earnings.”

9. LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE: LYB)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47

LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE: LYB) is a Dutch firm that makes and sells chemicals. The company has operations throughout Europe North America Asia and other places. The company is expected to benefit from the surge in demand for chemicals and oil as the economy reopens following the lockdowns of 2020. It is ranked ninth on our list of 10 stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery. The stock has returned 62% to investors over the course of the past year.

LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE: LYB) is a solid option for income investors as the firm pays a regular and healthy dividend. On May 28 it declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share up more than 7.5% from the previous dividend. The forward yield was close to 4%.

Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey New York-based investment firm Eagle Capital Management is a leading shareholder in LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE: LYB) with 2.9 million shares worth more than $308 million.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86

Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) is placed eighth on our list of 10 stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery. The company’s shares have returned 121% to investors in the past year. It is an online travel firm based in Washington. The firm recently beat market expectations on earnings per share and revenue for the first quarter of 2021 reporting a 14% year-on-year increase in bookings on the platform that are set to increase further as the vaccine rollout allows for more business operations to resume.

On June 10 investment advisory Wells Fargo gave Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) stock Overweight rating and placed the company in an attractive value and high momentum target list for investors in the consumer discretionary sector.

At the end of the first quarter of 2021 86 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $6.1 billion in Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) up from 76 in the previous quarter worth $6.5 billion.

Just like Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) is one of the stocks to buy to profit from post-COVID economic recovery.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter ClearBridge Investments an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Several of our better performers in the first quarter were purchased while their business models were under stress from COVID restrictions or the macro environment the pandemic created. What gave us confidence in purchasing Expedia were the actions the company took to extend out their balance sheets until travel resumed. It should benefit as a broader vaccination rollout prompts cruise lines to resume operations and consumers to start traveling again and are positioned to deliver better margins and gain pricing power as the economy normalizes due to the cost controls implemented during the downturn.”

7. Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50

You may have seen reviews promoting a broad release for The Ice Road but sadly you probably won’t be catching The Ice Road on Netflix anytime soon.

The new Liam Neeson epic hasn’t exactly scored the best reviews from critics but that often doesn’t matter. The big action flick has been scoring plenty of headlines meaning that it’s in high demand.

But sadly only those in the United States can stream the movie.

Netflix has gone some way to protecting those outside the US from being exposed to The Ice Road. The trailer from Netflix for example is geo-restricted but even so almost all coverage of the movie just mentions that it’s a Netflix Original movie.

So what’s going on here? Well although it’s a Netflix Original Netflix didn’t produce the movie. Instead it just acquired the exclusive distribution rights in the United States meaning it can only show the movie there.

If we look back to the original announcement as reported by The Hollywood Reporter the movie was sold on a per-country basis.

Netflix in the US was the only country to land the movie with Prime Video scoring it in the United Kingdom and France with other countries being sold to local distributors or worse unsold.

We’d recommend using a service like JustWatch.com to see where it eventually lands in your region but know it may not be available right now.

It’s not the first time this has happened. In fact there’s a laundry list of movies and series where this often happens. Next month Gunpowder Milkshake will follow a similar release schedule with it only arriving in the States.

It can and often does work in the other direction too. Earlier this year for example everywhere except the United States was treated to Tom Hanks’s News of the World which is displayed as a Netflix Original. In that case Universal held back the movie from Netflix and at the moment is only available on VOD services although is expected to land on HBO Max eventually.

We hope that explains why you’re not able to watch The Ice Road but if you’re unable to find it where you live it probably doesn’t help much.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW1mb3JkYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvTmV0ZmxpeC1tb3ZpZS10cmFuc2Zvcm1zLU5ldy1DYW5hYW4tZG93bnRvd24taW50by0xNjI3NzY0OS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix movie transforms New Canaan downtown into Christmas set — in June,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/local/article/Netflix-movie-transforms-New-Canaan-downtown-into-16277649.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW1mb3JkYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvTmV0ZmxpeC1tb3ZpZS10cmFuc2Zvcm1zLU5ldy1DYW5hYW4tZG93bnRvd24taW50by0xNjI3NzY0OS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vYmVzdC9iZXN0LWZyZW5jaC10di1zaG93cy1vbi1uZXRmbGl40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best French TV shows on Netflix from Lupin to Marseille,"After a year of being stuck inside and devouring content on Netflix you may be starting to feel like you’ve watched everything decent that the English-speaking world has to offer. But as you've probably noticed Netflix is a global streaming service with a host of original content tailored for local audiences – if you're familiar with international shows like Spanish crime series Money Heist or German sci-fi drama Dark you'll know there's a lot more stuff to binge if you expand your horizons.

In particular Netflix has dozens of outstanding French-language shows that can open up a whole world of viewing if you know where to look. Below we’ve collated the top 10 series to give you a flavor of what's out there – all you need to decide is which one you'll be curling in front of la télévision with tonight.

Lupin

With the second season dropping earlier this month the hype around this much-vaunted French crime show only seems to grow and for good reason. An engaging blend of action storytelling and drama this iteration of Lupin uses the much-loved French detective as inspiration for a gentleman-thief revenge story. Omar Sy plays Assane Diop the show's charismatic lead. If you've only watched English-language shows on Netflix this massively popular series is as suitable a jumping-off point as any for the other shows on this list.

Call My Agent!/Dix Pour Cent

(Image credit: Christophe Brachet)

This hilarious satire is another great introduction to modern French cinematic and television culture. Based around the fictional ASK Talent Agency Call My Agent is full of cameos from famous French faces often playing somewhat fictionalized unreasonable versions of themselves as their haggard agents run around putting out fires – in the process it introduces you to some of the biggest music and screen stars in the Francophone world. Led by Camille Cottin the phenomenal ensemble cast is what transforms this show from a piece with smart writing and great sets into unmissable television.

Family Business

The standout cast in this comedy turn a witty script into something that’s exceptionally funny. Jonathan Cohen plays Joseph an unsuccessful entrepreneur who discovers that the newly elected French government is about to legalize cannabis and seeks to turn his father’s failing kosher butcher shop into Paris’s first cannabis cafe – without telling the rest of his family. A series of comically unfortunate events mean things don’t go quite as Cohen had planned and as the plot unfurls you'll be crying with laughter at the twists deployed along the way.

Osmosis

(Image credit: Jessica Forde/Netflix)

This speculative sci-fi show follows the creators of a fictionalized dating app called Osmosis which delves deep into the brains of its users to find perfect romantic matches. While there’s a huge focus on the tech and how it impacts users Osmosis is more than just your run-of-the-mill sci-fi show; the programme delves into the societal impacts of such an invasive-yet-useful technology and how the success of the app affects its creators financially socially and morally. This is a thoughtful series that asks the big questions we’re only just starting to come up with around subjects like biotech and computer ethics.

A Very Secret Service/Au Service de la France

(Image credit: Netflix)

This hilarious spy-comedy is set in 1960s France a country on the edge thanks to massive cultural shifts like second-wave Feminism the escalating Cold War and the looming decolonization of its North African territories. While these momentous societal shifts are an important backdrop to the show and provide many of the plot points the real value of A Very Secret Service is in its comedic performances and its excellent handling of what could be an insensitive premise. Hugo Becker is especially good as the hapless Agent Merlaux playing the character with a fine balance of humanity and hilarity.

Black Spot/Zone Blanche

(Image credit: Netflix)

Despite the confusingly contradictory translation of the title this supernatural series is well written tense and bingeable. Set in the fictional small town of Villefranche the story begins with the arrival of prosecutor Franck Siriani (Laurent Capelluto) who has been tasked with discovering why the town’s murder rate is six times the French average. There are plenty of twists turns and tense moments in this intriguing mystery as well as a few genuinely laugh-out-loud moments to bring you back from the brink. If you've seen the aforementioned German series Dark it's got a similar vibe. If you haven't think a grittier less cliched Stranger Things.

The Hook Up Plan/Plan Coeur

(Image credit: Netflix)

The Hook Up Plan follows Elsa (Cesar winner Zita Hanrot) as she meets and falls in love with seemingly perfect schoolteacher Jules (Marc Ruchmann). Unbeknownst to Elsa however Jules is a male escort hired by her friends to help her get over her ex-boyfriend who’s still very much in all their lives. Strong performances turn this from a sappy romantic comedy into a real heart-warmer with some truly standout comedic moments.

Marianne

(Image credit: EMMANUEL GUIMIER)

If you’re looking to shut the curtains and sprint from the light switch to your bed then Marianne is the scary treat for you. The plot revolves around young horror novelist Emma (Victoire Du Bois from Call Me By Your Name) who discovers her characters are coming to life. The show is a great combination of jump-scares gore and skin-crawling moments. A creepy hit with an interesting premise and a winding plot.

Marseille

(Image credit: David Koskas / Netflix)

This political drama has all the intrigue of shows like House of Cards serving up similarly deep relevant political critique and some unbelievably powerful performances. French screen legend Gérard Depardieu plays Robert Taro the incumbent mayor of the titular city and gives a star turn as the power-hungry political operator. It's heart-thumping stuff from the get-go which is rare for a series in this genre.

The Chalet/Le Chalet

(Image credit: David Koskas / Netflix)

The Chalet is set across two timelines 20 years apart (1997 and 2017) and you’ll start off wondering if these two seemingly disparate storylines have anything connecting them other than the titular location and a few shared faces. However as the plot unfolds you’ll start to pick up on the little intricacies and through-lines that link them until all is revealed in a horrifying yet signposted conclusion. A slow burner for sure but one that’s worth your indulgence."

The worker who is understood to have caught the virus at a quarantine hotel in Brisbane is employed at the Newmont-owned Granites gold mine in the Tanami Desert around 540 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs.

Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the worker was potentially infectious with the Delta variant from June 18 to June 24.

There are 754 people in isolation on the mine site. (Nine)

There are 754 people in isolation on the mine site but around 900 workers have already left the mine Mr Gunner confirmed.

Mr Gunner confirmed of the 900 who have left the Granites Gold Mine since June 18 - 244 are in the Territory (33 Alice Springs and 211 Darwin). The remaining workers have flown to Perth and Brisbane.

Of the 244 - 20 are considered close contacts and they have all been reached and are now in secure quarantine.

One in Alice Springs has moved into the Todd Quarantine Facility and one from Katherine and 19 from Darwin have moved into the Centre for National Resilience at Howard Springs.

The Chief Minister says authorities have directly contacted the others with two text messages and are following up by phone or personal visit. Frontline staff including Police are helping with this effort.

The group of 900 had sent text messages to get tested and isolate.

""We are assuming it is the Delta variant the worst-case scenario"" Mr Gunner said.

He said officials were ""confident"" they knew ""all of the people who have moved in and out of the mine site.""

""We are asking all 900 to identify where they are isolating where they have travelled to another jurisdiction we will advise that jurisdiction.""

The worker went to Brisbane from Bendigo on June 7 and quarantined there.

But he was only in quarantine for less than 24 hours before being released. In that time he contracted the virus.

The Northern Territory government has confirmed a worker at the Newmont-owned Granites gold mine has tested positive to COVID-19. (Nine)

After quarantine the worker travelled on to the gold mine. On June 24 he got a text message alert stating the Brisbane hotel had been a potential breakout site.

The worker went into isolation and got tested Mr Gunner said returning a positive test 12 hours ago.

Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Kidd said the government was taking a newly identified case in a Northern Territory mining site ""very seriously"" and will continue to support remote Aboriginal communities through the pandemic.

""We are aware of the reported case of COVID-19 in a worker in a mining site in the Tanami Desert in central Australia"" Professor Kidd said.

""We are taking this very seriously - right from the start of the pandemic we've had plans in place to work with local Aboriginal communities to respond to outbreaks in remote areas in Australia.

""The Commonwealth is working with the Northern Territory government and the Aboriginal community controlled health services in the affected area to provide whatever support is needed.""

To this point the Northern Territory has never had a case of community transmission of coronavirus.

Chief Health Officer Hugh Heggie said there was some concern for Darwin and Alice Springs which the 900 workers may have travelled through.

Dr Heggie said he had alerted health officials in other states.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 2004 and 2019 one in every four U.S. newspapers shut down and almost all the rest cut staff for a total of 36000 jobs lost between 2008 and 2019 alone. Local newspapers have been particularly devastated making it ever more difficult for people to know what is happening in their communities.

Many factors contributed to this economic collapse but none more so than the cornering of the digital advertising market by the duopoly of Facebook and Google. Facebook’s threat to a free press—and by extension to democracy—is especially pernicious. The social media company is financially asphyxiating the news industry even as it gives oxygen to conspiracy theories and lies. As a result of its many roles in degrading our democracy it faces mounting scrutiny by politicians and regulators.

Facebook has responded to the negative attention by creating a highly sophisticated public relations effort which includes becoming the number one corporate spender on federal lobbying and engaging in a massive advertising blitz aimed at the D.C. policy audience. Less well known and potentially far more dangerous is a secretive multimillion-dollar-a-year payout scheme aimed at the most influential news outlets in America. Under the cover of launching a feature called Facebook News Facebook has been funneling money to The New York Times The Washington Post The Wall Street Journal ABC News Bloomberg and other select paid partners since late 2019.

Participating in Facebook News doesn’t appear to deliver many new readers to outlets; the feature is very difficult to find and it is not integrated into individuals’ newsfeeds. What Facebook News does deliver—though to only a handful of high-profile news organizations of its choosing—is serious amounts of cash. The exact terms of these deals remain secret because Facebook insisted on nondisclosure and the news organizations agreed. The Wall Street Journal reported that the agreements were worth as much as $3 million a year and a Facebook spokesperson told me that number is “not too far off at all.” But in at least one instance the numbers are evidently much larger. In an interview last month former New York Times CEO Mark Thompson said the Times is getting “far far more” than $3 million a year—“very much so.”

Facebook has responded to negative attention by creating a highly sophisticated public relations effort which includes becoming the number one corporate spender on federal lobbying and engaging in a massive advertising blitz aimed at the D.C. policy audience.

For The New York Times whose net income was $100 million in 2020 getting “far far more” than $3 million a year with essentially no associated cost is significant. And once news outlets take any amount of money from Facebook it becomes difficult for them to let it go notes Mathew Ingram chief digital writer for the Columbia Journalism Review. “It creates a hole in your balance sheet. You’re kind of beholden to them.” It’s not exactly payola Ingram told me searching for the right metaphor. Nor is it a protection racket. “It’s like you’re a kept person” he said. “You’re Facebook’s mistress.”

There’s no evidence that the deal directly affects coverage in either the news or editorial departments. Before the Facebook News deal the Times famously published an op-ed titled “It’s Time to Break Up Facebook” by Chris Hughes a cofounder of Facebook turned critic. And since the deal columns from Tim Wu and Kara Swisher among others have been similarly critical. In December the editorial board welcomed a lawsuit calling for Facebook to be broken up.

And Facebook and Google money is admittedly all over journalism already. Virtually every major media nonprofit receives direct or indirect funding from Silicon Valley including this one. When the Monthly gets grants from do-good organizations like NewsMatch some of the funds originate with Facebook.

But these three points are beyond dispute.

First the deals are a serious breach of traditional ethics. In the pre-internet days independent newspapers wouldn’t have considered accepting gifts or sweetheart deals from entities they covered under any circumstance. The Washington Post under the editor Leonard Downie Jr. for instance wouldn’t even accept grants from nonprofits to underwrite reporting projects for fear of losing the appearance of independence. Facebook which took in $86 billion in revenue last year is a hugely controversial behemoth having profound highly newsworthy and negative effects on society. Accepting money from them creates a conflict of interest.

Even for trusted news organizations whose audiences believe they can’t be bought outright “it might come across as hypocrisy to heavily criticize an industry while also collaborating with them” says Rasmus Kleis Nielsen the director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Agreeing to keep the terms of the deal confidential is also a mistake Nielsen told me. “This sort of opacity I don’t think builds trust.”

Second these deals help Facebook maintain the public appearance of legitimacy. Journalists critics and congressional investigators have amply documented how Facebook has become a vector of disinformation and hate speech that routinely invades our privacy and undermines our democracy. For The New York Times and other pillars of American journalism to effectively partner with Facebook creates the impression that Facebook is a normal legitimate business rather than a monopolistic rogue corporation.

Finally these agreements undermine industry-wide efforts that would help the smaller ethnic and local news organizations that are most desperately in need of help. One such effort would allow the industry to bargain collectively with Facebook and other tech giants by withholding content from the platforms unless they received a fair price for it. But for that to work small newsrooms would need the biggest and most influential companies to sign on. With those organizations receiving millions of dollars from Facebook through their own side deals the smaller publications could be left stranded and defenseless.

If Facebook’s intent were to save American journalism it would be making generous offers to smaller local news organizations that do original reporting Damon Kiesow a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism told me. By contrast Facebook News “doesn’t really help anyone in the industry except for the small select group of outlets that get paid” he said. “These efforts are all flavored with a strong dose of crisis communication and regulation avoidance.”

If any major figure in the American media was going to say no to Mark Zuckerberg it was Mark Thompson.

For most of his eight-year tenure as chief executive officer of the New York Times Company Thompson was one of the industry’s most thoughtful eloquent and persuasive critics of Facebook and the danger it presents to journalism’s business models and essential role in a democracy.

“It makes my blood run cold the idea of Facebook as a publisher” he said at a June 2018 event convened by the Open Markets Institute. At a panel sponsored by the Tow Center later that month he described that same affect when Zuckerberg “starts talking about how he thinks about community and about what we trust.” Zuckerberg he said has a “terrifyingly naive perspective on news.”

During the OMI event Thompson warned darkly about the “sinister” prospect “that Facebook’s catalog of missteps with data and extreme and hateful content” will lead it to try to “set itself up as the digital world’s editor in chief prioritizing and presumably downgrading and rejecting content on a survey- and data-driven assessment of whether the provider of the content is ‘broadly trusted’ or not.”

In an exclusive interview former New York Times CEO Mark Thompson said the Times is getting “far far more” than $3 million a year in payouts from Facebook—“very much so.”

Here was actual humility from the CEO of the paper of record: “Democracy depends in part on unbounded competition between different journalistic perspectives and the clash of different judgments and opinions” he said. “History suggests that mainstream news organizations frequently get it right but also that not infrequently it is the outliers who should be listened to.”

And he knew what needed to be done. An essential preliminary step was for Facebook and others to “engage with the collective industry bodies of the news business to arrive at shared principles both on the presentation and choice of news content and on its monetization.” He called for “consistency and comparability in the treatment of news providers.”

This was not the language of shakedown. It was an impassioned and impressive philosophical argument about the survival of news—and democracy.

But then all of a sudden The New York Times and Facebook were making deals together. In October 2019 Facebook announced the launch of Facebook News with The New York Times as a marquee paid partner getting prime placement in a new vertical designated for “trusted” news sources.

What changed for Thompson between June 2018 and October 2019 such that the idea of Facebook picking which “trusted” news sources to pay went from sinister to “Sign here”?

“We always reserved our rights to do what we needed to do for our own business and to continue to fund our journalism in the interim” Thompson insisted in a phone interview in March. “I’m a sort of pragmatist” he said. “I don’t really see this as a conflict of interest or an issue of principle it’s the real world.” He rejected the depiction of the payments as a gift or a payoff. “As far as I’m concerned we were paid by a platform for access to our content.” Facebook of course does not pay The New York Times for access to its content when it is shared on regular newsfeeds.

And Thompson said that while he still thinks it would be sinister for Facebook to be making its own editorial decisions on a story-by-story basis “Facebook making it easier for people to identify The New York Times and making it easier to access The New York Times is a good thing.”

What about his devotion to collective rather than individual action? It remains—in theory. “As it happens I’m still very much in favor of broader agreements” he told me. “Ideally” he continued such payments would be “not just available . . . to the handful of big players but broadly in particular to local and regional journalism.”

So taking the deal wasn’t a betrayal of his principles Thompson insisted. “I still fundamentally believe everything I said.” With any collective agreement years away at best he said “I don’t accept that our reaching it made it harder for the other publishers to get it—on the contrary . . . I don’t think you’ve got any evidence that a refusal to engage . . . would have helped them at all.” It actually sets a good precedent he suggested. “It’s brilliant to have got a big digital platform to pay for the use of our content.”

But organizations that are favored by Facebook will obviously have different incentives going forward than those that are not. Unfavored outlets if begging doesn’t work may want to play hardball with Facebook to get their due—while the Timesand others will inevitably have qualms before blowing a hole in their budgets.

The Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha declined to address a long list of questions about the specifics of the relationship with Facebook responding instead with general comments. “Quality journalism is expensive to produce and we believe quality publishers should be fairly compensated for creating valuable journalism” she wrote in an email. The Times “does not disclose licensing and advertising terms” she wrote and “our licensing agreement with Facebook has no impact on our newsroom.”

Once news outlets take any amount of money from Facebook it becomes difficult for them to let it go notes Mathew Ingram chief digital writer for the Columbia Journalism Review. “It creates a hole in your balance sheet.

Thompson stepped down as CEO in July 2020 and was replaced by his protégé Meredith Kopit Levien who may be even more committed to the deal than Thompson was. A few months after she took over Levien expressed enthusiasm that Facebook had promised to create a space “for a particular level of quality news providers” to pay the Times “a fair amount” and to “feed your funnel.”

The Facebook News deal isn’t Facebook’s only or first inroad at the Times. The company already had a seat at the table—literally. The publisher and chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. installed the Facebook executive Rebecca Van Dyck on his 12-member board of directors in 2015. Van Dyck who was Facebook’s global head of consumer and brand marketing at the time now runs marketing for Facebook’s augmented and virtual reality labs.

Indeed the Facebook News bounty might even be dwarfed by the undisclosed sum that Facebook is pouring into the Times’s new augmented reality efforts. The newsroom’s new “AR Lab” a collaboration between Facebook and the Times builds augmented reality filters and camera effects distributed on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram.

There are likely even more ties the public doesn’t know about. BuzzFeed News recently discovered that the Times columnist David Brooks had written a pro-Facebook blog post while on salary for a nonprofit partially funded by Facebook and hadn’t disclosed it to his current Times bosses or the readers.

Thompson would have been very much alone among his U.S. peers had he resisted Facebook’s inducements. He was also hardly the most enthusiastic Facebook partner—that would be News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson who after years of vituperative attacks on Big Tech was grinning at Zuckerberg’s side at the Facebook News launch event and announcing a “new dawn” for journalists.

The rollout was undeniably a huge win for Facebook public relations. The Times story was headlined “Facebook Calls Truce With Publishers as It Unveils Facebook News.” What few negative headlines ensued were related to Facebook’s decision to include Breitbart the far-right website known for spreading white-supremacist disinformation among its cadre of “trusted” news sources—although in Breitbart’s case an unpaid one.

Months later Joshua Benton the director of the Neiman Journalism Lab described the big downside: The Facebook News deal he wrote “lets them (1) pick the publishers they want to pay (2) pick the amount of money they want to pay them (3) get publishers to stop complaining at least hopefully and (4) get headlines like ‘Facebook Offers News Outlets Millions of Dollars a Year’ in the hopes that they can stave off government regulation or taxation.” Facebook isn’t spending the money “because they think News Tab will be profitable” Benton wrote. “It’s a way to solve a PR and policy problem.” The vaunted new product he noted consists of “a new tab buried so deep in Facebook’s interface you need a spelunker’s headlamp to find it.”

To collectively bargain with Facebook small newsrooms will need the biggest ones to sign on. With those larger organizations receiving millions of dollars from the social media giant through side deals the smaller publications could be left stranded and defenseless.

Facebook News only links to approved outlets while in the actual News Feed the algorithm spews out non-reputable clickbait based on what’s enticing the people pages and groups a user engages with the most. “The most notable thing about Facebook News is that it includes almost none of the stories that do well on the rest of Facebook” observed the Nieman Journalism Lab editor Laura Hazard Owen.

Facebook is suspiciously evasive about how many people use Facebook News and how much traffic it generates for publishers refusing to provide any indication of its scale at all. “We don’t have hard numbers” the Facebook News spokesperson Mari Melguizo said when I asked for data on its performance. “It’s definitely grown and continues to grow. It is on an upward trajectory.”

Prior to Facebook News the company had repeatedly proved to be an unreliable partner for news publishers. As Sarah Perez detailed for TechCrunch the platform established an “Instant Articles” feature in 2015 that “restricted advertising subscriptions and the recirculation modules publishers relied on” in exchange for a better user experience. It was a bad bargain and as a result many outlets abandoned the feature. Facebook promoted a “shift to video” in 2016 but inflated its video use metrics and then refused to pay publishers. This prompted layoffs at many companies including Vox Vice and Mic. Shortly before Facebook News launched Joanne Lipman a former editor in chief of USA Today warned her colleagues that they had “been at the beck and call of these behemoths” for too long.

“I think it’s a dangerous situation for news organizations to count on anything when it comes to Facebook” the Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy says. To Kennedy Facebook lost any pretense of morality when having tweaked its algorithms after the November 2020 election to favor authoritative news sources in the News Feed it switched back—presumably to boost engagement to placate right-wing publishers or both. “You pull all this together and Facebook is just the worst possible partner” Kennedy says.

The world watched an extraordinary exercise of Facebook’s massive power in February when it stymied an Australian government attempt to force it to pay to link to news. First Facebook temporarily banned Australian news sites from its platform. Then it did an end run around the regulators by agreeing to arrange multimillion-dollar deals with major news providers—on its terms not the government’s. Facebook’s head of news partnerships Campbell Brown described it as “an agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to.” In Australia the biggest recipient by far of Facebook’s largesse will be Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp which owns most of the country’s newspapers. News Corp also heavily lobbied for the new legislation. Facebook didn’t pay the country’s smaller outlets.

“In the end Google & Facebook have a big bucket of baksheesh that will go to old proprietors and their shareholders” Jeff Jarvis the director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New York tweeted in February.

As Facebook News continued to roll out across the globe in 2020 and 2021 someone did finally tell Facebook no. The German media giant Axel Springer rejected Facebook’s offer describing it as both unseemly and insufficiently lucrative: “We consider the efforts of several platforms to become news brands themselves while at the same time compensating some publishers with inappropriately low remuneration for their content as problematic” a spokesperson said. The company is now holding out for the passage of new copyright laws in Europe that it hopes will create revenue-sharing agreements “in which all publishers can transparently participate and receive reasonable compensation.”

Meanwhile in the U.S. Facebook’s need for allies in the press has taken on a particular urgency. In October 2020 a House judiciary subcommittee released a bold agenda-setting report alleging wide-ranging antitrust violations by Google Facebook Apple and Amazon. In December the Federal Trade Commission and 46 state attorneys general as well as the attorneys general for D.C. and Guam brought an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook alleging that the company is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct.

Congress is currently holding hearings on the bipartisan Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2021 which would give news organizations of all shapes and sizes the ability to negotiate collectively with the big platforms. At a March 12 hearing News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern noted that the larger media companies already have leverage with Facebook and others. “The ones most in need of collective action are small and community publishers including most particularly publishers of color who are suffering deeply in this broken marketplace for real quality journalism” he said.

HD Media which owns several West Virginia newspapers filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Google and Facebook in January seeking damages from the duopoly. The suit charges that Google’s monopolistic control of digital advertising along with a secret deal with Facebook not to compete against it had strangled their source of revenue.

In the long run reformers say it will be necessary to break up the giant platforms end their stranglehold on advertising dollars and ban algorithms that incite outrage or even violence. In the nearer term however some observers support the idea of an independent journalistic fund financed by Big Tech but operating at arm’s length that could reward news organizations according to the resources they put into their reporting and the value they contribute to their communities.

Some sort of trusted intermediary or collective agreement seems necessary because it’s hard to see direct handouts as anything more than a corrupt stopgap measure—especially when they’re mostly given to the news organizations that need the money the least.

Sonny Bill Williams has won his return to the boxing ring by the slimmest of margins as the former dual code football superstar sets up a mouth-watering prospect.

Williams appeared to try to go under the radar when the news spread on Friday that he was to fight 2-14 fighter Waikato Falefehi in Townsville on Saturday.

Williams was hoping for a secret return to the squared circle and ran from cameras as the news got out.

It meant that the questions would be asked in the ring with Williams claiming a 57-56 unanimous points victory to take his career record to 8-0 with three knockouts.

While he was bound to be rusty six years after his last bout against American Chauncy Welliver in January 2015 Williams was almost stunned after being knocked down with an eight count in the second round of the fight.

Thanks to my Tongan brother for the Seki contest tonight. Love and blessings to your family bro like you said thank God we get to go home to our beautiful families.

❤️✊🏽💯🤲🏽 pic.twitter.com/hcaXKv0mpx — Sonny Bill Williams (@SonnyBWilliams) June 26 2021

Williams appeared in exceptional shape for the fight but will need some more time in the ring before going for some bigger fish.

But it didn't stop him from calling out Barry Hall — after a couple more fights of course.

""I hope so hopefully I can get a fight or two in before then and sharpen up a bit more"" he said according to the Townsville Bulletin.

""I am just like many people here I am an avid boxing fan and I enjoy doing it. Not like footy I can cater it around my family and school drop off.

""It felt good (coming back) until I got a couple of those bombs. That is the sport of boxing you don't play boxing that is for sure. I am just doing my due diligence to respect the sport.

""It was pretty hard but after five years out I would expect nothing different. I hope everyone enjoyed that I know where I am as a boxer but I am just trying to learn as much as I can.""

Hall has just one fight in his career a draw with Gallen before revealing last month that he was getting back in the ring.

""I signed an agreement'' Hall told the You Cannot Be Serious podcast.

""Two fights in August and October. I can't say at this stage (against who) because they want to launch it and those sort of things.

""It's going to be quite a big fight. I'll have a couple more fights and that will do. I'll sail off into the sunset.""

Williams retired from rugby league after Covid ruined his $10m deal with the Toronto Wolfpack and took up a role commentating on Nine.

Former league legend turned boxer Paul Gallen said at the time that he believed that Williams would turn to boxing.

""What's that worth to a club these days? $500000? That's decent money for the average Joe but this is Sonny Bill"" Gallen said. ""He's made a whole lot of money his whole careers: is he going to play for $500000?""

Gallen said SBW could have ""three or four fights against bums and earn himself $500000 to $750000 a fight"".

Gallen said ""he'd probably get a couple of mill if he wanted to fight me"".

Fresh of his reported $1.5m payday against Justis Huni where Gallen showed he could withstand plenty of punishment before being waved off in the tenth round Gallen-Williams would be a major event.

In March Williams and Gallen jawed at each other on Channel 9 in the commentary booth.

""I've said it before and I'll say it again I'll fight Paul"" Williams said during broadcast for Channel 9.

""But I've got to do my due diligence like he had in the past few years. You know what I mean? That means sizing him up.""

Gallen replied: ""He sized me up already tonight. He goes 'You're a bit shorter than before.'

""I've got great respect for what Sonny has done in sport. But as I said it remains to be seen whether this fight will happen.

""Maybe one day me and Sonny can happen. I've said it over and over for many years now let's do it. I still have my doubts it will ever happen though big boy.""

Maybe we're one step closer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L25ybC9ucmwtcHJlbWllcnNoaXAvbnJsLTIwMjEteXZvbm5lLXNhbXBzb24tYW5ub3VuY2VkLWFzLW5ldy1ucmwtMzYwLWhvc3QtYmVuLWlraW4tcGF1bC1rZW50LWZveC1sZWFndWUvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8xMzg1MjUyODA2NTZhOWI4YWE2ZWYyMjExNjhiNzgwMtIBsAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L25ybC9ucmwtcHJlbWllcnNoaXAvbnJsLTIwMjEteXZvbm5lLXNhbXBzb24tYW5ub3VuY2VkLWFzLW5ldy1ucmwtMzYwLWhvc3QtYmVuLWlraW4tcGF1bC1rZW50LWZveC1sZWFndWUvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8xMzg1MjUyODA2NTZhOWI4YWE2ZWYyMjExNjhiNzgwMg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yvonne Sampson to replace Ben Ikin as co-host of NRL 360,"Yvonne Sampson pictured today after being announced as the new host of NRL 360.

Between 2004 and 2019 one in every four U.S. newspapers shut down and almost all the rest cut staff for a total of 36000 jobs lost between 2008 and 2019 alone. Local newspapers have been particularly devastated making it ever more difficult for people to know what is happening in their communities.

Many factors contributed to this economic collapse but none more so than the cornering of the digital advertising market by the duopoly of Facebook and Google. Facebook’s threat to a free press—and by extension to democracy—is especially pernicious. The social media company is financially asphyxiating the news industry even as it gives oxygen to conspiracy theories and lies. As a result of its many roles in degrading our democracy it faces mounting scrutiny by politicians and regulators.

Facebook has responded to the negative attention by creating a highly sophisticated public relations effort which includes becoming the number one corporate spender on federal lobbying and engaging in a massive advertising blitz aimed at the D.C. policy audience. Less well known and potentially far more dangerous is a secretive multimillion-dollar-a-year payout scheme aimed at the most influential news outlets in America. Under the cover of launching a feature called Facebook News Facebook has been funneling money to The New York Times The Washington Post The Wall Street Journal ABC News Bloomberg and other select paid partners since late 2019.

Participating in Facebook News doesn’t appear to deliver many new readers to outlets; the feature is very difficult to find and it is not integrated into individuals’ newsfeeds. What Facebook News does deliver—though to only a handful of high-profile news organizations of its choosing—is serious amounts of cash. The exact terms of these deals remain secret because Facebook insisted on nondisclosure and the news organizations agreed. The Wall Street Journal reported that the agreements were worth as much as $3 million a year and a Facebook spokesperson told me that number is “not too far off at all.” But in at least one instance the numbers are evidently much larger. In an interview last month former New York Times CEO Mark Thompson said the Times is getting “far far more” than $3 million a year—“very much so.”

Facebook has responded to negative attention by creating a highly sophisticated public relations effort which includes becoming the number one corporate spender on federal lobbying and engaging in a massive advertising blitz aimed at the D.C. policy audience.

For The New York Times whose net income was $100 million in 2020 getting “far far more” than $3 million a year with essentially no associated cost is significant. And once news outlets take any amount of money from Facebook it becomes difficult for them to let it go notes Mathew Ingram chief digital writer for the Columbia Journalism Review. “It creates a hole in your balance sheet. You’re kind of beholden to them.” It’s not exactly payola Ingram told me searching for the right metaphor. Nor is it a protection racket. “It’s like you’re a kept person” he said. “You’re Facebook’s mistress.”

There’s no evidence that the deal directly affects coverage in either the news or editorial departments. Before the Facebook News deal the Times famously published an op-ed titled “It’s Time to Break Up Facebook” by Chris Hughes a cofounder of Facebook turned critic. And since the deal columns from Tim Wu and Kara Swisher among others have been similarly critical. In December the editorial board welcomed a lawsuit calling for Facebook to be broken up.

And Facebook and Google money is admittedly all over journalism already. Virtually every major media nonprofit receives direct or indirect funding from Silicon Valley including this one. When the Monthly gets grants from do-good organizations like NewsMatch some of the funds originate with Facebook.

But these three points are beyond dispute.

First the deals are a serious breach of traditional ethics. In the pre-internet days independent newspapers wouldn’t have considered accepting gifts or sweetheart deals from entities they covered under any circumstance. The Washington Post under the editor Leonard Downie Jr. for instance wouldn’t even accept grants from nonprofits to underwrite reporting projects for fear of losing the appearance of independence. Facebook which took in $86 billion in revenue last year is a hugely controversial behemoth having profound highly newsworthy and negative effects on society. Accepting money from them creates a conflict of interest.

Even for trusted news organizations whose audiences believe they can’t be bought outright “it might come across as hypocrisy to heavily criticize an industry while also collaborating with them” says Rasmus Kleis Nielsen the director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Agreeing to keep the terms of the deal confidential is also a mistake Nielsen told me. “This sort of opacity I don’t think builds trust.”

Second these deals help Facebook maintain the public appearance of legitimacy. Journalists critics and congressional investigators have amply documented how Facebook has become a vector of disinformation and hate speech that routinely invades our privacy and undermines our democracy. For The New York Times and other pillars of American journalism to effectively partner with Facebook creates the impression that Facebook is a normal legitimate business rather than a monopolistic rogue corporation.

Finally these agreements undermine industry-wide efforts that would help the smaller ethnic and local news organizations that are most desperately in need of help. One such effort would allow the industry to bargain collectively with Facebook and other tech giants by withholding content from the platforms unless they received a fair price for it. But for that to work small newsrooms would need the biggest and most influential companies to sign on. With those organizations receiving millions of dollars from Facebook through their own side deals the smaller publications could be left stranded and defenseless.

If Facebook’s intent were to save American journalism it would be making generous offers to smaller local news organizations that do original reporting Damon Kiesow a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism told me. By contrast Facebook News “doesn’t really help anyone in the industry except for the small select group of outlets that get paid” he said. “These efforts are all flavored with a strong dose of crisis communication and regulation avoidance.”

If any major figure in the American media was going to say no to Mark Zuckerberg it was Mark Thompson.

For most of his eight-year tenure as chief executive officer of the New York Times Company Thompson was one of the industry’s most thoughtful eloquent and persuasive critics of Facebook and the danger it presents to journalism’s business models and essential role in a democracy.

“It makes my blood run cold the idea of Facebook as a publisher” he said at a June 2018 event convened by the Open Markets Institute. At a panel sponsored by the Tow Center later that month he described that same affect when Zuckerberg “starts talking about how he thinks about community and about what we trust.” Zuckerberg he said has a “terrifyingly naive perspective on news.”

During the OMI event Thompson warned darkly about the “sinister” prospect “that Facebook’s catalog of missteps with data and extreme and hateful content” will lead it to try to “set itself up as the digital world’s editor in chief prioritizing and presumably downgrading and rejecting content on a survey- and data-driven assessment of whether the provider of the content is ‘broadly trusted’ or not.”

In an exclusive interview former New York Times CEO Mark Thompson said the Times is getting “far far more” than $3 million a year in payouts from Facebook—“very much so.”

Here was actual humility from the CEO of the paper of record: “Democracy depends in part on unbounded competition between different journalistic perspectives and the clash of different judgments and opinions” he said. “History suggests that mainstream news organizations frequently get it right but also that not infrequently it is the outliers who should be listened to.”

And he knew what needed to be done. An essential preliminary step was for Facebook and others to “engage with the collective industry bodies of the news business to arrive at shared principles both on the presentation and choice of news content and on its monetization.” He called for “consistency and comparability in the treatment of news providers.”

This was not the language of shakedown. It was an impassioned and impressive philosophical argument about the survival of news—and democracy.

But then all of a sudden The New York Times and Facebook were making deals together. In October 2019 Facebook announced the launch of Facebook News with The New York Times as a marquee paid partner getting prime placement in a new vertical designated for “trusted” news sources.

What changed for Thompson between June 2018 and October 2019 such that the idea of Facebook picking which “trusted” news sources to pay went from sinister to “Sign here”?

“We always reserved our rights to do what we needed to do for our own business and to continue to fund our journalism in the interim” Thompson insisted in a phone interview in March. “I’m a sort of pragmatist” he said. “I don’t really see this as a conflict of interest or an issue of principle it’s the real world.” He rejected the depiction of the payments as a gift or a payoff. “As far as I’m concerned we were paid by a platform for access to our content.” Facebook of course does not pay The New York Times for access to its content when it is shared on regular newsfeeds.

And Thompson said that while he still thinks it would be sinister for Facebook to be making its own editorial decisions on a story-by-story basis “Facebook making it easier for people to identify The New York Times and making it easier to access The New York Times is a good thing.”

What about his devotion to collective rather than individual action? It remains—in theory. “As it happens I’m still very much in favor of broader agreements” he told me. “Ideally” he continued such payments would be “not just available . . . to the handful of big players but broadly in particular to local and regional journalism.”

So taking the deal wasn’t a betrayal of his principles Thompson insisted. “I still fundamentally believe everything I said.” With any collective agreement years away at best he said “I don’t accept that our reaching it made it harder for the other publishers to get it—on the contrary . . . I don’t think you’ve got any evidence that a refusal to engage . . . would have helped them at all.” It actually sets a good precedent he suggested. “It’s brilliant to have got a big digital platform to pay for the use of our content.”

But organizations that are favored by Facebook will obviously have different incentives going forward than those that are not. Unfavored outlets if begging doesn’t work may want to play hardball with Facebook to get their due—while the Timesand others will inevitably have qualms before blowing a hole in their budgets.

The Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha declined to address a long list of questions about the specifics of the relationship with Facebook responding instead with general comments. “Quality journalism is expensive to produce and we believe quality publishers should be fairly compensated for creating valuable journalism” she wrote in an email. The Times “does not disclose licensing and advertising terms” she wrote and “our licensing agreement with Facebook has no impact on our newsroom.”

Once news outlets take any amount of money from Facebook it becomes difficult for them to let it go notes Mathew Ingram chief digital writer for the Columbia Journalism Review. “It creates a hole in your balance sheet.

Thompson stepped down as CEO in July 2020 and was replaced by his protégé Meredith Kopit Levien who may be even more committed to the deal than Thompson was. A few months after she took over Levien expressed enthusiasm that Facebook had promised to create a space “for a particular level of quality news providers” to pay the Times “a fair amount” and to “feed your funnel.”

The Facebook News deal isn’t Facebook’s only or first inroad at the Times. The company already had a seat at the table—literally. The publisher and chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. installed the Facebook executive Rebecca Van Dyck on his 12-member board of directors in 2015. Van Dyck who was Facebook’s global head of consumer and brand marketing at the time now runs marketing for Facebook’s augmented and virtual reality labs.

Indeed the Facebook News bounty might even be dwarfed by the undisclosed sum that Facebook is pouring into the Times’s new augmented reality efforts. The newsroom’s new “AR Lab” a collaboration between Facebook and the Times builds augmented reality filters and camera effects distributed on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram.

There are likely even more ties the public doesn’t know about. BuzzFeed News recently discovered that the Times columnist David Brooks had written a pro-Facebook blog post while on salary for a nonprofit partially funded by Facebook and hadn’t disclosed it to his current Times bosses or the readers.

Thompson would have been very much alone among his U.S. peers had he resisted Facebook’s inducements. He was also hardly the most enthusiastic Facebook partner—that would be News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson who after years of vituperative attacks on Big Tech was grinning at Zuckerberg’s side at the Facebook News launch event and announcing a “new dawn” for journalists.

The rollout was undeniably a huge win for Facebook public relations. The Times story was headlined “Facebook Calls Truce With Publishers as It Unveils Facebook News.” What few negative headlines ensued were related to Facebook’s decision to include Breitbart the far-right website known for spreading white-supremacist disinformation among its cadre of “trusted” news sources—although in Breitbart’s case an unpaid one.

Months later Joshua Benton the director of the Neiman Journalism Lab described the big downside: The Facebook News deal he wrote “lets them (1) pick the publishers they want to pay (2) pick the amount of money they want to pay them (3) get publishers to stop complaining at least hopefully and (4) get headlines like ‘Facebook Offers News Outlets Millions of Dollars a Year’ in the hopes that they can stave off government regulation or taxation.” Facebook isn’t spending the money “because they think News Tab will be profitable” Benton wrote. “It’s a way to solve a PR and policy problem.” The vaunted new product he noted consists of “a new tab buried so deep in Facebook’s interface you need a spelunker’s headlamp to find it.”

To collectively bargain with Facebook small newsrooms will need the biggest ones to sign on. With those larger organizations receiving millions of dollars from the social media giant through side deals the smaller publications could be left stranded and defenseless.

Facebook News only links to approved outlets while in the actual News Feed the algorithm spews out non-reputable clickbait based on what’s enticing the people pages and groups a user engages with the most. “The most notable thing about Facebook News is that it includes almost none of the stories that do well on the rest of Facebook” observed the Nieman Journalism Lab editor Laura Hazard Owen.

Facebook is suspiciously evasive about how many people use Facebook News and how much traffic it generates for publishers refusing to provide any indication of its scale at all. “We don’t have hard numbers” the Facebook News spokesperson Mari Melguizo said when I asked for data on its performance. “It’s definitely grown and continues to grow. It is on an upward trajectory.”

Prior to Facebook News the company had repeatedly proved to be an unreliable partner for news publishers. As Sarah Perez detailed for TechCrunch the platform established an “Instant Articles” feature in 2015 that “restricted advertising subscriptions and the recirculation modules publishers relied on” in exchange for a better user experience. It was a bad bargain and as a result many outlets abandoned the feature. Facebook promoted a “shift to video” in 2016 but inflated its video use metrics and then refused to pay publishers. This prompted layoffs at many companies including Vox Vice and Mic. Shortly before Facebook News launched Joanne Lipman a former editor in chief of USA Today warned her colleagues that they had “been at the beck and call of these behemoths” for too long.

“I think it’s a dangerous situation for news organizations to count on anything when it comes to Facebook” the Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy says. To Kennedy Facebook lost any pretense of morality when having tweaked its algorithms after the November 2020 election to favor authoritative news sources in the News Feed it switched back—presumably to boost engagement to placate right-wing publishers or both. “You pull all this together and Facebook is just the worst possible partner” Kennedy says.

The world watched an extraordinary exercise of Facebook’s massive power in February when it stymied an Australian government attempt to force it to pay to link to news. First Facebook temporarily banned Australian news sites from its platform. Then it did an end run around the regulators by agreeing to arrange multimillion-dollar deals with major news providers—on its terms not the government’s. Facebook’s head of news partnerships Campbell Brown described it as “an agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to.” In Australia the biggest recipient by far of Facebook’s largesse will be Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp which owns most of the country’s newspapers. News Corp also heavily lobbied for the new legislation. Facebook didn’t pay the country’s smaller outlets.

“In the end Google & Facebook have a big bucket of baksheesh that will go to old proprietors and their shareholders” Jeff Jarvis the director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New York tweeted in February.

As Facebook News continued to roll out across the globe in 2020 and 2021 someone did finally tell Facebook no. The German media giant Axel Springer rejected Facebook’s offer describing it as both unseemly and insufficiently lucrative: “We consider the efforts of several platforms to become news brands themselves while at the same time compensating some publishers with inappropriately low remuneration for their content as problematic” a spokesperson said. The company is now holding out for the passage of new copyright laws in Europe that it hopes will create revenue-sharing agreements “in which all publishers can transparently participate and receive reasonable compensation.”

Meanwhile in the U.S. Facebook’s need for allies in the press has taken on a particular urgency. In October 2020 a House judiciary subcommittee released a bold agenda-setting report alleging wide-ranging antitrust violations by Google Facebook Apple and Amazon. In December the Federal Trade Commission and 46 state attorneys general as well as the attorneys general for D.C. and Guam brought an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook alleging that the company is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct.

Congress is currently holding hearings on the bipartisan Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2021 which would give news organizations of all shapes and sizes the ability to negotiate collectively with the big platforms. At a March 12 hearing News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern noted that the larger media companies already have leverage with Facebook and others. “The ones most in need of collective action are small and community publishers including most particularly publishers of color who are suffering deeply in this broken marketplace for real quality journalism” he said.

HD Media which owns several West Virginia newspapers filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Google and Facebook in January seeking damages from the duopoly. The suit charges that Google’s monopolistic control of digital advertising along with a secret deal with Facebook not to compete against it had strangled their source of revenue.

In the long run reformers say it will be necessary to break up the giant platforms end their stranglehold on advertising dollars and ban algorithms that incite outrage or even violence. In the nearer term however some observers support the idea of an independent journalistic fund financed by Big Tech but operating at arm’s length that could reward news organizations according to the resources they put into their reporting and the value they contribute to their communities.

Some sort of trusted intermediary or collective agreement seems necessary because it’s hard to see direct handouts as anything more than a corrupt stopgap measure—especially when they’re mostly given to the news organizations that need the money the least. As Doug Reynolds the managing partner for the West Virginia newspapers suing Facebook and Google for damages told me “If the future of this industry is that we’re dependent on their goodwill then we don’t have an independent press anymore.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG9yaW5nL2Nhci1hZHZpY2UvdGhyZWUtb2YtdGhlLW1vc3QtYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1taWRzaXplLWh5YnJpZC1zdXZzLWNvbXBhcmVkL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvN2MyZWM1NGZmZjQwZjBiNDVhYzE5ODAxY2FhYjQ2NDPSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tb3RvcmluZy9jYXItYWR2aWNlL3RocmVlLW9mLXRoZS1tb3N0LWFmZm9yZGFibGUtbWlkc2l6ZS1oeWJyaWQtc3V2cy1jb21wYXJlZC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzdjMmVjNTRmZmY0MGYwYjQ1YWMxOTgwMWNhYWI0NjQzP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best hybrid SUV revealed,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/car-advice/three-of-the-most-affordable-midsize-hybrid-suvs-compared/news-story/7c2ec54fff40f0b45ac19801caab4643 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG9yaW5nL2Nhci1hZHZpY2UvdGhyZWUtb2YtdGhlLW1vc3QtYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1taWRzaXplLWh5YnJpZC1zdXZzLWNvbXBhcmVkL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvN2MyZWM1NGZmZjQwZjBiNDVhYzE5ODAxY2FhYjQ2NDPSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3cy5jb20uYXUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tb3RvcmluZy9jYXItYWR2aWNlL3RocmVlLW9mLXRoZS1tb3N0LWFmZm9yZGFibGUtbWlkc2l6ZS1oeWJyaWQtc3V2cy1jb21wYXJlZC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzdjMmVjNTRmZmY0MGYwYjQ1YWMxOTgwMWNhYWI0NjQzP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9zcG9ydC9zb25ueS1iaWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLXN1cnZpdmVkLXNpeC15ZWFyLWJveGluZy1zY2FyZS1jYWxscy1vdXQtYmFycnktaGFsbC9USk1DVVdZTDdZR1hXRFhGQUpSRTJZNDNYUS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sonny Bill Williams survived six-year boxing scare calls out Barry Hall,"Sonny Bill Williams.

Sonny Bill Williams has won his return to the boxing ring by the slimmest of margins as the former dual code football superstar sets up a mouth-watering prospect.

Williams appeared to try to go under the radar when the news spread on Friday that he was to fight 2-14 fighter Waikato Falefehi in Townsville on Saturday.

Williams was hoping for a secret return to the squared circle and ran from cameras as the news got out.

It meant that the questions would be asked in the ring with Williams claiming a 57-56 unanimous points victory to take his career record to 8-0 with three knockouts.

While he was bound to be rusty six years after his last bout against American Chauncy Welliver in January 2015 Williams was almost stunned after being knocked down with an eight count in the second round of the fight.

Thanks to my Tongan brother for the Seki contest tonight. Love and blessings to your family bro like you said thank God we get to go home to our beautiful families.

❤️✊🏽💯🤲🏽 pic.twitter.com/hcaXKv0mpx — Sonny Bill Williams (@SonnyBWilliams) June 26 2021

Williams appeared in exceptional shape for the fight but will need some more time in the ring before going for some bigger fish.

But it didn't stop him from calling out Barry Hall — after a couple more fights of course.

""I hope so hopefully I can get a fight or two in before then and sharpen up a bit more"" he said according to the Townsville Bulletin.

""I am just like many people here I am an avid boxing fan and I enjoy doing it. Not like footy I can cater it around my family and school drop off.

""It felt good (coming back) until I got a couple of those bombs. That is the sport of boxing you don't play boxing that is for sure. I am just doing my due diligence to respect the sport.

""It was pretty hard but after five years out I would expect nothing different. I hope everyone enjoyed that I know where I am as a boxer but I am just trying to learn as much as I can.""

Hall has just one fight in his career a draw with Gallen before revealing last month that he was getting back in the ring.

""I signed an agreement'' Hall told the You Cannot Be Serious podcast.

""Two fights in August and October. I can't say at this stage (against who) because they want to launch it and those sort of things.

""It's going to be quite a big fight. I'll have a couple more fights and that will do. I'll sail off into the sunset.""

Williams retired from rugby league after Covid ruined his $10m deal with the Toronto Wolfpack and took up a role commentating on Nine.

Former league legend turned boxer Paul Gallen said at the time that he believed that Williams would turn to boxing.

""What's that worth to a club these days? $500000? That's decent money for the average Joe but this is Sonny Bill"" Gallen said. ""He's made a whole lot of money his whole careers: is he going to play for $500000?""

Gallen said SBW could have ""three or four fights against bums and earn himself $500000 to $750000 a fight"".

Gallen said ""he'd probably get a couple of mill if he wanted to fight me"".

Fresh of his reported $1.5m payday against Justis Huni where Gallen showed he could withstand plenty of punishment before being waved off in the tenth round Gallen-Williams would be a major event.

In March Williams and Gallen jawed at each other on Channel 9 in the commentary booth.

""I've said it before and I'll say it again I'll fight Paul"" Williams said during broadcast for Channel 9.

""But I've got to do my due diligence like he had in the past few years. You know what I mean? That means sizing him up.""

Gallen replied: ""He sized me up already tonight. He goes 'You're a bit shorter than before.'

""I've got great respect for what Sonny has done in sport. But as I said it remains to be seen whether this fight will happen.

""Maybe one day me and Sonny can happen. I've said it over and over for many years now let's do it. I still have my doubts it will ever happen though big boy.""

Maybe we're one step closer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L25ybC9ucmwtcHJlbWllcnNoaXAvbnJsLTIwMjEteXZvbm5lLXNhbXBzb24tYW5ub3VuY2VkLWFzLW5ldy1ucmwtMzYwLWhvc3QtYmVuLWlraW4tcGF1bC1rZW50LWZveC1sZWFndWUvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8xMzg1MjUyODA2NTZhOWI4YWE2ZWYyMjExNjhiNzgwMtIBsAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L25ybC9ucmwtcHJlbWllcnNoaXAvbnJsLTIwMjEteXZvbm5lLXNhbXBzb24tYW5ub3VuY2VkLWFzLW5ldy1ucmwtMzYwLWhvc3QtYmVuLWlraW4tcGF1bC1rZW50LWZveC1sZWFndWUvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS8xMzg1MjUyODA2NTZhOWI4YWE2ZWYyMjExNjhiNzgwMg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yvonne Sampson to replace Ben Ikin as co-host of NRL 360,"Yvonne Sampson pictured today after being announced as the new host of NRL 360.

“Ben is very hard to replace. He is recognised as a voice of reason youngest ever Origin player played for Australia and you’d have to walk a long way to find someone that doesn’t like Ben Ikin and Vonnie is the same” said Fox Sports Executive Director Steve Crawley.

“I watch people’s reactions to Vonnie and she is one of the very few prominent television people who isn’t criticised. I’m sure there has been some critical comment here and there — that’s life.

Special to the Palm Beach Post

Florida Power & Light employee Barbara Thompson of Jupiter loved reading dinosaur books to her son when he was little.

So when she needed to choose a book to read for FPL’s annual Power to Care Serving Apart Together campaign Thompson read “Dinosaur Parade” by Shari Halpern.

“For me being able to read a book — that I truly enjoyed — on video for kids to watch and listen was a gift” said Thompson communication specialist at FPL. “I hope that some child will see how much fun it can be to read a book about something you like and seeing the video can make a difference for them.”

More than 700 Palm Beach County employees participated in the company's 13th annual volunteer campaign this spring. In total employees and their families signed up for more than 1100 service project opportunities across 25 Florida counties.

This year Power to Care was reimagined for COVID-19. Service projects were designed to be done remotely with family so FPL employees could serve their communities together but safely apart.

“FPL works with the communities we serve to help make them better places to live work and raise a family and our Power to Care volunteering campaign is one way we give back” said Thomas Bean director of public and community engagement at FPL. “This year due to the remote nature of the campaign this year employees across the entire company were able to help make a difference in their communities.”

In total FPL had volunteers across 25 Florida counties participate in service projects. There were four service projects that employees could register for:

Power to Clean litter pickup project: Employees and their families cleaned up their communities in honor of Earth Day with a Power to Clean kit they received from FPL.

Literacy project: In partnership with Reading Is Fundamental’s “Until Every Child Reads” initiative employees filmed themselves reading a book. These recorded stories are now featured on the organization’s virtual library for children helping to inspire a passion for reading and creating more engaged readers.

Paracord survival bracelet project: Employees and their families assembled paracord survival bracelets for military service members and frontline workers in partnership with Operation Gratitude. These bracelets will be included in care packages as a “thank you” to our heroes.

Letter-writing project: Employees and their families wrote letters of appreciation and encouragement to military service members and frontline workers in partnership with Operation Gratitude. These letters will be included in care packages to bring joy to our heroes.

In addition Gina Sicbaldi of Palm Beach Gardens and her family donated 230 Beanie Babies to Operation Gratitude to be included in care packages the organization sends to deployed troops.

This was FPL’s first year executing the campaign fully virtually. It was able to expand participation to include NextEra Energy employees in other states and saw a lot of engagement:

More than 2400 paracord survival bracelets were made in partnership with Operation Gratitude.

More than letters of appreciation and encouragement were written to military service members and frontline workers in partnership with Operation Gratitude.

More than 500 employees and their families honored Earth Day by picking up litter in their local communities.

More than 180 volunteers recorded themselves reading a book in partnership with Reading Is Fundamental’s “Until Every Child Reads” initiative.

Power to Care caught on quickly with FPL employees and executives.

“We didn’t know what to expect when we offered the remote volunteering options” Bean said. “We hoped several hundred would sign up. We passed that within hours and ultimately had more than 1000 employees sign up.”

As more people are getting vaccinated and COVID guidelines evolve accordingly Bean expects to get back to doing more in-person volunteering.

“We also think there will be opportunities to do more remote volunteering that engages our employees across multiple communities” he said.

Bean usually brings his kids out in their green Power to Care shirts to a clean-up project so they can see that serving others is time well spent. He likes for them to share in the positive experience.

Pam Rauch is the vice president of external affairs and economic development at Florida Power & Light Co. She participated in the literacy project by filming herself reading the children’s book “Fancy Nancy” by Jane O’Conner. This video recording is now featured on the company’s virtual library for children helping to inspire a passion for reading and creating more engaged readers.

As for Thompson reading about dinosaurs brought her back to her days as a young mom searching for a way to get her now 16-year-old son excited about reading.

“When 'Dinosaur Parade' arrived the first thing I did was have my son pronounce all of the dinosaur names for me” she said. “He still knows them all!”

Thompson volunteers at school and at work. She’s been a member of the School Advisory Council at her son’s schools (elementary middle and now high) and mentored a Boys & Girls Club Youth of the Year winner this past fall and winter.

All her volunteering makes Power to Care a special week — even in this virtual year.

“This year was very different volunteering remotely especially feeling that the need for so many was greater than it had ever been in the past” Thompson said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The results? Pretty freaking stellar. In fact Nike shares surged more than 15% and hit a record intraday high of $154.59 the very next day.

2021 Earnings Call Highlights

Words you could use to describe what The Swoosh did to The Street’s estimates: beat crushed smashed demolished eviscerated. Your choice.

Nike outperformed expectations by about every metric possible:

North American revenue up 141% vs. 2020

North American digital sales up 54% vs. 2020 and 177% vs. 2019

Chinese sales up 17% year-over-year with the driver being equipment sales

Gross margins up 850 bps or 8.5% (which is like…a lot of basis points)

Earnings per share of $0.93 beating estimates by $0.42

Take a deep breath. That’s a lot to unpack. (Imagine how I felt listening to CEO John Donahoe wax poetic about margins strategic positioning and omni-channel distribution on Nike’s earnings call. But I digress.)

Here were my three main takeaways:

1. Women’s Apparel Is The Future

In 2021 Nike women’s products outperformed men’s (20% growth vs. 11%) and represented 24% of the total merchandising revenue for the company.

Year-over-year growth for the women’s segment was clearly a point of pride for the company as they spent ample time discussing initiatives like revamping WNBA merchandise for the 2021 season.

An $8 billion revenue figure is a huge indication of things to come — and Nike appears fully committed to innovating in women’s sports.

2. The Situation in China Is Unprecedented

Nike’s growth in the Chinese market should not be underestimated. Revenue in the nation jumped 51% year-over-year in Q3 2021 alone.

Prior to the pandemic Nike had already experienced periods of double-digit growth in China from 2015-2019 and also benefited from the Chinese government’s investment in sports and the country’s growing middle class.

However disputes over alleged forced cotton production in the western region of Xinjiang have still been a large point of contention.

Earlier in the year Nike and H&M independently made statements of concern over their potential involvement in the controversial supply chain.

China vehemently denounced the claims and jabbed back.

Chinese celebrities cut ties with brands like Nike who participated in the Better Cotton Initiative.

H&M was removed from various e-commerce stores in the country.

Nike was also removed from many of the largest Chinese e-commerce apps — a clear push from the government to boycott the Swoosh.

All of that said Q4 results indicate that demand for Nike is alive and well in China.

3. Digital Digital and More Digital

Nike made it clear back at its 2017 investor day that shifting toward a DTC-centric model was a top priority.

A move away from traditional retail and its price segmentation strategy — shipping exclusive sneakers to high-end boutiques while Air Monarchs are relegated to DSW — was at the time a big decision for Nike.

How has it worked? Splendidly.

Digital revenue grew from $34 billion in 2017 to $42 billion in 2021. The percentage of Nike’s revenue coming from DTC sales jumped from 28% to 39% in the same period.

Q4 of fiscal 2020 was a dark spot though — Nike’s worst quarter of the pandemic:

Earnings per share dropped by $0.51

$6.31 billion in Q4 2020 revenue vs. $10.1 billion in Q4 2019

Net income sank to $790 million vs. $989 million a year earlier

But the push to digital was a saving grace. In that same miserable quarter Nike’s e-commerce sales grew 54%.

Digital is at the forefront of top dog Donahoe’s strategy.

In late 2019 Nike cut ties with a little known online retailer based out of Seattle: Amazon. This past March Nike went through another round of cuts — DSW Urban Outfitters Macy’s Olympia Sports and Big 5 were all dropped in favor of the company’s OneNike digital strategy.

On the other hand Nike beefed up its relationships with Dick’s Foot Locker and Nordstrom. These retailers allow Nike to uniquely position the brand — with a heavy emphasis on in-store initiatives that drive engagement.

Nike is opening up to 200 new owned and operated stores that are intended to be smaller more intimate and most importantly — more digital. Competitors are on a similar trajectory.

Adidas stated in March that its sales would be 50% DTC by 2025.

Puma’s DTC sales were up 19.2% YTD in April — e-commerce made up 57.2% of that total.

In an age where digital commerce is ubiquitous Nike is going about as all-in as possible.

Where Do We Go From Here?

All in all the question remains whether or not Nike’s investment in digital will allow it to scale the same way its wholesaler price segmentation model did.

My bet would be that it absolutely can and will. The moat created by Nike is so wide that it will be difficult for anyone to impede on the brand’s progress.

The shoes are inspired by hip hop according to notes from the brand per WWD. Specifically the sneaker’s design is drawn from the album art for It Takes Two by Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock. The image shows E-Z Rock wearing a Nike Air Force 1 basketball trainer customized with a Louis Vuitton swoosh.

“The cover embodied the hip hop community’s early practice of hacking together high fashion and sportswear sidelining diverging brands with equal reverence. A cultural symbol in its own right today the Nike Air Force 1 serves as an objet d’art emblematic of self-generated subcultural provenance” Louis Vuitton wrote in its collection notes.

The Louis Vuitton Air Force 1s are set to be released in 21 colorways. They made their debut Thursday in Paris during Abloh’s spring/summer men’s 2022 collection show. To showcase the collection Abloh created the film Amen Break which stars GZA Goldie Saul Williams Issa Perica Caleb JIM JOE Kandis Williams Thelma Buabeng Octavia Burgel Lupe Fiasco Damian Eugene Nagisa Williams and others.

“I always work in polar opposites and I’m always dialoguing with the formality of Louis Vuitton and the contemporariness of youth culture today — almost like a generation discovering luxury again and I’m the conduit” Abloh told WWD.

“We have straight-up A-line skirts. It’s liberating in 2021… The next thing in fashion isn’t in fashion. It’s in people it’s in the atmosphere it’s in the streets it’s in the socio-political” he continued. “Decision gender diversity — those aren’t even hot topics. That’s top line. That’s already been established. Now it’s developing menswear into showing the freedom that can be.”

In regards to the Air Force 1s Louis Vuitton has not shared a release date. Nevertheless the collaboration marks another accomplishment for Abloh who began his official partnership with Nike by reinventing 10 models of sneakers for his initial “The Ten” project in 2017.

(“AEye”) the global leader in active high-performance LiDAR solutions today announced the appointment of Hod Finkelstein as Chief R&D Officer. A technology and business veteran Finkelstein brings deep experience spearheading the development and commercialization of strategic and disruptive technologies including LiDAR.

Finkelstein joins AEye from Sense Photonics where as CTO he defined the company’s technology direction and led its LiDAR development activities. He started his career at Intel designing the early Pentium chips and was in charge of semiconductor technologies at Mellanox Technologies. During his PhD he invented the first generic-CMOS Single-Photon-Avalanche-Diodes (SPADs) which are widely used in LiDARs today and first demonstrated arrays of these devices. Hod was Director of Technology Development at DNA sequencing giant Illumina where he managed the development of on-chip CMOS DNA sequencers and was later CTO at TruTag Technologies where he conceptualized and developed award-winning handheld and battery-operated hyperspectral cameras.

“Hod is a brilliant technology and business leader highly respected for his work advancing disruptive semiconductor and optical sensor technologies” said Luis Dussan Founder and CTO at AEye. “Hod is a visionary technologist who perfectly complements and extends AEye’s seasoned management team. He is a key strategic addition as we accelerate commercialization of our leading-edge LiDAR system in various markets.”

AEye’s active LiDAR system overcomes the pitfalls of conventional LiDAR with a uniquely intelligent approach called iDAR™ (Intelligent Detection and Ranging). This high-performance LiDAR has set standards for LiDAR range resolution and speed across all major metrics. iDAR is based on a bi-static architecture – which keeps the transmit and receive channels separate: as each laser pulse is transmitted the solid-state receiver is told where and when to look for its return – enabling deterministic artificial intelligence to be introduced into the sensing process at the point of acquisition. Ultimately this establishes the iDAR platform as active – allowing it to focus on what matters most while simultaneously monitoring the vehicle’s surroundings resulting in greater reliability safety and performance at longer range and lower cost.

“I am delighted to join the AEye team and to play a key role in advancing AEye’s disruptive LiDAR system” said Finkelstein. “AEye’s approach to create an integrated perception system that brings together software extensibility artificial intelligence and smart agile sensors is exceptional and I look forward to continuing the company’s groundbreaking innovation and its relentless customer-focus.”

AEye’s customers and partners have the ability to engage in a live test drive with an AEye engineer from the comfort of their own home or office via AEye’s interactive web-based demo platform Raptor.

He shot 61 that Saturday hitting 12 or 14 fairways and 16 of 18 greens then went on to win the tournament the following day. Two months later he won the Northern Trust the first event in the FedEx Cup playoffs. Two weeks later he won the Tour Championship and the $15 million check that comes with it.

Johnson started that third round of the 2020 Travelers Championship six shots off the lead. A 65 at TPC River Highlands put him just three shots behind the leaders after he signed his scorecard. In other words he’s lurking again.

“It’s nice this week obviously playing solid and to birdie the last two yesterday to make the cut. I definitely wanted to be here for the weekend” Johnson said. “Obviously to go out today and shoot a nice score it was good.”

Today’s performance was eerily similar to Johnson’s third round here last year. He hit 11 of 14 fairways this time and 16 of 18 greens in regulation again. He also putted extremely well making birdie putts from 8 11 9 and 7 feet before draining a 43-footer on the par-5 13th hole.

When asked if he was one good round away from being back and regaining the form that took him to No. 1 in the world Johnson supplied a surprising answer.

“I have plenty of good rounds. The good rounds doesn’t matter” he said. “It’s more my shots just seeing the right shape and hitting them solid and consistency with my shots and distance control. Then I know I’m starting to play well.”

Here's What You Need To Know: The plane will be a drone and will also be able to launch attacks in addition to spying.

Long a source of speculation throughout the defense commentary sphere the SR-72 “Son of Blackbird” next-generation drone has been mired in mystery for over a decade.

The SR-72 is the planned successor to the SR-71 the iconic Cold War-era reconnaissance plane that shattered world records for the fastest manned airbreathing jet engine aircraft. Initial reports emerged as early as 2007 but it was only in 2013 that Lockheed Martin official Robert Weiss publicly confirmed that the company had made significant headway into developing a hypersonic plane that he called the “SR-72.” Lockheed Martin proceeded to release widely shared concept art for the project—the SR-72 appears to be an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) boasting a groundbreaking purported top speed approaching Mach 6.

In yet another difference with its manned SR-71 predecessor the SR-72 is a reconnaissance and surveillance craft that doubles as a strike weapon. The UAV will reportedly support hypersonic armaments such as Lockheed Martin’s High Speed Strike Weapon (HSSW) making the SR-72 a potent tool for delivering precision strikes against agile or otherwise hard-to-reach targets.

Following a four-year information drought Lockheed Martin dropped the announcement that the SR-72 will enter development by the early 2020s. Lockheed rationalized this prolonged interlude on the grounds that the technologies required to produce a plane that fast were not yet sufficiently mature: “Without the digital transformation the aircraft you see there could not have been made. In fact five years ago it could not have been made” said Lockheed Vice President Jack O’Banion referencing an artist’s SR-72 rendering presented at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ annual SciTech Forum in 2018. O’Banion’s statement seemed to imply that an SR-72 prototype or concept demonstrator already exists prompting fevered interest from defense observers. Lockheed refused to clarify his comments adding to what increasingly seems to be the company’s purposely cultivated aura of mystery surrounding the SR-72.

“We couldn’t have made the engine itself—it would have melted down into slag if we had tried to produce it five years ago” O’Banion added. “But now we can digitally print that engine with an incredibly sophisticated cooling system integral into the material of the engine itself and have that engine survive for multiple firings for routine operation.”

Lockheed Martin maintains that an SR-72 concept demonstrator will take to the skies by the mid-2020s possibly entering service as soon as 2030. However unanswered questions—and serious design challenges—linger. For one it remains unclear exactly how the SR-72 is piloted; will it be operated in real-time by remote pilots or will it boast a sufficiently robust artificial intelligence (AI) suite to run missions with either no or minimal manual control? Further still scramjet engine development is notoriously costly and complex. It will likely take many years and colossal investment for a possible SR-72 prototype to be realized as a serially-produced model.

It remains to be seen whether or not Lockheed manages to secure the considerable funding required to mass-produce a product as complex and cutting-edge as the SR-72 especially when it’s unclear what specific pressing operational purpose it is supposed to fill. From sophisticated satellite surveillance methods to the next-generation B-21 bomber and Northrop Grumman’s new RQ-180 stealth drone the U.S. military seems to have somewhat covered many of the individual capabilities being offered by the SR-72.

Windows isn't the only platform to game on though and no we're not talking about the Mac.

PC gaming on Linux is growing in popularity and one of the biggest driving forces behind that is Valve. Not only does Steam offer a big selection of native Linux games but it also has Proton which enables a large array of Windows-only games to play on Linux.

In the case of Proton Valve has been working with Nvidia to bring its DLSS magic to Linux gamers and the first fruits of this are now out in the wild. There are only a few games initially and right now it requires a beta driver. But it works. Hoo boy does it work.

How to use DLSS on Linux

The good news is that eventually you won't have to do anything. Nvidia will provide the necessary drivers and Steam will do the work with Proton. As on Windows all you'll need to do is boot up your games and turn it on in settings.

Right now however it's a different story. The initial driver is a beta which means it isn't pushing out through the usual channels. Installing it will be different across distros I'm sure but on Pop!_OS I had to purge the existing Nvidia driver reboot then install the beta driver. And even then there have been issues and other tools on my PC now don't work properly with the beta driver.

The driver is available directly from Nvidia and other than getting it installed you have to choose Proton Experimental in Steam Play settings. The next general Proton release will likely include support for DLSS but for now it's this one.

The rest is done in-game. Exactly where you find it will vary but your 'advanced' graphics settings are the best place to start looking.

DLSS on Linux is actually magical

DLSS is an unsung hero in PC gaming despite Nvidia's continued push it can get overlooked next to sexier tech like RTX ray tracing. But DLSS is what you really want in your games. Ray tracing slows everything down DLSS accelerates it. If you want to know more in-depth about the tech then our explainer is a good place to start. But the tl;dr is that it gives you a better frame rate without any noticeable drop in quality and in many cases even lets you play at a higher resolution.

The implementation on Linux is identical to on Windows with one key differentiator. DLSS on Linux is running on a Windows game so all of this is going through additional compatibility layers just to exist at all. And that's pretty mind-blowing.

It also helps narrow the performance gap in supported games to their comparable frame rates on Windows 10. But what does this look like in reality? For this a test rig made up of an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X Nvidia RTX 3060 and 16GB of 3200MHz RAM.

(Image credit: TechRadar)

I've tested it in two games No Man's Sky and Wolfenstein: Youngblood and the impact is the same in both. Unnoticeable quality differences and a serious uptick in frame rate. In No Man's Sky performance was generally 20-30 FPS better with DLSS enabled on the balanced setting. This was at 1080p with maxed-out graphics settings though stability seemed worse than usual in this game which could also be attributed to using a beta driver and Proton Experimental. Nevertheless DLSS makes a significant improvement.

In Wolfenstein: Youngblood it's a similar tale. At 1080p using the Uber graphics setting (but without film grain and chromatic aberration which I detest) and the built-in benchmark DLSS on balanced was worth a 37 FPS average improvement. Not small figures we're dealing with here.

(Image credit: TechRadar)

What's next for DLSS on Linux?

The next immediate step is for it to be included in the regular driver and a future release of Proton. This could also net further bonus gains as the popular custom Proton version GloriousEggroll will no doubts get DLSS baked in as well as any additional tweaks it brings.

Right now the biggest limitation is that it only works on Vulkan hence the launch titles that also include DOOM: Eternal. Later this year that is supposed to expand to DirectX games through Proton but there's no time frame on that and it could always slip back.

But what it does do is bring Linux gaming even closer to an equal playing field with Windows. Playing these titles through Proton there's no indicator you're on Linux and not Windows and that's exactly what we want. There doesn't need to be a native Linux port if it can run through Proton this well and have access to DLSS trickery.

Windows 11 could send gamers looking elsewhere and as each day passes Linux becomes a more and more viable alternative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvZGVsbHMtb21uaWEtYXV0b21hdGVzLWhwYy1wb3dlcmVkZ2UtZ2V0cy1udmlkaWEtcmVmcmVzaC8yMDIxLzA2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dell's Omnia Automates HPC PowerEdge Gets Nvidia Refresh,"Dell Technologies today announced the general availability of Omnia its open source platform for managing high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.

Omnia is an open source set of Ansible Playbooks developed by Dell’s HPC and AI innovation team in partnership with Intel and the broader HPC community. If this sounds familiar Dell quietly released Omnia on Github earlier this year.

The platform automates the process of downloading and installing open source software for things like cluster management application execution accelerator drivers frameworks applications and platforms and it manages systems running Slurm or Kubernetes explained Caitlin Gordon VP of product management at Dell Technologies.

“It’s all about simplifying and easing the development and the management of high-performance clusters for not just HPC but AI” she said.

And because these automations are built on Ansible Playbooks “you can compose and recompose the stack based on what you need” Gordon said. “We’re really taking an infrastructure as code approach here.”

This she added allows users to compose HPC deployments around a wide variety of workloads and hardware from multiple vendors. “Of course because its open source it can be shaped to whatever your needs are” Gordon said. “We’ll continue to integrate the latest open source tools but we also even more importantly have the collective power of the HPC community already working behind this.”

Arizona State University one of Dell Technology’s HPC and AI centers for excellence is among the first to deploy Omnia and begin contributing to its development according to Gordon.

Dell HPC Nabs VMware Support PowerEdge Gets Nvidia Upgrade

Dell Technologies also extended support for VMware to its HPC on-Demand program which launched last year.

“Being able to consume things as a service be able to access resources as you need them be able to move faster and simply pay for what you’re using. That’s really what HPC on demand is all about” Gordon said. “It’s really about being able to support our customers who may not have the resources or may not want to invest in their own infrastructure and people because their HPC workloads maybe are inconsistent and/or maybe they need to complement what they already have in their environment with a secondary environment to burst to.”

With support for VMware Cloud Foundation VMware Cloud Director and VMware vRealize Operations customers can now extend these capabilities beyond single-tenant environments to include multi-tenant use cases.

Meanwhile Dell Tech is adding Nvidia A10 and A30 GPUs to its PowerEdge server portfolio. “These are really ideal for things like VDI inferencing and interactive rendering” Gordon said.

Nvidia A-series GPUs are now available on the PowerEdge R750 R750XA and R7525 models.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd2luLmdnL25ld3MvbnZpZGlhLWh1ZC1yZW1vdmFsLWlzLW1ha2luZy1mbGFzaC1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMtaW4tdmFsb3JhbnQtZHlzZnVuY3Rpb25hbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA hud removal is making flash capabilities in Valorant dysfunctional,"NVIDIA GeForce’s settings have been messing with the Valorant flashes.

Annoying Valorant flashes recently got tweaked in patch 3.00 but an unofficial NVIDIA nerf is rendering them useless. Players have discovered that the blindside effect can be turned off by removing the HUD from NVIDIA settings.

The GE force Experience may help you record cool plays to flex on your followers and friends but it can also help you get free kills in patch 3.0. A weird bug triggered with NVIDIA is making the rounds among players confused as to why some enemies are retaliating despite the flash. Turns out the software is triggering a bug which makes players immune to all flash abilities in Valorant except for Reyna’s leer.

A Reddit user posted a clip from practice range where Kay/O’s flash ball bounced off the floor and washed the screen in powder blue. However the same ability failed to have any impact when the player turned off the Valorant HUD. As soon as the bars across the screen turned off the player became immune to the blinding effects.

This bug can be game-breaking in competitive matches where flashes are one of the most overpowered agent abilities. By turning off the HUD players can easily dodge the flashbangs without turning away. This particular ability has caused a lot of nuisance among players and NVIDIA has finally delivered a temporary fix. The bug applies to all agents including Pheonix Breach and Skye which is rather worrying for main flasher players.

A few hours after the bug post gained traction players confirmed that it’s not working anymore in ranked games or practice range. The players figured that the developer might have instantly patched it due to the severity of the glitch. However many others reported that it could still be triggered on occasion if you kept spamming flashes with HUD turned off. The developer hasn’t officially addressed the game-breaking glitch but players are torn whether it’s actually been fixed or not.

Considering the bug’s severity the developer may roll out a hotfix as it can easily be exploited in ranked games. Many other bugs have also been reported since Kay/O entered the roster with Episode 3 and the developer was quick to patch most of them. To be safe players should refrain from playing solo ranked games till a proper fix has been delivered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL252aWRpYS1pbmNyZWFzZS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXJ0eC0zMDYwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia to Increase Production of its RTX 3060 Card from July Prices Dropping,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL252aWRpYS1pbmNyZWFzZS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXJ0eC0zMDYwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS92YWxvcmFudC9yaW90LWdhbWVzLXNlZW1zLWRpc2FibGVkLW52aWRpYS1nYW1lLWZpbHRlcnMtdmFsb3JhbnQtZHVlLWdhbWUtYnJlYWtpbmctZmxhc2gtYnVn0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Riot Games disabled NVIDIA game filters in Valorant due to game-breaking ""Flash Bug""","With Episode 3 finally going live the new Valorant patch does seem to be causing a lot of problems for NVIDIA users.

Recently the developers seem to have disabled the driver’s game filters in the shooter which allowed players to personalize the appearance of their game the way they wanted to.

NVIDIA Freestyle was launched a while back that provided users with the tools to customize games like Valorant and change the shooter's appearance through the application of real-time post-processing filters.

Hence certain filter types can be used to make Valorant look like a game out of a retro cinema. However not all filters are just for fun as some of them can be used to enhance Valorant’s color and contrast to provide players with a better gameplay experience.

Anyone else's NVIDIA game filter not working in Valorant? — Cloud (@Silent48101435) June 25 2021 Expand Tweet

NVIDIA users could easily access the Freestyle filters by either employing the “Alt+Z” shortcut or through the in-game overlay.

However this feature seems to have broken or disabled by Riot Games and it may be because of the game-breaking flash bug that came with the recent Valorant patch.

Valorant patch 3.0 bug is causing some NVIDIA users to be immune to flashes

An Nvidia software (HUD remover) competely removes flashes for VALORANT.

After Valorant patch 3.0 went live many NVIDIA users were experiencing a bug where their screen was not going white when hit by an Agent’s flash ability.

This bug was triggered by using Nvidia Geforce Experience thereby making it a game-breaking exploit for a large portion of the Valorant community.

Yeah I figured it was cause of that I just hope they bring it back — Cloud (@Silent48101435) June 26 2021 Expand Tweet

For a low-TTK tactical shooter like Valorant flashes play an extremely vital role in gameplay and strategy. Therefore players being immune to flashes ultimately damages the competitive integrity of the game.

Prior to the day’s proceedings starting defense attorney Katherine Flickinger filed a motion for mistrial after she learned from the defendant’s mother Cheryl Hurdel that she had overheard members of the victim’s family discussing the victim’s relationship with the defendant in the courtroom near the jury on Friday morning.

Justin Hurdel is on trial for allegedly shooting and killing his estranged wife Maggie Flint in a garage on Fort Dodge’s south side on Aug. 5 2020. The trial was moved to Boone County by order of the court in April.

Flickinger motioned for the mistrial arguing that if the jury heard the statements the family members were making it could unfairly prejudice the jury violating the defendant’s right to a fair trial.

The attorneys and District Court Judge Christopher Polking went into a private room to discuss the matter outside the jury’s presence.

First Assistant Webster County Attorney Ryan Baldridge said the state would resist the mistrial motion saying that the jury may not have even heard anything.

“We don’t know if a juror or the jury as a whole actually heard anything” Baldridge said. “While I in no way doubt that Ms. Hurdel testified what she believes she saw and heard … I believe she was sitting closer to the family than what the jury would have been but also would have been more sensitive to issues concerning the decedent’s family than another individual might be.”

He also argued that even if the jury did overhear anything the jury is provided an instruction before deliberation to only consider information made as part of the formal record in the courtroom.

“My third concern … is that the statements made by Ms. Hurdel weren’t specific and the general statements were that they discussed abuse and attempts to leave the relationship” Baldridge said. “The attempts to get away from the relationship I think she used the word ‘escape’ I think there has been evidence of that in the record.”

He said that since the state has charged the defendant with first-degree murder “clearly” the relationshp was not a good one.

Flickinger responded that the defendant being charged with first-degree murder being evidence that it wasn’t a good relationship is exactly the issue caused by the alleged statements made by the victim’s family.

“Right now Mr. Hurdel is presumed innocent until found guilty” she said.

Flickinger also took issue with the jury possibly hearing that Flint was trying to “escape” the marriage.

“Escaping the relationship is a very different statement than ‘wants a divorce and then decides not to go through with the divorce'” she said.

To find out if the jury had heard any of the alleged comments Polking brought each of the jurors in individually to ask if during the course of this trial have they been exposed to any information about this case from persons seated in the spectator seating area.

“Based on the polling of the jury the court would find … there has been no exposure by members of the jury to any information about the case from persons seated in the spectator seating area” Polking said. “Because there has been no exposure there can be no prejudice. Because there can be no prejudice the motion for a mistrial is denied.”

Polking said the court would take stricter efforts to make sure that the jury and spectators are not in close proximity to each other again to avoid a repeat of Friday morning’s events.

The first witness the jury heard from on Friday afternoon was Gary Spencer of Fort Dodge who was present when Flint was killed on Aug. 5 2020.

Spencer testified that he was working in his friend Robert Baker’s garage at 526 S. 19th St. helping Baker and Flint do maintenance on Flint’s pickup truck that day. Spencer said that the first time Justin Hurdel stopped at the garage the defendant stayed for just a few minutes and told Flint that he had signed their divorce papers that day.

When Justin Hurdel left he hit or kicked the outside wall of the garage Spencer testified.

When Justin Hurdel returned a short while later Spencer testified that he was outside cleaning out his car and that Flint and Baker had run to O’Reilly’s Auto Parts to pick up parts for the truck. The defendant had parked his vehicle between Spencer’s car and the north side of the garage and got out.

“And the next thing you know he was reaching across getting back in the car getting something out of the car which I don’t know what he was getting” Spencer testified.

He said Justin Hurdel asked if Baker and Flint had gone to the auto parts store which Spencer confirmed before the defendant walked past Spencer and into the garage.

Spencer testified that the defendant wasn’t behaving like he was sad or angry at that time.

When Baker and Flint returned Spencer went into the garage with them. Spencer testified to hearing a short interaction between Justin Hurdel and Flint.

“He said ‘My life’s over you’ve ruined my life'” Spencer said. “And then it was ‘No no’ and then she was collapsing to the floor because she had been shot.”

He said after he saw Flint fall to the ground he ran out of the garage and down the alley because he was afraid Justin Hurdel would shoot him. As he ran Spencer heard a second shot but said at the time he did not know what had happened.

On cross-examination Flickinger asked Spencer if he had used methamphetamine in the 24 hours prior to the shooting. He said he had.

Flickinger asked if Spencer had been honest with police that day telling them everything he knew. He said he had.

Spencer had told officers that day that he didn’t actually see Hurdel shoot Flint but that he just heard the gunshot and saw Flint fall to the ground.

Fort Dodge Police Department officer Dan Charlson was next on the witness stand. Charlson testified about being one of the officers who finally located and apprehended Justin Hurdel next to a shed near the junction of U.S. Highway 20 and Webster County Road P59 on the morning of Aug. 6 2020 the day after the shooting. The jury saw body camera footage from the camera worn by Charlson on that day.

A nearby homeowner had reported a suspicious person wearing camouflage walking along the treeline on their property around 7 a.m. and a K-9 unit from the Webster County Sheriff’s Office tracked Justin Hurdel to the site where he was apprehended a short while later.

Through the body camera footage the jury saw that Hurdel appeared to have been hiding underneath bushes and brush next to a shed. During cross-examination Charlson would testify that Justin Hurdel did not run when he was located and that he was cooperative and even polite as officers arrested him.

Justin Hurdel was taken to UnityPoint Health — Trinity Regional Medical Center for treatment of soft-tissue injuries to his nose that were reportedly caused by the defendant attempting to take his own life with the shotgun used to kill Flint.

The final witness of the day Webster County Sheriff’s Office Detective Alex Winninger with the cyber crimes unit testified about extracting data from Justin Hurdel’s cell phone. The cell phone had been found abandoned by a private citizen on Old Mill Road on the afternoon of Aug. 5 2020. The person who found the phone Loree Lee had later heard about the shooting and came to the scene to turn the phone into law enforcement.

Winninger testified that in July 2020 there were 1100 text messages exchanged between Justin Hurdel and Flint. And in the first four days of August 2020 Hurdel had sent 17 unanswered text messages to Flint.

The trial is in recess until Tuesday morning when the state will continue making its case for the jury. Follow @KelbyWingert on Twitter for live updates.",,,,,,,,,

The 1988 tragedy which claimed 167 victims remains the world’s deadliest offshore marine accident after a gas leak sparked a series of explosions on the doomed oil rig around 120 miles north east of Aberdeen.

Although 61 men escaped with their lives - some by jumping from the highest point of the platform into the sea - they will never forget those who perished.

In BBC Scotland series The Disasters That Shocked Scotland Geoff Bollands a night shift control room operator on Piper Alpha recalls the moment he realised most of the crew weren’t coming home.

The Middlesbrough pensioner said: “I went into the hospital and they stitched my thumb up and x-rayed my hip and I was in there for an hour or so.

“As I went into the foyer of the hospital to leave there was a policeman there and he had a list of the survivors and I said ‘can I have a look’ at the list and I think I was number 64 on it.

“I said ‘is that all you’ve got off?’ He said ‘yeah how many were on it?’ I said there would have been 220/230 so there’s about 160/170 missing.

“And that’s when the enormity of what had happened hit me. At that point I knew there were people missing at that stage that were missing presumed dead unfortunately.”

Geoff who worked on the Piper Alpha for eight years and wrote a book about the tragedy admits on the programme that it felt like any other day on the massive rig which produced 3000 barrels of oil daily.

He still remembers July 6 1988 like yesterday after being injured by one of the explosions when gas started leaking from a pipe which was missing a safety valve.

Blasts tore the platform apart sending the accommodation block where many people were located plunging into the sea.

Flames were reaching 300ft and could be seen from 70 miles away as it took nearly three weeks for the fire to be brought under control.

Geoff who was saved by a rescue boat said: “We were on night shift and I was going home the next day so it was the last shift of my seven and I was looking forward to going home.

“It was very much routine. I was in the night shift control room. I phoned my wife that night and said I was looking forward to going home and I’ll see you tomorrow.

“We got this massive leak and the first I knew about it was when the gas alarms went off on the panel. Within a couple of minutes there was a big explosion and it knocked me about 15 feet to one side and things changed dramatically within minutes.

“The funny thing about an explosion is when you’re involved in it you don’t hear it you just pick yourself up off the floor and think what’s happened?

Stockline explosion shocked whole of Scotland THE 2004 stockline explosion in Glasgow is also featured in the new disaster series as those on the ground that day share their memories of the tragedy. On May 11 an explosion in Maryhill reduced a four-story plastics factory to rubble killing nine people and seriously injuring 33 others in Scotland’s worst industrial incident since Piper Alpha. The deadly blast was caused by a build-up of leaking gas from corroded underground pipes and led to a countrywide pipe replacement programme. Paul Connelly a divisional fire officer on the scene remembers being lost for words when he received his orders upon arrival at the explosion site. He said: “I booked in and met the officer in charge at that point and asked him ‘what do you need?’ and it was the first time I’d ever had in my career that someone said ‘Paul can you go and set up a temporary mortuary?’ “We had officers to the left of me to the right of me all carrying out different rescues of people that we were talking to or that we were in physical contact with. “Each time someone came out there was absolute euphoria amongst the crews. Crews wanted to rescue people."" Gary Gentles a caretaker at Maryhill Community Halls at the time consoled family members of the workers who waited for news as rescue workers tried to find survivors trapped under the debris. He added: “I can remember it as if it were yesterday. I remember leaving the building and going and standing outside and taking in a bit of the sun. “Standing outside the place was just bustling as it normally was and then all of a sudden just about noon there was a bang. “I found it hard when I went home because I hadn’t seen my wife and family and my granddaughter for any length of time and it wasn’t until I actually went home it hit me. ""My wife said what do you want to eat and I just burst into tears.You never forget . ""We always meet up on the anniversary of the explosion and go down to the garden and lay flowers. It’s the least we can do but we’ll never forget.” Two operators of the plastics factory were later fined a total of £400000 as it emerged the faulty pipework which led to the explosion would have only cost £405 to replace.

""I got a blow to the hip that immobilised me a bit but I could walk with discomfort. About midnight we just saw the platform split in two and it was like slow motion.

""The accommodation block fell into the sea and you just knew anybody that was in it had gone. From the day I got off and ever since and I say it reverently I just thank god that I got off and that I got off with such minor injuries.

“It’s just very sad what happened. You go to Aberdeen to see the memorial in Hazelhead Park and you see the names of the lads on there that died and it’s just so sad.”

5 Charles was one of the rescuers from The Silver Pit Credit: BBC

Charles Haffey a rescuer on standby safety vessel The Silver Pit also still has vivid memories of the tragedy. He recalled: “I used to go to my bed about 10pm and I was on my way down to the cabin and I heard this bang I looked out the hatch of the ship and I actually saw a puff of smoke I’ve always described it as like dirty cotton wool with an orange glow coming from behind it.

“I put my survival suit on and my hard hat grabbed the radio from the bridge and then went out. You couldn’t take in what was happening. It was like a warzone.

""We just concerned ourselves with getting guys off the rig and getting them back to the silver pit. And then after about the fourth time there couldn’t have been anybody left on the rig. So basically for us it became like a search and rescue.”

5 It took weeks to get the fire under control Credit: PA:Press Association

Filmmaker Paul Berriff was embedded with the team and remembers seeing the injured firsthand on support vessel Tharos which housed a hospital wing.

He said: “I’ve filmed in my lifetime dozens of fires and major incidents but nothing like this. It was just incredible. I couldn’t believe it.

“The whole platform was well alight from the sea to the top of the platform. In fact the sea was on fire as well. The Silver Pit was picking up the casualties from the sea and she had 30 to 36 casualties on board three of them were seriously burned.

“We went over the stern of The Silver Pit and began winching the three badly injured guys into the helicopter. We got the three in and they were in a really bad state and at that point I put my camera down and began helping the crew on board the helicopter to look after the guys.

“On arrival on Tharos I went into the hospital with my sound guys. All the beds were full of guys. Some were laid out on stretchers on the floor. It was a really horrific sight.

“I was on the deck and you could see the remains of the Piper. It was just a skeleton really. Everything had just gone below the waves. It was a real ghostly scene it’s unbelievable how it went so quickly.”

An inquiry after the incident led to North Sea safety being shifted from the Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Executive and meant that automatic shut-down valves were made mandatory on rigs to starve a fire of fuel.

It also found that the rig’s operator Occidental Petroleum had used inadequate maintenance and safety procedures with the firm forced to pay out millions in compensation.

Brown,"D.J. Brown almost wasn’t a part of Notre Dame’s 27-man Class of 2018.

With four-star Noah Boykin (Washington D.C.) pledging to the Irish it didn’t appear there would be room for Brown. But as the recruiting process unfolded the Irish remained enamored with the three-star cornerback -- also out of the Washington D.C. area -- and accepted his commitment.

Brown joined Boykin Houston Griffith (Bradenton Fla.) and TaRiq Bracy (Milpitas Calif.) at cornerback with athlete Joe Wilkins Jr. (North Fort Myers Fla.) eventually settling in at receiver.

Brown’s days as a cornerback were short-lived as they would be for Griffith. After seeing action in one game (Wake Forest) as a freshman in 2018 Brown shifted to safety. As a red-shirt freshman in 2019 Brown played mostly special teams with seven tackles in nine games with multiple stops coming against New Mexico (3) and Michigan (2).

With Alohi Gilman and Jalen Elliott off to the NFL a spot opposite Kyle Hamilton was available in 2020. Brown saw action in 12 games but lost out on a starting opportunity when Shaun Crawford was shifted from cornerback/nickel to safety. Brown and Houston Griffith combined for more than 450 snaps in subordinate roles.

Brown had eight tackles two passes broken up and a quarterback hurry in 2020. He continued to battle Griffith in the spring with both seeing action with the No. 1 unit although it appeared Griffith exited the spring as the frontrunner.

• Irish Illustrated Ranking: 39

• Prister Ranking: 40

• O’Malley Ranking: 41

• Sinclair Ranking: 36

• Loy Ranking: 39

• 2020 Pre-Season Ranking: 41

O’Malley Says: “Former cornerback seemed an afterthought during the spring time feting of prodigal son Houston Griffith. But it’s a long season and Brown has a shot to win the job – or a job – opposite Kyle Hamilton.”

What To Expect In 2021

Notre Dame expects Brown to compete with Houston Griffith for the starting job and why not? After all Brown had 243 snaps to Griffith’s 215 in 2020. If Griffith showed marked improvement in the spring Brown certainly was in a position to do so as well. Expect this to be a battle from the start to the end of the season with perhaps a youngster or two applying pressure to the academic seniors.

Future Prospects

With Hamilton out the door following the 2021 season Brown has a minimum of two seasons available to him in 2022-23. He could be part of a starting tandem with a fifth-year Griffith or again some young up-and-coming prospects. In addition to the expected competition from K.J. Wallace and to a lesser extent Litchfield Ajavon there are 2021 true freshmen Khari Gee and Justin Walters and likely a Class of 2022 insertion to be named later.

Stat Of The Day

On 243 snaps last season Brown finished with eight tackles and two passes broken up. The passes broken up came early in the 2020 season against Duke in the opener and Florida State in Game 3. One or both could have been interceptions. Brown also had a quarterback hurry in Game 2 against South Florida. Three of his tackles came in the first three games. His missed tackle on Eli Pancol within the first five minutes of the season led to a 55-yard reception and an early 3-0 Duke lead.

Quote To Note

“I’m really pleased with the depth that’s developing at the safety positions. Obviously that starts with Houston and really having a great spring. He was outstanding in all areas off the field on the field…And so when you feel like you’ve got a veteran player like that along with Kyle Hamilton and D.J.

Nwabuko informed Brenan Marion and Pat Narduzzi that he wanted to join the Panthers program and gave them a commitment before leaving Pittsburgh from his official visit weekend d

Pitt football recruiting coverage sponsored by RM LAW P.C. is a boutique litigation law firm with a national practice dedicated to protecting shareholders’ interests and promoting improved corporate governance practices.

Nwabuko who’s from Manor Texas becomes the second player from Texas in Pitt’s Class of 2022 joining linebacker/safety Marquan Pope who committed Saturday.

Pitt has made it a point this year to recruit more speed to their program and they accomplished that goal with Nwabuko who’s possess elite speed and is a state champion in track. Nwabuko committed to Pitt over other offers from Air Force Kansas Liberty Marshall Minnesota Michigan Michigan State Old Dominion and Purdue.

Before hopping on his plane flight back to Texas Nwakuko spoke with Pittsburgh Sports Now about his decision and what sold him on Pitt.

“Just being around the Pitt staff and seeing their facilities in person it was just a great great experience to go through and it really just pulled me in after being here” said Nwakuko. “This official visit was way way more than I thought and expected it would be. It really blew me out of the water. Honestly I thought Pittsburgh was some old rundown place steel mills but I was wrong and it was a whole different experience than I was expecting it to be.

“One of the biggest things that sold me on Pitt and made my decision final was hearing and seeing about all the people they put in the NFL. All of the things that those players accomplished in college awards that they won and I believe that I could accomplish those type of things at Pitt too.”

Major credit goes to Marion for all the work he put in to identify Nwakuko as a prospect and then to get him interested enough to make a visit from Texas up to Pittsburgh. The bond he created with his future position coach was a key factor in Nwakuko’s decision.

“Man Coach Marion is my dude. He was so cool to be around and I loved being around him this weekend Nwakuko said. “Same with Coach Narduzzi they are both coaches with so much energy and excitement and they’re also both great people.

“I first told Coach Marion about my decision and he was really excited. We didn’t put anything out there until I told Coach Narduzzi today. He was obviously very excited when I told him too.”

As far as where Nwakuko will play in college it’ll be a lot like his current role in high school as he’ll be used as both a slot receiver running back and a returner on special teams.

“I’m going to be a slot receiver but really they’re going to put me everywhere” he said. “They’ll put me in the backfield and find ways to get me the ball. I’m ready to do a lot in the offense.”"

The ultrasonics business that originated in Jim Bullen’s garage in 1971 is now an “ultrasonic machining powerhouse” and globally recognized leader in the production of high-quality components used in semiconductors MEMS transportation defense & aerospace medical & life sciences industries. Half a century later Bullen Ultrasonics remains a privately held company owned by Jim’s son-in-law Steve Brown and daughter Vicki Brown and their family.

“I know that Jim would be proud to see the company doing what it’s doing today staying true to our values and committed to excellence in every way” Brown said. “Because we’ve remained committed to our family values Bullen has been able to accomplish so much more than technical output over the last 50 years. The beauty of a family business means that we have the freedom to push the boundaries and innovate uniquely. We’ve built things no one else has built; we’ve reached markets others hadn’t touched and created value for our customers in unique and innovative ways.”

Fifty years ago Bullen Ultrasonics began as a small group of engineers that repaired old ultrasonic machines and sold them globally to in-need countries like India. In the early 1990s led at the time by Steve Brown and Mary Bullen the business started working alongside IBM and Howmet Aerospace and took on a newfound trajectory.

Around that same time Bullen’s engineers began working with Lam Research (LRCX) in California. What started as a small job with Lam quickly turned into a more significant project and Bullen acquired even more customers through a network of semiconductor manufacturers looking for similar ultrasonic solutions.

This series of events propelled Bullen to dive deep into the silicon production world which ultimately led to the company’s differentiation in the ultrasonics space. The Bullen team decided to alter its supply chain by growing its own silicon crystal in 1997. Despite its small size and humble roots Bullen was the only crystal grower in the world growing wafer-quality silicon for non-wafers at the time. By 2006 they had 13 crystal growers. They eventually sold these silicon growing and processing assets to Lam Research now known as Silfex. It continues to experience growth at its Eaton and Springfield Ohio facilities.

Today Tim Beatty serves as the company’s president proudly preserving the DNA of the company. “While I embrace the opportunity to carry on the legacy of the Bullen family as the company’s president I also recognize that everything that’s happened in these last 50 years can be traced back to our employees” said Beatty. “We have incredibly talented people working for us. Everywhere I turn our employees strive to make a difference for our customers in their homes and within their communities. This positive culture I believe is created by people and fostered by leadership.”

Beatty and the rest of the Bullen Ultrasonics team believe that their work extends beyond just the technology and day-to-day production. Bullen has gained a reputation of service both locally and globally over its 50 years in business and was most recently awarded Dayton Business Journal’s 2020 Business of the Year. It contributes 10 percent of its profits to global charitable organizations in Cambodia Mumbai and the Philippians. It continues to serve those in Preble County as a longstanding affiliate of the Preble County Development Partnership and Home is the Foundation.

“We want our employees to know they are making a difference when they come to work every day. We give a portion of our profit back to our employees and people in need worldwide. This has been a part of our DNA ever since the beginning and that’s something that will define us for years to come” adds Beatty.

Bullen continues to seek opportunities to create value for its customers by improving operational excellence in everything from engineering to quality assurance. It has created a system built around supporting its employees to focus on delivering value and quality services to its customers. The company plans to diversify its technology to open new markets while allowing them to better serve existing customers in the semiconductors aerospace and MEMS industries. Bullen continues its growth and is currently hiring for various positions which can be viewed at bullentech.com/careers.

Bullen leadership is inviting any current and former team members as well as their families to a 50th-anniversary celebration which will be held on Saturday Sept. 11 at the Bullen facility. Find out more about Bullen’s celebration and history at bullenultrasonics.com/anniversary.

(“AEye”) the global leader in active high-performance LiDAR solutions today announced the appointment of Hod Finkelstein as Chief R&D Officer. A technology and business veteran Finkelstein brings deep experience spearheading the development and commercialization of strategic and disruptive technologies including LiDAR.

Finkelstein joins AEye from Sense Photonics where as CTO he defined the company’s technology direction and led its LiDAR development activities. He started his career at Intel designing the early Pentium chips and was in charge of semiconductor technologies at Mellanox Technologies. During his PhD he invented the first generic-CMOS Single-Photon-Avalanche-Diodes (SPADs) which are widely used in LiDARs today and first demonstrated arrays of these devices. Hod was Director of Technology Development at DNA sequencing giant Illumina where he managed the development of on-chip CMOS DNA sequencers and was later CTO at TruTag Technologies where he conceptualized and developed award-winning handheld and battery-operated hyperspectral cameras.

“Hod is a brilliant technology and business leader highly respected for his work advancing disruptive semiconductor and optical sensor technologies” said Luis Dussan Founder and CTO at AEye. “Hod is a visionary technologist who perfectly complements and extends AEye’s seasoned management team. He is a key strategic addition as we accelerate commercialization of our leading-edge LiDAR system in various markets.”

AEye’s active LiDAR system overcomes the pitfalls of conventional LiDAR with a uniquely intelligent approach called iDAR™ (Intelligent Detection and Ranging). This high-performance LiDAR has set standards for LiDAR range resolution and speed across all major metrics. iDAR is based on a bi-static architecture – which keeps the transmit and receive channels separate: as each laser pulse is transmitted the solid-state receiver is told where and when to look for its return – enabling deterministic artificial intelligence to be introduced into the sensing process at the point of acquisition. Ultimately this establishes the iDAR platform as active – allowing it to focus on what matters most while simultaneously monitoring the vehicle’s surroundings resulting in greater reliability safety and performance at longer range and lower cost.

“I am delighted to join the AEye team and to play a key role in advancing AEye’s disruptive LiDAR system” said Finkelstein. “AEye’s approach to create an integrated perception system that brings together software extensibility artificial intelligence and smart agile sensors is exceptional and I look forward to continuing the company’s groundbreaking innovation and its relentless customer-focus.”

AEye’s customers and partners have the ability to engage in a live test drive with an AEye engineer from the comfort of their own home or office via AEye’s interactive web-based demo platform Raptor. To see what a software-configurable sensor can do and to experience iDAR’s record-breaking performance in real-time visit aeye.ai/demo-the-4sight-m.

Ensuring the most power-conscious designs can often be difficult thus making it essential to look at all options from semiconductor materials to teaming up with other companies; what's most important is power design.

Lately silicon carbide (SiC) is quickly becoming a promising technology for enhancing power conversion and supply systems. Expectedly prominent players are building strategic partnerships to take advantage of SiC-based technologies.

This article will break down how these different partnerships are harnessing SiC in various technological applications starting with Avnet and Infineon.

Avnet and Infineon Delivering CoolSiC Technology

With the increasing need for cost-effective efficient and portable power conversion devices and systems globally engineers are consistently designing new technologies and improving existing ones.

Avnet recently announced its collaboration with Infineon to deploy energy-efficient power devices through CoolSiC technologies to meet this need. This team-up promises better solutions for engineers building ground-breaking power systems for a wide range of applications.

The Avnet-Infineon collaboration could benefit various power-related applications since it focuses on utilizing SiC rather than the conventional silicon (Si) semiconductors.

Before this collaboration Infineon had over 20 years of experience developing and supplying SiC technology for smarter and more efficient power generation transmission and consumption including the CoolSiC portfolio.

A high-level look at some of the benefits the CoolSiC family claims from using SiC. Image used courtesy of Infineon

Avnet is a worldwide technology distribution and solutions provider with a century of existence in the tech ecosystem. It has consistently supported designers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in every phase of the product life-cycle from idea conception to production and distribution.

Furthermore Infineon is currently leveraging its impeccable global distribution network to participate in the SiC technology market which has a projected CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 30%. Thus while Infineon contributes CoolSic technology to the collaboration Avnet provides its distribution channels.

Avnet is also currently selling Infineon's EVAL-1ED3122MC12H-SiC an evaluation board exclusive for developers and engineers to test the capabilities of CoolSic technology. In addition both companies are leaving no stone unturned by offering comprehensive training programs for power system designers who intend to apply the technology.

Avnet and Infineon's team-up for SiC is just one of many recently taking place another is happening between Gospower and Cree.

Gospower and Cree Colab For SiC Data Center Solutions

With the rising development of cloud-based storage 5G technology artificial intelligence and distributed storage comes the increased demand for server and computing power supply.

To help with that issue Gospower and Cree recently announced their partnership to develop a state-of-the-art Common Redundant Power Supply (CRPS) solution that applies SiC technology to meet high power-efficient digital storage demands.

Delivering this solution Gospower with its experience in power electronics conversion incorporates Cree's Wolfspeed 650V SiC MOSFETS promising a reliable efficient cost-effective and portable power supply required for an optimized data center functioning.

Cree Inc. an American semiconductor manufacturer and marketer developed the Wolfspeed 650V SiC MOSFETS to ensure high power efficiency and density in power systems.

Key features include the following:

Low parasitic capacitances

Through-hole and SMT packages that match up to industry specifications

Reduced on-state resistance to temperature

Comparatively lower switching and conducting losses

Efficient operation in high temperatures

According to Cree's CEO the company has attempted to strategically position itself to usher in the wide acceptance and application of SiC technology with its innovative Wolfspeed Silicon Carbide devices. He also states that collaboration with Gospower is necessary to improve the power supply sector by developing SiC technology-based solutions.

By innovating SiC for data center applications both Cree and Gospower hope to help solve it demanding issue of power. A final team-up hoping to improve further SiC technology consists of three parties.

A Triple Team-up for SiC Schottky Diodes

Can SiC Schottky diodes be manufactured at a wafer level? Would they perform better? And ultimately is this concept technologically and economically viable?

These are some questions current research by Queensland Semiconductor Technology (Questsemi) and Griffith University seeks to answer with funding support from the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC).

The importance of SiC Schottky diodes in semiconductor production and distribution is often underestimated though it plays a significant role especially when weighing which material to make it on. Thus this collaboration is invaluable to the design manufacture and commercialization of semiconductor devices to meet local and global demands in drones solar inverters EV battery chargers high-frequency power converters and industrial motor drive applications.

While Questsemi is the commercial arm of the collaboration Griffith University and IMCRC are the research and economic arms respectively. This setup could help them mass-produce and distribute the SiC Schottky diodes since they have the funding for research and development the expertise and the distribution channel.

Although the SiC diode manufacturing process is complex and highly capital intensive researchers at Griffith University adopted conventional silicon wafer processing techniques to simplify manufacturing and decimate costs. Combining that with the significant funding from IMCRC to the tune of $1.3 million promises a quick transition of the research to ground-breaking commercialized technology.

With all of this interest from so many companies it makes SiC technology seem like it is starting to hit its stride which is no wonder with the benefits it claims to have. However with benefits also come drawbacks. To drive home the reason so many companies are willing to put their ""chips"" on SiC as the next top semiconductor material it might be beneficial to outline some pros and cons.

Benefits and Limitations of SiC

SiC semiconductors offer several benefits in power systems. Some of them include:

High band-gap energy levels of 3.2 eV compared to other semiconductor materials for wide application ranges

Power loss reductions of up to 70%

High energy efficiency of about 98.6%

Reduced cooling system requirements

It can operate at high temperatures

High power density

Improved device portability: 30% floor space reduction

SiCs however has some of the following drawbacks:

High cost of manufacturing and processing

Excessive use of furnaces to produce the silicon used in their manufacture

Complex manufacturing processes

Susceptible to various fabrication defects

Although the transition from silicon to SiC may seem daunting because of the various limitations it could be inevitable because of the many benefits it offers. Since the benefits look like they outweigh the drawbacks its mass adoption appears imminent. Researchers and developers can discover better ways to simplify its fabrication process and lower manufacturing costs just like the researchers at Griffith University. The future will likely hold many more SiC news innovations and team-ups.

The building had reached only 16 floors by then and the original 52-story design was never finished. To see what might have been however we can look at the old “District 1 Plan” from 1980.

The cover illustration depicts how city officials expected downtown to look in the year 1990 after what they presumed would be an oil-fueled decade of tremendous growth. The Cities Service building dominates the skyline surpassing even the 667-foot BOK Tower from 1976.

Other departures from reality include a string of medium-height buildings along Third Street one at Boston Avenue one at Boulder Avenue and one at Cheyenne Avenue where a sky bridge seems to connect with an older building to the east. Instead today you will find parking lots at two of those sites and a single-story Tulsa Transit hub at the third.

Outlining development priorities for the ’80s and beyond the District 1 Plan envisioned rows of townhouses and large-scale residential projects south of Eighth Street where entire city blocks had already been cleared to make room for new developments. Instead 40 years later most of those lots remain nothing but asphalt.

Other ideas included expanding the pedestrian Main Mall farther south building several small “pocket parks” and introducing a shuttle system that could have potentially evolved into light rail in the early 21st century.

Obviously none of that happened. Instead the price of oil dropped nearly 40% between 1981 and 1985 and nosedived by more than 50% in the first half of 1986. The Oil Bust wiped out dozens of companies cost tens of thousands of Oklahomans their jobs and plunged downtown Tulsa into decades of neglect and decline.

Fortunately in the long run some trends developed that no one anticipated in the 1980s. Historic but mostly empty office buildings became widely popular loft apartments. And once abandoned warehouses turned into the Arts District and the bustling Blue Dome area.

As for the Cities Service building crews eventually capped it off at 17 floors and it became known as ONEOK Plaza standing near Fifth Street and Boulder Avenue where the tower’s unique rounded corners make it one of the city’s most recognizable landmarks. Like the rest of downtown Tulsa it didn’t turn out the way people originally expected. But it didn’t turn out so bad.

Let’s see which private islands are owned by famous CEOS.

Necker Island: As soon as Richard Branson heard in 1978 that some of the islands in the British Virgin Islands were for sale he decided to go there and find out any real estate market opportunities. He was stunned by the view and wildlife of Necker Island so he decided to purchase it for $120000. According to the British Virgin Islands Law the new owner had to develop a resort. Branson committed to building a resort on the island. He spent an extra amount of 10 million dollars to turn it into a private island retreat. The whole island operates as a resort and can accommodate up to 30 guests. If someone wants to stay the total rent is about 102500 dollars per day. The visitors with this cost have access to two beaches private pools tennis courts scenic views a personal chef a team of about 100 staff and water sports equipment. A really bad moment for Branson was in August 2011 when a fire broke out at the island causing damages to the properties. New Holland Island (Saint Petersburg Russia): Iris Foundation founded by Dasha Zhukova and Roman Abramovich owns the island since 2010. Basically the island belongs to Roman Abramovich. He launched a new project amounting more than 10 billion dollars in order to make space for galleries and a museum to house some of his art pieces. Also many other restorations took place in different parts of the region. The PTJ islands: The hedge fund manager and CEO at Tudor Investment Corporation Paul Tudor Jones owns a trio of private islands that spell out his initials. They are part of a 3000 acre wildlife preserve he owns on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Lanai: Larry Ellison the co-founder of Oracle Corporation bought 98% of Hawaiian island Lanai in 2012 for an estimated $300 million. His dream is to turn it into a sustainable paradise and an even more attractive tourist destination. He even wants to create a well organized employee community there. Among his plans is to create a 100% green community. He is going to achieve this through his wellness company Sensei which main purpose is to use data to help people lead healthier and longer lives. North Dumpling Island: The island (Fishers Island Sound Southold New York) was bought Dean Kamen inventor of the Segway Human Transporter and founder of FIRST in 1986. The island home to the North Dumpling Lighthouse is located one mile off the coast of Connecticut. Kamen is said to refer to himself as “Lord Dumpling” or “Lord Dumpling II”. In addition to North Dumpling Lighthouse the island has a replica of Stonehenge. Brecqhou: It is one of the Channel Islands located off the west coast of Sark. Since 1993 the tenement of Brecqhou has been owned by the Barclay brothers the co-owners of The Daily Telegraph newspaper and former co-owners of The Scotsman. The brothers bought the island for £2.3 million. Coast of Vancouver: Craig McCaw founder of McCaw Cellular and Clearwire Corporation owns with his wife a 780-acre island off the coast of Vancouver. The island has many amenities and his worth is more than 70 million dollars.

In a Forrester Consulting report titled “The Transformation of Television: Embracing the Era of Addressable TV” commissioned last month by DISH Media ViacomCBS and others across the industry over 60% of those surveyed said that addressable advertising is going to be part of their media mix. Another finding revealed that buyers fear the operational aspect associated with addressable TV as well as the various platforms and forms of measurement.

At the forefront of innovation in addressable ViacomCBS offers buyers ways to reach any viewer they are after with targeting methods that are both easy and effective. Since 2018 the company has been an early adopter of addressable capabilities. CBS was the first broadcaster to join the Nielsen addressable trial and a proponent of methods like out-of-band signaling and smart TV-based addressable. Leading the charge too was Viacom among the first to adopt set-top box based methods for national cable addressable. Now the combined company has 40 million households enabled across a collection of MVPDs and set-top box households.

Recently ViacomCBS reached another milestone achievement. In December 2020 CBS became the first broadcast network to deliver addressable impressions into a live national broadcast.

“Viacom and CBS have combined to have the strongest position in the programmer addressable space” says Mike Dean ‎SVP Advanced Advertising ViacomCBS. “And arguably the company has the strongest position in the addressable TV space at large.”

As technology advances so does the approach to addressability. With unparalleled product offerings that the company continues to enhance with market feedback ViacomCBS is dedicated to updating the narrative of addressable across the industry.

Simplifying the Addressable Process

One way the company is connecting the dots for advertisers: a partnership with Open AP an audience-targeting alliance that allows advertisers to buy a specific audience across a number of media outlets.

“We’re partnering with OpenAP on their OpenID initiative and BlockGraph on their IDos offering” says Travis Scoles SVP Vantage Product Management at ViacomCBS. “It’s about giving third parties access to that information on behalf of the buyers and enabling the on-ramp instead of trying to charge forward and do it individually in a silo.”

Vantage ViacomCBS’ advanced advertising platform also makes campaign activation easier simplifying complicated workflows.

“With Vantage we are seamlessly activating audiences across the ViacomCBS portfolio regardless of that end point—whether that is linear addressable or digital—to make it easy and effective” Dean explains.

ViacomCBS has been carrying out campaigns through Vantage since 2014. What makes the company’s offering unique is the amount of experience and expertise that the operators behind Vantage can bring to the marketplace.

“We realized there’s not a one-size-fits-all model” says Dean. “We take a very consultative approach and we work with our clients to integrate addressable TV in a way that fits their overall goal and their overall media mix.”

Evolving Advanced Advertising

ViacomCBS is delivering cross-platform campaigns across linear digital (EyeQ Video) and addressable endpoints with massive scale and reach — all through Vantage.

“We’ve built the ability to extend these capabilities across multiple endpoints which means if a client defines a particular audience we will serve the right ads to the right viewers regardless of which end point they are watching. And that’s really the power of addressability” says Seema Patel VP partnership development ViacomCBS. “For marketers this is an extremely powerful tool.”

Patel also says ViacomCBS’ goal is to reach a point where they can “write once and publish everywhere” in all aspects of the campaign lifecycle as a way to ultimately unify the buying cycle.

By utilizing new innovations in tech ViacomCBS is focused on allowing advertisers to get to the end of a campaign lifecycle as seamlessly as possible. The focus is on measurement and the move towards unification in order to achieve true cross-platform campaign management and execution.

“That’s where our role as a programmer in this ecosystem is really critical in helping to champion and advocate for change” adds Patel.

As the company looks forward to integrating more easily with its clients it continues to engage across the ecosystem including with initiatives like Project OAR a consortium of programmers and distributors led by smart TV manufacturer Vizio. Dean also added that they expect other national broadcasters will follow their lead in introducing addressability to the set-top box environment after its partnership with DISH to deliver impressions within a live national broadcast.

“We’re ahead of the curve in terms of not only enabling addressability but actively selling it in the marketplace. We’ve been doing this for a few years now and as a result we have gained a lot of learnings that ultimately help bring value to our clients” says Patel. “We’re also continuing to refine our offerings as the marketplace evolves. We’re really proud of how far we’ve come and we’re committed to continuing down that path of evolution with our clients and with our partners because making consistent progress takes strong collaboration across all fronts”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhZ2xpdHouY29tL2Fub3RoZXItYm9sbHl3b29kLWNvdXBsZS10aWVzLS10YW1pbC1uZXdzLTI4OTYxMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another Bollywood couple ties the knot together - Tamil News,"Quite a few Bollywood celebs have gotten married in last few months.

The actor showed up at the airport wearing a bathrobe to board an Air India flight but was thwarted by the authorities.

Zeeshan Khan was apparently aiming to create a world record at the Goa airport before an airport authority approached the actor and explained to him that wearing solely a bathrobe wasn't allowed on the flight. Speaking about the stunt he said ""Well I feel we have one life and we should completely make the most of it. Who decides it's inappropriate to wear a bathrobe in public? If I'm comfortable then what's the issue? And I believe in doing what I want to. For me there is one life and I am here to make the most of it challenge the norms and question them because some of them honestly are followed blindly.""

Zeeshan Khan also recently spoke about his casting couch experience in an interview with an entertainment portal. He reportedly said ""Firstly I believe the casting couch one of the horrible truths of the industry should not exist. When I was new I was told that I won't make it big and was laughed at when I declined an offer of compromise. And that incident was heartbreaking. It breaks the spirits of many such actors. But I still made it to the top with my hard work. Who's laughing now?"""

The San Jose Earthquakes returned in less than triumphant fashion to full capacity at PayPal Park for their California Clasico showdown against the Los Angeles Galaxy. It quickly became clear that Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez would give the single raucous section of Galaxy supporters more to cheer for than their some 18000 counterparts from San Jose.

Earthquakes star Chris Wondolowski the rivalry’s all-time leading scorer with 12 goals was kept quiet throughout. Instead it was Chicharito’s turn to announce his arrival to the rivalry leading Los Angeles (7-3) to a 3-1 win.

San Jose (3-7-1) had held the Galaxy’s star designated player scoreless in four meetings last season Chicharito’s first in Los Angeles after arriving as a transfer from Sevilla.

On Saturday night the 5-foot-9 striker gave the Galaxy an early lead when he found the back of the net on a pass from Samuel Grandsir in the 11th minute then added another goal five minutes into the second half with help from Kevin Cabral.

A shot in the 70th minute ricocheted off Florian Jungwirth and past goalkeeper James Marcinkowski for an own goal that made it 3-0 Galaxy.

Cade Cowell who subbed in for Judson nine minutes into the second half scored the Earthquakes’ lone goal of the evening off an assist from Eduardo Lopez in the 83rd minute.

After winning three of their first four matches this season the Earthquakes have dropped six of their past seven and sit in 10th place in the Western Conference standings.

“I think we’re still playing our style of football” said midfielder Jackson Yueill who put one of three Earthquakes’ shots on target all game. “What’s hurting us at the moment is our mistakes and our turnovers. We’re having a hard time recovering and scoring goals on the offensive end. … We do have good moments but we’re shooting ourselves in the foot early on in the game.”

Lopez couldn’t connect on a pair of prime scoring opportunities from inside the box. After booting the first ball off the post Lopez collapsed to the ground in disappointment.

Wondolowski touched the ball just six times in the first half and was limited to 23 total touches fewer than any other Earthquake to play all 90 minutes of regulation plus extra time.

Chicharito assumed the same pose a few minutes later. He had just missed a chance to complete a hat trick.

After 72 minutes of regulation Chicharito ran to the sideline and took a bow; his night was over after leading Los Angeles out to a 3-0 lead. His 10 goals this season are more than any other player in the MLS.

The loss was the Earthquakes’ second in a row to the Galaxy but they have still taken six of the past 11 contests with Los Angeles. The Galaxy improved its all-time advantage in the series between original MLS franchises to 34-26-16.

Over the last decade payments has proven to be the cash cow of financial infrastructure. As money went digital and ecommerce boomed multibillion dollar winners like Adyen PayPal and Stripe were born.

The pandemic has only accelerated the success — and competitiveness — of digital payments. European startups in the space like Mollie Klarna and Checkout.com are now the continent's three most highly-valued fintechs. Meanwhile a host of tech firms have pivoted into payments to join the fray.

Margins are slim but it's a lucrative game for those who can grab volumes or earn a competitive edge. Indeed 10 of the 16 biggest fintech exits in Europe between 2013 and 2019 involved a payments company.

Investors have naturally swooned making 'paytech' the second-best funded subgenre in fintech last year (behind consumer fintech). A burst of local newcomers including SaltPay Primer Form 3 and Volt have even secured backing from top VCs like Accel and EQT.

The payments market is evidently giant — ""touching money either costs money or it makes money"" summarises Draper's Vinoth Jayakumar — but the challenge for startups lies in finding new gaps to fill and differentiating themselves.

To scout out the next big paytech winners we asked five VC investors to nominate top young European startups tackling pain points in payments.

For transparency the VCs were not allowed to list their own portfolio companies.

Check out the investors’ nominations below.

Olga Shikhantsova — principal at Speedinvest

Mercuryo

Estonia-based Mercuryo is an emerging leader in the cryptocurrency category. It provides a crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto payment gateway to crypto-exchanges gaming companies and payment institutes making it easy for crypto newbies to buy tokens (including NFTs and DeFi tokens!). It also facilitates cross-border payments virtual accounts business payments and remittances via crypto behind the scenes.

Crypto is no longer treated as a purely speculative asset and has gained massive adoption by both retail and institutional investors. Now crypto is also being embedded into classic 'fiat' fintechs like neobanks and trading apps. That naturally opens up a new category of payment infrastructure fintechs that are building a bridge between crypto and fiat joining other European players like Ramp.

Fintecture

Open banking adoption has clearly reached the point of no return: underlying infrastructure has matured and coverage offered by banks has increased finally making accounts-to-accounts payments ready for mass adoption. A2A (account-to-account) payments are here to address the pain points of merchants (both B2B & B2C) reducing costs and increasing security and speed.

Fintecture is one such payment infrastructure provider from France successfully facilitating direct A2A payments between buyers and merchants in both B2B and B2C.

Osu

Osu is another startup leveraging the increasing adoption rate of accounts-to-accounts payments but in the freelancers and micro-businesses space. Micro-business has been long forgotten in fintech innovation — with poor tools in place it remains cash heavy.

Osu is changing this by introducing immediate payment by link as well as combining all transactions into the CRM. This allows booking and calendar integration as well as proper tax calculations and reporting. It's one of the very early entrants to the space which is increasingly growing and in desperate need of innovation.

UNIPaaS

UNIPaas is as technical as its name suggests. It's an end-to-end payments and banking service for marketplaces and B2B platforms which includes onboarding/KYB pay-ins and pay-outs tailored to the specific business model needs. In other words it's a vertical solution that allows merchants to own financial services control the flow of funds and earn from financial services.

Silverflow

Silverflow is still the only cloud-native acquirer processing platform. That's the deepest layer in the payments stack talking to card networks such as Visa and Mastercard. The platforms and infrastructure currently in place were never designed for the needs of today's customers.

Many of these platforms were designed decades ago and were optimised to save memory and processing which were expensive. Due to the age of these platforms they are difficult to upgrade and complex to work with.

Tillit

Tillit offers a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) plugin for B2B customers. Tillit makes it easy for B2B merchants to offer invoices as a payment method meaning they can delay the transaction). As we’ve seen with B2C (with the likes of Klarna ClearPay and beyond) BNPL drives higher conversion rates. BNPL is a critical payment method to drive B2B digital payments adoption and to bring it up to speed with the consumer space.

Editors note: It's worth noting that currently B2B e-transaction volume globally is $12.2 trillion. That's nearly 2.38x bigger than B2C ecommerce. That gap is also expected to grow as more B2B transactions move online.

Matt Ford — partner at Mouro Capital

APEXX

As the digital economy has expanded so too has the complexity and fragmentation of online payments. Consumers are increasingly adopting diverse ways to pay (be it PayPal buy-now-pay-later or account-to-account) resulting in increased requirements for merchants to integrate and support multiple payment methods and providers.

Add to this more global or crossborder commerce — plus a host of PSPs to choose from in each market — and you see the need for intelligent routing (for instance to optimise for acceptance or cost). Payment orchestrators like Apexx (and Primer) help solve these issues by reducing the overhead of managing multiple integrations helping route the payment to the optimal provider and ultimately bringing cost efficiencies for the merchant.

Likvido

Compared to consumer payments B2B payments have historically been lagging behind. The vast majority of B2B payments are still requested manually via an invoice chased via phone or email when overdue and then once paid (sometimes even by cheque) manually reconciled against what was billed. This leads to errors unnecessary cost and sometimes even cashflow issues.

Fortunately we're seeing a wave of companies like Likvido trying to solve these challenges by automating the workflow of sending requesting and reconciling payments.

Legl

From gym management software to restaurants to hotels there are now a number of very large industry-specific software platforms that sit at the heart of their customers' workflows offering software specifically tailored to that industry's specific needs.

Many of these platforms initially started with non-fintech use-cases (e.g. scheduling or CRM) but are now moving rapidly into payments as a revenue stream. Legl for instance helps lawyers accept payments online tailored to their very specific reporting and workflow requirements.

Juliette Souliman — investor at MMC Ventures

Simpler

Simpler is a one-click payment checkout solution for online shopping across all platforms and devices based in the UK and Greece. It tackles the broken checkout process that has a notoriously high shopping cart abandonment rate and low single-digit ecommerce conversion.

Simpler has designed an identity layer that sits on top of multiple payment gateways that allows companies to treat customers like repeat customers — regardless if they are first-time shoppers or not — and package the checkout experience as a seamless one-click step. It's one that's still under the radar but could it be the next Fast or Bolt of Europe? (Plus it's led by a female CEO and cofounder!)

WhenThen

When payments meets devOps there is a lot to like! Meet WhenThen. It allows its users to create flexibly design and manage their payment flows all through a simple-to-use no-code interface.

While payments is becoming a commodity being able to create faster more personable and flexible payment options for your customers is a true differentiator in the market. One to watch for sure.

Pento

Pento is the newest payroll automation startup out of Denmark. Its SaaS offering challenges the traditional payroll process which is still very manual highly inefficient and costly. From payment automation tax calculation to National Insurance contributions Pento does it all. They just announced their Series A last month with some good names in the cap table and an ambitious expansion plan.

Javier Perez — partner at Global PayTech Ventures

Pay With Charlie

Vending machines have always been a challenge from a payment perspective. First you had to get the right cash and change. Then as digital payments when mainstream they had to work out to integrate chunky card readers.

Pay With Charlie's system is particularly interesting though — the buyers' mobile phone authorises transactions as opposed to having to equip the vending machines with a full-fledged expensive terminal. You only need to install a simple Bluetooth receiver inside the vending machine and a QR code on the outside to recognize the buyer. The system simplifies and lowers the cost to deploy digital payment acceptance at unattended vending machines. The company also has a female CEO.

Card Dynamics

When a consumer wants to register — say with Netflix — Card Dynamics (CD) gives instruction to their bank and the process is done automatically with no friction for the consumer or merchant. In that sense it simplifies the process of enrollment or registration and sits between your bank account and a merchant website. Card Dynamics also keeps card details current if users card expires or changes.

Trilo

Trilo is an elegant way to pay account-to-account resulting in a simple process and lower cost. It's still setting up to fully launch but is one of the good options taking advantage of open banking regulation.

Swiipe

A simple and functional multipurpose digital wallet. All cards at all merchants with one click and peer-to-peer options as a bonus.

Saffe

Biometrical authentication will be needed for all payments going forward (à la Apple Pay). Saffe is a simple solution that allows the consumer and merchants to incorporate face recognition in the purchasing experience to give certainty and lower costs.

Ethereum blockchain transactions are 35 billion dollars daily

Ethereum exchange transactions annually are 12 times of PayPal transactions

Cryptocurrencies have captured the interest of investors and an example is Ethereum has surged nearly 1100% over the past 12 months. When the crypto world is in turmoil popular crypto KOL Lark Davis feels that Ethereum (ETH) is seriously undervalued. He also gives statistics to prove his point. The market is in a bearish phase but Lark feels that classic ethereum at its current market capitalization and the possible price is seriously trading below its value. Lark added that ethereum is traditional and other cryptocurrencies are just waiting to explode.

At present Ethereum was trading at $1991.43 with a market cap of 235 billion dollars. In comparison with the Ethereum blockchain Paypal has a market capitalization of 340 Billion. Thus it is 100 billion more than classic ethereum.

Ethereum (ETH) price history from 2015 to June 25 2021

The Ethereum (ETH) price in USD kept growing in value over the course of April 2021 at one point reaching over 2500 U.S. dollars. Much like Bitcoin (BTC) the price of ETH went up in 2021 but for different reasons altogether: Ethereum for instance hit the news when a digital art piece was sold as the world’s most expensive NFT for over 38000 ETH – or 69.3 million U.S. dollars. Unlike Bitcoin – of which the price growth was fueled by the IPO of the U.S.’ biggest crypto trader Coinbase – the rally on Ethereum came from technological developments that caused much excitement among traders. First the so-called “Berlin update” rolled out on the Ethereum network in April 2021 an update meant to pave the way for reduced ETH gas prices – or reduced transaction fees. Second the arrival of Uniswap V3 in May 2021 – a smart contract protocol – is expected to further optimize Ethereum trading.

Ethereum’s future and the DeFi industry

Price developments on Ethereum are difficult to predict but cannot be seen without the world of DeFi – or Decentralized Finance. This industry used technology to remove intermediaries between parties in a financial transaction. One example includes crypto wallets such as Coinbase Wallet that grew in popularity in recent years with other examples including smart contractor Uniswap Maker (responsible for stablecoin DAI) money lender Dharma and market protocol Compound. Ethereum’s future developments are tied with this industry: Unlike Bitcoin and Ripple Ethereum is technically not a currency but an open-source software platform for blockchain applications – with Ether being the cryptocurrency that is used inside the Ethereum network. Essentially Ethereum facilitates DeFi – meaning that if DeFi does well so does Ethereum.

NFTs: the most well-known application of Ethereum

NFTs or non-fungible tokens grew nearly ten-fold between 2018 and 2020 as can be seen in the market cap of NFTs worldwide. These digital blockchain assets can essentially function as a unique code connected to a digital file allowing to distinguish the original file from any potential copies. This application is especially prominent in crypto art although there are other applications: gaming sports and collectibles are other segments where NFT sales occur.

Daily Ethereum value from August 2015 to June 25 2021

Paypal settled a trillion dollars

Lark Davis compared the statistics to prove his point. Paypal completed over 15 billion transactions in 2020. It amounted to $936 billion in transaction volume. It is a huge figure worth a trillion dollars settled by Paypal and it is a payment platform of immense proportion.

ETH exchange did over $1.5 trillion worth of transactions

In comparison classic ethereum ETH did a little over a trillion-dollar on-chain settlement in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021 ETH exchange did over $1.5 trillion worth of transactions. Compared to PayPal Ethereum did 50 percent more transactional volume than what PayPal did in an entire financial year.

Lark added that the ethereum blockchain and other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum are increasingly becoming relevant in today’s world. The future is heading towards online payment. It is exactly why PayPal has started to allow its customers to pay for things online using bitcoin and Ethereum in their PayPal accounts.

Davis added that Ethereum is doing $35 billion of daily transactional value settled on the Ethereum blockchain. In other words Ethereum does as many transactions on the Ethereum exchange in a month as PayPal does in a year. Furthermore Ethereum blockchain is doing twelve times as much volume as PayPal is doing. Still PayPal is labeled as the biggest online payment behemoth.

Ethereum is an exceptional asset

Lark Davis continues to compare PayPal to ETH. PayPal pays zero percent dividends while ethereum has just introduced its staking function in December and is paying 6 to 7 % as dividends per year. Lark added that it is better to have ethereum because if you have 100 ethereum you get seven more ETH a year and earn more ethereum next year.

Ethereum blockchain in 2015 expanded the idea to create a peer-to-peer electronic payments system that eliminates the need for financial institutions like banks. In addition to storing transactions the Ethereum blockchain can build smart contracts that power decentralized applications (apps).

PayPal had partnered with Paxos Trust to bring cryptocurrency to the PayPal and Venmo mobile apps. Today PayPal users can buy sell and hold Ethereum Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. However the boldest move by PayPal was to introduce Checkout with Crypto. The service enables consumers to buy and sell wares using digital currencies. PayPal also intends to offer this service to all of its 31 million merchants sometime in the future.

PayPal active accounts surged by 21% in the first quarter of 2021. In the previous year it was 17% growth. CEO Dan Schulman said that 50% of the crypto users open their app daily which shows a high interest in cryptocurrency. It also suggests that these investors are also amenable to new apps like digital payments QR Code payments or the Venmo Credit Card.

Both Ethereum and PayPal have compelling qualities. PayPal could be labeled as a long-term investment option since Ether tokens were designed to power the Ethereum blockchain not to increase in value over time. However it does not mean that Ether value will not increase but at some point in time in the future it will reach a stage of equilibrium."

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday added a warning to patient and provider fact sheets for the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines to indicate a rare risk of heart inflammation.

For each vaccine the fact sheets were revised to include a warning about myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose and with the onset of symptoms within a few days after receiving the shot.

Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is the inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart. Health officials said the benefits of receiving the vaccine still outweigh any risk.

DW takes a closer look.

In a measure of its ambitious efforts to be vaccine self-reliant Cuba has named one of its homegrown jabs Abdala after a famous dramatic verse by independence hero and national icon Jose Marti. In the verse the young hero Abdala heads to war to defend his fatherland full of patriotic fervor no matter how strong and powerful the enemy.

From the perspective of many Cubans it's the perfect name for the first COVID-19 vaccine to be developed in Latin America. And the perfect imagery for the story of a tiny island of 11 million inhabitants eager to show it can't be broken by a deadly virus and a 60-year economic blockade by the United States and a country that boasts several brilliant scientists of its own.

Cuba's new scientist star

One of them is Gerardo Enrique Guillen Nieto director of biomedical research at the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB) in Havana where Abdala was developed.

Last Sunday on Father's Day Cuban television ran a commercial featuring the 58-year-old Guillen Nieto. Accompanied by melodramatic music it opened with the scientist in his clinic while his son talked off camera about how his father works tirelessly for his family and the people.

Guillen Nieto said he gathered researchers from all fields to develop the vaccines Image: Televisión Cubana.

""We have worked full time since the beginning of the pandemic every Saturday every Sunday from early in the morning until late at night without even a moment's rest"" the highly respected scientist said in the clip. ""And we are very euphoric because the results have exceeded all our expectations. We knew the vaccine was very good but not even I expected such a result.""

Charting its own course

According to the state-run biotech corporation BioCubaFarma Abdala has proven about 92.28% effective against COVID-19 in clinical trials which would put it the same league as the most effective vaccines BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna. Huge applause erupted in the auditorium of the CIGB this week when the impressive results were announced.

Since then Guillen Nieto has been inundated with interview requests. The whole world wants to know Abdala's formula for success. The Cuban vaccine is neither a vector vaccine nor does it work with mRNA technology. Instead it's a so-called protein vaccine. That means it carries a portion of the spike protein that the virus uses to bind to human cells. It docks onto the receptors of the virus' own spike protein thus triggering an immune reaction. The scientists are using yeast as a receptor-binding domain.

The government vaccination program was rolled out in mid-May with Abdala and the second homegrown vaccine Soberana 2 even before the completion of the third phase of clinical trials. These are the first vaccines on the island since Cuba declined importing any shots from Russia or China. Cuba has also decided against joining the UN-backed COVAX initiative a global project aimed at getting COVID-19 shots to countries regardless of their wealth.

""We know that in the end we always have to rely on ourselves on our own strengths and abilities"" said Guillen Nieto alluding to the political isolation caused by the US embargo. ""The result is a health care system that is not only free of cost but also centrally controlled and that has perfected the ability to respond quickly to disasters be it with clinical trials with vaccination campaigns or even the production of a vaccine.""

Vaccinations to curb rising COVID infections

According to Guillen Nieto 2.2 million Cubans have already received their first vaccination 1.7 million their second and 900000 the third dose.

Abdala is administered in three doses with two weeks between each vaccination. Based on the government's ambitious plans 70% of country's population should receive their shots by August.

It's a race against time because the number of new infections on the Caribbean island is steadily rising with more than 2000 cases a day. Nearly 1200 people have died of COVID-19 in Cuba. Guillen Nieto is counting on the vaccination campaign to give him a decisive advantage over all other countries in the world in the fight against the virus.

""Here there is an unprecedented level of trust in the Cuban health system"" he said. ""For example we never have problems finding volunteers when it comes to clinical trials. In Cuba people are extremely eager to be vaccinated. No one here would think of not getting inoculated because everyone knows how important vaccinations are.""

An independent panel of experts in Havana will now scrutinize the Abdala vaccine and official emergency approval is expected in the next two weeks. After that Cuba could also apply to the World Health Organization (WHO) for approval of Abdala for international use. Bolivia Jamaica Venezuela Argentina and Mexico have already signaled interest.

WHO shares optimism

But is Abdala really the miracle vaccine that the numbers promise? Perhaps Jose Moya is the man best placed to assess this. The Peruvian doctor started out as an epidemiologist 30 years ago in his native Ayacucho and then worked for Doctors Without Borders in Guatemala Mozambique and Nigeria.

For the past two years Moya has been the representative in Cuba of PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) a regional organization of the WHO with 27 country offices. And he trusts the Cuban figures.

""The CIGB Research Institute has 30 years of experience in vaccine research. I trust the results that have been published. These are serious studies with the participation of researchers and institutions committed to science"" Moya said.

The best proof is the fact that 80% of all of Cuba's vaccines are produced in the country itself Moya said. He was not surprised by the high efficacy of Abdala saying it was simply the logical consequence of a health care system that had been performing steadily well for decades. ""Already the results published by the scientists beforehand showed a good response in terms of antibody production"" he said.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel however does not want to dwell on scientific assessments of the new vaccine. For him the country's drive to pursue homegrown solutions rather than importing foreign vaccines are a triumph of Cuba's biotech industry.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added a warning about the risk of heart inflammation to fact sheets for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.

The warning on Friday noted that reports of adverse events following vaccination – particularly after the second dose – suggest increased risks of myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis or inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.

The warning update follows an extensive review of information and discussion by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC’s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on Wednesday the FDA said.

At end of the second week of June more than 1200 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have been reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

The cases reportedly appear to be notably higher in males and in the week after the second vaccine dose.

There has been no comment from Pfizer and Moderna yet."

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The first thing Hidalgo was asked elicited some laughter from the live audience to nobody’s surprise.

Hidalgo is appointment viewing on and off the court.

“My teammates call me a gnat because I’m all over them” Hidalgo said when asked if she has a go-to nickname.

There were a couple other quick-hitting questions thrown Hidalgo’s way. She said the high point of her career so far was Notre Dame winning the ACC Tournament in March. The low point was Notre Dame losing to Oregon State in the Sweet 16. She gave props to her parents and coaches for getting her to where she is today.

Here’s everything else Hidalgo said at the summit.

On arriving at Notre Dame and becoming one of the best players in the country as a true freshman…

“I know what God instilled in me. I know the gifts that he’s placed in me even from a young age. I’m big on my faith. I know God as blessed me with a talent so it’s so easy to be able to just go out there and just play my game. Also I have coaches and teammates that have so much confidence in me. When they tell me to go score the ball we need you to score we need you to play defense like you do it just makes everything so easy to just go out and do it when they give you the keys to do so.”

On Notre Dame head coach Niele Ivey being a players’ coach…

“It’s definitely a blessing to be able to have that connection with your coach to be able to go to her and say ‘This isn’t working’ or ‘What do you see? I don’t know what to do in this situation.’ It just makes the game so much easier and it makes me as a player want to run through a wall for a coach like that who gives everything and instills everything in you. It’s truly a blessing to be able to have that connection with her.”

On Notre Dame’s chances of winning the national title in the next few seasons…

“Absolutely. Absolutely. Not to be cocky but we have a lot of talent. Women’s basketball in general has a lot of talent. You can find it all over. But we have a lot of injuries coming back and transfers especially players like Olivia Miles coming back. A lot of people might have forgotten but she’s going to come back and shock the world with the talent she has. Emma Risch Cassandre Prosper. We just have so much firepower coming back. It’s going to be exciting.”

On someone she looks up to…

“[Skylar Diggins-Smith] for sure. Obviously she went to Notre Dame but she is just a dog on the court. Her being a smaller guard and just the defensive firepower that she brings I’m able to look at that and kind of model my game after that.”

More on what Ivey means to her…

“Just to persevere. Obviously Coach Ivey went through some stuff during the season and just to be able to see her come out on the court with all the stuff that she had gone through and was still going through and still to be able to come to practices and talk to recruits even through everything that she had been through it was amazing to see. I saw how much she persevered through all the stuff she was going through.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyYW50LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzI3L3BoaWxpcC1tb3JyaXMtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1pcy1icmluZ2luZy1pdHMtdmlzaW9uLWZvci1hLXNtb2tlLWZyZWUtdG9iYWNjby1mdXR1cmUtdG8tY29ubmVjdGljdXQtYnV0LXdoeS1pcy10aGUtY29tcGFueS1tb3ZpbmctaGVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philip Morris International is bringing its vision for a 'smoke-free' tobacco future to Connecticut but why is the company ...,"Almost immediately after Gov. Ned Lamont announced and defended Philip Morris International’s move to Connecticut from New York the tobacco giant launched an advertising blitz touting its work to become “smoke-free” and how the state’s role in scientific research can help it reach that goal.

Anti-tobacco advocates dismissed Philip Morris’ work advertised on numerous websites soon after the relocation was announced Tuesday at a news conference in Stamford. Critics also took aim at Lamont saying he’s failing to do more to stamp out tobacco use.

“We consider it an ideal location for our new U.S. head office where we will be working to more quickly achieve our vision of a smoke-free future” Philip Morris said when it announced the move to Fairfield County.

The relocation from Park Avenue in Manhattan will bring 200 jobs Philip Morris and the Lamont administration said. It’s scheduled for summer 2022 at a site yet to be determined.

Peter Denious president and chief executive officer of AdvanceCT the state’s rebranded economic development group that was instrumental in recruiting Philip Morris International said in an interview Friday that Connecticut’s “innovation community and our life sciences our expertise in the area” played an important role.

“This company is in the midst of a transformation and saw our assets in that area as valuable” he said.

A shoreline life sciences presence

For a decade or more Connecticut has sought to expand its presence in biopharma precision medicine and genetic research. It spent nearly $300 million on bringing the Jackson Lab and its research center to Farmington and invested in Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. as it became the state’s star start-up. All of this has been part of a strategy to develop well-paid jobs and begin replacing those lost in manufacturing and finance.

The result is a growing research and product development network particularly along the shoreline branching out from Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven and extending to Branford Guilford Stamford and elsewhere.

Philip Morris has not identified potential Connecticut research or life science ventures it might work with to advance its smoke-free research. The cigarette maker with revenue of $28.7 billion in 2020 has deep pockets to continue to finance its transformation in Connecticut.

The tobacco company one of the world’s largest manufactures six of the top 15 cigarette brands including the instantly recognizable Marlboro that it sells worldwide but not in the U.S. Philip Morris USA a unit of Altria Group Inc. sells Marlboro and other brands in the U.S.

Philip Morris International’s operational headquarters in Lausanne Switzerland.

Philip Morris International said it’s aiming for at least $1 billion in net revenue from “Beyond Nicotine” products in 2025 with possible products including respiratory drug delivery such as aerosols of aspirin. Much of the work will leverage Philip Morris’ expertise but mergers and acquisitions are a “likely component of our beyond nicotine strategy” spokesman Corey Henry said.

“However beyond that I can’t comment on any hypotheticals regarding potential ventures” he said.

Denious said state officials showed a “willingness to listen and understand” Philip Morris’ “transformation and openness to (its) evolving business.” And the company recognizes Lamont’s position that includes his support for a ban on flavored vaping and legislation he signed in 2019 raising the legal age to buy cigarettes to 21 from 18 he said.

“There was a good respect for both perspectives” Denious said.

Other points such as lower costs for office space in Fairfield County than in Manhattan came up in discussions between the Lamont administration and Philip Morris he said.

Smoke-free research but still selling cigarettes

Cathy Callaway director of state and local campaigns at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said Philip Morris has had 23 years to sharply scale back or even end tobacco use since the Master Settlement Agreement between tobacco companies and state attorneys general that scaled back cigarette advertising and sales.

Henry said Philip Morris International was not a party to the settlement. Philip Morris USA which sells cigarettes in the U.S. was involved in negotiations for the agreement.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal who participated in negotiating the Master Settlement Agreement as Connecticut’s attorney general did not respond to requests for comment about Philip Morris’ move to Fairfield County.

Callaway said Philip Morris has made little if any progress fighting tobacco use despite promoting its research into alternatives to cigarettes.

“It’s business as usual for them” she said. “They’re saying one thing and they’re doing something else.”

Matthew L. Myers president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids dismissed Philip Morris’ pledges of smoke-free products as “trying to read tea leaves.”

“We find they continue to oppose tobacco control measures in countries all across the globe that would in fact reduce cigarette use” he said. “We have seen them continue to heavily advertise on TV in any country where it hasn’t been outlawed.”

Investing in smoke-free products

Henry said Philip Morris International has invested $8.1 billion since 2008 in smoke-free products for research product and commercial development production capacity scientific work and studies he said.

In comparison five years ago net revenue from smoke-free products was “essentially zero” while Philip Morris last year earmarked 99% of its research and development to smoke-free products he said.

“We are making rapid progress. Every year our sale of combusted cigarettes goes down and the sale of smoke-free products goes up” Henry said.

Philip Morris’s sophisticated ad campaign suddenly appearing in print and digital media across the state promises that the company’s move to Connecticut “will enable us to deliver a smoke-free future to the world faster.”

In the first quarter of this year nearly 30% of Philip Morris International’s net revenue came from smoke-free products and its ambition is to boost the share to 50% in 2025 he said.

Callaway’s criticism did not solely target Philip Morris. Connecticut has “virtually no money” set aside for smoking cessation and prevention and only this year dedicated $1 million for tobacco control she said.

Philip Morris International sells Marlboro cigarettes worldwide but not in the United States.

Max Reiss a spokesman for Lamont said the state spends millions of dollars annually across several agencies including the Department of Public Health Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and Office of Policy and Management. He did not provide a dollar amount.

Callaway said many “elected officials still don’t have the political will to do the things that we know will be effective at reducing tobacco use.”

“Unfortunately Gov. Lamont seems to fall into that category listening to them over listening to those that are promoting public health and protecting public health” she said.

The governor has pointed out he backed an effort this year in the legislature to ban e-cigarettes and certain vaping products based on nicotine content or with a flavoring agent other than tobacco. It failed and Lamont said he’ll try again to enact the ban into law.

Lamont and Connecticut tobacco policy

Lamont signed cannabis legislation that also further restricts tobacco use. In addition to a ban in health care settings restaurants state buildings and more smoking is now prohibited in hotels motels and other places of lodging and in correctional facilities and halfway houses

Lamont was asked Tuesday about the deal with Philip Morris International which involved no state financial incentives. He praised the company for developing the IQOS electronic tobacco heating system that doesn’t use fire combustion or smoke to generate nicotine-containing aerosol. The product has been authorized for sale by the Food and Drug Administration but the agency placed strict limits on marketing to prevent youth access.

For its part Phillip Morris says it will be a “progressive employer that invests in local communities” and a company that is “driven by science and bold ambition.”

Lamont said he was proud Philip Morris International chose Connecticut and that it will “take the lead getting people who were addicted to cigarette smoking off of cigarettes.”

“I think they’re headed in the right direction” he said.

In the year that ended in March sales of rolled tobacco products plunged by a record 16.3% from the year before to 98.8 billion sticks the lowest since fiscal 1990 when comparable data became available according to the Tobacco Institute of Japan.

Nonetheless Cambodia is in the process of developing a tobacco tax roadmap to guide future long-term policy amid calls from NGOs to increase rates.

In 2019 the Kingdom exported more than $30 million worth of tobacco products – $18 million of cigarettes and over $12 million of leaves – and imported in excess of $246 million in products – over $225 million of cigarettes and more than $21 million of leaves according to Ministry of Commerce data.

From January-June last year Cambodian tobacco exports were to the tune of more than $3.6 million in cigarettes and over $3.4 million in leaves.

While no export statistics are available for last year’s second half the Kingdom imported some $191 million in tobacco products for the full-year 2020 – over $183.5 million of cigarettes and $7.5 million of leaves.

In the ASEAN region the countries with the lowest tax burdens are Cambodia (25-31.10 per cent) and Laos (18.81 per cent) the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (SEATCA) reported earlier this year.

JT International (Cambodia) Co Ltd (JTI Cambodia) general manager Roy Manalili discussed the tobacco industry with The Post in a virtual interview.

What are your thoughts on tobacco regulation enforcement in Cambodia?

Regulation of the tobacco industry that follows internationally accepted principles of “Better Regulation” can meet public policy goals and ensure that business interests are respected. Dialogue between governmental authorities and businesses is essential if the regulation of the tobacco industry is to be effective and proportionate.

In Cambodia we encourage the government to enforce the existing laws covering the tobacco industry to reduce the amount of illegal trade products in the market which are not complying with the law.

Illegal trade cheats everyone – governments consumers legitimate businesses and local communities. It robs governments of tax revenue consumers do not know what they are smoking as counterfeit cigarettes are not subject to quality controls it harms small businesses and invites organised crime into communities.

Is the industry an attractive investment option?

As a legitimate business we are a significant revenue generator for the Cambodian government while also creating jobs and supporting communities and local businesses. We encourage the government to enforce the existing laws covering the tobacco industry to reduce the amount of illegal trade products in the market which are not complying with the law.

The trade of cheap illegal tobacco robs the government of tax revenue while also undermining public health objectives and efforts to prevent adolescents from smoking. Criminals sell their dodgy products in back streets and online – they don’t care to whom they sell.

There are four major international companies represented in Cambodia – JTI British American Tobacco (Cambodia) Ltd Imperial Brands Plc’s Huotraco International Ltd and Philip Morris International Inc through Heng Heng Group. There are several other local companies operating here also.

What would a reasonable tobacco tax rate be?

The government applies 20 per cent excise rates and an additional public lighting tax of three per cent.

JTI believes decisions on taxation should reflect the interests and concerns of individual countries. Each country has its own optimal level of tobacco taxes that reflect its unique fiscal economic and social circumstances where one-size-fits-all fiscal policies do not work.

Sudden or steep tobacco tax increases are counter-productive – governments risk losing tax revenues as legal products become unaffordable leading consumers to shift to cheaper often illegal products marketed by criminals.

Excessive taxes are not an effective means of combating the illicit cigarette market. Spikes in tobacco taxes in a market like Cambodia would only serve to further develop the illegal trade in cigarettes and create so many unintended consequences.

The correlations between jumps in tobacco taxes and the development of illegal trade are well-known much to the detriment of governments.

Malaysia is one such example where the uncontrolled proliferation of illegal tobacco in the grip of criminal gangs continues to hinder the lawful activities of the legitimate tobacco industry and ravage government revenues. Six out of every 10 packs sold in Malaysia today are illegal.

What specific factors should the government look into to determine the best fitting rate?

We believe that tobacco taxation in particular should carefully consider a country’s priorities and concerns such as government revenue regional development and employment income and consumer purchasing power with its impact on the affordability of tobacco products illegal trade and regional sensitivities such as cross-border shopping.

Therefore a predictable and progressive increase would be right for the operating environment in Cambodia.

How do you see the industry evolving in the upcoming years?

We envisage that the government will move to enforce against any product that is illegally traded. Illegal trade cannot be dealt with in isolation.

We help governments regulators police and customs crackdown on illegal trade by sharing information and developing specific programmes. We do this to protect our business and our brands.

Like many other consumer goods companies JTI has invested heavily in building its brands over many years. They are JTI’s most precious assets and we want to protect them for the future.

The 16 non-smoking COPD-patients (mean age 68) were randomly exposed to vapour for 2 sessions each of which lasted 4 hours.

The researchers reported that the passive exposure exerts acute small inflammatory responses in the lungs and blood as well as throat irritation. “SP-A in exhaled air and some plasma proteins were affected by passive vape in patients with COPD indicating inflammation showing that passive vape exposure is potentially harmful.”

COPD smokers who switched to vaping reported benefits

The research team also reported “significant and constant improvements in lung function [and] CAT scores” (a health questionnaire used for COPD patients) in the vaping vs the control group.

Meanwhile other studies have indicated that smoking COPD patients benefited greatly by switching from smoking to vaping. Following up on findings published two years ago a recent study led by award winning and renowned expert in tobacco harm reduction Prof. Riccardo Polosa confirmed that smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who switched to vaping reported improved respiratory symptoms in comparison to those who continued to smoke.

Titled “Health effects in COPD smokers who switch to electronic cigarettes: a retrospective-prospective 3-year follow-up” the earlier study followed 44 patients for a period of three years. The participants were split in two groups those who switched from smoking to vaping and the ones who kept on smoking. The compiled data indicated that the COPD patients who switched reported improved respiratory symptoms while those who continued to smoke experienced no change.

A reduction of about 50% in flare ups

Following up on these same COPD patients two years later the current study “COPD smokers who switched to e-cigarettes: health outcomes at 5-year follow up” found that the vaping group continued to experience health improvements. They reported a reduction of about 50% in flare ups a significantly improved cardio-respiratory health and increased exercise ability and quality of life.

The recent study managed to compile complete data from 39 participants—19 in the COPD smokers control group and 20 in the COPD e-cigarette user group. The research team also reported “significant and constant improvements in lung function [and] CAT scores” (a health questionnaire used for COPD patients) in the vaping vs the control group. “E-cigarettes can be a massive remedy for COPD and this is important for physicians patients and their caregivers” concluded the study.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjaG9yb3Vrb25saW5lLmNvbS90aGUtZmxvdy1vZi1jaWdhcmV0dGVzLWZyb20tYWxnZXJpYS10by1mcmFuY2UtZGVjcmVhc2VkLWJ5LTc40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Flow Of Cigarettes From Algeria To France Decreased By 78%,

The Equality Act passed the House of Representatives in February but is yet to be passed by the Senate.

All but three Republicans in the House voted against LGBTQ+ equality. Those 206 politicians were bolstered in part by huge donations from US corporations.

Amazon for instance donated over $450000 to politicians who voted against the Act according to data from The Center for Responsive Politics for the 2020 election cycle.

But the company is still happy to garner profits from queer identities. The company offers a special Pride store offering unicorn pool floats and rainbow-striped K-Swiss sneakers.

Fran Tirado a writer and LGBTQ+ strategist is critical of these advertising efforts. “In an ideal world there would be no Pride campaigns. Brands and companies profiting off marginalized identities with bad rainbow-washed advertising ploys is an abhorrent tradition of this country” he said.

It’s not just products. Tirado watches his inbox get flooded every June with work requests. “Most queer and trans folks who get wrapped into any kind of marketing initiative this month often end up feeling exhausted underpaid tokenized and exploited. But because we exist under capitalism Pride campaigns are obligatory – and often a key source of income for queer and trans people in media and entertainment spaces.”

Walmart has also donated over $400000 to politicians that sought to block equality. The food giant has changed its Twitter avatar this month to be a rainbow colored-version of its logo.

Reporting record earnings (tied to pandemic-induced home improvement projects) Home Depot has also shown support for politicians that blocked the Equality Act. The company’s billionaire co-founder Ken Langone is a longtime donor to the Republican party.

Like Amazon and Walmart Home Depot also makes donations to Democratic candidates (for instance giving a quarter of a million dollars to the Biden campaign). Many firms donate to candidates from both parties to hedge their bets when it comes to political influence.

AT&T also provided a huge boost to Republican politicians trying to prevent a federal law that would protect LGBTQ+ people. The company donated over $1m to 163 different Republicans including Steve Scalise ($22150) and Kevin McCarthy ($20881).

These totals only include donations to politicians that voted against the bill. But many corporations also made large donations to Mitch McConnell (for example AT&T gave him $56295 in the 2020 cycle) despite his persistent obstructions to the Equality Act. In 2020 McConnell then the Senate majority leader refused to bring the act to the Senate floor.

There has been widespread anger in the LGBTQ+ community in recent years over the perceived corporate hijacking of Pride marches. In 2019 the Reclaim Pride Coalition launched the Queer Liberation March as an “antidote to the corporate-infused police-entangled politician-heavy Parades that now dominate Pride celebrations in a grotesque expression of societal forms of marginalization and oppression for Queer and Trans people”.

For Tirado engaging with big brands is often necessary but “holding them accountable is a crucial part of how we ethically engage with these campaigns”. He adds that’s why it’s added salt to the wound for any company to brag “allyship” and a rainbow logo while also donating to anti-queer efforts. “If you’re going to perform advocacy we need to see it matched on your dollars too resourcing queer and trans communities year-round.”

This year’s Queer Liberation March in New York will take place on Sunday the same day as New York City Pride one of the largest annual Pride marches in the world. Amazon Walmart Home Depot and others will not be welcome.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oeXVuZGFpLm5ld3MvZXUvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvZ2xvYmFsLWh5dW5kYWktZHJlYW0tY2VudGVyLWtlbnlhLWZvci1hdXRvbW90aXZlLXRyYWluaW5nLWFuZC1lZHVjYXRpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hyundai Motor Opens Global Hyundai Dream Center in Kenya for Automotive Training and Education,Hyundai Motor has established Hyundai Dream Center Kenya within the electronics plant and automotive centers at NITA – a state-run vocational training institute – to help stimulate growth in the local automotive industry.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)



Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

There were 11 insurance firms that reported a drop in revenue in 2020 including Prudential Aviva and Legal and General according to statistics from data and analytics firm GlobalData.

An aggregate revenue of $1923.9bn was reported by the top 20 global public insurance companies in 2020 showcasing a year-on-year decline of around 5% in top line performance last year.

Most of the top companies witnessed a decline in new business activities and premium income.

Firms were also affected by a decline in investment return owing to a lower interest rate environment and uncertainty in financial markets against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.

What firms were affected?

The main firm impacted was Prudential due to a substantial rise in outward reinsurance premiums which amounted to $32.2bn up from $1.6bn in the previous year.

This is because it paid Athene Life Re for reinsuring its in-force fixed and fixed index annuity business.

This subsequently brought down its net earned premiums steeply by around 75%.

In addition to this there was a 5% decline in its gross written premiums (GWP) due to lower new business premiums from Asia as well as lower sales of fixed annuities and fixed index annuities in the US which abetted the revenue decline.

Meanwhile Aviva has been selling off its non-core businesses to steer gains for developing its core markets in the UK Canada and Ireland as well as increasing shareholders’ return. This also aims to mitigate lower investment returns.

Parth Vala company profiles analyst at GlobalData said: “Unlike Prudential Aviva suffered due to its weak investment returns especially from its UK and Ireland life business and manage-for-value business in France and Italy where its income from investments dropped by 51% 70% and 28% respectively.”

On the other hand Legal and General derived approximately 80% of its revenue from investment activities.

As a result the firm saw a 26.1% contraction in its investment income in 2020 to reach £39.2bn compared with £53bn in the previous year - this greatly impacted its revenue stream.

The insurer saw a 37.1% drop in gains on financial investments designated at fair value through profit or loss and a 24% decline in dividend income which adversely affected the overall investment return of the company.

Zurich Insurance Group was also impacted. The insurer’s revenue stream from investment income almost halved in 2020 compared to the previous year reaching $12.3bn from $24.8bn - this can be attributed to a 56% decrease in investment results on unit-linked investments related to its life insurance business.

The remaining nine insurance players reported “subdued to moderate” revenue growth with Allianz China Life and China Pacific Insurance reporting a year-on-year growth rate of 10%.

However Dai-ichi Life outperformed the top players with revenue growth surpassing 20%. This was due to the weaker currency Yen allowing the company’s returns from its investments to soar significantly over the previous year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb253b3JsZC5pbi9wb2xpY3ktdXBkYXRlcy1hbmQtZWNvbm9taWMtbmV3cy8taW5kaWEtdG8tYmVjb21lLWdsb2JhbC1lY29ub21pYy1wb3dlcmhvdXNlLS1uaXJtYWxhLXNpdGhhcmFtYW4tLzI3OTE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India to become global economic powerhouse: Nirmala Sitharaman,"Hi There!

There are some ICE-ing incidents that may be understandable. A driver may not be familiar with how electric cars work; they might not be aware that non-electric cars should not park in designated charging stations; or they might simply occupy a charging slot for a few minutes. A reported ICE-ing incident in New Jersey does not seem to be one of these incidents.

As shared by Tesla owner James Bledsoe a Supercharger station at the Springfield New Jersey Wawa location has been perennially blocked by a Ford Transit from the Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) a publicly-traded diversified energy company and the largest utility in New Jersey. What was remarkable is that PSEG vehicles have reportedly been blocking a Tesla Supercharger at the location almost every day.

The Tesla owner observed that it was not just PSEG employees that tended to block designated charging spots at the Springfield NJ Wawa location either. Employees from Wawa itself have been observed to occupy reserved charging slots. Images shared on an EV Facebook group showed some Wawa employees parking on some Supercharger slots even if there were free parking spots nearby.

Some PSEG vehicles that had been sighted blocking a Tesla Supercharger were actually worse. Earlier this year a massive RAM pickup owned by PSEG was photographed in the same location ICE-ing two Supercharger slots in one go. Granted the location reportedly allows 15 minutes of general parking but the PSEG RAM back then and the Ford Transit in the recent incident occupied the charging slots far longer than was allowed.

There is some irony to be had in the idea of vehicles from a power company blocking a Tesla Supercharger or any electric vehicle charging station for that matter. EVs after all are becoming ubiquitous and being the largest utility in New Jersey the PSEG must be familiar with how important each charging station is to electric car owners. Amidst the growing adoption of EVs every charging station matters especially those that are used by the most popular electric cars on the market today.

213800 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s doubling of the child tax credit.

Every income group in every Connecticut congressional district received a tax cut. Nationwide a typical family of four received a $2000 annual tax cut and a single parent with one child received a $1300 annual tax cut.

1028380 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s doubling of the standard deduction. Thanks to the tax cuts nine out of ten households take the standard deduction which provides tax relief and simplifies the tax filing process.

45200 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s elimination of the Obamacare individual mandate tax. Most households hit with this tax made less than $50000 per year.

Lower utility bills: As a direct result of the TCJA’s corporate tax rate cut Connecticut residents are saving money on utility bills. Lower electric water and gas bills help households and small businesses operating on tight margins. For example at least eight Connecticut utilities reduced their customers’ bills (see below).

Thanks to the tax cuts Connecticut businesses of all sizes are hiring expanding raising pay and increasing employee benefits:

Charter Communications Inc. (Stamford Connecticut) – Base wage raised to $15 per hour; commitment to hire over 20000 employees by 2020:

With the resources and investment confidence resulting from historic tax reform legislation and the FCC’s removal of the 1930’s era regulatory framework for internet service Charter is increasing our investment in our workforce by ensuring all employees are paid a minimum wage of at least $15 per hour including target commissions within the next year.

In addition the reforms in Washington are allowing Charter to increase its capital investment including in its broadband network. Last year given the general deregulatory environment and anticipating the Administration Congress and the FCC enacting these pro-growth policies we announced we would hire 20000 employees and invest $25 billion in infrastructure.

Today with tax reform and the removal of the Title II statutory framework both a reality Charter will continue the capital investment program we started last year and will complete it by 2020. In 2017 we extended the reach of our high-speed broadband network in rural areas like Meeker CO Lakeview OR Hawthorne NV as well as to more than 42000 underserved and unserved homes and businesses in New York State. Charter remains steadfast in our commitment to continue to bring our broadband service with a minimum speed of 100 Mbps to more communities across the country. – Feb. 2 2018 Charter Communications Inc. statement

Thomas Hooker Brewery (Bloomfield Connecticut) – The brewery used savings from the tax cut to expand the business and create new jobs:

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says a federal tax credit for small-scale breweries distilleries and wineries has helped create jobs in Connecticut.

The tax credit for small scale alcohol producers was initially part of the 2017 Trump tax cut. It’s been extended in the bipartisan federal budget passed by Congress last month. Blumenthal says he opposed Trump’s tax cuts to big business but this particular tax cut is for small businesses and is a job creator.

“These craft breweries put the savings back into their businesses. They create jobs. They produce more beer. They meet demand. And they provide good value.”

Blumenthal spoke at Thomas Hooker Brewery in Bloomfield. Brewery owner Curt Cameron agrees that he’s putting 100% of his tax cut back into his business “in our case a brand-new pizza kitchen which is an offshoot of our existing business. It will create at least seven jobs immediately.”

If the tax break had not been extended craft breweries like Thomas Hooker would have faced a federal excise tax increase of 400% this year. – Dec. 31 2019 WSHU article.

Lautenbach President and CEO. “We believe that the investments we make in our employees and our clients not only strengthen our business for the long term but ultimately benefit our shareholders.” In addition Pitney Bowes plans to provide additional investments that contribute to the long-term growth of the Company including funding the financing offerings within Pitney Bowes to support growth in its small and medium-sized business clients in the U.S. – Jan. 31 2018 Pitney Bowes press release excerpt

Shortway Brewing Co. (Newport Connecticut) — Increasing wages and hiring new employees:

Mr. Shortway said the new tax plan along with the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act also passed last year have already helped the brewery save money. The craft beverage act greatly reduced excise taxes on small-scale brewers and the tax plan has additional provisions designed to help small businesses.

Mr. Shortway said he was able to give his employees a small raise and hire more workers as a result of the tax savings. He said although it is a bit early to know what the long-term impact of the tax plan will be he expects it will keep helping going forward.

“Growth is picking up” he said. – May 11 2018 News-Times article excerpt

The Travelers Companies Inc. (Hartford Connecticut) — $1000 bonuses for 14000 employees with a base salary less than $75000:

Today comprehensive U.S. tax reform has been signed into law. One objective of the legislation is to spur economic growth and therefore the U.S. economy.

In addition to benefiting from economic growth Travelers will benefit directly from the legislation in two important ways. First like all companies our corporate tax rate will decrease from 35% to 21%. Second the legislation will level the playing field for U.S. insurers by eliminating a loophole that foreign insurers have used to our disadvantage for decades to move their U.S. profits offshore to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.

One of the opportunities all of these benefits create for us is to make additional investments in our business. I shared at a recent all-employee meeting that our vision as it relates to investment and innovation is to strengthen our competitive advantages with two goals in mind: be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers.

The leadership team decided that given our confidence in our business and the way we are successfully positioned for the opportunities ahead we should start making additional investments immediately. We also came to the conclusion that we should use the opportunity to make our first investment in our most valuable asset and greatest competitive advantage — our people.

I’m pleased to announce that we will be giving approximately 14000 employees with a base salary of $75000 per year or less and who meet our performance expectations a special one-time bonus of $1000. The bonus will be paid in January to then current employees. Eligible employees will hear more shortly.

In addition while we have only a small number of U.S.-based employees making less than $15 an hour we will increase their hourly wage to $15. – The Travelers Companies Inc. note to employees

United Technologies Corporation (Farmington Connecticut) – 35000 new employees to be hired and $15 billion in capital expenditures and research/development over the next five years:

The competitive tax system resulting from U.S. tax reform is encouraging global companies such as United Technologies to make long-term investments in innovation in America. – May 23 2018 United Technologies Corporation press release excerpt

Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (Hartford Connecticut) — $1000 bonuses for employees making less than $75000 per year. This amounts to 9500 employees:

The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. on Friday became the latest company to announce bonuses tied to a federal overhaul reducing the corporate tax rate.

Chief Executive Officer Christopher Swift told reporters the investment and insurance company will distribute bonuses of $1000 each to employees who are paid less than $75000 a year. – Jan. 5 Hartford Courant article excerpt

Cigna Corporation (Bloomfield Connecticut) – Base wage raised to $16 per hour; increased 401(k) matches:

Global health service company Cigna (NYSE: CI) today announced that the net financial benefits of United States tax reform will allow the company to further accelerate investments in our employees our capabilities and our customers clients partners and communities.

San Francisco-based Premise Data Corp. pays users many of them in the developing world to complete basic tasks for small payments. Typical assignments involve snapping photos filling out surveys or doing other basic data collection or observational reporting such as counting ATMs or reporting on the price of consumer goods like food.

About half of the company’s clients are private businesses seeking commercial information Premise says. That can involve assignments like gathering market information on the footprint of competitors scouting locations and other basic public observational tasks. Premise in recent years has also started working with the U.S. military and foreign governments marketing the capability of its flexible global gig-based workforce to do basic reconnaissance and gauge public opinion.

Premise is one of a growing number of companies that straddle the divide between consumer services and government surveillance and rely on the proliferation of mobile phones as a way to turn billions of devices into sensors that gather open-source information useful to government security services around the world.

The company says 90% of its work is gauging public sentiment and understanding human geography by paying users to fill out surveys yielding data that it says has uses for commercial businesses nonprofits and governments. A smaller number of projects it says involve asking users to go out into the world to complete tasks such as taking pictures or walking a predetermined route. Sometimes those tasks involve collecting data on nearby wireless signals or other cellphones the company said comparing the practice to how Google and Apple map Wi-Fi networks with phones using their operating systems.

“Data gained from our contributors helped inform government policy makers on how to best deal with vaccine hesitancy susceptibility to foreign interference and misinformation in elections as well as the location and nature of gang activity in Honduras” Premise Chief Executive Officer

Maury Blackman

said. The company declined to name its clients citing confidentiality.

Premise launched in 2013 as a tool meant to gather data for use in international development work by governments and nongovernmental organizations. In recent years it has also forged ties to the U.S. national-security establishment and highlighted its capability to serve as a surveillance tool according to documents and interviews with former employees. As of 2019 the company’s marketing materials said it has 600000 contributors operating in 43 countries including global hot spots such as Iraq Afghanistan Syria and Yemen.

According to federal spending records Premise has received at least $5 million since 2017 on military projects—including from contracts with the Air Force and the Army and as a subcontractor to other defense entities. In one pitch on its technology prepared in 2019 for Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Afghanistan Premise proposed three potential uses that could be carried out in a way that is “responsive to commander’s information requirements”: gauge the effectiveness of U.S. information operations; scout and map out key social structures such as mosques banks and internet cafes; and covertly monitor cell-tower and Wi-Fi signals in a 100-square-kilometer area. The presentation said tasks needed to be designed to “safeguard true intent”—meaning contributors wouldn’t necessarily be aware they were participating in a government operation.

The company said the document reflected only potential capabilities and doesn’t accurately characterize the work it does for military clients. A spokesperson for coalition forces in Afghanistan didn’t respond to a request for comment about whether coalition forces ever saw the concept note or had engaged Premise’s services.

A second document submitted to the Air Force for a grant that the company ultimately received echoed similar capabilities—with Premise saying it could dispatch workers to do “directed observations associated sentiment and wireless network mapping.” Another Premise document says the company can design “proxy activities” such as counting bus stops electricity lines or ATMs to provide incentives for contributors to move around as background data is gathered.

Data from Wi-Fi networks cell towers and mobile devices can be valuable to the military for situational awareness target tracking and other intelligence purposes. There is also tracking potential in having a distributed network of phones acting as sensors and knowing the signal strength of nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points can be useful when trying to jam communications during military operations. Nearby wireless-network names can also help identify where a device is even if the GPS is off communications experts say.

Mr. Blackman said gathering open-source data of that nature doesn’t constitute intelligence work. “Such data is available to anyone who has a cellphone” he said. “It is not unique or secret.”

“If some of our data is used by government departments to shape policy and to protect our citizens we are proud of that” he said.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think the rise of app-based reconnaissance will affect the intelligence community? Join the conversation below.

Premise submitted a document last July to the British government describing its capabilities saying it can capture more than 100 types of metadata from its contributors’ phones and provide them to paying customers—including the phone’s location type battery level and installed apps. A spokesman for the British embassy in Washington didn’t respond to a question about whether any U.K. government agencies were using the service.

Users of the Premise app aren’t told which entity has contracted with the company for the information they are tasked with gathering. The company’s privacy policy discloses that some clients may be governments and that it may collect certain types of data from the phone according to a spokesman.

“All those who collect and use Premise are fully informed by the public terms of service—available on the app and the Premise website—that the open-source data collected by local paid ‘contributors’ from their cellphones could be shared with any of Premise’s customers including government agencies” Mr. Blackman said.

Currently the app assigns about five tasks a day to its users in Afghanistan according to interviews with users there including taking photos of ATMs money-exchange shops supermarkets and hospitals.

At left a screenshot of the Premise app shows examples of tasks available to a user in Washington D.C. At right a sample task the company uses to train new app users as shown to a user in Afghanistan.

One user in Afghanistan said he and others there are typically paid 20 Afghani per task or about 25 cents—income for phone and internet services. A few months ago some of the tasks on the site struck him as potentially concerning. He said the app posted several tasks of identifying and photographing Shiite mosques in a part of western Kabul populated largely by members of the ethnic Hazara Shiite minority. The neighborhood was attacked several times by Islamic State over the past five years and militants killed at least 50 people there in May in three explosions targeting a girls’ school an attack for which no group has claimed responsibility. Because of the nature and location of the tasks in a hot spot for terrorism the user said he thought those tasks could involve spying and didn’t take them on.

Premise said photographing religious sites such as mosques temples synagogues and churches is a standard task assigned to contributors around the world to help clients understand the physical and social geography of a place. Contributors are only asked for exterior photographs and aren’t asked to enter any sites.

None of the more than three million people who have worked with Premise over the past five years has come to harm as they have completed more than 100 million tasks or surveys the company said.

Premise began as a way to register prices in the developing world and help its customers better understand the needs of the population. But the company struggled to turn a profit in those markets and the demand for its services was inconsistent former employees say.

In 2018 the board brought in Mr. Blackman as CEO hoping he could stabilize the company’s finances and bring in new business according to current and former employees. Mr. Blackman had experience in the government contracting world having earlier founded Accela a company that developed software for government. He pushed to pursue more intelligence and military contracts the employees said which led to a culture clash within the company’s workforce many of them veterans of the development world who objected to some uses of the military and intelligence contracts that were being considered for the platform. A spokesman for the company dismissed that account as coming from disgruntled former employees and said the company hasn’t departed from its original mission. David Soloff Premise’s co-founder who preceded Mr. Blackman as CEO didn’t respond to a request for comment.

In recent years Premise’s data has been purchased by numerous defense contractors or government agencies working on defense programs federal records show. The Air Force paid the company $1.4 million in 2019 to do “persistent ground ISR”—a military abbreviation that stands for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance. The Air Force Research Laboratory said the contract was focused on data science and machine learning work for military units but declined to provide additional details.

At least five other defense contractors working on intelligence or defense contracts have purchased the data federal spending records show. Premise stepped up its presence in Washington in recent years posting jobs requiring security clearances on LinkedIn and bringing on employees whose LinkedIn profiles say they are veterans of the intelligence community.

To figure out whether LINC00284 was abnormally expressed in TC we first extracted the RNA sequencing data of 510 TC tissues and 58 normal tissues from TCGA to take heat map analysis and observed that LINC00284 expression was increased in a large proportion of cancer patients (Fig. 1A). The results of the further t-test indicated that LINC00284 expression levels were remarkably upregulated both in unpaired and paired cancer samples (Fig. 1B and C). We also found the same trend via analyzing the other published profiling data (GSE66783) of GEO (Fig. 1D). Then we confirmed the RNA-seq results by examining the expression of LINC00284 in 75 paired PTC specimens and adjacent normal specimens and discovered that PTC tissues displayed higher LINC00284 expression (Fig. 1E). Meanwhile the expression levels of LINC00284 were higher in PTC cells (IHH-4 K-1 and TPC-1) than that in normal thyroid follicular epithelial cells (Nthy-ori3-1) (Fig. 1F).

Fig. 1: LINC00284 is highly expressed in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). A Heat map analysis of LINC00284 expression in TC tissues and normal tissues from TCGA. B T-test was conducted to assess the differential expression of LINC00284 in TC samples and normal samples using TCGA data. C Relative LINC00284 expression in paired TC samples and normal samples in TCGA. D The data of GEO was extracted to evaluate LINC00284 expression in paired TC specimens and normal specimens. E qRT-PCR analyses of LINC00284 expression in PTC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from our own hospital. F qRT-PCR was conducted to analyze LINC00284 expression in the normal thyroid follicular epithelial cell (Nthy-ori3-1) and PTC cells. Values indicated mean ± standard errors. *P < 0.05 **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. Full size image

Subsequently to explore the relationship between LINC00284 expression and the clinical features of PTC patients we classified the patients as high or low expression group based on the median value of LINC00284 expression. As shown in Table 1 higher LINC00284 expression in PTC tissues was markedly related to larger tumor size (P = 0.014) but there was no obvious association between LINC00284 expression and gender age extrathyroidal extension lymph node metastasis multifocality and TNM stage.

LINC00284 promotes PTC cell proliferation

The TPC-1 and K-1 cells presenting relatively higher expression of LINC00284 were selected to knockdown LINC00284 with siRNA. After 48 h the results of qRT-PCR showed the satisfactory transfection efficiency that LINC00284 expression was obviously downregulated in the si-LINC00284 group than that in NC group for TPC-1 or K-1 cells (Fig. 2A). Considering the association between LINC00284 expression and tumor size we investigated the influences of LINC00284 on PTC cell proliferation. The cell growth curves from CCK-8 assays revealed that silencing LINC00284 could cause a decrease in the proliferation of TPC-1 and K-1 cells compared with the NC group (Fig. 2B and C). The colony-formation assay also identified that downregulating LINC00284 suppressed the proliferation of these cells (Fig. 2D). Similarly we found that knockdown of LINC00284 had a remarkable inhibition on PTC cell growth through the EdU assay (Fig. 2E).

B CCK8 experiments were adopted to assess the viability of si-LINC00284 treated PTC cells. C Colony formation assays were used to examine the growth of PTC cells after transfection. D The proliferation ability of PTC cells transfected with si-LINC00284 was analyzed by EdU staining assays (scale bar: 100 μm).

Silencing LINC00284 induces apoptosis G1 arrest of PTC cells and attenuates tumorigenesis in vivo

As we all known cell cycle and apoptosis were two common elements influencing tumor cell growth ability thus we performed the flow-cytometric assay to assess the impacts of LINC00284 on these two properties. The results suggested that inhibiting LINC00284 in TPC-1 and K-1 cells brought about increased cell proportion in G0/G1 phase while reduced cells in the S phase (Fig. 3A). In comparison with the NC group the apoptosis of the si-LINC00284 group was found to be significantly accelerated (Fig. 3B). In addition in line with the cell cycle progression data cells transfected by si-LINC00284 expressed obviously lower levels of G1–S-phase checkpoint proteins including CDK4 and Cyclin D3. After silencing LINC00284 the expression level of pro-apoptosis protein like Bak was significantly upregulated while anti-apoptosis proteins like Bcl-2 were strongly decreased (Fig. 3C). To further illustrate whether LINC00284 affected tumor growth in vivo we inoculated subcutaneously TPC-1 cells treated by sh-LINC00284 or control vector into female nude mice. It’s clear that tumor volume and weight decreased after inhibiting LINC00284 expression in TPC-1 cells (Fig. 3D–F). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed sh-LINC00284 group displayed reduced expression of Ki-67 and upregulation of Cleaved Caspase-3 expression compared with the negative control (Supplementary Fig. 1).

LINC00284 serves as a ceRNA sponging miR-3127-5p in PTC

Recently increasing evidence has illuminated that plenty of lncRNAs could act as ceRNAs to sponge miRNAs modulating the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level. Firstly using the online tool “lncLocator” we predicted that most LINC00284 existed in the cytoplasm of cells (Fig. 4A). Then the FISH and subcellular fractionation assay were conducted and confirmed the above outcome that most of LINC00284 located in the cytoplasm of PTC cells suggesting that it might exert its functions as ceRNA (Fig. 4B and C). The programmes such as lncRNASNP2 and RegRNA 2.0 were carried out for predicting potential miRNAs binding to LINC00284 in result four miRNAs were selected (miR-499a-3p miR-1914-5p miR-3127-5p and miR-3692-5p) (Fig. 4D). We then investigated the impacts of LINC00284 knockdown on the expression of these four miRNAs via qRT-PCR assay and observed that miR-3127-5p expression level was dramatically upregulated after inhibiting LINC00284 in TPC-1 or K-1 cells. And given that miR-3127-5p has been demonstrated to serve as a tumor suppressor in various carcinomas thus we finally chose it for further investigation. Likewise we used the TCGA database to evaluate miR-3127-5p expression and found that TC tissues possessed lower expression of miR-3127-5p when compared with normal tissues (Fig. 4F) which was also subsequently verified in our own collected PTC specimens and adjacent non-cancer specimens (Fig. 4G). Furthermore the expression of miR-3127-5p in PTC cells was lower than that in normal thyroid follicular epithelial cells (Fig. 4H). Figure 4I exhibited the putative binding sequence between LINC00284 and miR-3127-5p from lncRNASNP2. After that the luciferase reporters including the mutated LINC00284 sequence which changed the binding sites of miR-3127-5p were designed and transduced into HEK-293T cells together with miR-3127-5p mimics or control. As anticipated we found that the mutation of LINC00284 abolished the inhibition of luciferase activity mediated by miR-3127-5p. Besides there was a remarkable inverse association (R = −0.507 P < 0.001) between LINC00284 and miR-3127-5p levels when making qRT-PCR analyses of 75 PTC tissues (Fig. 4J).

Fig. 4: LINC00284 serves as a ceRNA sponging miR-3127-5p. A The online tool lncLocator was utilized to forecast the subcellular localization of LINC00284. B RNA FISH assay was performed to analyze the location of LINC00284 in the nuclear (blue) and cytoplasm (red) fractions in TPC-1 and K-1 cells (scale bar: 50 μm). C The subcellular fractionation assay verified the location of LINC00284 in TPC-1 and K-1 cells. D Bioinformatics analyses screened the miRNAs binding with LINC00284 by RegRNA 2.0 and lncRNASNP2. E The expression levels of four speculated miRNAs via qRT-PCR after inhibiting LINC00284. F Relative expression of miR-3127-5p in TC samples in comparison to normal samples was assessed by applying TCGA dataset. G H MiR-3127-5p expression was detected by qRT-PCR in PTC tissues and cells. I Dual-luciferase reporter assay for verification of the binding between LINC00284 and miR-3127-5p. J Correlational analyses of the expression of LINC00284 and miR-3127-5p in 75 PTC samples.

Knockdown of LINC00284 inhibits tumor proliferation via miR-3127-5p

Although it has been proven that miR-3127-5p inhibited tumor cell development and progression in various malignancies its role in PTC remained unknown. So we transfected miR-3127-5p inhibitor into TPC-1 and K-1 cells to identify whether it plays a tumor-suppressive role in PTC and Fig. 5A showed the effective silencing efficiency. Then we conducted the CCK-8 colony formation and EdU assays observing the significant enhancement of cell growth and colony formation ability (Fig. 5B–E). Meanwhile to reveal whether the influences of LINC00284 on PTC cells were mediated by miR-3127-5p si-LINC00284 and miR-3127-5p inhibitor were cotransfected into TPC-1 and K-1 cells. As a result we found that the attenuation of cell proliferation arisen from LINC00284 knockdown could be partially rescued by miR-3127-5p inhibitor via CCK-8 and colony formation assays (Fig. 5F–H).

Fig. 5: Knockdown of LINC00284 inhibits tumor proliferation via suppressing miR-3127-5p. A After being treated with miR-3127-5p inhibitor or control miRNA the transfection efficiency was detected with qRT-PCR in TPC-1 or K-1 cells. B-E CCK8 colony formation and EdU experiments were adopted to measure the proliferation viability of TPC-1 and K-1 transfected miR-3127-5p inhibitor (scale bar: 100 μm for EdU assay). F–G The growth ability of TPC-1 and K-1 cells after cotransfection with si-LINC00284 miR-199a-5p inhibitor or control miRNA were determined by CCK8 and colony formation assays.

E2F7 is the target of miR-3127-5p and indirectly modulated by LINC00284

The online bioinformatics tools such as Targetscan DIANA and miRDB were utilized to search the downstream targets of miR-3127-5p and the final intersection of these three datasets was 130 genes (Fig. 6A). Combining the TCGA database we sorted out seven mRNAs with markedly higher expression in TC specimens than in normal specimens as candidate target mRNAs (fold change ≥ 2 P ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 6B). Next we transfected miR-3127-5p inhibitor into TPC-1 cells and applied western blot experiments to detect the protein levels of the seven predicted target mRNAs. The results indicated that E2F7 protein level was upregulated and the change was most obvious suggesting it is likely to be the target mRNA of miR-3127-5p (Fig. 6C). Similarly we then conducted dual-luciferase reporter assay mentioned above and found that the mutation of E2F7 abolished the inhibition of luciferase activity mediated by miR-3127-5p (Fig. 6D). Combined with the previous Fig. 6C further qRT-PCR and western blot analyses showed that miR-3127-5p inhibition could lead to a dramatical increase of E2F7 expression both at protein and mRNA level for TPC-1 and K-1 cells (Fig. 6E and F).

Fig. 6: E2F7 is a target of miR-3127-5p and is repressed by downregulating LINC00284. A Three bioinformatics tools (Targetscan DIANA and miRBD) were used to predict target genes binding with miR-3127-5p. B Seven mRNAs from the total predicted genes were selected according to the following criterion (its expression level in TC tissues was higher than that in normal tissues fold change ≥ 2) by analyzing TCGA data. C Western blot assays were performed to determine the protein levels of seven candidate target mRNAs after TPC-1 cells being treated by miR-3127-5p inhibitor. D Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the binding between miR-3127-5p and E2F7. E The protein level of E2F7 in K-1 cells following miR-3127-5p inhibitor. F E2F7 mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR in TPC-1 and K-1 cells treated by miR-3127-5p inhibitor. G H E2F7 mRNA and protein levels in TPC-1 and K-1 cells treated by si-LINC00284. I J Evaluation of E2F7 mRNA and protein levels through rescue assays that cotransfected with si-LINC00284 and miR-3127-5p inhibitor in TPC-1 cells. K L Relative expression of E2F7 in TC samples and normal samples using TCGA and GEO data. M qRT-PCR analysis of E2F7 expression from PTC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues of our own hospital. N The online GEPIA tool was applied to draw the disease-free survival curve. O P Correlation analyses of the expression of E2F7 and miR-3127-5p the expression of E2F7 and LINC00284 in 75 PTC tissues. Values indicated mean ± standard deviation. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. Full size image

In order to validate the ceRNA network between LINC00284 miR-3127-5p and E2F7 we silenced LINC00284 expression in TPC-1 or K-1 cells and discovered both mRNA and protein expression levels of E2F7 were markedly reduced (Fig. 6G and H). The above outcomes reminded us of LINC00284 modulating E2F7 expression through competitively binding to miR-3127-5p. Furthermore miR-3127-5p inhibition could effectively reverse the decrease of E2F7 mRNA or protein expression driven by si-LINC00284 in TPC-1 cells (Fig. 6I and J). The TCGA and GSE66783 datasets displayed TC tissues possessed significantly higher expression of E2F7 than normal tissues (Fig. 6K and L) in keeping with the detected values in PTC samples and adjacent normal samples from our own hospital (Fig. 6M). The GEPIA bioinformatics tool predicted that TC patients with E2F7 high expression had shorter disease-free survival (Fig. 6N). Finally a negative relation between miR-3127-5p and E2F7 mRNA expression was uncovered in 75 PTC samples (R = −0.325 P = 0.005) while a positive association between LINC00284 and E2F7 mRNA expression was found (R = −0.620 P < 0.001) (Fig. 6O and P).

E2F7 promotes PTC cell growth

Guo et al. reported that miR-30a targeted E2F7 inhibiting PTC cell progression. However their study only proved that E2F7 was the target gene of miR-30a which didn’t preliminarily explore its biological functions in PTC cells. So we transfected E2F7 siRNA into TPC-1 or K-1 cells to knockdown its expression and verified it using qRT-PCR and western blot assays (Fig. 7A and B). We carried out the CCK-8 colony formation and EdU incorporation experiments and found that downregulating E2F7 dramatically suppresses PTC cell proliferation (Fig. 7C–F). Moreover the CCK-8 and colony formation assays revealed that inhibition of PTC cell growth induced by the silence of E2F7 was partially reversed by cotransfection with a miR-3127-5p inhibitor (Fig. 7G–I).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wdGNwdW5qYWJpLmNvLmluL2RoYXJtZW5kcmEtZ2V0cy1lbW90aW9uYWwtYXMtYWpheS1kZXZnbi1yZW1lbWJlcnMtaGlzLWZhdGhlci1sYXRlLXZlZXJ1LWRldmdhbi1vbi1oaXMtYmlydGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnnSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHRjcHVuamFiaS5jby5pbi9hbXAvZGhhcm1lbmRyYS1nZXRzLWVtb3Rpb25hbC1hcy1hamF5LWRldmduLXJlbWVtYmVycy1oaXMtZmF0aGVyLWxhdGUtdmVlcnUtZGV2Z2FuLW9uLWhpcy1iaXJ0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dharmendra gets emotional as Ajay Devgn remembers his father Late Veeru Devgan on his birth anniversary!,"Dharmendra gets emotional as Ajay Devgn remembers his father Late Veeru Devgan on his birth anniversary!

The theft happened back in May according to the San Antonio Junior Brahmas Sports Organization.

Lori Black president of the SAJBSO said the organization offers many activities for the youth in our community.

“We do tackle and flag football” she said. “We also do track and there are cheerleaders as well.”

Black’s passion for the program starts deeply with the children.

“Every time they learn something even if it is how to properly tackle they get so excited” Black said. “They turn around and start jumping up and down. They are so excited about everything. They want this program so bad. They love being outdoors. Covid had them all locked down for so long but even before that they just wanted to be here because they love it.”

She and several other coaches have built such a strong relationship with their child athletes.

“They bond with their coaches and other families” Black said. “They make life-long bonds with friends. Maybe some of them don’t have many friends at school but then they come here and they are brothers and sisters for life.”

Black said this theft was extremely devastating because most of the families they serve are low-income.

“It is expensive getting all of the gear we had for them” Black said. “We had conditioning practice and game-day gear in that trailer. Helmets cleats pads a shadow man tackling dummies. We had the little parachutes for the little ones to run with.”

In total Black said it was about $10000 worth of football equipment which is enough to supply around 100 athletes.

Their trailer was one of three that was stolen from the Storage 4U Self Storage facility on Nacogdoches Road not far from where they practice and play at Lady Bird Johnson Park.

“They showed me the video to see if I could identify our trailer” Black said. “It was happening from like three in the morning. Apparently the suspects went in took one trailer left and came back took another trailer left and came back and then took ours and left. It was around seven in the morning.”

She said it breaks her heart that someone would steal from children like this.

“It just hurts” Black said through tears. “I am very hurt. They obviously were able to cut all the locks open and see what was in there and they took it anyway. How do you…you see little cleats. We had cleats in there. These was children’s things.”

Black said fortunately other organizations have reached out to offer their support and their coaches have been able to collect things that will at least supply them for conditioning training during their July practices.

She said this loss will not stop them from participating in this football season.

“We are going to do this. The community is going to do this.” Black said. “The sports world is going to do this. They are not going to stop us. They are not going to stop us from playing.”

This is the second time in three years the organization had its trailer stolen from a secure location. Black said she hopes the suspect or suspects responsible realize they are not only hurting their program but also the children.

“Find God” Black said. “Ask for forgiveness. I forgive them but they need some help. They need to figure it out. You don’t steal from children. You don’t.”

She also said she hopes this is a reminder to the community to continue helping youth programs in the city.

“Continue to support all youth organizations” Black said. “They all struggle like we do. They all sponsor kids and rely on donations and sponsorship. Keep the kids all over going. All over going.

The organization is raising money and asking for donations. Those who would like to help can contact Black at (210) 639-7655.

It happened at the U.S Storage near 59th Avenue and Bethany Home Road sometime over the past two weeks.

Anthony Treacy moved to the Valley from Illinois and like so many his mom was not far behind.

""I figured... I can move some of her stuff with me. It will save her the cost. Just get a storage unit for a couple of months it will be cheaper"" said Treacy.

Treacy unloaded his mom's boxes and got settled himself.

Until his Mom got a call this week.

""They said her lock might’ve been tampered with"" he said. ""I got out here as soon as I could and realized very quickly the latch was completely busted off.""

""My stomach dropped. It was awful to see"" Treacy continued. ""They took a substantial amount of boxes.""

The burglars made off with ""some family heirlooms a stamp book that dates back three generations some jewelry that was super important to my Mom.""

Then Treacy realized what else they took.

""The remainder of my sister's belongings along with her urn which had her remains"" said Treacy. ""That was another stomach drop.""

Shannon Treacy a mother of three was just 30 years old when she died in 2017.

""She was great. She was amazing"" he said.""She actually ended up overdosing.""

Treacy and his family are now without Shannon's possessions and her remains.

""We just want to get the word out and get it back as soon as possible"" said Treacy. ""It would mean everything to our family.""

If you see the urn the stamp book or any photo albums with pictures of Shannon call Glendale police or email Anthony at anthonyglendale1@gmail.com.",,,,,,,,,

Whether or not it will be available in adequate shipments is something we will have to see in the coming months but one company executive has hinted at the launch of a flagship smartphone touting the new silicon.

Lenovo’s General Manager Says Company Will Release a Flagship Bearing the New SoC Before 2022 Starts

Details spotted by GizChina include the mention of Chen Jin General Manager of Lenovo’s mobile department who states on Weibo that the company will release a flagship phone before 2022. However just because a product launch takes place earlier than anticipated does not mean that availability of that flagship smartphone will be large in numbers. Given the ongoing chip shortage there might be several hurdles that Qualcomm may have to scale before providing larger shipments to its long list of clients.

The ongoing chip shortage is also why the Snapdragon 895 is rumored to be made on Samsung’s 4nm architecture and not TSMC’s. Likely the Taiwanese manufacturer is already running at full capacity so Qualcomm would have no choice but to opt for Samsung though it is also possible that the Korean giant might have given the San Diego chipset maker an enticing offer it was reported on the previous occasion.

Coming to the Snapdragon 895 details a previous leak revealed that the SoC sports the part number SM8450 along with touting custom Kryo 780 cores plus an integrated Snapdragon X65 5G modem which will also be made on Samsung’s 4nm node. One tipster mentioned that Qualcomm’s next-generation silicon is already being tested by its partners so Lenovo may be amongst them.

Qualcomm could announce the Snapdragon 895 in December of this year and perhaps after a couple of days Lenovo and its executives take center stage to announce the new flagship. There are still a few months remaining for the official announcement so remember to treat this information with a pinch of salt for now. With the chip shortage saga far from over many companies including Lenovo could delay their plans.

Design

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

The Pixel 5 and Pixel 4 are very similar at first glance but there are important design differences between them when you look closer. The first one is that the Pixel 5 has a punch-hole display with minimal bezels surrounding it. The Pixel 4 and 4 XL on the other hand don’t have a cutout of any sort. Both phones sport slightly thicker bezels with the top bezel containing an array of missing sensors from the Pixel 5. This gives them a lower screen-to-body ratio compared to the Pixel 5.

Then there’s the material. The Pixel 5 has an aluminum back with a material bio-resin coating while the Pixel 4 phones have a glass back. Which is better depends on personal preference but what’s important to note is that both look and feel premium. Aluminum has the advantage of being more durable and less of a fingerprint magnet though. Read next: Google Pixel 5 vs Pixel 4a 5G vs Pixel 4a — Which should you buy?

Next up are the color options. The new Pixel 5 comes in Just Black and Sorta Sage which can be best described as greenish. It’s a unique colorway although it won’t be to everyone’s liking. The Pixel 4 phones also come in Just Black as well as Clearly White and — if you can find one — an Oh So Orange limited edition. All of these color options come with a contrasting power button. Unfortunately you don’t get that with the Pixel 5.

These are the main design differences you need to be aware of although there are a few others. You’ll find a fingerprint scanner at the back of the Pixel 5. In contrast the Pixel 4 series eschews a fingerprint reader and instead relies on those aforementioned sensors in the top bezel for 3D Face Unlock.

Features

This is where things get interesting. The Pixel 5 isn’t a true flagship phone in the traditional sense. Instead it falls more into the growing premium mid-range category including phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and LG Velvet. The Pixel 4 phones on the other hand were flagship devices at launch sporting one of the best chipsets available at the time and a (mostly) bleeding-edge specs sheet.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that the Pixel 4 series offers more than its successor however. While the Pixel 5 has less power under the hood it makes up for it in other areas.

The Pixel 5 is a downgrade in some areas and an upgrade in others.

Let’s start with the displays. The Pixel 5 sports a 6-inch screen making it quite compact. Google’s Pixel 4 features a smaller 5.7-inch panel while the XL model comes with a larger 6.3-inch display. The standard Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 have Full HD+ resolution displays and a 90Hz refresh rate but the Pixel 5 does use Gorilla Glass 6 as opposed to Gorilla Glass 5 found on its predecessors. You can argue the Pixel 4 XL has a slight advantage thanks to its Quad HD+ panel.

A bigger difference between the phones is when it comes to performance. Google’s latest Pixel phone packs the Snapdragon 765G under the hood which offers similar performance to the two-year-old Snapdragon 845. The Pixel 4 phones come out on top in this category with both sporting the Snapdragon 855 SoC. Read more: Snapdragon 765G vs Snapdragon 865: How will the Pixel 5 stack up?

Although there is a difference between the SD765G and the SD855 the former is still very snappy and can handle day-to-day tasks without an issue. If all you do is browse the web watch videos and chat with friends the chipset in the Pixel 5 will be more than adequate. But if you love playing demanding 3D games and want as much speed as possible the Pixel 4 series is still a better option.

David Imel / Android Authority

The Pixel 5 pulls slightly ahead of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL when it comes to memory. The new device has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. You only get 6GB of RAM on the last year’s Pixels while the base variants of the phones come with 64GB of storage — although 128GB options are available for a higher price.

The Pixel 5 has its predecessors beat when it comes to the battery as well as it’s powered by a 4080mAh cell. The batteries in the Pixel 4 and 4 XL only come in at 2800mAh and 3700mAh. Plus the newer less power-hungry chip will get more out of that larger cell too. Battery life was one of the biggest issues with the Pixel 4 — especially the vanilla model — so we’re happy Google didn’t make the same mistake with its latest phone.

The Pixel phones have always been all about the camera experience and the Pixel 5 is no different. It sports the same main 12.2MP sensor you get with the Pixel 4 and comes with Google’s software enhancements including Night Sight and ASTRO Mode. However the phone ditches the 16MP telephoto lens found on its predecessors for a 16MP ultra-wide camera. Instead Google is relying on its Super Res Zoom software for zoom shots on the Pixel 5.

On the front the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4 phones all feature an 8MP selfie shooter. The Pixel 4 also has a Soli radar that allows for 3D Face Unlock and Motion Sense. The latter lets you do things like skip tracks snooze alarms and silence calls with swiping gestures above the device all without touching it. The Pixel 5 relies on a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner for unlocking it instead and misses out on Motion Sense.

Other differences between the phones are that the Pixel 5 offers 5G support while the Pixel 4 only supports 4G LTE. All three phones support wireless charging but you only get reverse wireless charging on the Pixel 5.

Price and availability

Google Pixel 5 — $699/£599/€629 MSRP

— $699/£599/€629 MSRP Google Pixel 4 XL (64GB) — $899/£829/€899 MSRP

— $899/£829/€899 MSRP Google Pixel 4 (64GB) — $799/£669/€749 MSRP The Pixel 5 launched with a price tag of $699. The Pixel 4 series was more expensive when it made its debut. The regular model started at $799 while the XL model sold for $899. If you wanted to get your hands on the 128GB version you had to dish out an additional $100.

But since the Pixel 4 phones have been on the market for about a year their price has come down quite a bit. You can currently get a significant discount on the regular Pixel 4 and XL model on Amazon which means both are cheaper than the Pixel 5 at the moment.

An important thing to keep in mind is that Google discontinued the Pixel 4 series back in August 2020. It no longer sells it but various retailers including Amazon still have it in stock — for now at least. So if you want to get your hands on one you’ll have to move fast.

Google Pixel 5 vs Pixel 4: Should you upgrade?

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

The winner of the Pixel 5 vs Pixel 4 comparison depends on what your wants and needs are. If you already own a Pixel 4 or 4 XL I’d say an upgrade isn’t necessary. Sure you’re going to get a few extra features your current phone lacks if you opt for the Pixel 5. You’ll also be sacrificing some raw power and additional features like Face Unlock and Motion Sense.

For example upgrading means you’ll get a phone with 5G support more RAM a bigger battery a more modern design and extra features like reverse wireless charging. But you’ll have to give up a more powerful chipset and the Soli radar with its 3D face unlock among other things. If the specs and features you’ll gain mean more to you than the ones you’ll lose an upgrade might make sense for you. But if not sticking with the Pixel 4 or 4 XL is a better choice for now.

Google Pixel 5 vs Pixel 4: Which should you buy? 1743 votes Pixel 5 57 % Pixel 4/4 XL 43 %

For those considering whether to buy a Pixel 4 or the Pixel 5 phone things are a bit more complicated especially since Google’s 2019 flagships are currently cheaper than the Pixel 5. If you’re a gamer or just someone who wants as much power and speed from your phone as possible a Pixel 4 phone is likely the way to go. The same applies if Face Unlock is super important to you.

But if the faster chipset and advanced biometrics don’t mean that much to you the Pixel 5 should be the better choice. The Snapdragon 765G is still a capable chipset and offers 5G support you don’t get on the Pixel 4. The handset also looks nicer has a bigger battery and comes with a few extra features already mentioned. And since it’s newer you can expect it to get upgraded to Android 12 13 and 14 while software support for the Pixel 4 will end with Android 13.

If you’re after an even cheaper Google phone in 2020 there’s also the Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G to consider. These make further trade-offs on specs and features beyond the Pixel 5 but will save you a few bucks.

Samsung and Xiaomi ""Ultra"" smartphones are arguably the best that the Android market has to offer currently but which is best? Here's a comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra.

Top Shelf Specs

TechRadar recently reviewed both phones that offer the best of the best that is currently on offer.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra came out at the start of the year on January 29 while the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra was launched on April 2 of the same year. The processors of each smartphone vary as Samsung has decided to go with two types namely Qualcomm and Exynos; while Xiaomi stuck with Snapdragon all throughout.

The Snapdragon is slightly faster than the Exynos while Qualcomm holds supreme.

So in terms of processing power Samsung still stays ahead by a narrow margin. Snapdragon processors tend to overheat at longer amounts of time compared to the other two whilst Samsung processors can perform better with heavier tasks.

Advantages of Galaxy S21 Ultra Mi 11 Ultra

Let's start with the contender Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra; it boasts 12 GB of RAM and as for the camera it has 48MP and has 5x periscope lens. The device brings in much more light than its Samsung rival.

Battery life can run for the entire day with over 10% to 20% left before you need to charge.

Xiaomi came with its own 67W charger as compared to Samsung not having the same chance for their users and expect that you buy your own. The 67W charger can charge the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra from 0 to 100 in less than an hour as compared to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra supporting only up to 25W with an hour of charging time.

Now let's talk about the display of each ""Ultra"" phone.

Xiaomi impressively competed with Samsung on this end with having a 6.81-inch 120 Hz AMOLED display having a resolution of 1440 x 3200. Meanwhile the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has a 6.8-inch AMOLED display that also can reach 120 Hz and Quad HD resolution if needed.

Samsung however wins this round with the ability to give a little bit more kick in colors and give a deeper black. Samsung also created the displays used by Xiaomi.

What Should You Get

Both phones are undoubtedly amazing and they have their own perks and features.

However it may also depend on what region you are in since variants vary and you may not even get what you want. Specifically Xiaomi isn't offered in the US region but you can still get the phone via other means.

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra are both beautifully designed and it will come down to what you can get since both phones are pricey. It comes down to the preference of the user with more and more people taking notice of Xiaomi given its competitive price and top-shelf specs to even challenge the giant that is Samsung.

The true wireless earphones market is pretty crowded these days especially around the budget or – value-for-money areas. You can get some truly remarkable earphones for around £50 these days and the competition is fierce.

That’s where the Edifier TWS1 Pro come in: small true wireless earphones with excellent battery times decent sound (though it depends on the type of music you like) the latest Bluetooth standards and sound codecs and all for an affordable price.

A few connectivity and usage issues however spoil the fun a bit – but the value for money here is still impressive. Let’s dig in to see whether this is the right pair for you…

Who Are The Edifier TWS1 Pro For?

Having been around since 1996 Edifier is a Chinese company that specialises in audio products – from speakers to soundbars and earphones.

The TWS1 Pro is an updated model of Edifier’s TWS1. It comes with all the latest codecs and standards such as Bluetooth 5.2 Qualcomm’s QCC3040 chipset with the cVcTM 8.0 voice cancellation technology (for voice calls – not for music) AptX Adaptive and more.

Of course all the bells and whistles are secondary to the most important thing with earphones – the sound quality.

It’s important to remember that these are £50 earphones so there’s no point in comparing them to models that cost £200. But there are quite a lot of earphones at this price range these days – so comparisons are still in order.

If you’re a big bass fan these aren’t the pair for you especially if you tend to listen to louder songs (such as rock and pop). If you stay around the more quiet musical zones however these fare pretty well. Plus they’re excellent for voice – so if you’re a podcast or audiobook lover you’ll get super crisp speech.

Using The Edifier TWS1 Pro

Size and Comfort

The earbuds themselves are not the smallest out there and they stick out of your ears a bit. But they’re very lightweight they look nice and they’re available in two colours – dark grey and ivory.

They go quite deeply into your ear canals – I know some people don’t like that but for me they were extremely comfortable and I was never afraid they might drop out of my ear.

Although they don’t have any active noise cancellation the fact that they’re in this deep means there’s good passive noise cancellation so outside sounds won’t trouble you too much.

In the box you get three different silicone ear tip sizes a USB-C cable for charging and a cut-down version of the instructions manual. The minimal manual doesn’t explain all the options (or even what the LED lights mean) for some reason.

The charging case is small and despite feeling quite plasticky actually looks pretty good – I like its curved edges. There’s a USB-C port on the back of the case for charging but there’s no wireless charging support.

The earbuds are easy to take out of the case (that’s sometimes an issue with other earphones) though I did notice an issue with putting them back in there – at times an earbud (on either side) didn’t slip in all the way into the case and therefore didn’t start charging.

Furthermore it remained connected and active on my phone and it took me a while to understand why there were no sounds coming from my phone (because it was still connected to the Bluetooth earphone). This happened to me several times and now I have to remember to press both earbuds kind of hard into the case – not something one should be bothered with normally.

The TWS1 Pro have touch buttons so the whole outer face is a big touch-control surface. That touch surface isn’t so big that you accidentally touch it each time you pull the earbuds in and out which is good. The buttons worked well for me most of the time though occasionally they did miss a tap.

The earbuds are IPX5 water-resistant so they’re splash-proof. That means you should be OK in the rain (or sweating at the gym) but you can’t drop them in a puddle (or God forbid in the toilet).

Pairing And Controlling

The TWS 1 Pro feature Qualcomm’s QCC3040 chip with Bluetooth 5.2 support. Pairing them with my phone was easy and whenever I took them out of their case re-pairing was almost instant.

Qualcomm’s latest chipset supports “True Wireless Mirroring” so you can instantly switch between dual and single use mode.

That being said there were instances where I took both earbuds out of the case and only one of them played any sounds. I then had to put them BACK in the case let them disconnect from my phone take them back out again – and things were back to normal with both earbuds working as expected.

Other than that the connection was stable – even when I was walking in crowded places (well as crowded as they are these days) there were no Bluetooth disconnections or hissing sounds that you sometimes get with bad Bluetooth connections.

As for controlling the action as with any touch-based earphones you have to memorise a set of taps. Things are quite straightforward – one tap to play and pause double-tap (left or right) to skip forward and back and a tap-and-hold to raise/lower the volume.

You can’t use the buttons to activate your phone’s voice assistant – though that can usually be done by voice these days if you set things up correctly on your phone.

TWS1 Pro’s Audio Quality

This is where things get a bit more complicated. Don’t get me wrong the sound is quite decent especially for earphones at this price range. The sound is crisp and quite accurate – but it also falls a bit flat.

Starting with Enya’s Carribean Blue the delicate intro synth melts well into Enya’s angelic rich vocals. As the song progresses piling up vocal and synth layers there is good definition and overall the sound is clear but not harsh. The lower end however remains a little thin.

Moving on to Beat it by Michael Jackson the song as a whole is bright in nature. With soaring electric guitar riffs and energetic vocal performance the high end of the spectrum stays nice and clear. But the bass and drums are quite thin which really drains a lot of power from the mix.

So if you’re into fast/loud/bigger-than-life songs that are supposed to send shivers down your spine – the TWS1 Pro might disappoint you. If you stay on the quiet/calm side however the sound is quite pleasant though again – is missing some more oomph (manual EQ settings might have helped here – but Edifier don’t have an app for that at the moment).

As for phone calls the TWS1 Pro work very well. They use Qualcomm’s cVc 8.0 tech which helps with voice clarity on calls. As usual with these technologies I didn’t witness any miracles here – when I was in a noisy environment calls were noisy. But overall the voice quality was good.

The same can be said about podcasts and audiobooks – the TWS1 Pro handle speech really well so these are great for long talk-radio sessions.

Watching Movies with The Edifier TWS1 Pro

With so many people watching films and TV on their phones these days I always make a point of testing that with earphones as well.

And thanks to Bluetooth you can connect the earphones to any device that supports the format – so phones and computers but also streaming devices like the Amazon Fire TV stick.

One thing to note when watching films is that Bluetooth is notoriously laggy so lip-synching can become an issue.

But I had no such problems with the TWS1 Pro – the connection was stable and when I watched videos on my phone there were never any lag or lip-synch issues.

As for the sound I tested it with Aquamen and the earbuds repeated their strengths and weaknesses – the speech was clear and crisp sound effects on action scenes were decent (the bass felt better than it does with music on this pair) but the overall mix was a bit lowkey with some oomph missing. That shouldn’t trouble you at all with dramas – but is less impressive when you’re watching a loud action flick.

Battery Times

When fully charged you can use the TWS1 Pro earphones for up to 12 hours which is very impressive (at any price range!). The charging case holds another 30 hours for a respectable total of 42 hours – not the highest out there but quite good for the price – and for the physical size of the case.

There’s only one LED light on the case which makes it difficult to know when it’s time to charge it (or the earbuds themselves) – plus there’s no mention of that light in the manual. It’s my understanding though that if it flashes rapidly – it’s time to charge the case.

Your actual battery mileage may vary of course because it depends on what you do with the earbuds (volume level distance from your phone etc.) – but after a full week of usage (about 2-3 hours a day) I haven’t had to re-charge the case at all.

Bottom Line: Are The Edifier TWS1 Pro For You?

Now we get to the £50 question. A couple of years ago and at this price and performance level I would have called the TWS1 Pro perfect.

Today the competition – at this low price level – is quite fierce and there are earphones out there that outdo the TWS1 Pro – at least in terms of audio quality (the EarFun Free Pro come to mind for example).

That being said these are still very good earphones for such a low price (and if you can get them during a sale – value for money gets even better). They have most of the features one would expect these days – except for Active Noise Cancellation which I’m not a fan of at this price range anyway.

If you’re looking for good all-rounders that won’t shake your body but will still sound pleasant and in particular if you’re a fan of podcasts or audiobooks – these are worth considering.

The part-Palestinian model appears in a campaign video set in a swanky nightclub of the same name as the fragrance alongside IRL best friends US-Palestinian artist Fai Khadra as well as model and musician Lucky Blue Smith and artist and actor Luka Sabbat.

However things quickly turned hazardous on the set when the stars accidentally sprayed perfume into each other’s mouths Hadid revealed to People magazine.

When asked what was the biggest danger posed on set she said: “Spraying each other in the mouth with perfume! Not on purpose but when you have to spray a lot of fragrance in a room you just end up consuming it.

“We all turned out fine but don’t try it at home.”

While it is a short film it was Hadid’s first major night out in New York City in a long time — partly because of the coronavirus pandemic and also because she gave birth to her daughter Khai in September.

Khadra told People Magazine: “It brought us all back together after a year and a half of being in lockdown and not really seeing each other. Some of us live in LA some of us live in New York . . . Ralph’s Club brought us all together.”

The new fragrance was inspired by Ralph Lauren’s “one-night-only” 2019 fashion show which was set in a swanky 1920s-style Ralph’s Club and which was opened by Hadid.

In fact the catwalk star who was born to US-Palestinian real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid and “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Yolanda Hadid landed one of her first modeling gigs for Ralph Lauren.

She recently revealed to Forbes that when she was 16 she “randomly got casted” for a small Ralph photoshoot in Malibu.

“Ralph was one of my first jobs before ever moving to New York or starting modeling professionally or full-time.

The range includes a mix of classic cricket sweaters and heritage detailing alongside quintessential Ralph Lauren pieces such as the bomber jacket polo shirt and baseball cap.

Ball boy and ball girl (BBG) uniforms feature innovative stretch moisture-wicking properties UPF 40 protection from UV rays and are crafted from lightweight jersey made with yarn derived from recycled plastic bottles.

As well as using recycled fibres Ralph Lauren has also ""upcycled"" a colourful motif of scattered tennis rackets and uniforms from Ralph Lauren’s Spring 1992 collection on a 2021 men’s polo shirt and women’s polo dress and shorts.

“England has always been a source of inspiration for our brand from the impeccable tailoring Savile Row is so famous for to the casual laid-back elegance of the English countryside to the heritage of Wimbledon as one of the world’s most iconic sporting events” says David Lauren Chief Innovation and Brand Officer of Ralph Lauren.

To model the new collection an inspirational cast from the world of sport and dance have been selected including Maro Itoje from rugby Son Heung-Min for Tottenham Hotspur Francesca Hayward from The Royal Ballet surfer Lucy Campbell and G2 E-Sports driver Rekkles.

“We are very proud to celebrate 16 years of partnership with Wimbledon. Ralph Lauren and Wimbledon share such similar brand values and codes each with our own rich traditions and incredible heritage and a sort of timeless elegance - it has been a wonderful match.

Due to the global Covid pandemic last year's Wimbledon tournament was cancelled. Socially distanced crowds are permitted to attend this year's event.

“I think it’s because of this that the anticipation for The Championships is even more so this year. Wimbledon embodies certain magic and I think people are excited to get back to that and back together"" David Lauren added.

Ralph Lauren became the first Official Outfitter for Wimbledon in 2006 elevating the practical uniforms for officials and BBGs to a covetable collection that draws inspiration from The Championship's 129-year history fused with the brand's signature preppy style.

The collection is available to buy on the Wimbledon website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbWJsZWRvbi5jb20vZW5fR0IvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA2LTI3LzIwMjEtMDYtMjVfcmFscGhfbGF1cmVuX2F0X3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXBzXzIwMjEuaHRtbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbWJsZWRvbi5jb20vYW1wL2VuX0dCL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMS0wNi0yNy8yMDIxLTA2LTI1X3JhbHBoX2xhdXJlbl9hdF90aGVfY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwc18yMDIxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ralph Lauren at The Championships 2021,,,,,,,

It’s just part of the NHL culture.

So defensemen turn their heads and put their bodies in front of wicked shots on goal. Forwards stand their ground in front of the net while opponents attempt to shove elbow and whack them out of the way.

And owners?

Well if necessary they miss a potential Stanley Cup-clinching game because it’s more important to be a dad. At least that’s the plan for Lightning owner Jeff Vinik whose son Danny is getting married the day after Game 6 is scheduled to be played in Montreal.

Normally the NHL playoffs would be completed by July 10 but the 2021 season was extended an extra month due to pandemic scheduling. And that means the wedding in Rhode Island ended up falling between what could be the two most important games of the year.

“Two years ago when they picked the date we all assumed hockey would be over in the middle of June if we were fortunate to get that far” Vinik said. “I’m thankful there’s no game on July 10 but Game 6 if it goes that far is on that Friday night the 9th in Montreal.

“So I will not be going to that game none of my family will either. We will be at the rehearsal and welcome dinner in Newport. I guess it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if two years in a row I wouldn’t be there when we lifted the Cup.”

Vinik missed the Stanley Cup celebration in 2020 because he chose to stay home with his family rather than remain quarantined in Canada for Tampa Bay’s two-month playoff run. He doesn’t regret missing out on the fun with the players but acknowledged it was a far different experience to watch the Lightning clinch Game 7 of the Islanders series at Amalie Arena on Friday night.

“It was incredible to be in the building. It was incredible to be able to share that with 15000 screaming fans” Vinik said. “That’s what it’s all about in my opinion in terms of owning a hockey team: winning meaningful games in front of our community. It was fantastic.”

Vinik 62 talked about what he liked best about this Lightning team and a handful of other topics in a 20-minute interview with the Tampa Bay Times on the eve of the Stanley Cup final beginning Monday night in Tampa. Some answers were edited for brevity.

Since buying this team in 2010 the Lightning have reached the Stanley Cup final three times and the conference final three other times. What is the secret to this success?

“I always go back to hiring the right people. In anything you do it’s all about the people. It’s not just Julien (BriseBois) and Steve (Yzerman) and (Jon Cooper). It’s Tod Leiweke. It’s Steve Griggs and dozens and dozens of more. Everyone in the organization having the common goal of being world class-plus.”

You were a financial guy in your previous life. How much more fun is it being a hockey owner?

“I still have my previous life even though it’s more of a hobby than anything else now. But it’s extremely fulfilling to have developed with all these great people a really strong hockey franchise and also to be developing all this real estate.”

Speaking of which downtown Tampa has become a different place since you bought the franchise. What goes through your mind when you drive to work and see some of these plans come to fruition?

“Eight years after starting to design Water Street Tampa which wasn’t called anything back then I almost get tingles seeing all of these buildings that are starting to be occupied and all of the public spaces that are going to be amazing. It’s a source of great pride. I can’t wait as we keep getting bigger and better.”

You have always been more comfortable as a behind-the-scenes guy. Are you still shy after 11 years in the spotlight?

“I’m still a shy guy that hasn’t changed. But I think I’ve just had practice. Whether it’s being behind a microphone or talking with fans I’ve gotten more comfortable in the role. But honestly it’s just 11 years of practice for this introvert who is trying to be an extrovert.”

So what do you like best about this group of players?

“It’s how we raise our game and our grittiness at the most difficult times. We play like a championship team … We were (known as) the Greatest Show on Ice etcetera for a time (but) our guys have learned how to win and how to play big in big games. It’s really impressive from where we were and how many years it took us to learn that. Hockey is a tough sport but it’s every bit as much about their hearts and heads as it is about their hockey ability.”

So if it comes down to it will you really miss Game 6 to be at the rehearsal dinner?

“You know what? Family comes first. Hockey is a very close second but family comes first.”

First he was depressed. After a series of tragic events Erik Kramer decided to take his own life. He pulled that trigger… miraculously survived… and things only got wilder. When we first launched this Go Long newsletter months ago Kramer was one of the first players to get right back to us. He badly wanted to share what’s happened since his 10-year career wrapped up and… wow.

What Kramer has been through is almost impossible to fathom.

Miss Part I? Catch up right here.

If you were to look at Erik Kramer post-surgery you’d have no clue anything was wrong.

No clue this was a man who tried to commit suicide.

He could walk and talk. He could even drive a car and swing a golf club.

He could coach football becoming an assistant at a local high school. He gave frequent speeches about depression and suicide and made the media rounds. ESPN. Sports Illustrated. Bleacher Report. You name it. Even watching those gripping clips today it’s difficult to tell anything was wrong. In one Kramer calmly states he doesn’t have “any real mental deficiencies.” In another a girlfriend gives him a kiss in the kitchen.

The only physical or mental scar left from that near-fatal night at the Good Night Inn — it appeared — was a minuscule abrasion underneath his chin.

A miracle indeed.

Unfortunately nobody knew the half of it. The resulting brain trauma from that bullet in truth rendered Kramer a completely different person. When a chunk of his forehead was literally shot off his head his frontal lobe was left severely damaged. So while he could process the simple things the part of the brain that made decisions was ravaged.

Kramer could not comprehend risk.

Kramer suddenly had the mental capacity of a six-year-old.

“I couldn’t put two and two together” Kramer says. “If you put two and two together for me and said it was four I would say ‘Oh. OK.’ And then the next person would say ‘What’s two and two?’ And I’d say ‘I don’t know.’”

When it came to connecting dots his brain only… buffered. A neuropsychologist named Dr. Robert Tomaszewski who specializes in traumatic brain injuries later explained to Kramer he was in the ultimate “vulnerable” state. Anybody could say anything to him and he’d register it as say Today is sunny. He’d agree unconditionally with the last thing someone told him. Because as Dr. Tomaszewski put it people simply do not survive what Kramer did. And those who do? It takes three to four years for the brain to heal. Considering Kramer endured three seizures his recovery would take five years.

Imagine cutting yourself on the arm he told them. It bleeds. It forms a scab. The scab peels off. And that whole process takes what two weeks? Now imagine the scab on the brain. That process takes years.

Which is why we’re sitting here on Zoom chatting about this all. It’s now been five-plus years since Kramer’s suicide attempt.

And what happened in those five years it took his brain to heal should have ruined him.

Now that he’s finally himself he is on a mission to share his story with everyone — he previously chatted with Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports. Kramer does not want anyone to ever experience what he did. For humanity’s sake this is a story that must be told over and over and over again. In his vulnerable state Kramer says he lost $700000. First there was Cortney Baird. The “thief” he calls her. The girlfriend who coerced him into a sham marriage took $300000 in all he says while a twisted legal system took another $400000.

Kramer was living a damn nightmare and had no clue.

No Baird did not appear out of thin air. Three weeks after Griffen passed away in 2011 she was one of many friends to show Kramer sympathy. He remembers her bringing cupcakes over. Spending time. Baird had a seven-year-old herself and Dillon was 13 so together all four would pop a DVD in for a movie night. Kramer does recall watching the Pixar movie “Up.” From there a friendship turned into an unhealthy on-again off-again relationship for three years. Finally Kramer called it off for good in January 2015.

Or so he thought.

Of course Kramer has no recollection of all the details he shares throughout our three-plus hours of conversation. He’s been able to meticulously piece the entire ordeal together with the help of family and friends especially his close high school friend Anna Dergan.

As he recovered at the Centre for Neuro Skills post-gunshot the part of Kramer’s health insurance allowing him to stay overnight was running out so he decided to redirect to another brain clinic in Las Vegas area where his sister Kelley lived. And through a two-week gap between CNS and Vegas Kramer stayed overnight back at his California home with the help of Dergan who drove him to and from visits while taking an accounting class at night.

Two days before Dergan was set to drive Kramer to Vegas she returned from one Wednesday class to see Baird sitting at the kitchen table around 9:30 p.m. As she recalls Baird stayed until 1:30 a.m. She did all of the talking too. Kramer barely muttered a word as Baird went on and on about how her daughter looked up to him as a Dad how she’d take care of him etc. The morning Kramer left for Vegas she was back at 8:15 a.m. to say goodbye and not to be gone for too long.

Right then in retrospect is when Kramer believes she knew he was an easy target.

Right then is when he believes she knew he had zero memory of their final breakup.

“I would guarantee you” Kramer says “that she recognized then that mentally I was not all there.”

He got to Vegas and the workers at this facility became irritated that Baird called all day long. They’d call Kramer’s sister to say Baird won’t leave him alone and it was affecting his brain recovery. And when it was time to go Baird flew out to Vegas to drive Kramer back to California in his car.

“In that four-hour ride home she probably figured out ‘OK it’s on’” Kramer says. “And four days later I can recognize the first charge.”

Baird quit her job soon after they returned to the L.A area moved into his home within two weeks and never left.

That point on Kramer’s accounts were bled dry.

Know this about Kramer when it comes to money: He was regimented. He followed a strict routine in the past. With $4 million saved up in a Raymond James trust fund he’d write himself a check worth about $10000 per month and move it over to his West Fargo Bank checking account to cover his expenses. He was known as frugal. He rarely ever bought anything for himself. Now? He was hemorrhaging money. Sifting through old records Baird’s spending started innocently enough with a $50 charge at a pharmacy on April 20 2016 in Thousand Oaks Calif.

There were some cashbacks at grocery stores. Starbucks runs. The fee for her daughter’s soccer team. Storage. She’d load up on gift cards at Vons grocery store and rip through Amazon Prime. There were enough shoe boxes in one bedroom Kramer says “to outfit a basketball team.” It was as if Baird started slow and gradually picked up steam Dergan notes to see what she could really get away with.

Next up were daily ATM withdrawals.

Once she ran the checking account dry Dergan explains she moved to Griffen’s Memorial Fund account.

Once she ran this $9984 dry she took credit card cash advances.

From there she forged a check.

Baird tracked and tried to mimic what Kramer did in the past with those $10000 monthly checks pulled from the trust fund both Dergan and the ex-QB say by forging a check for $10000. What Baird did not know however was that Raymond James took control of this account after the suicide attempt and covered his expenses themselves. Thus when Baird likely thought there was $10005 in the account when they took a trip to a Bears game on Oct. 1-2 the account was actually siphoned down to $5. She took out $400 the morning they left with their kids per Kramer and then another $300 in Chicago. Upon returning she took another $1200.

Finally the original forged check bounced.

Kramer’s checking account was $6900 in the red.

“Think for a second if you have all your mental faculties” Kramer says. “Just think if you saw someone who you were around all the time that didn’t and then you crafted out a plan using your mental capacities against that person. It was an unfair fight. There was no way to win. So that’s what happened.

“And then part of what Dr. Tomaszewski said is that one of the things that goes along with this type of brain injury is your ability to decipher. So let’s say we’re walking down the sidewalk and you say ‘Hey up at this next corner we’re going to turn left.’ And I say ‘Oh OK.’ Then five seconds later someone else comes and says ‘Hey up at this corner we’re going to turn right.’ I’m going to forget everything you and I just agreed to and say ‘OK we’ll go right.’”

Kramer obviously cannot recall his own mental state but Dergan sure can.

She remembers Kramer doing nothing but sit on a couch to watch TV all day.

The screen had a “mesmerizing” effect.

“He would sit in front of a TV for six hours at a time without getting up to go to the bathroom or getting anything to eat” Dergan says. “If you didn’t put food in front of him he wouldn’t eat. It’s like his brain didn’t know he had to eat. He’d sit in the same spot and not move. It was absolutely insane. A person who’s caring would make sure he was eating and make sure he was taking his medication and would know all the medication he was taking. Not think about herself and that’s what she would do — ‘Oh this is my opportunity to go steal.’

“She said ‘I have the life that I wanted. I don’t have to work and I can spend on daily basis.’”

Whenever a movie is made of this all no doubt Anna Dergan will be cast as the hero.

Rightfully so too.

Out of that Bears trip Dergan became… suspicious. She saw the Amazon boxes piling up in front of Kramer’s house and was confused. Kramer never ordered anything. And when she sat down to help him with some medical bills Kramer told her that he couldn’t write a check because his account was overdrawn. Huh? This made zero sense to Dergan. When she checked Kramer’s bank records she was shocked to see north of $46000 in spending.

On Oct. 19 2016 Dergan alerted the Sheriff’s Department to start an investigation.

On Oct. 21 the detective on the case — David Lingscheit — interviewed Kramer at the brain center. Of course it didn’t matter what anyone said to Kramer himself. Dergan. His sister. His son. His best friends. Everyone close to the ex-QB told him straight-up — Cortney is stealing from you! — and he’d hardly react. Lingscheit even reported that Kramer showed no emotion which to him was proof that he lacked the capacity to make financial decisions.

When Kramer filled his friend Robert in he was extremely nonchalant about that initial chat. As if this was nothing he told Robert the detective would find out who took the money and get it back.

“That is not a normal reaction” Dergan says. “The detective told him something and he moved on to something else. His attention span was only what’s in front of him. In one ear out the other.”

Kramer filled Baird in best he could and you guessed it Kramer then called Lingscheit back to stop the investigation.

“Not knowing his contact info” he adds “who do you think dialed that number?”

Knowing Baird was behind this knowing Kramer was in this mental fog the detective pressed on. And not long after a letter from Wells Fargo Bank arrived for Kramer which Baird intercepted. Right there she could see the investigation was still on. The bank was letting Kramer know it was releasing his records to the detective based on a search warrant.

Lingscheit requested a meeting with Baird and on this late November trip to the detective’s office in Chatsworth Calif. Baird texted Kramer’s ex-wife to say she may need to get bailed out of jail and would pay her back.

She walked in. She admitted to stealing. She was not arrested.

Says Kramer: “She actually admits it. To everything. Stealing $50000. Forging checks. And she turns around and walks right out. She’s on video doing this. Now let’s say I’m a murder suspect and I walk in to the lone detective investigating the murder and I go ‘It was me.’ Am I walking out of that office?”

Still those around Kramer had a plan. They wanted Kramer to grant conservatorship to his sister Kelley so she’d handle his finances. That’d also allow them to kick Baird out once and for all.

That plan then effectively blew to smithereens. Again Baird stayed one step ahead.

On Dec. 22 she and Kramer were married.

There were no friends no family present. Kramer has zero memories of this day at all. (“All I did was say ‘Yes’ he says. “Someone suggested I do something and I said “OK.”) By getting married Baird could avoid prosecution and Kramer admits her plan “worked perfectly.” She figured the best way to end that investigation was to get hitched and she was correct.

Dillon only found out his Dad got married when he saw the ring on his finger at Christmas a few days later. When both he and Robert told him right to his face that Baird admitted to stealing $50000 Kramer reacted as if they had just said $5. He even defended Baird. That piece of paper became one hell of a shield. The criminal investigation indeed was finished. And no way does it end right there if Dr. Tomaszewski’s evaluation was taken seriously. He wrote himself that Kramer did not have medical or financial capacity.

Meaning he cannot make a financial decision for himself.

Meaning he cannot sign a legal document.

You know like a marriage certificate.

“So I wasn’t permitted to get married when I got married” Kramer says. “And all the lawyers knew that. And one specific one if he didn’t should have. The other big lawyer who also should’ve known was the deputy district attorney at that time Belle Chen. She told the detective who then told Anna that the marriage muddied the waters. That’s why she didn’t prosecute. If I’m not allowed to get married legally how does that muddy the waters? Everybody f----- this up.

“Think about this: Is it legal to marry a six-year-old? No. But you can marry somebody with a six-year-old brain.”

As he puts Baird was “diabolical” every step of the way.

Adds Dergan: “What better way to maintain the lifestyle you created for yourself right?”

On Jan. 10 2017 a conservatorship hearing was held to get Kramer’s finances under control. Here the detective testified and Baird promised not to be a threat to Kramer. She admitted to unauthorized spending and claimed she quit her job to care for Kramer.

Kramer heard everyone testify from Baird to Lingscheit and again hardly reacted.

He still was not himself.

“He was just… there” Dergan says. “It was like a body going through the motions. It was like he couldn’t hear what was going on. Even though he was there even though he’s answering nothing is penetrating to the brain because we all knew Erik would never be that way. Yet here he is with no reaction after all he heard from the detective from Cortney saying she stole money. We know the integrity and principles he lives by he’d never…”

Until one day Kramer was not someone with a six-year-old brain.

Until he began to wake up.

About a year and a half into this nightmare his brain started to recover. He describes the feeling as waking up from another coma. One lightbulb started to flicker on in May 2018 when Kramer put a bid in on a house for his new family to move into. The bid was accepted but the purchase was nixed. For the first time Kramer mentally hit the brakes and asked “Why?” This didn’t add up. The reason: He was professionally conserved. A conservator who wouldn’t step in as Baird spent and spent — by this point she was taking trips around the country — actually did block this purchase.

The reason Kramer was conserved was Baird’s theft.

Granted Kramer was still working through the cobwebs but he knew enough right then to want a divorce.

Adds Dergan: “It was ‘I can’t do something because of Cortney and it has something to do with theft.’”

About one week later Kramer took a scheduled trip to Chicago for an alumni golf outing where he first made a point to catch up with an old friend who was a team priest for his Bears in the 90s. Kramer isn’t that religious himself but the two became very close over the years. And right there over dinner Kramer told a Catholic priest he was going to get a divorce when he returned home.

He can’t help but chuckle today.

“What I actually did” Kramer says “was go home and go to jail.”

Bad turned to worse. Any glimmer of daylight in Kramer’s life cracking open quickly slammed shut.

When Kramer returned home to California around 11:30 p.m. he says he told Baird he wanted a divorce. She said she didn’t want one. He repeated he did once more and went to bed. The next morning June 13 2018 Kramer woke up at 6 a.m. and couldn’t believe Baird was awake. (She rarely was ever up this early.) He poured a cup of coffee grabbed the newspaper walked outside and says Baird followed him out.

She wanted to talk about this whole divorce thing.

“I said ‘What’s there to talk about?’” Kramer recalls. “She goes ‘I told you I’m not getting one.’ I said ‘Great. Don’t.’ She says ‘Where are (my daughter) and I going to live?’ I said ‘You should’ve thought of that before you started stealing from me.’ She goes ‘I’m not stealing from you.’ I said ‘OK.’ She stood up and I put my hand on the back of her shoulder and said ‘Look would you just go inside.’ And she kind of shrugged my hand off of her and then ultimately did go inside.”

Time passed Kramer went back inside to make breakfast and then started stacking pictures of Baird and her daughter about five feet from the door.

Baird saw this he says and started putting them back up.

Which prompted Kramer to start throwing them out the front door. Which prompted Baird to call 9-1-1.

Suddenly a convoy of cop cars were in front of the house. When one officer asked Kramer if he put his hands on his wife — his brain still foggy still considering a question in literal terms — he thought back to the moment he put his hand on Baird’s shoulder and answered that yes he did. Kramer was cuffed thrown into a police car and spent a night in jail. Dillon actually went over to the house later that day asked where his Dad was and Kramer says Baird shut the door on him.

Only after Dillon put a Wellness Search out did he discover Dad was in jail.

Looking back Dergan believes Baird knew her scam was up and in another attempt to stay one step ahead “concocted the whole domestic violence.” It worked. When Kramer was arrested he didn’t even have a chance to grab his wallet. He later realized Baird took $18710.44 over a four-day span while simultaneously filing for divorce and putting a restraining order on him. An order that prevented Kramer from returning to his own home — he was forced to live in four different hotels over a 75-day span.

And even after Kramer shut off his credit cards he says that Baird was able to use the domestic violence charge to squeeze more money out of him.

She requested a sum north of $20000 for relocation expenses post-divorce Kramer says after already stating she paid her sixth months in advance.

“Well she didn’t pay six months rent in advance” Kramer says. “Stupidly she left her bank statements on my computer. For about eight months. There’s no $18000 or $19000 check going to any apartment complex. What there is though are a couple hotels where she and her daughter went away on soccer trips. There’s the $1000 she paid to her attorney to have her forgery conviction expunged. So she perjured herself.”

Of course the domestic violence accusation was publicly humiliating.

The headlines were damning. The headlines were everywhere.

Baird requested nearly $12000 per month in alimony on Sept. 10 2018 and the judge granted her only $530 per month. After that she stopped showing up for hearings.

To this day Kramer is adamant that the scene depicted was utterly invented.

“If this is a crime scene and I throw something at the victim or the victim’s daughter or I tip over a chair wouldn’t there be picture evidence of that? There isn’t any. Not only that. In the police report where the arresting officer says ‘Did you put your hands on your wife?’ and I said ‘yes’ he said in quotes attributing it to me: ‘My wife and I had an argument over finances that turned ugly and I pushed her.’ Did I say that? Not even close. And then he said when he entered the house there were household items all over the house a turned over chair. Where are the pictures for that?”

There was one silver lining through this all. On Jan. 28 2019 an L.A. judge nullified the marriage.

Of course this cost Kramer plenty too. About $125000 in legal fees.

Finally in February 2020 Baird was arrested and charged with 12 felonies including counts of elder abuse identity theft and forgery. In lieu of this the domestic violence charge was dropped… not that the news made a fraction of the national headlines his initial charge did. Nobody noticed. The damage to Kramer’s reputation was done.

A trial date is expected to be set at the next hearing June 29. Baird faces a maximum 14 years in prison.

Baird is pleading not guilty.

Baird’s attorney’s office declined requests to be interviewed for this story.

What’s most frustrating? This all could’ve all been kiboshed five years ago. The same felonies Baird is being charged with now would’ve been the same felonies back at the time of that sham marriage. The only difference? About $650000. Kramer knows this all could’ve been avoided if Chen would have stepped in if the D.A. would’ve realized Kramer was in absolutely no condition to sign that legal document and done something about it.

Erik Kramer and his friend Anna Dergan

The No. 1 problem — all along — was that lawyers weren’t treating this as a medical issue. There is no theft if there is no medical issue. Those closest to Kramer told him repeatedly that Baird was stealing from him and he had zero reaction. Without Dergan’s tenacity on the front lines of a fight Kramer had no clue he was in heck this charade likely would’ve played out for years.

As Detective Lingscheit once said Baird fit a very specific category of thief.

When it comes to dependent adult abuse perpetrators try to separate you from those around you. They make an emotional connection to a weak target — like that four-hour drive back from Vegas — and systematically push away friends family threats. There were times Kramer sincerely thought Dergan and his sister were out to get him.

Anybody could see he was compromised he adds. All it took was a conversation a back-and-forth beyond a scripted speech or media interview.

Yet the authorities who should’ve been protecting Erik Kramer hung him out to dry.

“One particular lawyer who got involved in the conservancy part he made my aunt and sister out to be (evil) like ‘They are trying to overtake your life Erik. They’re trying to overtake your finances annul your marriage. What they’re doing is bad and when the judge hears you speak in this trial all of what they’re doing will go away and you’ll go back to living your life again.’ They are the very people who are trying to help me against the thief.

“He’s supporting the thief! Are you f------ kidding me?”

His voice picks up. His eyes widen.

It wasn’t just Baird who stole money. The legal system ate him up.

There’s no doubt about it: Erik Kramer is squarely in the fight now.

Some might have been a little less excited after seeing the restrictions.

The silver lining to all of this is things are getting more and more back to the way they were before COVID-19 caused widespread shutdowns and restrictions across all avenues of society and especially in sports.

As much as things are getting back to normal there are still cautious steps being taken and the restrictions on how many fans and how they’ll be selected to attend is one of those.

Via Buccaneers.com and senior writer/editor Scott Smith

“We are thrilled to welcome back our most tenured season pass members and our great corporate partners to AdventHealth Training Center for training camp this year as we continue preparations for this much-anticipated follow up to last year’s historic season” said Buccaneers Chief Operating Officer Brian Ford. “With the return of fans to training camp and a sold-out crowd for the upcoming season at Raymond James Stadium the excitement surrounding Buccaneers football is stronger than ever. The energy that the fans bring to our team creates a special atmosphere that our players feed off of and we can’t wait to see that passion on display once again.”

General admission will not be available for training camp as those gaining access will be limited to season pass members suite owners stadium club members and premium seat holders and sponsors.

Surely there is some grumbling about this. After all those people are also the ones who have tickets and the ability to see the team during the season. So why not open training camp to those who may not otherwise be able to witness their Bucs in action?

The short answer is because that’s how it’s always been done. There are perks to being in one of the categories above and in post-COVID recovery this is one of them. I won’t pretend this fact will make anyone who can’t go feel any better. It just is what it is at this point.

There are other opportunities by way of special camp audiences. Again via the same article on the team site from Smith those dates are as follows:

Thursday August 5: Military Day presented by USAA

Friday August 6: Women of Red

Monday August 9: Community Day – Special Olympics/Arians Foundation

The same announcement also officially declared the Buccaneers’ schedule joint practice days with the Tennessee Titans set to take place on August 17th and 18th.

For those who can’t attend camp practices there will be a “Training Camp Live” show on the team site YouTube channel and Facebook page.

Of course as those of us here at Bucs Nation attend we’ll also do our best to keep all Buccaneers fans as up-to-date as possible.

If all goes well this year then this should be the runway needed to have full access open again for 2022’s training camp. And we can’t wait to see all of you back at the AdventHealth Training Center.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYXJyb3doZWFkYWRkaWN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzI3L3BhdHJpY2stbWFob21lcy1ncmVhdGVzdC1vZmZlbnNpdmUtZmlyZXdvcmtzLWNvbWUtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patrick Mahomes' greatest offensive fireworks could come in 2021,

There is a good chance are you are not familiar with the AX Gaming Renegade brand because it only launched last year as E-Sports centric exclusively in China.

The graphics card from the AX Gaming brand is produced by Innovision (the same company that owns INNO3D). which is why you may find some similarities between the designs. The company claims that it has its own separate R&D team in China though. AX Gaming has recently launched its GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti models bringing some fresh new design to already extensive portoflio of custom RTX 30 models.

AXGaming GeForce RTX 3080 Ti X3W

The RTX 3080 Ti model called ‘X3W’ is a triple-fan model kept in dua-slot design. The shroud is all white including the fans.

This cooler actually has an interesting name ‘Punk Pro MAX’ which is not a translation.

AXGAMING RTX 3080 Ti 12GB X3W Specs provided by VideoCardz.NET Database GPU : GA102-225 Base Clock : 1365 MHz Cores : 10240 Boost Clock : 1665 MHz TMUs : 320 Memory Clock : 19 Gbps ROPs : 112 Memory : 12 GB GDDR6X 384b

The X3W is not factory-overclocked all specs are kept at reference frequencies including TDP. In comparison to INNO3D cards there are no changes to the board design either. Our readers might have been quick to notice that this card is essentially a clone of INNO3D RTX 3080 Ti X3 except with a new color scheme.

AXGaming GeForce RTX 3070 Ti X3B

The manufacturer has just announced its black edition of the RTX 3070 Ti model. This card features a thick 3-slot cooling design equipped with three fans. The card is powered by a pair of 8-pin power connectors which is a standard configuration for this model. The design of this card is exclusive to AX Gaming there is no such model in the Inno3D lineup.

Specification-wise the RTX 3070 Ti X3B offers a reference clock speed of 1770 MHz. As far as the official specifications are considered there are no changes to the TDP or display connectors. This model is not yet listed by AXG on the official website but there is a review of this card at Chinese PCOnline.

AXGAMING RTX 3070 Ti 8GB X3B Specs provided by VideoCardz.NET Database GPU : GA104-400 Base Clock : 1575 MHz Cores : 6144 Boost Clock : 1770 MHz TMUs : 192 Memory Clock : 19 Gbps ROPs : 96 Memory : 8 GB GDDR6X 256b

It is definitely a good sign to see new brands appear during a global GPU shortage although AX Gaming isn’t exactly a completely new company. It does appear though that Inno3D manufacturing capacity is sufficient to supply two separate product lines.

The AXGaming GeForce RTX 3080 Ti X3W has a triple-fan cooler and dual-slot design almost identical to the Inno3D GeForce RTX 3080 Ti X3 OC dual-slot graphics card that I reviewed not too long ago.

That would be because Inno3D is owned by the same company that runs the AX Gaming brand so the designs are heavily influenced (virtually the same) except with some slight tweaks and a color change from black to white.

We have the ""Punk Pro MAX"" cooler on the new AXGaming GeForce RTX 3080 Ti X3W graphics card.

Secondly there's the chunkier AXGaming GeForce RTX 3070 Ti X3B which has a larger triple-slot design but similar triple-fan cooler.

Last year we reviewed the the TUF A17 a model from the previous series equipped with a Ryzen 7 and a GTX 1660 Ti. The new model should be much faster at least in graphics applications and games although the total TGP of 95 watts is rather in the middle to lower performance range of an RTX 3060. The display now supports 144 Hz instead of the former 120 Hz.

Besides the virtual predecessor we naturally also want to compare it with the competition found in the same price segment. This primarily includes the Schenker XMG Core 17 but also the MSI Alpha 17 and for lack of further 17-inch competition the MSI GF65 Thin and the Acer Nitro 5 AN515-55 15-inch rivals.

ZOTAC H-Box is a custom variant designed for a special sale on T-Mall (judging from the logo).

The card features an identical cooling solution as the original RTX 3060 X-Gaming which has recently been updated to the ‘GOC’ variant. That of course refers to the LHR model with a new hash rate limiter.

In terms of specs this card is a close of the blue/pink X-Gaming model with a boost clock of 1792 MHz which is a cosmetic upgrade of 0.8% over reference 1770 MHz. It’s a dual-slot design with a single 8-pin power connector. A standard display connector configuration is to be expected from X-Gaming H-Box.

Intellia to host investor event on Monday June 28 at 8:00 a.m. E.T.



CAMBRIDGE Mass. and TARRYTOWN N.Y. June 26 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intellia Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) today announced positive interim data from an ongoing Phase 1 clinical study of their lead in vivo genome editing candidate NTLA-2001 which is being developed as a single-dose treatment for transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. The Phase 1 study run by Intellia as the program’s development and commercialization lead is evaluating NTLA-2001 in people living with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN). NTLA-2001 is the first CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy candidate to be administered systemically via intravenous infusion for precision editing of a gene in a target tissue in humans. NTLA-2001 is designed to inactivate the TTR gene in liver cells to prevent the production of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein which accumulates in tissues throughout the body and causes the debilitating and often fatal complications of ATTR amyloidosis. The interim data were presented today at the 2021 Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) Annual Meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine (nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107454.)1.

“These are the first ever clinical data suggesting that we can precisely edit target cells within the body to treat genetic disease with a single intravenous infusion of CRISPR. The interim results support our belief that NTLA-2001 has the potential to halt and reverse the devastating complications of ATTR amyloidosis with a single dose” said Intellia President and Chief Executive Officer John Leonard M.D. “Solving the challenge of targeted delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 to the liver as we have with NTLA-2001 also unlocks the door to treating a wide array of other genetic diseases with our modular platform and we intend to move quickly to advance and expand our pipeline. With these data we believe we are truly opening a new era of medicine.”

The interim data released today cover the first six ATTRv-PN patients across two single-ascending dose cohorts of the Phase 1 study which is currently being conducted in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Single doses of either 0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg of NTLA-2001 were administered systemically. Reductions in serum TTR levels were measured from baseline to day 28. Treatment with NTLA-2001 led to dose-dependent reductions in serum TTR with mean reductions of 52% among the three patients in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group and 87% among the three patients in the 0.3 mg/kg dose group including one patient with a 96% reduction. By contrast the standard of care for ATTRv-PN which requires chronic treatment typically yields TTR reductions of approximately 80%.

“This is exciting early data both for people living with this devastating disease and for the entire scientific community working to maximize the potential of genetics-based medicines through cutting-edge research and technologies” said George D. Yancopoulos M.D. Ph.D. President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron which first partnered with Intellia in 2016 to advance CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology for in vivo therapeutic development. “Thanks to large-scale human genetics research there have been many new genetic targets identified and confirmed to have an impact on human health. Combining this knowledge with the precision and enhanced convenience of a single CRISPR infusion unlocks new possibilities in treating – and potentially even curing – life-threatening and historically difficult-to-address diseases.”

At both dose levels NTLA-2001 was generally well-tolerated by the six patients included in the interim analysis with no serious adverse events and no liver findings by day 28. Given the safety and tolerability profile so far NTLA-2001 is continuing to be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of the study to determine if a higher dose could result in a deeper reduction in disease-causing protein levels leading to the potential for more meaningful clinical benefit. As of the date of this release Cohort 3 evaluating NTLA-2001 at the 1 mg/kg dose level is actively enrolling.

Following the identification of a recommended dose in the dose-escalation portion of the study Intellia expects to begin a single-dose expansion cohort in Part 2 of the Phase 1 trial later this year. After completion of the Phase 1 trial the company plans to move to pivotal studies for both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis.

“ATTR amyloidosis is a progressive and fatal disease that usually requires chronic lifelong treatment. These interim Phase 1 data support NTLA-2001 as the only one-time treatment either on the market or in development” said Julian Gillmore M.D. Ph.D. Professor of Medicine National Amyloidosis Centre UCL Division of Medicine Royal Free Hospital U.K. and the Phase 1 study’s national coordinating investigator. “As the first-ever systemically administered CRISPR therapy candidate NTLA-2001 shows strong potential to stop the production and accumulation of the misfolded TTR protein by inactivating the TTR gene at the root of the disease. This approach could deliver life-changing lifelong benefits to patients with all forms of ATTR amyloidosis who continue to experience debilitating symptoms and complications of disease while on the standard of care. While further investigation is needed these results are highly encouraging.”

Intellia intends to present additional data from the study at a medical or scientific meeting later this year.

About NTLA-2001

Based on Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR/Cas9 technology NTLA-2001 could potentially be the first curative treatment for ATTR amyloidosis. NTLA-2001 is the first investigational CRISPR therapy candidate to be administered systemically or through a vein to edit genes inside the human body. Intellia’s proprietary non-viral platform deploys lipid nanoparticles to deliver to the liver a two-part genome editing system: guide RNA specific to the disease-causing gene and messenger RNA that encodes the Cas9 enzyme which carries out the precision editing. Robust preclinical data showing deep and long-lasting transthyretin (TTR) reduction following in vivo inactivation of the target gene supports NTLA-2001’s potential as a single-administration therapeutic. Interim Phase 1 clinical data released in June 2021 confirm substantial dose-dependent reduction of TTR protein following a single dose of NTLA-2001. Intellia leads development and commercialization of NTLA-2001 as part of a multi-target discovery development and commercialization collaboration with Regeneron.

About the NTLA-2001 Clinical Program

The global Phase 1 trial is an open-label multi-center two-part study of NTLA-2001 in adults with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN). The trial’s primary objectives are to assess the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of NTLA-2001. Patients receive a single dose of NTLA-2001 via intravenous administration. The study will enroll up to 38 participants (ages 18-80 years) and consists of a single-ascending dose phase followed by a dose-expansion phase which is expected to begin later in 2021. Visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04601051) or eudract.ema.europa.eu/ (2020-002034-32) for more details.

Enrollment is ongoing at clinical trial sites in the U.K. and New Zealand and Intellia is submitting additional regulatory applications to support a planned global study expansion. After completion of the Phase 1 trial the company plans to move to pivotal studies for both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis.

About Transthyretin (ATTR) Amyloidosis

Transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR amyloidosis is a rare progressive and fatal disease. Hereditary ATTR (ATTRv) amyloidosis occurs when a person is born with mutations in the TTR gene which causes the liver to produce structurally abnormal transthyretin (TTR) protein with a propensity to misfold. These damaged proteins build up as amyloid in the body causing serious complications in multiple tissues including the heart nerves and digestive system. ATTRv amyloidosis predominantly manifests as polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) which can lead to nerve damage or cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM) which can lead to heart failure. Some individuals without the genetic mutation produce non-mutated or wild-type TTR proteins that become unstable over time misfolding and aggregating in disease-causing amyloid deposits. This condition called wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) amyloidosis primarily affects the heart. There are an estimated 50000 people worldwide living with ATTRv amyloidosis and between 200000 and 500000 people with ATTRwt amyloidosis.

Ward Melville High School.

This post was written by Rohan Nagavardhan a high school student at Ward Melville High School with a passion for astronomy & computer science. He completed this research at the SUNY Stony Brook University during the summer under the supervision of Dr. Praveen Tripathi. He plans to present these results at Regeneron STS.

In 1995 the radial velocity method found the first extrasolar planet around a Sun-like star in the constellation Pegasus. This method uses the motion of a planet’s home star around a center of mass in order to detect the planet (see figure below) and has been responsible for the detection of a vast number of planets over the past decades. NASA and other groups such as European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are amassing large catalogs of radial velocity data for stars with instruments such as High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) and Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS).

We built a machine learning classifier to analyze radial velocity time series data of a star and predict whether that star has 0 1 or more planets orbiting it. Our radial velocity data set was comprised of data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Machine learning models are unable to look at time series data (data that measures a certain quantity over a certain period of time i.e. monitoring the value of a stock over 5 years) and form a prediction; therefore I needed to conduct feature extraction. Feature extraction describes each unique radial velocity data set with a specific set of orbital parameters that point to that specific star’s data. Repeatedly performing this method with the radial velocity data yielded a data set which would be used to train a model and test the performance of the model. There are two ways of measuring performance of a machine learning model: F-measure score and accuracy percentages. F-measure score analyzes how precise the model is and how well it is able to recall information in order to create one metric that measures the performance of the model. Accuracy percentage which calculates the number of correct predictions over all predictions made is not always the best way to measure the performance of a model was also utilized to supplement the F-measure scores. After training the model received an accuracy percentage of 81.20%; furthermore the model received an F-measure score of .81. These results substantiate the use of machine learning methods on radial velocity time series data for the purpose of exoplanet identification.

If your bills are on autopay and your bill is found to be in error credit will be issued to your account.

Republic did not respond to a request for comment from the Dayton Daily News.

Explore Huber residents to pay more for trash after Rumpke nixes bid citing worker shortage

Huber Heights renewed their contract with Republic this year with a price increase for the first time since 2013. The first year will be $14.54 per month which includes weekly trash pickup biweekly recycling a 10% senior discount and no fuel surcharge said interim city manager Scott Falkowski. The contract is for five years and includes price changes each year. Republic worked with Huber Heights previously and the contract was $11.19 per month.

Huber Heights had three bids for their trash services but Republic ended up with the bid after Rumpke pulled out of the process citing problems with staffing.

The new contract with Republic begins on July 1. It’s not clear why current bills show an increase though many residents pay quarterly or yearly so that could be a factor. Chodkowski said one issue was the short time frame the city had to communicate rate increases before the new contract.

He said from their conversations Republic believes the bills are correct and a detailed accounting of the bills should be available by calling Republic customer services.

Mayor Jeff Gore said in a Facebook post to residents that the bills Republic has sent out appear to be a yearly bill broken into 11 months and then broken down by quarter.

“That’s the reason there are some extra $6-$7 bills and some bills that are in the $50 range” he said. “It’s impossible to give an example of everyone’s bill on this post but I wanted to try and help you understand what the main issue seems to be.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmVkZm9yZGNpdGl6ZW4ub3JnLzIwMjEvMDYvc2VsZWN0LWJvYXJkLW9rYXlzLXNtYWxsLWZlZS1pbmNyZWFzZS1mb3ItZGlzcG9zaW5nLW9mLWhvdXNlaG9sZC1idWxrLWl0ZW1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Select Board Okays Small Fee Increase for Disposing of Household Bulk Items,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thebedfordcitizen.org/2021/06/select-board-okays-small-fee-increase-for-disposing-of-household-bulk-items/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmVkZm9yZGNpdGl6ZW4ub3JnLzIwMjEvMDYvc2VsZWN0LWJvYXJkLW9rYXlzLXNtYWxsLWZlZS1pbmNyZWFzZS1mb3ItZGlzcG9zaW5nLW9mLWhvdXNlaG9sZC1idWxrLWl0ZW1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbWlkbWljaGlnYW5ub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbndzLXBvcnQtYXVzdGluLXRvcm5hZG8tdGhhdC1pbmp1cmVkLXNpeC1wZW9wbGUtcmF0ZWQtZWYtMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vbWlkbWljaGlnYW5ub3cuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL253cy1wb3J0LWF1c3Rpbi10b3JuYWRvLXRoYXQtaW5qdXJlZC1zaXgtcGVvcGxlLXJhdGVkLWVmLTI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NWS: Port Austin tornado that injured six people rated EF2,"PORT AUSTIN Mich. - The National Weather Service (NWS) of Detroit/Pontiac has confirmed that the tornado that struck portions of Port Austin in northern Huron County on Saturday was an EF2 tornado.

DALLAS — To retain its top workers North Texas employers may need to reassess their pay and office situation as two in five Dallas workers plan to look for a new role in the coming months.

According to a new report from staffing company Robert Half the amount of workers who are looking for a new role in Dallas is higher than the national average of one-third. The report found that workers are leaving for higher pay career advancement opportunities and the ability to work remotely.

Thomas Vick regional vice president for Robert Half said employee retention is vital in today’s job market.

""DFW is growing so quickly and workers are getting more opportunities than ever before - employers need to be concerned about retention” Vick said in a prepared statement. “If their top talent isn’t happy there’s a good chance they’ll lose their star employees to other companies who will offer higher compensation remote work options and a work culture that workers want.”

RELATED:

Since the onset of the pandemic which drove even reluctant companies to remote work working from anywhere has proven to be not only viable but also more productive for employees. Over the past year roughly 60 percent of the more than 200 human capital executives surveyed in The Conference Board’s new report say that productivity has increased on average in their organizations. When asked in April of 2020 it was only 23 percent.

A major caveat to this increase in productivity is higher rates of worker burnout – in Dallas half of the city's workers are burnout.

Those same executives believe that the deteriorating mental condition of their employees is one of the major challenges of the future. Others include finding qualified workers and adjusting to a permanent hybrid or sometimes fully remote workflow.

After experiencing the work-from-home model many of the nation’s workers became rather fond of the work style. For example the Robert Half survey found that more than 40 percent of Dallas workers want a fully remote job when looking for their next role.

Nationally almost half of the nation’s workers are keeping an eye out for fully remote jobs – millennials were the most likely to want to work remotely in future positions.

With workers wanting to be fully remote 55 percent of the human capital leaders surveyed by The Conference Board said as long as a worker can come in occasionally to the office they are open to the model – a quarter would hire a full-time report worker anywhere in the U.S.

For nearly a third of workers nationally they are not just keeping an eye out they’re actively searching for a change in the coming months. When broken down by age more than half of those between the ages of 18 and 24 are on the job hunt while only 11 percent of those 55 and up planned to part ways with their current company soon.

According to The Wall Street Journal more workers are leaving their jobs than at any time in at least the past two decades.

The only cities with higher rates of workers looking to move than Dallas were Sacramento Houston Charlotte and Atlanta where 50 percent of all workers plan to look for a professional change.

Thankfully for workers there are a lot of jobs on the market and both pay and bonuses are on the rise. As of the end of April there are over 9.3 million job openings. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics there were roughly 161 million workers in the workforce in May.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtOTczMDMxMS9KZWZmLUJvYmJ5LUJyYXppZXItbGVhdmUtZ3ltLXdvcmtvdXQtcHJlcGFyZS1oYWxmLW1hcmF0aG9uLWdyaWVmLWNoYXJpdHkuaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtOTczMDMxMS9hbXAvSmVmZi1Cb2JieS1CcmF6aWVyLWxlYXZlLWd5bS13b3Jrb3V0LXByZXBhcmUtaGFsZi1tYXJhdGhvbi1ncmllZi1jaGFyaXR5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff and Bobby Brazier leave gym after workout as they prepare for a half marathon for grief charity,"Jeff and Bobby Brazier were spotted leaving the gym after a workout as they prepare to run a half marathon.

The model has already walked for established brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Dolce and Gabbana.

Bobby previously revealed that he followed an unusual route into modelling. He got into trouble at school which resulted in an unexpected encounter with Unsigned Group model scout Cesar Perin.

During an Instagram Q&A session the teen said it was a chance encounter while out with his dad that kickstarted his journey into couture.

One fan asked: 'How'd you get into modelling?'

Can't wait: Jeff and Bobby both carried carrier bags filled with items as Bobby tucked into a snack on the way to their car

Proud: Their charity quest comes after Jeff's youngest son Freddy has followed in his older brother Bobby's footsteps by securing a modelling contract with Unsigned Models

For sale: Jeff also revealed on his Instagram Stories that he was looking for someone to buy his Mercedes after the outing

Amazing: Bobby signed to modelling agency Unsigned Models in 2019 and has since participated in campaigns across the globe

Bobby replied: 'Jokes story. I was in trouble at school and had to go in for a meeting.

'So before I go I go Costa for a little pep talk with my dad and then when we leave @cesarpin is chasing me down the street asking me if I'm a model.'

Bobby bears a striking resemblance to his late mother Jade who tragically passed away in 2009 at the age of 27 following a battle with cervical cancer.

The young model's father Jeff previously told The Sun of his son's career: 'He's signed up with a model agency because he had quite a few that wanted to take him on.

'I know he's quite sort of hopeful for what that might bring and basically it just seems like there's a few opportunities available to him.'",,,,,,

A significant shift is underway as to how industrial software is being procured from traditional perpetual software ownership to subscription and cloud deployment. As digital transformation continues to accelerate software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscription licensing models – including on-premise – and cloud solutions increasingly offer new more appealing options for end users.

For software suppliers to encourage a long-term mutually beneficial relationship with their customers they must transform moving from a traditional reactive focus to being proactive in helping their customers be successful in achieving their business goals and accelerating adoption and product value throughout the life of their solutions. This is critical as end users are moving into the era of the digital enterprise where all product design manufacturing processes services and support and customer experiences are connected by a digital thread that merges the virtual and physical worlds.

Rapid Growth of Subscription and Cloud

Subscription for software licensing has shifted the industrial software market. Many suppliers now offer subscription options. ARC Advisory Group anticipates subscription-based models to grow at a pace nearly four times that of traditional software licenses over the next five years in the industrial software market.

With subscription users are empowered to leverage leading technologies and respond to evolving market demands enhancing agility and accelerating transformation and growth. The transition from perpetual licensing to subscription has lowered the barriers for adoption in several areas such as much lower first-year costs and costs being funded as operating expenses (OpEx) rather than capital expenditures (CapEx). Most end-user organizations prefer bundled services for the software support and upgrades and paying for it using a regular OpEx budget rather than going through the often long approval process for CapEx funding. This can reduce first-year software costs by up to 65 percent. With subscription support services generally include software version upgrades and maintenance as well as access to 24/7/365 remote troubleshooting and technical support. In the industrial sector where software frequently requires implementation and deep domain expertise the quality of the support users get when acquiring subscription software can dramatically impact the outcomes they get from the software.

Cloud-based solutions are flexible allowing universal access to data introducing a collaborative environment for remote workers across the globe and addressing security and availability demands. They can also lower the cost of entry provide near-limitless scalability and they inherently include a routine “automatic” schedule of software maintenance and updates. This eliminates much of the cost and overhead associated with owning and maintaining an in-house IT infrastructure.

The Need for Customer Success

Unlike perpetual software licensing where software is purchased outright at the start subscription solutions begin with a fraction of the initial “full” product cost. That is typically a big advantage for users as they pay over time rather than upfront for product functionality and if they don’t feel they are getting the value from their investment they are able to re-evaluate periodically and make adjustments.

For software suppliers however it means revenue is received over time only a portion coming early on. To ensure long-term customer relationships and minimize churn suppliers must help ensure that their customers can optimally use their software and that they are able to meet the business objectives they acquired the software to achieve. Now more than ever suppliers need to be focused on their customers’ success.

As part of the selection criteria for industrial software investments users should look for a vendor that offers programs and services that balance reactive issue resolution with proactively driving onboarding adoption and success.

AVEVA Builds on a Strong Foundation of Support

As a leading industrial software supplier AVEVA has decades of experience and deep domain knowledge from working with thousands of customers around the world. It also has cultivated an extensive global partner network to help customers wherever they do business.

For years AVEVA has offered comprehensive support services through its foundational Customer FIRST Maintenance and Support Program. That program for example has provided software maintenance to help keep clients’ systems up-to-date as well as provide access to technical support. Technical incident management has been a dedicated customer support function demand-driven and focused on customer satisfaction and resolving immediate issues.

AVEVA has built on this foundation and moved beyond a primary focus on reactive support to be more proactive and prevention-oriented. The company’s Customer Success organization and portfolio of success offerings help its customers accelerate time to value reduce risk increase operational resilience minimize or eliminate unscheduled downtime and help to prevent supply chain disruptions.

Customer Success at AVEVA leverages people processes and technology to ensure customers more quickly achieve their targeted operational and business objectives with AVEVA software solutions. AVEVA is ramping up the hiring of Customer Success Managers and has expanded its offerings to include Success Management Packages and Success Accelerators.

Customer Success Managers

AVEVA’s Customer Success organization aims to proactively help clients reach the business goals that justified their AVEVA software purchase remove obstacles they may face in pursuit of those goals and inspire them to innovate and derive additional value. The organization seeks to continuously improve the customer experience and be an integral part of their success. It is comprised of experienced Customer Success Managers (CSMs) responsible for delivering personalized engagements and fostering optimized technology deployments and long-term collaborative relationships.

CSMs perform comprehensive onboarding to help clients understand their software and entitlements know and align on the outcomes they expect from their software purchases and develop agreed-upon success plans that include critical actions to help ensure expected outcomes are achieved. CSMs also provide guidance and insights to help clients more efficiently and effectively adopt AVEVA solutions and quickly realize value. CSMs achieve this through periodic success plan reviews tracking client progress and providing recommendations to stay on track.

Success Management Packages

Success Management Packages include strategic engagements and services. They provide structured guidance from CSMs and AVEVA product experts across three key areas: onboarding adoption and success. Packages include:

a team focused on long-term success that helps extend a customer’s capabilities through best-practice leadership and hands-on expertise and achieve more rapid adoption and optimized performance.

Depending on a client’s size and geographic footprint the packages also allow for coordination across regions. CSMs can provide cohesive global oversight to help ensure client-driven best-practice standardization as well as optimized technology deployment.

Success Accelerators

AVEVA’s portfolio includes an extensive collection of Success Accelerators. These pre-packaged fixed-fee services are designed to help clients across the various lifecycle stages of their software. A client could be in any stage or more than one stage at a time if they have multiple products.

In the Plan and Implement stages Accelerators help engineer best practices into the application architecture which improves time to value and lowers the long-term cost of ownership. In the Operate stage the focus is on effectively running the software with expert training and driving increased engagement and adoption. Users in the Maintain stage are looking to efficiently maintain their software including software updates patches and license management. In the Optimize stage the goal is to improve software performance and reliability (over time system changes can degrade performance) and help drive changes in functionality to address new market requirements. And then in the Evolve stage the objective is driving innovation through the deployment of major version upgrades adopting new technology and future-proofing the application. After the Evolve stage when for example the user adopts new technology they may then enter the Plan and Implement stage anew.

Helping Users Get the Most from Their Software

The shift from perpetual software ownership to subscription licensing and cloud solutions presents a significant opportunity for end users and for industrial software suppliers. AVEVA is helping its customers take advantage of accelerated Digital Transformation not only with its software subscription and cloud solutions but with an innovative collection of success-based services built on a leading support foundation. To help ensure these success services deliver for customers the company is implementing a leading customer success management platform and it is extending its success activities through its global network of knowledgeable partners.

Proactive success engagements help foster optimized technology deployments and help maximize ROI with increased value realization and tangible and quantifiable business outcomes. They facilitate increased technology adoption through more coordinated thorough and successful solution deployments that result in a broader use of functionality that drives innovation. The engagements also help clients develop success plans and roadmaps to achieve their financial targets and KPIs. Best practices engineered into its clients’ solutions deliver long-term results and a regular cadence of achievement that reduces risk and lowers total cost of ownership while increasing long-term reliability scalability and usability.

End users should seek industrial software suppliers that offer onboarding adoption and success-focused programs and services that balance issue resolution with driving adoption and success. AVEVA is an example of a supplier that is investing in innovative ways to help its customers be successful in achieving their desired business outcomes.

Following Edge's surprise return and attack on Roman Reigns Edge has officially received his rematch opportunity for the Universal Championship against The Tribal Chief at Money In The Bank in three weeks.

Before Edge's return last night Seth Rollins another top-tier contender on the blue brand asked for his Universal Championship shot after successfully winning two big matches against Cesaro. When WWE Officials Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville told Rollins they would consider it it seems that Rollins interpreted their response as a yes instead of a maybe.

This week on Talking Smack before hearing Edge would be getting the title shot ahead of him the ""Friday Night Savior"" justified why he's earned the chance to become the next challenger for the Universal Championship and take home the title for the third time.

""It was promised to me [a shot for the Universal Championship]"" Rollins declared. ""They were inclined to agree. If you've ever had a human conversation that means yes. So that's a promise and they're talking to me!""

After seeing the clip on today's show Rollins in disbelief at first couldn't believe what he just heard. His shocked reaction turned into rage which turned into an enraged promo on Edge. Before he stormed off the set and demanded to talk to an official Rollins had some wrathful things to say towards Edge.

""No no no this can't be"" Rollins said with shock on his face after seeing the clip. ""You guys must have misheard that. There's no way. They promised it to me!

""This is everything that I've worked for! I've never been more ready in my entire life. I deserve the opportunity not Edge. Where has he been? He hasn't been here since WrestleMania; he hasn't done anything. He got his match at WrestleMania. I don't care if it was a triple threat match. That's not my fault! There's got to be something that we can do.

""I don't care what Edge wants! I'm Seth Freakin' Rollins! This place revolves around me. I've been here every day. I didn't take six months off. I've been here every day busting my ass. I deserve that shot. I deserve that title match.""

It’s anchors aweigh and full steam ahead for the Celebrity Edge.

On Saturday the cruise ship owned by the Royal Caribbean Group will become the first to sail from a U.S. port since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought the industry to a halt more than 15 months ago with a no-sail order that was ultimately extended a number of times. It is scheduled to sail from Fort Lauderdale on a seven-night trip that will take it around the Caribbean with ports of call in Mexico and the Bahamas.

CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta got an exclusive early look at the procedures and safety features in place to make cruising in the Covid era possible. The question is will they be enough to keep passengers and crew coronavirus-free?

Smooth sailing or troubled waters?

For die-hard cruise fans this event after several false starts has been a long time coming. For the more skeptical the event is tempting fate to once again reveal that cruise ships are floating petri dishes for one infectious disease or another. It will be a long while before the world forgets the high-profile saga of the Diamond Princess which saw more than 700 coronavirus infections on board and others like it – a situation made worse and more dramatic by nationwide lockdowns and travel bans that left some ships literally racing toward any welcoming port.

For cruising to be possible in the Covid era leaders in the industry convened the Healthy Sail Panel – which included experts in the public health infectious diseases biosecurity maritime and hospitality industries – to come up with recommendations to make the experience healthier and safer for guests and crew. These wide-ranging recommendations developed before vaccines became available dovetail with the Covid-19 Member Policy of the industry’s largest trade group Cruise Lines International Association and with the requirements and guidelines for cruise ships set forth by the CDC which has been – up to now – deciding the circumstances under which ships can sail from the United States.

Dr. Calvin Johnson the chief medical officer for Celebrity told CNN neither he nor the crew are apprehensive. “I think everyone really believes in – because they were part of it – the protocols that we’ve developed the processes we put in place” he said.

“This has been over a year of consistent methodical science-based operational examinations to look at the business how it operates and how we can do it safely. Putting in place protocols to protect our crew and then looking at what it will look like when our guests come back to protect them – and so it’s been a process that brought us to this place” he said.

The industry battens down the hatches

So what’s the plan to make sailing safer? This summer at least there will be fewer people on board; the Edge is sailing at 40% of its capacity. Because the coronavirus is spread through airborne particles fewer people less crowding and good ventilation can make a big difference.

“For this start-up period we’re sailing with a reduced capacity to give us all a chance to get used to the protocols and to really allow for natural social distancing” said Susan Lomax head of global public relations at Celebrity Cruises. She said the cruise line does not plan to exceed 50% capacity on any of its trips this summer. Because of the reduced capacity cabin occupancy will be spaced out and people will be put into cabins with windows that face outward. Crew members will get their own cabins.

Lomax said filtration experts from the University of Nebraska were asked to evaluate the ventilation/HVAC system and pronounced it “better than what hospitals have.”

Linsey Marr an environmental engineer and professor at Virginia Tech agrees the Edge’s ventilation system is more than adequate. “The combination of high air change rates and high-quality filters … will greatly reduce the amount of virus that can build up in the air. Thus it is unlikely that people will be exposed to elevated levels of virus in cabins and public indoor spaces” she told CNN. “If this is the case then the biggest risk comes from being in close proximity within the exhaled respiratory plume of an infected individual.”

Yuguo Li from the department of mechanical engineering at The University of Hong Kong sides with Marr.

“Taking all evidence so far I highly believe that SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly transmitted by the short-range inhalation route in inadequately ventilated spaces. We have studied about 20 outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and performed ventilation measurement for 10 of them all supporting this hypothesis” Li wrote in an email. His study on the Diamond Princess was published online in April in the journal Building and Environment and his editorial appeared in the journal Indoor Air in mid-May.

“For the Diamond Princess outbreak we showed that their cabin ventilation might be sufficient and suspect that infections occurred in the public areas. There are two major factors in these public areas: First in gyms and dancing floors people perform high [energy] activities with more droplet release and higher inhalation flow hence infection risks are high … Second if occupancy is not controlled in these public spaces the ventilation per person can be even lower. In some spaces such as restaurants people cannot wear masks” he explained.

On the Edge other procedural changes include staggered arrival and departure times to prevent large crowds and a muster drill – the mandatory safety exercise done at the start of every trip – done virtually instead of in person again to avoid large crowds. And food lovers need not fear: the all-you-can-eat buffets will still be a staple of the dining experience but instead of self-serve crew members will lend a hand.

In the unfortunate event of an outbreak the Edge has the capacity to manage 33 patients and there are four ICU beds. The entire medical area is on a separate ventilation system.

Contact tracing plans that make use of the ship’s CCTV have been drawn up there are protocols for isolation and quarantining and disinfection procedures following positive cases.

Importantly Royal Caribbean has agreements with a number of countries to act as disembarkation ports should there be a need to get people off the ship.

“There’s no longer any ‘Oh my gosh we’re sailing for days and no one will take us’ ” said Lomax. “There’s no reason to wait till the end of the cruise; we have the ability to go to those disembarkation ports if and as needed.”

Vaccines are game changers

But everyone from those in the cruise industry to health experts says the real game changers are vaccines which offer up to 95% protection against symptomatic Covid-19. Even if there are breakthrough infections vaccines reduce the amount of virus in the body making people less infectious to others.

“It’s really the vaccines that have enabled us to return to cruising with a low enough level of risk of transmission” said Marr.

On the Edge 100% of the crew and at least 95% of passengers are vaccinated which considerably lowers the risk of people getting infected and sparking an outbreak.

However effective vaccines are it’s unclear whether when and where they can be mandated on future cruises. The CDC currently advises unvaccinated people against going on a cruise – but that’s just guidance. Additionally Florida is one of several states that has banned businesses from requiring customers to provide proof of vaccination although upcoming cruises leaving from ports in Washington state and Alaska are expected to have vaccination requirements.

And to top it off a federal district judge in Tampa recently concluded the CDC’s restrictions on the cruise industry are likely unconstitutional and the agency is overstepping its legal authority. So starting July 18 the agency will no longer be able to enforce its sailing rules including requirements that either 95% of passengers be vaccinated or that the ship successfully conduct a simulated voyage. The judge gave the CDC until July 2 to propose more modest guidelines.

In navigating these murky fluctuating rules Lomax said that the Edge capped at 5% the number of cabins for people who choose not to disclose their vaccination status. They are counted as unvaccinated. People presumed to be unvaccinated will have to wear masks in public areas and will also have to undergo additional Covid-19 testing – both to board and midway through the cruise – at their own expense. Everybody has to be tested before disembarking in the United States.

“With 95% of passengers vaccinated that’s far more than we have in any country. And we know that the higher vaccination rates have really brought down cases. So I think it’s probably reasonable for healthy vaccinated people to go on a cruise” said Marr. “The risk of an outbreak on a cruise ship together with the measures that they’re taking requiring unvaccinated people to wear masks the overall risk of an outbreak should be quite low. And I’d be surprised if we saw something like the Diamond Princess again.”

But despite all the precautions the experience is still not guaranteed to be 100% coronavirus-free if the Celebrity Millennium is any example. That ship carrying the first North American paying passengers set sail in early June out of St. Maarten and made several ports of call. The crew were all fully vaccinated as were more than 95% of passengers. Nonetheless two passengers tested positive for coronavirus at the end of the trip.

“In term of vaccination the protection is not 100%. Sufficient vaccination protects us from developing a chain of infection i.e. sustained infection in a large population but … that means sporadic outbreaks can still occur particularly with the new variants of concern” Li noted.

Johnson Celebrity’s CMO said the incident was unfortunate but it shows the system is working. “It certainly got my attention” he said.

“But we also know that if we look [at] the world around us in every venue infections are happening every day. And so we fully anticipate that… as thorough as our efforts are and as much as we do prevent on the front end virus from coming on board the ship that it can happen” he said. “It’s why we have protocols we have a process; we’ve trained our folks to know what to do when we do identify this. We work very quickly to identify and isolate that and prevent and stop the spread.”

But perhaps the most reassuring statement for would-be cruise goers comes from Marr who said that she would not stop her healthy vaccinated 70-year-old cruise-loving mother from taking one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL2NhcHRhaW4ta2F0ZS1jb3ZpZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Captain Kate Takes Back The Helm After 15 Months,"By Jonathan Levin (Bloomberg) A Celebrity Cruises ship left the coast of Florida on Saturday becoming the first revenue-earning cruise to depart from the U.S. after a pandemic-induced hiatus.

Guests on Celebrity Edge operated under the broader Royal Caribbean Group umbrella flashed their vaccination cards as they filed through lines. The company says 99% of guests are vaccinated and the ship set sail at about 40% of its normal capacity of about 2900. Health surveys were filled out digitally before boarding.

After a pause of more than 15 months the departure marks the industry’s biggest step yet in returning to a business hit hard since the start of the outbreak. As guests checked in at designated times at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale to limit crowds there’s a sense of optimism on what this journey brings to the future of cruises.

“I feel like it’s a step toward some normality but it’s a just a test so we’ll see how it goes” said Brandon Prunty a 26-year-old who was waiting to board with his girlfriend amid scattered showers. “I’m trying to keep a positive outlook. If they have certain restrictions that’s the way it goes. I’m just looking for a good vacation.”

The cruise industry has come a long way since March 2020 when a series of Covid-19 outbreaks on ships led to deaths at sea and sent governments into panic about whether the vessels could even let passengers disembark. In the ensuing period the main three companies — owners of vast and capital intensive fleets — have raised more than $40 billion in new financing to muddle through without customers.

The shutdown reverberated across a series of other professions that feed off the floating resorts which all told account for around 750000 American jobs according to Royal Caribbean.

Captain Kate Takes Departure





The company pulled out all the stops for the first trip. The ship’s captain was Kate McCue the first American woman cruise captain and one of the industry’s biggest social-media stars. The event was filled with celebratory music and speeches from local politicians and Royal Caribbean Group Chief Executive Richard Fain — who’s also on board — even sang a slightly off-key chorus of Jimmy Cliff’s “I Can See Clearly Now.”

“I expected to be in this position long before 15 months” Fain said in an interview on the ship. “The virus has proven to be different than many of us expected in the beginning. And I think that we had hoped that more normal epidemiological methods would help contain it. But in the end it turned out that the important and really groundbreaking change was the development of the vaccines.”

Even as more people get inoculated some uncertainty still hangs over the industry as new waves of Covid-19 outbreaks prompt lockdowns and new restrictions in other parts of the world. Cruise companies expect Saturday’s voyage will be the start of a gradual resumption to normal operations that could take until well into 2022.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has outlined a path back to the ocean that it considers safe in which companies can either conduct “simulated” voyages to prove their virus safety or ensure 95% of passengers and crew are vaccinated. Celebrity Edge was approved under the latter.

The industry was somewhat entangled in Florida’s politics too. Under Republican Governor Ron DeSantis the state sued the CDC this year to prevent it from enforcing the restrictions on the industry a massive source of jobs in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis also pushed to approve legislation that banned so-called vaccine passports in which vaccination proof is required as a condition of service — which initially seemed to clash with the CDC path to resumption that called for a 95% vaccination rate on board. But the cruise companies appear to have found a way around that as shown by the check-in process on Celebrity Edge.

“There is nothing in the vaccine passport ban that prevents a company from asking about vaccination status” said DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw. “The law would only be violated in the event that a company denied service or entry to an individual who could not or would not show proof of immunization.”

‘No Apprehensions’



James and Cynthia Mitchell of Hope Kansas were just glad to be returning to the sea. The retiree couple in their mid 50s wore matching black t-shirts that read “Straight Outta Vaccination.” They consider themselves avid cruisers and had nine trips canceled during the pandemic. They planned to be on a cruise again next week as soon as they return on Celebrity Edge.

“We have no apprehensions at all” James said. “There’s a lot of smart people that will make sure that everything works great. We just have to listen and do as they say but I don’t think it’s going to take away from any of the fun and good times.”

The net is the window to the outside world connecting the crew with their loved ones back home.

Each day crew members are joining the ships as more countries reopen the borders allowing cruise ships to sail. And while guests can go out in ports crew members are unfortunately not allowed ashore yet or have limited access. Before the pandemic many of the crew use to go out in ports to get free internet access at the nearby bars restaurants or beach resorts and chat with their family and friends. With the current restrictions many of the cruise lines are now offering free internet for the crew. In order to find out more about what is free and how much the cruise lines are charging for additional services I spoke with my fellow crew members onboard. Here’s what they said.

Carnival Cruise Line

A crew member onboard one of the Carnival cruise ships getting ready to start cruising said they have unlimited free internet access to all apps except YouTube.

“We have two vouchers per week of 450min each and free unlimited social media (Facebook Instagram WhatsApp Messenger LinkedIn and Snapchat). If you ask they will give you more vouchers. But so far I got 6 vouchers and I only used 20 min of the first one ” said the crew member

The crew are rushing to get the ships ready so they have little time to chat or browse the net this is not only the case on the Carnival ships but all cruise lines as well. Housekeeping restaurant and technicians are especially busy during the restert. When asked if the crew will have the same internet privileges once guests arrive the crew member said “We have free internet until the start of cruises. After that nobody knows but it will probably go back to what it was before”

Royal Caribbean Group

The crew onboard Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises ships have 24/7 access to WhatsApp and one hour of free internet per day which needs to be used at the same time when they log in.

“Here in Royal we have pretty much the same as Celebrity. We have unlimited WhatsApp 24/7 (text only) and 1 hour free per day.” said Royal Caribbean crew member. “We are super busy at the moment but once we get on track everything will be fine. When we're at CocoCay we have free internet on the island and it’s a good speed though.”

Costa Cruises

A crew member working for Costa Cruises said the crew receive a voucher for free internet of 250 MB once they embark on the ship.

“When you embark you’ll be in quarantine 7 days hard and after 7 days soft. On embarking you’ll get a voucher for full internet of 250MB. So this is the voucher crew received on embarkation day and needed to last for 2 weeks during the quarantine. Since 2 weeks after reopening the Costa Crew has in general the CrewWifi for free use of WhatsApp - No pics No Voice just Text - for free but at least is for free 24/7

If you don’t want you can pay: on port 3 cents each minute or at sea 5 cents each minute. They have as well packages: 1GB €15 - 5GB €45 for 30 valid not used will disappear after 30 days. ""

Norwegian Cruise Line

So far NCL has opted not to charge crew for internet until the first guest steps onboard. Ncl hasn’t decided yet for when guests sail. According to our source they said it will be paid packages again.

Viking Ocean Cruises

Viking has free unlimited internet for the crew even as the guests started sailing on the Viking Ships. All apps are enabled the speed is great and the crew can even watch YouTube but sometimes the videos need more time to upload.

MSC Cruises

A crew member onboard MSC Virtuosa said that the company has free WhatsApp for text messaging only and the crew can use Facebook Messenger to make video or audio calls. The crew can also purchase internet packages such as the monthly internet package 50 euro of 3GB. One thing we noticed is that this package in 2019 was 45 euros for the crew. So there is an increase in the prices but the crew said at least they are giving free WiFi which was not offered before by the company.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

""Smoking Joe Biden. Cadaver Joe Biden. I never thought I would say this. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3Jmay1qcnMtdnAtcGljay1uaWNvbGUtc2hhbmFoYW4tdHJpZXMtdG8tc2hha2Utb2ZmLWRhaWx5LWJlYXN0LXN0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RFK Jr.'s VP Pick Nicole Shanahan Says She's 'Hurt' by Daily Beast Story,"Nicole Shanahan who ignored repeated requests for comment on a Daily Beast story about her astonishing ascent to become Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. in a series of mocking meant-to-be-funny videos that were inarguably uncharacteristically un-Kennedyesque escalating a civil war within America’s most storied political dynasty.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

But what viewers may be more struck by or even insulted by are the heavily accented caricatures the young scion used to dramatize his points.

Laturnus Obituary 2024,"Peter S. (Pete) Laturnus

December 30 1934 – May 09 2024

Peter S. Laturnus 89 of Munich ND passed away on May 09 2024 at CHI St Alexius Health Devils Lake Hospital.

Several years later the family moved to a farm near Clyde North Dakota. Pete obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1960.

Pete worked with his brother-in-law Elmer Mueller for many years doing plumbing and heating work. When Elmer retired Pete started his own plumbing and heating business along with farming for many years at Calio N.D. He so loved the farm and could build and fix almost anything. He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Student loans are some of the largest and most common loans in the U.S. and many people first take them out when they’re just 18 years old. Because of this many people don’t consider the requirements and risks of a student loan until they graduate.

As a result the federal government has made loan exit counseling a requirement for people with federal student loans.

These people must complete the counselling before leaving school graduating or dropping below half-time enrollment. This is when student borrowers need to start paying back their federal loans.

The goal of these counseling sessions is to make sure students understand their loans and any changes their new educational status may cause.

When are loan exit interviews necessary?

Federal law requires schools to offer loan exit interviews to anyone who receives:

Subsidized Direct Federal Stafford Loans: Undergraduate student loans provided by the U.S. Department of Education. Interest is subsidized by the government until the student graduates.

Undergraduate student loans provided by the U.S. Department of Education. Interest is subsidized by the government until the student graduates. Unsubsidized Direct Federal Stafford Loans: Undergraduate professional and graduate student loans provided by the U.S. Department of Education. Interest is not subsidized by the government.

Undergraduate professional and graduate student loans provided by the U.S. Department of Education. Interest is not subsidized by the government. Federal Perkins Loans: A federally-subsidized loan available to undergraduates and graduate students based on financial need. These loans are offered through the educational institution.

A federally-subsidized loan available to undergraduates and graduate students based on financial need. These loans are offered through the educational institution. Graduate/Professional Student PLUS Loans: Federally-subsidized loans available to graduate and professional students through the U.S. Department of Education.

While loan exit interviews aren’t legally required for other types of lending they can still be used.

Any student loan program where terms change upon graduation may benefit from an exit interview requirement.

What should a loan exit interview include?

A complete loan exit interview both collects information and provides explanations to loan borrowers.

These complex documents include collection fields for contact information references and schools to be notified of the completed exit counseling.

They should explain how loans work generally as well as explain the student’s specific loans including repayment options payment schedules and interest accrual information.

‌Other information that may be found in a loan exit interview includes explanations of how to repay the loan avoid delinquency or cancellation and the rights and benefits of federal student loan recipients.

How secure should loan exit interviews be?

Because loan exit interviews contain private financial information they need to be kept secure. Like all documents related to higher education they are also held to the standards of FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act).

Following FERPA regulations is crucial if you’re offering student loans of any type. PandaDoc’s online forms are FERPA-compliant so you never need to worry about sensitive information being released.

You can further protect student privacy by ensuring that your exit interviews are filled out by the right person.

With electronic signature capabilities PandaDoc can help you keep your exit interviews trustworthy secure and in line with federal regulations.

Is a loan exit interview the same as a loan summary?

A loan exit interview is a more in-depth version of a loan summary. Outside of student loans most lenders require borrowers to begin repaying the loan immediately.

A loan summary explains all of the terms interest rates and payment schedules in a single document.

It doesn’t need to be as complex as a loan exit interview because there’s no lag between taking out the loan and beginning repayments.

On the other hand student loans often have a deferment period of months or years before they start accruing interest and requiring payment.

As a result the student borrower may not remember the loan terms by the time they need to make payments. Loan exit interviews remind them of that information when it becomes relevant.

Should you use a template to create a loan exit interview?

If your organization regularly issues student loans you will likely benefit from using a template for your loan exit interviews.

Whenever you need to update your forms to fit changing federal regulations a template can ensure that you’ve included all required sections.

It can also help you maintain robust legal elements throughout the document. Without the need to create every interview from scratch when you need to update things you can save significant time and effort for your organization.

HR Solutions on the Deluxe People Platform was soft launched in the first quarter and is now widely available. Deluxe also said it would bring its HR and payroll tools for small businesses to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. On the surface Deluxe's launch highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digitization of SMBs. If you zoom out however there's a digital transformation story and more than 2 years of work.

I've been tracking Deluxe for a few months since it highlights how a company that epitomizes paper-based processes (checks and check clearing) can go digital and expand into new markets. HR Solutions on the Deluxe People Platform is the product of a focus on payments collaboration with GoCo.io Inc. and digital transformation.

Coupled with the $960 million purchase of First American Payment systems a deal that closed June 1 and Deluxe has revamped its business in a hurry. Deluxe Payments will now represent 29% of the company's revenue. Barry McCarthy CEO of Deluxe said the First American acquisition is a big step toward becoming a ""trusted payments and business technology company.""

McCarthy added that Deluxe will take First American and expand into government non-profit and retail verticals to complement its core SMB customer base.

The First American deal is the largest acquisition in Deluxe's 106-year history.

When announcing the First American deal Deluxe noted that its digital transformation in advance set the stage for the purchase. Deluxe has built a technology platform that can integrate purchases a sales organization to cross-sell the portfolio and the ability to build products.

The digital transformation plan

While the HR product launch and First American deal are two big moves they're only possible due to a digital transformation plan laid out previously.

Deluxe CEO McCarthy's plan was called One Deluxe. In a nutshell One Deluxe aimed to turn the company away from being a rollup of acquisitions to an enterprise focused on building products organic growth and more strategic acquisitions.

Over the last two years Deluxe set out to break down silos in its business as well as become a customer and product driven company.

In the first quarter Deluxe was able to close 1600 deals and sell its software as a service and cloud platforms as well as land business for payments promotions and its core checks business. The financial results are still a work in progress. Deluxe reported first quarter sales of $441.3 million down 9.3% from a year ago with net income of $24.3 million or 57 cents a share. The company is projecting 2021 sales to be flat to up 2%.

Deluxe is targeting a small and medium sized business market as well as core financial institutions.

Here are a few lessons from Deluxe's transformation:

Deluxe had to get its own IT house in order to be nimble enough to acquire and transform to launch new product extensions. As outlined in a 2020 investor day Deluxe moved to a modern technology stack as it implemented Workday Salesforce MuleSoft and a bevy of other tools.

View transformation through the customer and business lifecycle. Those IT operations were designed to enable a business lifecycle that walked SMBs from the startup to branding to growth and optimization phases.

Once phases of the lifecycle are clear develop customer-centric products for pain points. Deluxe is now focused on payments cloud products including everything from web hosting to marketing to digital engagement as well as promotional tools and checks.

McCarthy said on Deluxe's first quarter earnings conference call May 6:

Our transformation into a sales-driven payments and trusted business technology company is yielding results and will accelerate with the addition of First American. Our One Deluxe strategy is clearly working and our execution is strong. This really is a new Deluxe a payments and trusted business technology company.

Going forward McCarthy said that the economy's reopening should accelerate Deluxe's sales as SMBs recover. He said:

We do see small businesses continuing or accelerating reorder of core products. We mentioned that in our promotional products business. The business we have there which is business essentials is a pretty good leading indicator of what's happening in the marketplace because those are forms that people and businesses use in the normal operation of their business. And we've seen a very healthy rebound there. We've also seen good growth in our incorporation services that new businesses use our web-based and our cloud-based corporation services help businesses incorporate. We think small business formation continues and that we're especially pleased to see small business to start recovering as well.

Wall Street is modeling Deluxe to report 2021 sales of $1.86 billion with $1.96 billion in 2022. Shares of Deluxe have recovered from $18.90 a share to $44.33 in the last year but are down from nearly $80 in 2018.

We get it; you’ve been holed up in your apartment for over a year and as things gradually reopen you need a fresh start (preferably somewhere that doesn’t give you pandemic PTSD.) Unfortunately high-tailing it out of your quarantine-ridden home is easier said than done.

Right now the demand for homes exceeds supply thanks to a collective urge to explore new places increased ability for some to work remotely and—most of all—low interest rates. That means it’s a seller’s market allowing you to snag more money for your space particularly if you live in the suburbs surrounding a major city (homes in Midwestern metro areas are up 10 percent year over year for example). But it also means buying a new home comes at a steeper cost. So if you’re looking to move you might as well do everything you can to get the best offer you can.

Which brings us to our point: When it comes to selling your home curb appeal is the best way to give your listing a competitive edge. Not to mention that when Chip Gaines says that the best best place to invest in a home’s value is the exterior paint job you abide. So what colors should you choose? Right now the hottest shades follow two particular paint trends: soft neutrals and nature-inspired tones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXJieWluZm9ybWVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2RlcmJ5LWNvdXBsZS1icmluZy1tb2JpbGUtYXhlLXRocm93aW5nLWJ1c2luZXNzLXRvLWFyZWEvYXJ0aWNsZV9lZDMzMTVhYS1kNzQxLTExZWItODI5Ny0wZjIyMmRkMjcyYmEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Derby couple bring mobile axe throwing business to area,"×

And with the last year dominated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic school districts can use the help.

Parents of Imlay City Community Schools (ICS) students and other volunteers headed out to the ICS athletic areas last week to contribute a little elbow grease to freshen up the facilities. Dubbed the Spartan Community Day the effort was organized by parent of two ICS students Jessica Keeping.

Keeping along with about 40 other volunteers students and adults cleaned and painted throughout last weekend. “It was just a group of parents that wanted to help out” said Keeping.

Keeping said her two children one in eighth grade and the other in fifth are both active in several sports and she and fellow parents have noticed some of the facilities have needed TLC. “We understand the budget is tight so if there’s something we can do to help (we will)” she said.

Keeping said the volunteers which included most of Imlay City High School’s boys’ varsity soccer team were led by ICS director of operations Dan Campbell who came in on his day off. “He was awesome and the boys’ soccer team was there for hours” said Keeping.

This year’s Spartan Community Day was the first but Keeping said it won’t be the last. “We’re hoping to make it annual” she said.

ICS curriculum and instruction executive director Dr. Dina Tallis said the district continues to be “grateful and amazed” at the support from ICS families and community. “We are so very thankful for all of the work that was done and the time that these volunteers worked to make it all happen” she said.

Tallis also extended thanks to Mortimer Lumber Imlay City Hardware and Lapeer’s Sherwin Williams for their support “during our many many trips for supplies before and on Spartan Community Day.”",,,,,,

At the time there wasn’t a firm timetable for the project but it was in its design phase.

The park sits next to SouthPark mall.

Two years later the public-private project is still being designed. There’s still no date for a groundbreaking and Simon which owns the mall and the park won’t say anything about it. Through a spokesperson the city’s economic development team declined to comment citing “the active and ongoing nature of the deal.”

Hilary Larsen chair of the SouthPark Association of Neighborhoods says the project was put on hold during the pandemic.

City council member Tariq Bokhari whose district 6 includes SouthPark says both sides are still very much committed to the project. The park is a way to “innovatively use underutilized space” Bokhari says.

Why it matters: Although it sounds like the project is still happening the city has kept mostly quiet about a project that uses millions in public dollars.

More broadly the Symphony Park development is part of a larger plan to make SouthPark more walkable and vibrant.

Zoom out: Symphony Park is a 7.5-acre green space anchored by a circular bandshell where the Charlotte Symphony and other artists perform. It’s on the same property as the mall but it’s disconnected from it. Part of the goal of the project would be to connect the park and the mall Bokhari says.

“People will come to SouthPark and watch (a concert) or they’ll go to the mall and shop. There needs to be a bridge” he adds.

A renovation of the park would add community amenities such as a public plaza a promenade leading to the mall restrooms and children’s play spaces.

Between the lines: SouthPark is a high-end mall that’s often considered one of the most successful in the South but the pandemic crushed mall traffic.

Investing in nontraditional mall amenities like an outdoor park could be a way to drum up foot traffic.

“I have been incredibly surprised that the top of the house folks at Simon … have been so innovative and willing to push the envelope on something like this” Bokhari says.

City involvement: A makeover of the park is one of the projects the city identified as part of its Comprehensive Neighborhood Improvement Program (CNIP) about three years ago.

SouthPark is a neighborhood already with lots of private investment the city noted. The CNIP aims to “maintain and enhance SouthPark as a community that is attractive economically strong and provides transportation choices.”

Another signature CNIP project is a SouthPark Loop a 3-mile urban trail for walking and biking.

The city would not comment on how much of the $10 million comes from taxpayers versus how much comes from Simon.

Larsen the SouthPark group chair hopes to meet with Simon this fall to hear about what they’re willing to do “given the new climate.”

“We think that the idea of greater utilization of the green space is in line with customers’ desire to be outdoors” she said in an email.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you shop through our links we may get a commission.

Mophie's Snap+ Juice Pack Mini acts like a MagSafe wireless charging pack but crucially it's not.

Mophie Snap+ Juice Pack Mini 3.5 / 5

Mophie's new Snap+ Juice Pack Mini is a well-priced and well-designed compact portable battery that plays nicely with MagSafe but there are some caveats that potential buyers should be aware of before purchasing.

It would be easy to conclude that the new Snap+ Juice Pack Mini is MagSafe certified. After all the company's own marketing repeatedly references Apple's MagSafe noting that the battery pack is ""compatible with MagSafe for iPhone 12 models.""

However that's not actually the case. Mophie's new battery pack simply offers Qi wireless charging holding the battery in place on your iPhone 12 with a series of magnets that align with the MagSafe charger.

Because it's not MagSafe certified that means the recharge capacity of the Snap+ Juice Pack Mini is just 7.5 watts — half of what ""true"" MagSafe is capable of.

However if you bring along a USB-C to Lightning cable and recharge that way it increases the output to 12 watts.

That major caveat aside as a small pocketable 5000 mAh battery pack we like the Snap+ Juice Pack Mini a lot. Mophie says a fully charged battery can give an iPhone 12 in default settings a complete charge from 0 to 100%.

It holds a hefty 5000mAh of charge for your iPhone which it can deliver wirelessly.

Both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro feature 2815mAh batteries. That means owners of the iPhone 12 Pro Max which boasts a 3687mAh battery won't get a complete recharge from this accessory — but they will get some extra juice to finish out the day if necessary.

In our own tests with an iPhone 12 Pro the handset recharged at a rate of about 1/3 capacity per hour (slower naturally as the phone approached 100%) but with enough juice to top off a near-dead phone. Recharging was a bit faster — about half-capacity in an hour — when using a USB-C to Lightning cable.

And for recharging the battery pack itself via its USB-C port that was accomplished in about two hours.

An alignment guide you get with your power bank.

Another plus of the product along with the rest of the Snap accessory lineup is that it comes with a ""Snap Adapter"" a metallic ring with an adhesive that can be attached to non-MagSafe compatible devices like the iPhone 11.

With this adapter older iPhones — and other Qi-compatible devices — will magnetically attach not only to the Mophie Snap+ Juice Pack Mini and other Snap accessories but also to Apple's own MagSafe accessories (albeit at a slower charging rate than the full 15 watts of ""true"" MagSafe).

The large circle magnet on the battery itself is plenty strong enough to attach and stay connected to our iPhone 12 Pro.

However the small ""orientation"" magnet that resides below the main ring magnet is to put it bluntly worthless.

It's small enough to be easily dwarfed by the iPhone 12 Pro.

The good news is even if the battery is off-kilter it will still charge so if it gets knocked out of alignment in your pocket or bag you should be OK. But it raises the question of: What is the orientation magnet's point if it doesn't do its job?

It should also be noted that Zagg's website initially and incorrectly stated the battery pack would be rechargeable through Qi. We tried this repeatedly on different charging pads and contacted Zagg after we couldn't get it to work and the company later confirmed that it was an error on their site that has since been corrected.

If you plan to use the battery pack with MagSafe on Apple's iPhone 12 mini be aware that the accessory obstructs one of the cameras. We didn't have an iPhone 12 mini to test but Zagg says the battery will interfere with zoom functions and it also hangs off of the bottom of the phone by 4.8mm.

The base of the Snap+ Juice Pack Mini nicely mirrors the elements on the bottom edge of the iPhone.

The Snap+ Juice Pack Mini has one USB-C port which recharges the unit at a speed of 15 watts. The port pulls double duty and can also be used for the aforementioned Lightning charge of the iPhone at faster speeds but it really opens up the battery to be used for recharging anything including other USB-C accessories like Apple's new Beats Studio Buds.

We can also confirm that the battery pack will provide power to an iPad Pro. Obviously with its small capacity it won't be completely refilling your iPad but if you're in the single digits of remaining battery percentage it could get you through until you find your way to a proper wall charger.

In our test a 12.9-inch iPad Pro went from 73% to 100% in about an hour and a half and there were still one out of four dots of capacity shown on the battery pack.

The USB-C port also has the added benefit of indirectly adding USB-C charging to the iPhone. If you're the type of person who wants to go all-in on USB-C and ditch your Lightning cable or you don't have a Lightning cable available the Mophie Snap+ Juice Pack Mini is a viable solution.

The Snap+ Juice Pack Mini sits quite nicely on the iPhone's back hugging the space below the camera module.

The final factor to consider here is the price. At $49.95 despite its shortcomings it's not a bad deal for an ultraportable well-designed battery that works with MagSafe and offers USB-C output for other devices.

Apple is rumored to be working on its own MagSafe battery pack which will presumably charge at the full 15 watts capable of the wireless charging standard.

Apple's last Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 11 was considerably expensive at $129 and there's no reason to suspect an iPhone 12 version with MagSafe would be any cheaper. There's also the issue that the iPhone 11 Smart Battery Case could only charge an iPhone 11 — it didn't offer the ability to connect a cable and charge other accessories like Mophie's new product can.

Mophie's packaging is minimal but does the job.

It's far from perfect but there's still a lot to like about the Mophie Snap+ Juice Pack Mini. It'll easily recharge your iPhone in your pocket or while being used and it works with other small accessories with a USB-C cable and it's priced reasonably for an accessory with these capabilities.

Just don't buy into the MagSafe marketing hype because this little battery is not truly pushing Apple's wireless charging standard to its full potential.

Dad-of-22 Noel Radford has cooked up an impressive barbecue feast to feed Britain's biggest family.

He showed off a bumper-sized meat platter with enough massive steaks sausages and burgers to feed the nation's largest brood.

Sharing the mouth-watering snap on Instagram Noel wrote: ""Now that's what you call a steak"".

The family are known to love their food and recently shared snaps of a generous Father's Day breakfast fry-up for Noel and the kids.

The mammoth breakfast including tins of beans dozens of tomatoes bacon sausages hash browns and mushrooms as well as no less than 30 eggs.

Earlier this year mum Sue revealed that the weekly food bill for the sizeable family has nearly doubled thanks to lockdown as the children are constantly eating - with their outlay rising from £300 to £400.

During an episode of Channel 5 series 22 Kids And Counting she admitted that they managed to get through 16 pints of milk and four loaves of bread a day and each week they go through 80 yoghurts three tubes of toothpaste and 24 toilet rolls.

As well as discussing bedtime routines and how much they spend on birthday presents Sue also discussed her never-ending chores such as doing the laundry and going food shopping.

The Radfords famously don't claim benefits from the government and live on the income from Noel's bakery business and their show.

The Radford Pie company which is located near their family home has recently expanded and caters for online orders made from around the UK.

On the website it says: “We have owned our own lovely bakery since 1999 which is how we manage to provide for (and feed) our huge and expanding family as well as for the local people of Heysham and Morecambe.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS05NzI2NDkzL0t5bGllLUplbm5lci1wb3Nlcy1zdWx0cnktc25hcC1sb25nLWJsYWNrLWdvd24uaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS05NzI2NDkzL2FtcC9LeWxpZS1KZW5uZXItcG9zZXMtc3VsdHJ5LXNuYXAtbG9uZy1ibGFjay1nb3duLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kylie Jenner poses for sultry snap in a long black gown,"Kylie Jenner shared a sundrenched snap on Friday as she spent a day at her Kylie Cosmetics headquarters.

Kylie famously kept her pregnancy secret until after she'd given birth and she admitted she was trying to avoid judgement over being a young mom.

She said: 'I shared so much of my life. I was also really young when I got pregnant.

'It was just a lot for me personally. I didn't know how I would bring that to the public too. With everyone's opinions it was just something I needed to go through for myself so I decided to not even deal with that.'

To do that by the end of the pregnancy the beauty mogul even stopped leaving her house entirely.

She said: 'I stayed in my house and around my neighborhood and then towards the end there would be helicopters every day and I couldn't even leave my [house]; I couldn't even go outside because they were shooting all my deliveries.'

But though her pregnancy was kept private it was still a positive time for the rest of the family.

Her half-sibling Khloe Kardashian - who was expecting her daughter True at the same time - noted: 'Like it was very joyous time in our private life.'

Two more have been proposed.

Looking Glass Rock • Paying up to $600 per night to stay in a tent might not sound like a typical camping experience. But there is little that’s typical with Under Canvas a Montana-based resort company that offers “luxury camping” experiences near the entrances to popular national parks in Utah and elsewhere across the United States.

Guests who visit the resorts can reserve king-size beds in canvas tents perched atop wooden decks with private bathrooms. They might unwind on the “yoga platform” or wander down trails that snake through the peaceful natural landscape. The resorts offer s’mores to guests organize group activities and promote the option to rent out the entire facility for private events.

There are three Under Canvas resorts currently open in Utah — near Lake Powell and the entrances to Zion and Arches national parks — that cost between $250 and $600 per night depending on the resort and time of year. A fourth resort is being planned near Bryce Canyon National Park.

According to critics “glamping” enterprises like Under Canvas which is backed by a multi-billion-dollar private equity firm have found a way to sell accommodations at luxury hotel prices while bypassing zoning safety and fire mitigation standards that may apply to similarly sized and priced hotels all while putting pressure on remote areas outside of developed towns and cities.

Under Canvas development proposed near Canyonlands

The most recent development to be announced by the company which will be the fifth Under Canvas resort in the state if it opens after the Bryce Canyon location is in a remote part of San Juan County 25 miles south of Moab near Canyonlands National Park. The proposed 220-acre 75-tent resort abuts a popular rock climbing and recreation area known as Looking Glass Rock. The plan to develop the area has generated strong opposition in the weeks since it was made public last month sparking a petition drive signed by over 2350 people along with 650 comments.

“The opposition comes from being exasperated at what is happening to our community and our lands near our home” said Dailey Haren a lifelong Moab resident who started the petition. “We’ve watched one special place after another being lost to commercial interests.”

(Zak Podmore | The Salt Lake Tribune) Looking Glass Rock a remote arch long popular with hikers and rock climbers is a quarter mile from the proposed site of a 75-unit luxury camping development in northern San Juan County. June 14 2021.

Looking Glass Rock features a deep arch that has long attracted hikers picnickers and climbers. Dan McBrearty chief development officer of Under Canvas said that there has been “significant misinformation” shared on social media since the development proposal was announced and some commenters incorrectly assumed the entire site would be closed to public access.

“The edge of our planned site is a quarter mile from the rock” he said “leaving plenty of public space to access and continue to enjoy both the rock and perimeter.”

But Haren worries that experience of visiting the impressive arch will be fundamentally changed if a glamping resort is built on adjacent school trust lands even if the rock itself most of which is on Bureau of Land Management land will remain open to the public.

“Looking Glass for a lot of locals represents a part of the community that we still have access to for quiet for solace for peace” she said noting the Moab area has seen an explosion in tourist traffic over recent decades that has brought in sprawling development. “Our landscape is very precious and has inherent value that is much greater than economic value.”

Leasing school trust lands

As is also the case with the Under Canvas resorts near Lake Powell and Bryce Canyon the Looking Glass development will be built on land managed by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) which is mandated by the state to make as much revenue as possible from its 3.4 million acres of holdings in order to help fund Utah’s public schools.

The terms of the glamping leases vary by location but existing Under Canvas contracts pay over $100000 per year to SITLA plus 5% of gross revenues. The land near Looking Glass Rock had previously been leased to ranchers for grazing at a far lower rate and had been open to the public.

(Zak Podmore | The Salt Lake Tribune) Over 70 acres of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) land is slated for development by the ""glamping"" company Under Canvas in northern San Juan County. June 14 2021.

Leasing land from SITLA as opposed to purchasing it McBrearty said is “a mutual opportunity” for the company and the state agency noting “school trust lands designated for development are scattered throughout the state and in some cases are located near the national parks and monuments where our guests are interested in visiting.”

“Luxury camping or glamping continues in popularity but for how long we just don’t know” said Deena Loyola-Merrill a spokesperson for SITLA. “Leases allow the Trust to make a good return while luxury camping is still popular and lucrative. After the lease expires the property will be reclaimed. SITLA will still manage the trust land property and can market the same property for a new economic purpose.”

A ‘very low impact’ resort?

In February SITLA announced through the state’s Resource Development Coordinating Committee that a company had proposed a “a very low impact commercial venture” near Looking Glass Rock “for tourism related purposes.” No further information was made public until the lease was already close to being finalized late last month. SITLA typically withholds the specific details of lease proposals until late in the process so competing companies don’t copy the development plan proposed for a given parcel during the bidding process.

“Under Canvas was deemed the best partner for use of those parcels” Loyola-Merrill said “largely driven by the company’s emphasis on land preservation low impact approach to development focus on allowing everyone to enjoy the outdoors and region and economics.”

The development plan was approved by the San Juan County Planning and Zoning Commission on June 10.

Under Canvas which received a “substantial investment” from the private equity firm KSL Capital Partners in 2018 advertises an experience that “minimizes impact on our environment” and promotes “water conservation” through pull-chain showers and low-flow toilets.

But Haren who works in hospitality and restaurants in Moab and catered a recent event at the Under Canvas facility north of Arches National Park questioned the company’s claims about sustainability and whether the resort would indeed have a “very low impact.”

Each of the 75 tents will have bathrooms and will be individually heated (with wood stoves) and cooled. In addition to the tents the Looking Glass proposal features a central 4000-square-foot restaurant and lobby building. Wastewater will flow settle in septic tanks before liquid waste flows into a buried leach field.

Haren said she was “horrified” after working as a caterer at the private late-night party and seeing the number of people who wandered off-trail through the desert trampling sensitive soil crusts and vegetation.

Multiple current and former Under Canvas employees who talked to The Salt Lake Tribune on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly about the company raised similar concerns and said Under Canvas does not always live up to the image presented on its flashy website and brochures. They also spoke about a prolonged septic system issue at the Under Canvas Moab location.

(Under Canvas/San Juan County Planning and Zoning) The proposed Under Canvas development plan near Looking Glass Rock as presented to San Juan County on May 27 2021.

According to records on file with the Utah Division of Water Quality the septic system at the resort failed last month “causing a large amount of septic water to surface and flow downhill.”

Several former employees said the company knew about the issue for years and failed to address it even as effluent bubbled to the surface of the ground less than a hundred yards from the luxury tents giving off a strong urine smell.

“They’re not as eco-friendly as they try to [appear]” one employee said.

One worker said that water and sewer pipes at the Moab location routinely break in the winter because they are buried close to the surface and graywater often leaks onto the ground under the tents.

McBrearty the Under Canvas executive downplayed the concerns. “An isolated septic issue was discovered earlier this year at our Under Canvas Moab site” he said “while completing routine plumbing maintenance and has been addressed. We took immediate corrective action and have been working in partnership with the county. Under Canvas is committed to maintaining commercial code-approved systems across our camp locations.”

Glamping ordinances and restrictions

Garfield County which overlaps with Bryce Canyon National Park and Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument passed a glamping ordinance in 2019 to address safety concerns related to the trend in new luxury camping developments. The county commissioners noted at the time that hotels are typically built near city services such as fire departments and municipal wastewater plants even in rural areas but the remote location of glamping resorts aren’t always near those amenities.

Under Canvas is not the only luxury camping company with resorts in Utah. Capitol Reef Resort offers stays in covered wagons and teepees for upwards of $300 per night. Amangiri Luxury Hotel and Resort built near Lake Powell on former SITLA land and also backed by KSL Capital Partners charges a whopping $3500 per night during peak season to stay in canvas-ceiling-ed pavilions.

In addition to the leases SITLA has sold numerous parcels near national parks to private entities in recent years including 391 acres of land surrounded by what is now Bears Ears National Monument. Joe Hunt an executive for a medical transportation chain purchased 19 state parcels around the state totaling 5214 acres prior to 2016.

While advocating for the glamping ordinance several years ago Garfield County Commissioner Leeland Pollock a rancher and Republican worried about the trend where remote parcels of SITLA land long used for grazing are sold or leased to private developers. Pollock added he hoped the ordinance could serve as a model in other counties. San Juan County does not currently have a specific glamping ordinance.

As SITLA representatives have repeatedly stated the state trust lands are not public lands and can be sold or leased at any time and luxury camping has a much bigger return for Utah’s public schools than cattle grazing. In a recent interview with the Moab Sun News Bryan Torgerson a resource specialist for SITLA summarized the agency’s mission plainly.

SITLA he said manages “sacred lands that must be used for the sole purpose to generate money.” And at hundreds of dollars per night leasing land to luxury camping companies does just that.

Mississippi lawmakers voted last year to retire a Confederate-themed flag state as part of the national reckoning over protests against law enforcement.

“This I think removes a significant impediment and will change perceptions of Mississippi across this country and across the world” said Anthony Wilson 2020-2021 Mississippi Economic Council chair at the council’s annual meeting in Jackson.

The Mississippi Economic Council was a staunch supporter of the legislature’s decision to surrender the last state banner in the U.S. that included the Confederate battle emblem — a red field topped by a blue X with 13 white stars.

During the November 2020 Election Mississippi voters approved the new state flag with a magnolia and the phrase “In God We Trust.” That flag was officially adopted by the state Legislature this year.

The flag was displayed prominently at the in-person event at the Jackson Convention Complex which drew hundreds of business leaders from across the state. Dozens of small state flags lined a red carpet in front of a stage and podium behind which was displayed another massive state flag.

Wilson who is president and CEO of Mississippi Power a subsidiary of Southern Company said he is filled with pride when he sees people all over Mississippi choosing to fly the new flag.

“I see more state flags today than I ever have in my life” he said. “Without question taking down the controversial state flag was a defining moment for our state.”

Also present at the event was Tribal Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians Cyrus Ben who was one of the nine members selected by Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to serve on the Mississippi State Flag Commission.

Commission members parsed through thousands of designs submitted by the public to chose a final design to put on the November ballot.

Ben said serving on the commission was an honor that gave him a chance to educate people in Mississippi about the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians the state’s only federally recognized Native American tribe.

It’s a perspective that has historically been forgotten or overlooked he said.

“Many are not aware of who we are that we are still alive and thriving here in central Mississippi” he said. The new flag design features a gold star is made of diamond shapes that are significant to the Choctaw culture.

Executive Director of the Mississippi Development Authority John Rounsaville was a panelist at the event. He said the importance of the flag change to a business looking to come to Mississippi depends on the industry.

“On your consumer-facing manufacturers or consumer-facing businesses it can be important — it’s not a major topic of discussion” Rounsaville said. “But when we talk to site consultants and even some companies there have been times when it comes up.”

“I think overall it’s very favorable to the state of Mississippi to have the flag change” he added.

The governor did not specifically mention the flag in his address at the meeting instead focusing on the economic growth in the state during the last year. Reeves said the average capital investment in the state of Mississippi during the last 10 years was $900 million per year. In 2020 it was $1.7 billion he said.

After his speech when asked about the flag and other major factors that contributed to that economic growth Reeves said: “This business community that is represented here today has worked very closely with our administration to remove hurdles and to make Mississippi an even better place to invest capital and create jobs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWZhY3QuY29tL2ZhY3RjaGVja3MvMjAyMS9qdW4vMjcvcm9kbmV5LWRhdmlzL25vLXNvdXRoZXJuLWlsbGlub2lzLXByYWlyaWUtc3RhdGUtbm90LW5hdGlvbnMtY2xlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No Prairie State is not the nation's 'cleanest' coal plant,"As Republican operatives were dropping U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis's name as the next potential rival to run against Gov. J.B. Pritzker the GOP congressman was in southern Illinois visiting a coal plant that could get shut down if the governor gets his way.

Davis used the visit to criticize the governor’s support for a sweeping energy plan that could shutter every coal-fired power plant in Illinois by 2035 an idea many opponents lambast as one that will kill jobs and hike rates.

Davis called on Pritzker a Democrat to spare the Prairie State Energy Campus in Marissa located south of East St. Louis. The plant provides power to municipalities in eight states including a swath of Davis’ 13th Congressional District.

""The municipally owned Prairie State power plant is the cleanest coal-fired power plant in the nation"" he said during his June 18 visit. ""The company is actively pursuing and adopting additional carbon sequestration and storage and emissions-reducing technologies and they should receive support from state and federal agencies for their efforts.""

One of Prairie State Energy Campus’ two power units was selected in 2019 as the site of a U.S. Department of Energy-backed carbon capture research project slated for completion at the end of 2021. But federal data show the plant has been one of the nation’s 10 biggest emitters of heat-trapping carbon dioxide a fact recently highlighted by the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune.

While experts say there are multiple ways to evaluate which coal plants are the ""cleanest"" beyond total CO2 emissions — which tend to single out the power plants producing the most electricity — Prairie State ranked nowhere near the top based on any of the yardsticks we found to measure it.

Davis’ office did not respond to calls or emails requesting comment.

Not the ‘cleanest’ by any major metric

Defining how ""clean"" a coal plant is depends on whom you ask — and when according to experts.

""‘Clean coal’ has been this sort of amorphous term that has meant whatever people want it to mean and it's changed over time"" said Daniel Cohan a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University.

Before climate change gained significant attention Cohan and other experts said coal plants were generally judged by their emission of regulated air pollutants causing smog and acid rain such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).

Amid growing concern over climate change however experts said there’s a case for including CO2 emissions in the conversation about which plants are the ""cleanest.""

To compare Prairie State’s emissions against other power plants Cohan pointed us to data published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency showing how much of a given gas or pollutant power plants emit per unit of electricity they generate.

In 2019 the latest year for which this data was available Prairie State Generating Station ranked 169th of 306 coal plants in the nation with EPA data for CO2 emission rates. Its ranking for its SO2 emission rate was roughly the same.

Prairie State performed better when it came to its NOx emission rate — placing 37th — but still nowhere near the top.

""By no means is this a clean power plant"" Cohan said referencing the EPA data. ""It’s still a substantial contributor to air pollution and climate change.""

Calling Prairie State the cleanest coal plant in the country he added ""would be absurd.""

Emily Grubert an energy systems researcher and professor at Georgia Tech agreed. ""It’s not the cleanest by any reasonable metric"" she said.

Our ruling

Davis said the Prairie State power plant is ""the cleanest"" coal-fired power plant in the nation.

His office did not respond to our inquiry asking for evidence to back that up.

Experts told us there are multiple metrics by which to assess how ""clean"" a coal plant is but federal data shows Prairie State does not come out at or near the top on any of them.

Four people were taken to hospital after experiencing turbulence on a Southwest Airlines flight into Salt Lake City Utah on Friday.

Southwest flight 1753 was approaching Salt Lake City Utah after departing from Chicago Midway International Airport around 2:30 p.m. when the incident occurred.

The airline told Insider in a statement: ""Southwest Flight 1753 in its approach to Salt Lake City this Friday afternoon (after flying from Chicago Midway) experienced moderate turbulence. Fasten seat belt signage was illuminated when the aircraft encountered the turbulence.""

It added: ""Our initial reports indicate that following an uneventful landing of the aircraft three flight attendants and one customer were treated for minor injuries.""

Upon landing those who suffered injuries were taken to Jordan Valley West Hospital in West Valley City airport spokesperson Nancy Volmer told KUTV.

This is not the first time Southwest Airlines has made headlines in recent months. Earlier in June the airline grounded all of its flights in the contiguous US airspace due to an issue with its computer systems.

And in May a Southwest Airlines flight attendant reportedly lost two teeth after a passenger allegedly assaulted her according to a letter that a flight-attendant union sent to the company's CEO Gary Kelly.

Southwest Airlines facing operational meltdown

Looking at published data Southwest Airlines has either canceled or delayed nearly 4000 flights over a three day period (and counting) with no end in sight to these issues. Here’s how many cancelations and delays we’ve seen from Southwest between Friday and today:

On Friday June 25 2021 Southwest canceled 254 flights (6% of the schedule) and delayed 1575 flights (42% of the schedule)

On Saturday June 26 2021 Southwest canceled 307 flights (9% of the schedule) and delayed 1440 flights (42% of the schedule)

On Sunday June 27 20217 Southwest canceled 38 flights (1% of the schedule) and delayed 308 flights (8% of the schedule)

I would imagine the number of cancelations and delays will continue to grow as the day goes on. While cancelations seem to be more under control today than yesterday I would expect that we’ll probably see 1000+ delays again today (Sunday). I’d hope that the schedule stabilizes a bit as the week starts but given what a busy week it will be for travel I’m skeptical.

While Southwest is rebooking people as much as possible many passengers are finding that the next flight with availability is only a couple of days later. This comes as we’re seeing a record number of travelers since the start of the pandemic with domestic flights being just about as full as they were pre-pandemic.

What’s the cause of Southwest’s cancelations?

Officially a Southwest Airlines spokesperson blames these cancelations on the weather and air traffic control:

“To proactively manage our operation we implemented a scheduled reduction ahead of expected storms and probable air traffic control initiatives.”

In all likelihood that doesn’t tell the full story and certainly doesn’t explain roughly half of flights being either delayed or canceled for the past couple of days (especially when you consider other airlines aren’t having issues to this extent). While weather definitely contributed to delays and cancelations the much bigger cause is likely the extent to which airlines’ operations are being pushed to the limits right now.

Many major carriers in the United States are short staffed across various roles from pilots to rampers. Airlines are obviously excited about the sudden surge in demand for travel and went about setting up their summer schedules in an optimistic way. Clearly Southwest was a bit too optimistic and we’re seeing the impacts of that right now.

When things go wrong in the airline industry there tends to be a domino effect. So yes on some level weather has contributed to these issues. But what we’re seeing at Southwest goes beyond that.

Bottom line

Southwest Airlines is either canceling or delaying thousands of flights. On Friday 48% of Southwest flights were either delayed or canceled which yesterday 51% of Southwest flights were either delayed or canceled — that’s terrible. While this is officially being blamed on weather it clearly also reflects the extent to which Southwest’s operation is being pushed to the limit right now.

Caution: Southwest Airlines Cancels Or Delays Flights In Latest Meltdown

On Friday Southwest cancelled 246 flights and delayed 1427 flights roughly 45% of its overall schedule.

So far today Southwest has cancelled 113 flights though that number is expected to significantly rise.

A Southwest spokesperson blamed the weather:

“To proactively manage our operation we implemented a scheduled reduction ahead of expected storms and probable air traffic control initiatives.”

But could a pilot shortage also be at play?

Whatever the reason for the delay many passengers are finding themselves stranded and unable to reach Southwest. A sampling of Twitter complaints includes:

@SouthwestAir Why would you cancel all the flights you offer today and reschedule me in the evening the next day? Essentially causing me to lose a full day and half. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #SouthwestAirlines — Nathaniel Wyrick (@nathanielwyrick) June 25 2021

Furious @SouthwestAir. Woke up to a text that my flight today (in 4 hours) was cancelled and I was rebooked on a flight 2 days from now. Would mean missing the reason for my trip- my only nephew’s 1st birthday. — Dr. Michelle Silver (@mich_silver) June 25 2021

@SouthwestAir please count your days. Canceled my flight without any explanation and hung up me now on hold for over an hour #stupid pic.twitter.com/IXxSN0sX2i — F. O. C. U. S. (@Montae_1996) June 25 2021

Traveling two days later for vacations that have been planned for weeks or months really does not help. Nor does a refund since last-minute tickets on other carriers are likely to be significantly higher than tickets booked early with Southwest.

If you are traveling on Southwest this weekend keep your eyes closely on your reservations. In case of a cancellation attempt to quickly rebook online or on the Southwest app. If your preferred flight is not available keep checking as seats are booked and cancelled all the time.

CONCLUSION

First American Airlines now Southwest Airlines. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst this weekend. If you’re traveling on Southwest today or tomorrow I wish you all the best.

picks back up due to reduced COVID restrictions and the economy reopening. Southwest hopes to implement the wage increase by August.

Southwest Airlines is hiking its minimum wage to $15 an hour as travel inches back towards pre-pandemic levels.

""Southwest continually works to attract and retain the best candidates for open positions"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to Insider. ""As part of this ongoing effort Southwest is increasing minimum pay rates so that all hourly employees will make at least $15 per hour.""

More than 7000 current employees will see bigger paychecks as a result of the wage hike Southwest said. The airline added that it will aim for the boost to take effect by August 1 but that some of its work groups will need to negotiate to implement the change.

The wage bump will affect reservations agents baggage and cargo handlers and customer service employees among others according to Bloomberg which was first to report the news . The change will spell out an additional $1.30 an hour on average Bloomberg reports.

The announcement comes in the midst of renewed interest in travel thanks to reduced coronavirus restrictions and the reopening of the economy. It also closely follows a prediction from Southwest CEO Gary Kelly that the carrier likely doesn't have enough planes to keep up with demand in 2022 and 2023. The airline has enough staff to carry it through the summer Southwest's vice president of labor relations Russell McCrady told Bloomberg.

Southwest is the latest company to struggle finding workers to fill open jobs at existing wage levels. Big names like Amazon McDonald's and JBS are among those trying to draw new employees with promises of signup bonuses increased pay and other incentives. Costco boosted its minimum wage to $16 an hour in February. In the same month Walmart announced it would raise wages for 425000 workers although its minimum starting wage would remain $11 an hour."

Starbucks workers say the chain is letting too many customers place orders on its app.

They say some stores don't have the capacity to keep up with demand.

Starbucks also allows unlimited drink modifications via its app which staff say they're sick of.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

As well as racing to bring down drive-thru times and navigating maskless customers Starbucks workers are facing another challenge: mobile orders.

Customers have turned to the Starbucks app during the pandemic because it allows them to order in advance and without any face-to-face interaction. Some baristas say this has left them swamped with mobile orders which now make up more than a quarter of its US transactions.

""The whole mobile order system is really bad"" Nat El-Hai a former Beverly Hills Starbucks barista told Insider.

Current and former staff told Insider that the chain is letting too many customers place orders on its app and it doesn't have enough staff demand causing delays for in-store customers.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Insider that this was ""not illustrative of the customer and partner experience in a majority of our stores.""

Mobile orders start trickling through as soon as her North Carolina store opens at 5 a.m. barista Sarah Ann Austin said. One former New York barista said most of their store's sales were mobile orders and that they could get more than seven a minute during busy times.

El-Hai said her store would often be swamped with walk-in and drive-thru customers and was ""chronically understaffed."" She said staff were told they couldn't turn mobile ordering off however.

A former barista from Long Beach California said that before the pandemic when the store was too busy management sometimes used to turn off the point-of-sale system used for mobile ordering and pretend that the server was down.

Customers expect rapid service and heavily modified drinks

Customers get an estimated collection time when they order on the app. A Starbucks spokesperson told Insider that this helped to stagger arrivals based on how long drinks take to make.

But El-Hai and Austin said that many customers placed their app orders on their way to the store and didn't give enough time for staff to prepare their drinks. They were angry if they had to wait the barista said. Some customers even placed orders on the app after arriving at the store El-Hai said.

On the other hand some customers were very late to collect their orders but would ""get mad"" if the baristas had thrown their drinks away El-Hai said. A former Los Angeles barista said staff sometimes had to remake drinks if they were cold or had melted by the time customers arrived.







At times the app sometimes didn't update when ingredients ran out in the store meaning people would order drinks that couldn't be made El-Hai said. Mobile-order refunds could only be carried out on the app which could be slow ""and people get really upset with you"" El-Hai said.

""It's not set up the way it needs to be"" Stephanie a barista in British Columbia Canada said. She told Insider that sometimes the app didn't reflect when the chain's collectable coffee cups were out of stock.

The Starbucks spokesperson said: ""The app shows what is available in each location and the stores turn it on and off. It is accurate and it says what it has available.""

The workers also said that customers were taking advantage of the unlimited modifications available through mobile ordering. One shift supervisor in Maryland said some customers added modifications ""just because they're there.""

They added: ""People can make drink combinations that not only aren't intuitive but also just don't make sense.""

El-Hai shared a photo with Insider of a drink she had made for a mobile order customer who had asked for 12 shots of coffee alongside five shots of hazelnut syrup in an iced latte.

They added that staff were sick of making so-called ""TikTok"" drinks which are inspired by viral trends and not limited to mobile orders.

Other workers told Insider that these drinks slowed down drive-thru times and made customers angry when they weren't made perfectly. They said that the company should cut down the number of modifications allowed.

Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Co. announced Friday that a Starbucks will be in the office building under construction at the west end of Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.

The Starbucks location will be operated by AVI Foodsystems based in Warren. The coffee shop is expected to be open later this year and will have a football theme that matches other parts of the planned development.

The Constellation Center for Excellence is part of the $300 million second phase of development at Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls.

Starbucks is the first announced tenant at the four-story office building. Hall of Fame Resort is working with commercial real estate firm CBRE to seek tenants for the building which has up to 40000 square feet of office space along with retail space.

The company expects to announce additional tenants in the coming months said Anne Graffice executive vice president for public affairs. The building is being marketed as a sports and research facility.

Still in the works for the second phase is a 180-room Hilton Tapestry hotel a football-themed water park and a retail promenade. Work on those buildings is supposed to begin this year and most of it should be finished by the end of 2022 the company has said.

Graffice said the company is locking in financing for the remaining construction projects.

""Given our environment we're feeling very good about the process"" she said adding that the company has capital in place to keep building.

In recent months construction has focused on building infrastructure — such as waterlines sewers and other utilities — as well as preparing the property for construction.

The coronavirus pandemic has bogged down the development Graffice said. She noted that steel for the new construction projects has been ordered but is being delayed because of supply issues that developed during the pandemic.

Starbucks joins other national brands as part of the retail mix planned for Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls. The Don Shula’s restaurant chain and Topgolf Swing Suites already have signed on for space for the 82000-square-foot retail center which will stretch between the hotel and the Constellation Center for Excellence.

The first phase of Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls included construction of the stadium and several youth football fields south of McKinley high school.

Redevelopment of the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in downtown Canton was part of the second phase as is the Center for Excellence. When that building is finished Hall of Fame Resort officials expect it will serve as ""an innovative hub"" for tenants ""dedicated to improving professional football player health and the mind and body through research and technology.""

A third construction phase estimated at $300 million is in the planning stages and scheduled to start after the second phase is completed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJhZS5jb20vMjAyMS82L3N0YXJidWNrcy1qYXBhbi00Ny1uZXctZnJhcHB1Y2Npbm9zLWRyaW5rcy1mbGF2b3JzLTI1dGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Japan Releases 47 New Frappuccinos,"Starbucks first arrived in Japan’s Ginza neighborhood 25 years ago and since then it has expanded to 1600 outlets across the country serving more than five million customers a week.

The shooting was reported at about 11 p.m. near the Circle A Convenience store at 1300 South State St. according to dispatches.

An ambulance escorted by several police cruisers raced up State Street away from the scene and toward Upstate University Hospital about 10 minutes after the shooting was reported.

Another person was reported to have arrived at Upstate University Hospital in a personal vehicle with a bullet wound to the leg about five minutes after the shooting on South State Street was reported according to dispatches.

Police were searching the area near the intersection of South State Street and East Raynor Avenue with flashlights. That area was also closed off with police tape.

Five police cruisers and two crime scene investigation vans were parked near the scene.

A Syracuse police spokesperson was not immediately available to comment on the shooting or either person’s condition.

Urban farms in St. Louis work on a solution • Missouri Independent,"Straw hat in hand Tyrean “Heru” Lewis jumped out of his pickup truck along busy Shackelford Road in North St. Louis County and walked into the treeline where he had something special to show.

On the other side uniform rows of vegetables — lettuce radishes and bok choy — sprouted on half an acre. The land is not on a remote country farm but just 17 miles from the Delmar Loop in the heart of the city. As Lewis founder of Heru Urban Farming checks the crop he gets excited about its progress raising his voice over the sound of traffic.

As he talks he describes the need he has seen in St. Louis his hometown the neighborhoods where many children don’t have enough healthy food to eat and where the nearest fresh vegetable can be miles away.

He has also seen how gun violence has become a fact of everyday life in these same neighborhoods. As a health teacher he saw one of his students go to prison for a shooting. As a resident he hears gunshots daily around his home and three or four people get killed in his neighborhood every year.

This story is part of a series The Kansas City Star and its partners across the state are producing this year focusing on public health issues that contribute to gun violence. These include income housing food security schools and living environments. The effort is undertaken as part of the Missouri Gun Violence Project a two-year statewide solutions journalism collaboration supported by the nonprofits Report for America and the Missouri Foundation for Health. The Star has partnered in the project with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the Springfield News-Leader and The Missouri Independent.

“I mean that’s normal to some people and unfortunately to me” he said.

Researchers say a host of factors contribute to a city’s gun violence problem — what they define as deficits in social determinants of health such as income housing healthy living environments and quality education.

And food insecurity.

Lacking a complex nutritional diet can harm brain development in childhood according to public health experts. That can cause later problems dealing with peers handling authority and responding to situations of extreme stress.

The problems facing areas that experience gun violence are many Lewis acknowledges but he has also seen the impact that food can have.

“I’ve seen the difference in kids when they get a meal and when they don’t get a meal how they behave and how they focus in school” he said. “So I truly believe that’s all connected.”

Nearly 70% of the city’s 271 homicides last year occurred in low income census tracts without access to a grocery store or supermarket for at least half a mile according to a Kansas City Star analysis of federal data and police reports.

Fifty-two of the killings occurred in just eight census tracts on the north side of the city with no grocery store for a mile.

St. Louis leads the state in gun violence and for most of the past decade ranked No. 1 for food insecurity — the lack of reliable access to healthy food.

But it’s not just an urban problem. Southeastern counties in or near Missouri’s Bootheel region currently lead the state in food insecurity federal data show. And four of the 10 counties with the highest rates of gun deaths sit in the far southeastern corner of the state: Wayne Reynolds Pemiscot and Carter.

Food insecurity across an entire community can lead to higher rates of health problems including mental health according to researchers. That long-term stress can increase suicides and confrontations that lead to gun violence.

Scarcity of fresh and healthy food in communities is a critical public health issue said Dr. Fredrick Echols director of the St. Louis City Department of Health.

“It’s not just about interrupting acts of violence or preventing acts of violence but it’s really about creating change in the trajectory of the lives of the individuals that are considered high-risk in those communities” he said. “Essential wraparound services — such as mental and behavioral health utility assistance mortgage and rental assistance and food — those are some of the things that a lot of people oftentimes take for granted and are really the key things that are necessary to change the environment for individuals.”

A few years ago Lewis decided he could be part of the solution.

“A lightbulb went off in my head” he said. “There’s a need here a demand here so why can’t I be the one that supplies it?”

Other urban farmers had the same idea.

A grassroots ecosystem of Black urban growers farmers markets entrepreneurs and community leaders has sprung up in St. Louis to increase production and access to affordable fresh produce in their communities. Their mission: to create a self-sustaining and economically beneficial food infrastructure for residents.

They’re tilling and planting vacant lots backyards and school gardens. Their fresh produce is going to community-owned businesses and families in need. And they’re finding ways to fund and train the next generation of farmers and entrepreneurs from within their neighborhoods.

Freshman state Rep. Kimberly Ann Collins a Democrat whose district makes up the middle of north St. Louis City introduced a bill to directly aid the efforts of the urban farmers in her district.

The bill created a tax incentive and financial support for growers converting vacant lots into gardens. Recent St. Louis Land Redevelopment Authority data shows that about 96% of vacant lots for rent or sale are found in eight wards spanning the northern half of the city.

For Collins a resident of the Ville neighborhood this issue hits close to home.

“I have the highest rates of obesity diabetes right here in the city of St. Louis just because of where we live because we don’t have access to fresh food” Collins said.

“The convenience stores that are in our neighborhoods don’t have the apples and bananas; the convenience stores in our neighborhoods have all of the processed foods that you can get.”

The measure sailed unopposed through the Missouri House’s Agricultural Policy Committee — a Republican dominated body. No one from either party opposed the bill.

The choice to support the bill was not difficult said Rep. Don Rone a Portageville Republican and chair of the committee.

“When you did the math on the size of the lots and everything there was over 400 acres of vacant lots in the city of St. Louis” he said. “So this would enable those people in those neighborhoods to raise their own vegetables and have a source for fresh vegetables that they would normally not have. And it would absolutely improve the looks of the city also — it’s basically a no-brainer.”

However the measure died on the last day of the regular legislative session when Senate Republicans refused to return to the floor to vote on remaining bills.

“We will get it across the finish line if the other end of the building does their job next year” Rone said. “It will come through my committee again it will pass. I will tell you it will pass unanimously because everybody is for it.”

But the growers at work in St. Louis aren’t waiting for the state to act.

Same store different food

Farming wasn’t something Lewis planned to get into.

For a decade he taught physical education in St. Louis schools until a run-in with the stark inequality of food access in the city changed the trajectory of his life.

In 2017 he went to his nearest grocery store — a mile from his home — to buy the ingredients for a vegan meal. But he didn’t find what he wanted.

“I wasn’t really happy with what I saw there wasn’t a good variety to pick from” he said. “It (the produce) actually looked kind of sickening.”

He traveled a little farther from his home to another location of the same grocery store chain. The quality and quantity of fresh produce there was slightly better but not by much. So he drove even farther out of the city into the suburbs of West St. Louis County.

The farther from his home he went the better the quality of food.

“It was a shock” he said. “Why does the same grocery store look totally different the further deeper you go into the suburbs than when you’re in the inner city where food deserts or food apartheids are at? That was a problem.”

His solution? First he planted a garden in his backyard. Then Lewis 38 quit his job and became a farmer.

From expanding his garden to vacant lots across the street to leasing larger plots of land on Shackelford Road and elsewhere Lewis expanded his operation to grow food full time.

Financing from grants have helped Lewis said and last year he produced 200000 pounds of produce.

He expanded his business by selling subscriptions to customers who for a total cost of about $500 receive weekly deliveries from his farm during a three-month growing season.

About 20 customers have signed up so far he said.

For every five subscriptions he sells he donates one to a family in need. Everything he grows in his first garden by his home he says he gives away to people in his community.

His neighborhood Kingsway West a mile north of Delmar Boulevard is considered food insecure by the U.S. Department of Agriculture because there is no supermarket within a half-mile. Instead it is surrounded by corner stores and gas stations.

Most of the city’s food insecure neighborhoods are north of Delmar.

Eight of the 10 census tracts without a grocery store within a mile were in the north federal data from 2019 showed.

The “Delmar Divide” — a line along Delmar Boulevard that cuts the city north and south along racial and economic lines — is a key to understanding where and why food insecurity is concentrated said Jessica Meyers project director at the St. Louis Area Violence Prevention Commission.

“North of that we see areas that have had systematic disadvantages whether it’s redlining or closing of businesses” she said. “Policies that have kind of gutted these neighborhoods including taking away access to healthy and nutritious food.”

What Lewis found in grocery stores in St. Louis also has been true in Kansas City a Star report in 2018 found. Many stores east of Troost Avenue lack healthy food so residents often had to travel to more affluent areas in the western half of the city to find fresh produce.

Helping Black farmers

Anyone driving through the Walnut Park East neighborhood in St. Louis might miss the clearing at the intersection with rows of purple cabbage spinach and newly sprouting beets hidden by tall grass. But it’s where you can find Tosha Phonix almost every day during the spring and summer growing season.

On a Tuesday afternoon in mid-May Phonix repeated her daily ritual: checking in on her vegetable garden on a vacant lot in the northwest St. Louis neighborhood.

Phonix’s work in food justice started almost a decade ago. However it wasn’t until she started as the food justice organizer with the Missouri Coalition for the Environment in 2018 that she saw the impact she could have she said.

Last year she left her job with the coalition to co-launch EVOLVE where her primary role is to raise grant dollars to help Black farmers like Lewis throughout the state get the financing and equipment they need to jump-start their own growing ventures.

“I realized that one there was no food justice movement here in St. Louis. And then two that Black farmers and growers weren’t getting the resources they needed to grow food for their communities” she said. “So I kind of took on the fight for you know resources and getting resources to Black farmers and growers in north city and throughout the Missouri region.”

The concentration of food inequity in certain communities does not happen by accident she said. Disinvestment in certain neighborhoods as well as the difficulty Black farmers have had getting the capital to start farming has exacerbated the situation in St. Louis Phonix said.

Food justice activists call the disparities in food access a “food apartheid” — a term coined by Black activists and farmers to describe the root causes that leave communities unable to access fresh healthy foods — rejecting the passive phrase “food desert.”

Walnut Park East where Phonix’s garden is located is a low income census tract where a significant number of residents don’t have access to a supermarket for at least one mile. The corner stores and markets in the community are stocked with packaged and processed foods with the produce section often consisting of small bins limited variety and aged produce.

The neighborhood has also struggled with high rates of gun violence.

In 2020 the area reported 10 homicides according to St. Louis Police Department data. Adjacent Walnut Park West tied another neighborhood in the city for the highest number of homicides last year at 15.

The gun violence in the neighborhoods has gotten worse in recent years residents said with sounds of gunshots and instances of firearm violence dramatically increasing.

Police data reflects their observations. In 2015 Walnut Park East and Walnut Park West reported a combined seven homicides.

The city’s department of health launched an anti-violence program targeting the Walnut Park neighborhood in January. Preliminary data shows that firearm homicides aggravated assaults and robberies are on track to be reduced by 50% since the program’s start said Echols the city health department director.

Farmers markets mobile providers

Across the city from Phonix’s garden in the Hyde Park neighborhood nestled against Interstate 70 one of the only weekly farmers markets in north St. Louis City launched in May.

What started as one urban farmer and a couple of vendors a month ago has grown to include multiple produce stands artisans a bi-weekly yoga class and stretching exercises on the lawn said Fatimah Muhammad founder and chair of the Hyde Park neighborhood association.

A retired business woman who moved from St. Louis County to north St. Louis City to work in the community Muhammad launched the weekly market as a way for local growers to make a profit by selling their goods while providing fresh produce to the community at affordable prices.

The historic neighborhood shows the typical signs of a community that has lost residents throughout the decades: vacant homes and closing schools. And as the population decreased the disinvestment in the community grew so when grocery stores closed they didn’t re-open said Muhammad.

For her the farmers market also acts as a way to rebuild the community bonds that have disintegrated over the years. Those bonds can deter crime and make the neighborhood safer.

“I mean if you go back to childhood…if I did something five blocks away by the time I got home my mother knew because the neighbors knew who I was and who my parents were” she said. “And so that communication is one of the biggest voids that we’re missing in urban communities.”

But the lack of access to affordable fresh healthy food is not isolated to a couple of neighborhoods in the city it’s widespread.

Of all census tracts in St. Louis City about half are considered food insecure without access to a supermarket or grocery store for at least half a mile.

One nonprofit St. Louis MetroMarket is trying to bridge the gap with its mobile market. In six years it has become a staple in many St. Louis neighborhoods that lack access to fresh produce. Fully stocked with fresh fruit and vegetables and supplemented by items like Amish honey from Bowling Green in Pike County the bus is effectively a small community grocer on wheels.

Their stops are intentionally designed to be in areas without access to a grocery store or supermarket for miles said Quinton Ward executive director.

“With the lack of access you’re talking about this larger thing — you’re talking about systems that have not worked in a very long time” Ward said. “What is the walking distance between yourself and a grocery store? But then also there’s the affordability aspect — you can have multiple grocery stores around you but if you don’t have the resources to be able to buy those things it doesn’t matter because you’re priced out.”

The nonprofit’s staff regularly go in person to hand-select fruits and vegetables from wholesale providers making it possible to sell items at a reduced price. For example a bunch of kale is sold for about 50 cents.

City state help

For urban farms to prosper and make an impact in St. Louis they’ll need investment from city and state officials advocates said.

The state legislature passed several bills related to food insecurity in the past session two of which were sponsored by Rep. Ian Mackey a Democrat from St. Louis.

One of his bills extended a pilot program that allowed SNAP recipients to use their benefits at participating farmers’ markets — a program Mackey said was immensely successful with close to $1 million utilized over three years.

Another bill established a Food Security Task Force a group with 22 members — composed of academics food advocates representatives from faith-based institutions and food retailers — that would study the causes impact and solutions for food insecurity throughout the state.

The legislation is still waiting to be signed by the governor who has until Aug. 28 to either sign or veto it before it defaults to law.

“We really want to connect the dots between our urban poverty and our rural poverty and try to figure out you know what other states are doing” Mackey said. “The states that border us even the red states don’t suffer with this quite to the extent that we do.”

Missouri follows only Arkansas as the most food insecure state in the region according to Feeding America’s 2019 data.

Other bills did not make it to the governor’s desk including Collins’ push to incentivize gardens in vacant lots and a measure to offer tax credits to businesses willing to reopen grocery stores that closed in food deserts.

Tackling food insecurity can’t happen in a vacuum said Democratic U.S. Rep. Cori Bush whose district covers St. Louis and who has supported bills that deal with both gun violence and food insecurity.

“In St. Louis we don’t have the luxury of dividing our social problems into neat categories such as food insecurity housing discrimination gun violence wage stagnation incarceration or climate destruction” she said. “Our communities are impacted by all of it and all of the issues feed into one another.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF1Z3VzdGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNi8yNS9zdC1hdWd1c3RpbmVzLW9sZGVzdC1yZWNvcmQtc3RvcmUtbXVzaWMtbWF0dGVycy1nZXRzLW5ldy1vd25lci81MzM1ODIzMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Augustine's oldest record store Music Matters gets new owner,"Renee Unsworth

Correspondent

Music Matters St. Augustine’s oldest record store has a new owner and a new name: Music Matters Remixed. Eric Wenstrom was “passed the torch” about six months ago by original owner Casey Kelber who opened the store in 1989.

Wenstrom turns 50 in November and has been shopping at Music Matters since it opened. He remained a loyal customer over the years stopping in to buy music every time he returned to town to visit his mom.

Wenstrom was furloughed during the COVID pandemic in 2020 and called Kelber at Music Matters to “order a curbside music pickup” when Kelber handed him a yellow paper flyer stating that the business was for sale.

An avid music fan and music memorabilia collector Wenstrom said he went back to his mom and asked her what she thought about him buying the store and moving back to St. Augustine. After a long career in hospitality at theme parks he decided it was time to go after his dream of owning his very own music store.

But what Wenstrom soon realized was it’s not just about his dream but about his responsibility to the St. Augustine community and customers who have been shopping at the store for more than 30 years. He says regular customers stop in weekly and thank him for buying the store and bringing in more vinyl more vintage collectibles more new inventory.

And how important is it in today’s digital age to be able flip through vinyl records and CDs?

“Sure technology is amazing and everything these days is available at the click of an app (or in my day the drop of a hat) and that is all well and good until something like COVID comes along and takes everything away except that little miracle device in your hands” Wenstrom said.

“It’s only then when so many people realized what was really missing these days is interacting with each other especially in connection with music.”

His immediate goal was to “create an environment reminiscent of days gone by a gathering place open to all to come and celebrate music together.”

Wenstrom explains that “Music Matters Remixed has been revitalized to be able to fully encompass the term ‘record shop’ once again.”

Every inch of the space from floor to ceiling is a tribute to music of all genres. The vintage music posters on the walls are from Wenstrom’s personal collection with the majority from the 1980s and early 1990s.

Vinyl albums are displayed in wooden peach crates throughout the store. Customers can easily flip through the well-organized crates to find vintage vinyl or the newest offerings which Wenstrom brings in each week.

“We carry a large selection of vintage out-of-print and hard-to-acquire records as well as current new releases and repackaging of the classics. The shop also offers domestic and import pressings on all formats including many limited-edition releases and collector sets” Wenstrom explained.

“You will also find cassettes; T-shirts; posters; Funko Pops (toys based on pop culture characters); comic books; stickers; incense; action figures; magazines; DVDs; and St. Augustine’s largest and most diverse inventory still available on compact disc.”

Also available: turntables; guitars; keyboards; ukulele; harmonicas; and music accessories.

Wenstrom invites the community and its visitors to stop by and see all the new updates.

A grand relaunch party will take place from noon to 5 p.m. Saturday June 26 at Music Matters Remixed in Riverside Plaza next to Hobby Lobby at 196 State Road 16. The event will feature live music by local musician Amy Hendrickson and friends along with merchandise giveaways area artisans and vendors and storewide sales.

“The shop has been completely reorganized making for a seamless and enjoyable one-stop shopping experience with keeping the vinyl platform in the forefront of the new experience” Wenstrom said.

“Most importantly the shop has been redesigned to have a warm and inviting vibe of record stores of days past — a place to meet with friends and enjoy the afternoon. We want to bring back that sense of community having a safe and welcoming place to come together and share the gift of music.”

Wenstrom said he was bullied as a child and teenager and that music literally saved him. It was his therapy at the time and continues to have healing power.

“I suppose it helps all of us. It allows us to feel to think to dream to have hope and to believe in love” he said. “It’s a universal language that casts a spell that binds us all together. Music leads us on a beautifully unique journey that helps us find ourselves at the core of our innermost vibration. … I owe so much of who I am to music.”

Some of his favorites include the bands he grew up with in the ’80s: Dead or Alive; A-ha; Depeche Mode; The Smiths; Stevie Nicks; Blondie; Culture Club; The Cure; Yazoo; Enya; Cyndi Lauper; Duran Duran; Billy Idol; Ministry; Pet Shop Boys; Heart; Bern; Missing Persons; Book of Love; and the list goes on …

Wenstrom remembers his first visits to a music store in the Ponce de Leon Mall in the mid-1980s called Music Land.

“I only had $20 to spend for the weekend and that was a lot for us back then. I know I needed money for a movie and food and with those things in consideration I only could afford one of the two albums I was holding in my hands. It pained me to know that I had to leave one behind because they were equally important to me” he remembers.

“I can clearly remember a young 15-year-old me boldly declaring to the universe that ‘one day I’m going to own the whole store and I’ll never have to choose just one ever again’ … well it only took me 35 years.”

In a rematch of the last MIAA Div. 1 North championship game played in 2019 the Eagles settled the score with Lincoln-Sudbury defeating the Warriors 12-6 on Saturday at Glatz Field.

“I was on the scout team then” said St. John’s junior Tommy Sarni who scored three goals for the Eagles on Saturday. “Still I was there with the team. We had this circled on our calendars.”

St. John’s Prep (16-1) will play the winner of Sunday’s South final between Franklin and BC High for the Div. 1 state title on Wednesday.

L-S the 2019 state champion finished its season at 12-3. In the 2019 meeting with the Eagles the Warriors prevailed 10-6.

“Lincoln-Sudbury has been the class of Massachusetts lacrosse for the last 15 years” said St. John’s coach John Pynchon. “Brian (Vonna the Lincoln-Sudbury coach) does an incredible job. We talked a lot about what happened two years ago. “

The Eagles got off to a strong start scoring the first five goals before L-S got on the board with 8:49 left in the second quarter on a goal from David Herlihy. Luke Surrette scored twice in the first quarter while Patrick Atkins and Jimmy Ayers also scored giving the Eagles a 4-0 advantage at the end of the quarter.

Surrette’s second goal which he scored with 5:20 left in the quarter came after the Warriors almost scored their first goal. Lincoln-Sudbury’s Hayden Donley gained possession of the ball in the L-S defensive end and raced downfield. About 10 yards in front of the Eagles’ goal he shot and the ball went off the crossbar. Michael Ayers got the rebound and passed to Sarni who set up Surrette’s goal.

“That was a big momentum play” Pynchon said. “We had a four-on-three and we were able to get the ball downfield.

“L-S plays very aggressively. Those kids just all go 100 mph. They’re big and athletic. We just had to be sure that their aggressiveness didn’t take us out of what we do. It was like Bruce Lee saying ‘Be like water.’ If they were going to play fast we’d be ready for it. If they were going to slow down we’d be ready.”

By halftime the Eagles held a 6-2 advantage with goals from Jimmy Ayers and Sarni. Donley scored the Warriors’ second goal with 6:37 left in the half.

Sarni and Jimmy Ayers each scored twice in the third quarter allowing St. John’s to hold a 10-3 lead going into the third. Herlihy scored for L-S on a man-up goal with 5:39 left in the quarter.

Are the 2021 Eaglets the best high school baseball team to ever come out of Oakland County or perhaps even Michigan?

Head coach Matt Petry has seen some of the best the state has had to offer through his playing days at Birmingham Brother Rice and coaching the Eaglets. However he wouldn’t give his 2021 team a label.

“It’s a great team. I don’t want to compare teams. That’s not fair to any of those guys” Petry said. “This year’s team was outstanding. They were fun to be around all year obviously very talented and were able to win a state championship.”

At 43-1 OLSM tied the MHSAA record for most wins in a season with four other programs becoming the first team to win that many games since 2010.

The Eaglets went wire-to-wire as the top-ranked team in Division 2 by the Michigan High School Baseball Coaches Association.

They were also recognized by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper as the No. 1 team nationally.

“The amount of talent on this team is pretty unbelievable especially for a Michigan high school team” OLSM senior shortstop Alex Mooney said. “It’s not just a bunch of good players these guys are my brothers and my friends away from the field which has made it that much more special.”

Orchard Lake St. Mary’s didn’t have a weak spot this year offensively or defensively.

Their 480 runs scored sits second all-time in MHSAA history for a season. Only Three Oaks River Valley scored more (487) in 1994.

Their 426 runs batted in ranks second in MHSAA history to Grand Ledge’s 434 in 1994.

Their 443 strikeouts as a pitching staff shattered the previous MHSAA record of 395 set by Homer in 2004.

To most onlookers it was the pitching staff that really put St. Mary’s on another level nationally. With a team ERA just over 1.20 and a WHIP just over 1.00 the Eaglets had plenty of arms to utilize throughout the season.

“I haven’t seen a pitching staff like that and I have had some pretty good ones” Birmingham Brother Rice baseball coach Bob Riker said of St. Mary’s. “They have five guys that throw over 90 and one of them touches 98 to 99 and sits at 96. When you have stuff like that it’s tough to beat because pitching is the name of the game. It’s probably the best staff that I have seen both as a player in high school and as a coach in high school. They have five guys they can run at you that don’t really drop off.”

Leading the staff was junior Brock Porter a Clemson commit who was 12-0 with 127 strikeouts and an ERA near .500. Porter struck out 12 in a 5-1 semifinal win over New Boston Huron.

The following day senior Tommy Allman a Jacksonville commit pitched 6.1 scoreless innings with seven strikeouts in a 9-0 finals win over Stevensville Lakeshore. Allman finished his season 11-0 with a 1.11 ERA and 85 strikeouts.

Both Porter and Allman were First Team All-State selections this season. In total St. Mary’s had seven earn that honor. Joining them were Mooney (Duke) Jack Crighton (Michigan) Jake Dresselhouse (Michigan State) Nolan Schubart (Michigan) and Ike Irish (Auburn).

With all the star power the Eaglets were balanced at the plate.

As a team the Eaglets had six players hit well over .400 for the season. Mooney led the way with a .462 average entering finals weekend. They also had five different players with at least 50 RBI.

Mooney is projected as a first- or second-round pick in the upcoming 2021 MLB Draft following in the footsteps of former Michigan shortstops Derek Jeter DJ LeMahieu and Jake Cronenworth.

Mooney has had to tune out the noise of his playing future all season while the Eagles have had to tune out the national buzz and statewide expectations for perfection throughout the year.

“We just tried to go out and play our game and not worry about what was being said” Mooney said. “It’s pretty cool to be able to look back at what we accomplished but we didn’t focus on it during the season.”"

Yanko Reyes said.

The tractor-trailer driver a 40-year-old Fort Pierce man was issued a traffic infraction Reyes said. FHP no longer releases the names of crash victims because of privacy reasons.

The impact caused the school bus to flip on its side.

The driver of the tractor-trailer and three students were taken to area hospitals with non-life threatening injuries after the June 10 crash in the 200 block of C.R. 512 Sebastian Police Cpt. Tim Wood said. The students were released from the hospitals by 7 p.m. that same day School District of Indian River County spokesperson Cristen Maddux said.

It was unclear what day the tractor-trailer driver was released from the hospital. The tractor-trailer belonged to Sysco Southeast Florida LLC a food products supplier.

Wood said the School District of Indian River County bus and tractor-trailer were both headed westbound on C.R. 512 when the two vehicles collided. The tractor-trailer was in the right lane and the school bus was in the left lane moments before the wreck.

Reyes said the tractor-trailer driver made an improper lane change from the right lane to the left lane. The tractor-trailer struck the right side of the school bus.

Reyes said the bus swerved to the left rotated counter clockwise and rolled on its side.

Maddux said all district school buses have seat belts. It was unclear if the students were wearing the seat belts during the collision.

Police closed C.R. 512 in the immediate area causing traffic delays for several hours. The road reopened later that evening.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But this was far from the company’s first attempt to use music superstars to promote its gadgets.

Back in 2007 Samsung (and Sprint) released the Beyonce-themed B’Phone a limited edition version of the Samsung UpStage M620. The phone had two sides – a simple-looking feature phone and a media player with a music controls and a larger 2.1” 176 x 220 px display (well larger than the line display that was on the other side).



The B'Phone promoted by Beyonce • A regular Samsung UpStage back and front

The exterior was changed to a gold-and-burgundy color palette (designed by singer herself) and offered exclusive downloadable content including a song called “632-5792” (a phone number) that Beyonce wrote when she was 10. That was it though if you wanted more songs you had to load them on a microSD card yourself (the UpStage supported cards up to 2 GB).

Nokia knew the value of celebrity promotion too but instead of going to any one celeb the Finns decided to cast a wide net and in 2004 (in partnership with AT&T) released the Nokia 3200 and Nokia 3300 American Idol limited edition phones. They were priced $50 to $70 and sold through multiple music stores (e.g. Sam Goody Media Play Suncoast).

The simple 3200 got nothing but branding – with no card slot barely any memory and no music player there was little hope for it. The 3300 was a different story however. Regular readers of Flashback will remember it as a sequel to the QWERTY-packing 5510 and as the “Black Phone” a Jay-Z branded special edition.

Years later the company tried something similar with the Nokia 5228 X-Factor (in some regions the phone was known as the 5233). This Symbian-powered (resistive) touch phone was a cheaper version of the 5800 XpressMusic Nokia’s first attempt to fight the iPhone.

The Nokia 5228 X-Factor edition: yes it looks the same but it has some pre-loaded content

Thankfully it was 2010 so the phone came with a standard 3.5mm headphones jack and microSD slot (not MMC like the 3300). However all you got with this special edition was the X-Factor app pre-loaded along with some wallpapers and ringtones from the show.

Also in 2010 T-Mobile partnered with legendary guitarist Eric Clapton to reveal the myTouch 3G Fender limited edition. The Android 1.6 smartphone by HTC was given a fake wood grain exterior with the trademark Fender sunburst finish (even the included headphones were customized).

A 16GB microSD was preload with some of Clapton’s best-known classics including “Layla” “My Father’s Eyes” “Rock ‘N’ Roll Heart” and “Wonderful Tonight”. Also two apps came pre-installed: Guitar: Solo and Musical Light.



The (HTC) T-Mobile myTouch 3G Fender Limited Edition with the trademark Fender sunburst finish

T-Mobile also offered ways to spruce up the device including more Fender-branded backs a Fender carrying case and the Rock Dock a docking station with built-in speakers. The carrier also debuted a multimedia sync solution that allowed users to sync music video and photos between their Windows or Mac computers and their phone (it’s obvious that T-Mo was looking for an alternative to iTunes).

The T-Mobile myTouch 3G Fender edition was available in T-Mobile retail stores (and online) at $180 (plus taxes and fees) with a 2-year contract.

Over the years there have been other phones promoted by famous musical acts. A more recent example is the Galaxy A80 Blackpink special edition from 2019 (BTS wasn’t the first K-pop band that Samsung has tapped for promotional purposes).

What’s your favorite music-themed limited edition phone?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3Rlc2xhbW90b3JzY2x1Yi5jb20vdG1jL3RocmVhZHMvMjUwMC1taWxlcy1pbi1hbmQtbm93LW15LXRpcmUtaGFzLWEtcHVuY3R1cmUtbG9jYWwtdGlyZS1zaG9wLXdvbiVFMiU4MCU5OXQtdG91Y2gtaXQuMjMyMTY2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2500 miles in and now my tire has a puncture. Local Tire shop won't touch it.,"It is so easy to plug a tire. I keep a plug kit in both cars for the unlikely probability that we'll get a flat but be that as it may both kits came from sitting in the trunk of previous cars. They don't wear out. They're also relatively cheap. I've seen them for under $20 and they last forever.



I'd also recommend people buy an inexpensive air compressor for filling tires. This may be useful if you're out in the wilderness and your tire has slow-leaked too fast.



Basically though if I had a tire that was losing pressure slowly I'd do the following.



1. Find the leak. This part is easier if you bring the tire pressure up to over 50 lbs. Mix a tiny amount of dish soap in a bowl of water and use a rag to wash it over the tire. Look for a little mountain of bubbles.

2. See if there's something in the hole and if there is prepare to remove it by having a strong pair of pliers handy

3. Get plug from plug kit and make sure plug is lubricated ready to push into the hole threaded into the Plug Insertion Tool (T-handle with large needle eye)

4. Pull out nail or whatever from hole and quickly use plug tool with plug inserted to push plug into hole. If done correctly you won't lose any more air.

5. Trim excess plug off. The end of the plug inside the tire will fold down over the hole when you drive and help seal it from the inside even more. It won't hurt if a quarter inch of plug or so lays outside the tire after trimming.

6. Aaaand... Bob's your uncle! Or maybe Steve or Mark. I just don't know your family that well. Your tire should remain leak free until the next nail or until it gets replaced at the end of tread life.



I've plugged many many tires in trucks I used in my business around construction. Lotsa nails! No way should you have to pull the wheel dismount the tire or mess with putting a patch on the inside. Totally unnecessary but useful if you want to date your tire-man's sister.



I agree with others here that this takes some muscle. Some women can plug a tire most don't want to mess with it. That's why they invented men so I hear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vYm94aW5nLW5ld3MtdGFuay1pcy1kZWFkLW1lYXQtdG8tdXMtdGVvZmltby1sb3Blei1zci1zaHV0cy1kb3duLWEtcG9zc2libGUtdGVvZmltby1sb3Blei1qci12cy1nZXJ2b250YS1kYXZpcy1maWdodC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teofimo Lopez Sr. Shuts Down a Possible Teofimo Lopez Jr. vs. Gervonta Davis Fight,"LAS VEGAS NV – AUGUST 26: (L-R) Gervonta Davis holds onto the ring against Francisco Fonseca during their junior lightweight bout on August 26 2017 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas Nevada.

Gervonta Davis continues to amaze the world with his in-ring performances. Registering an incredible eleventh-round knockout of Mario Barrios ‘Tank’ has etched his name alongside legends as a three-division world champion.

Most in the boxing world are impressed with his victory some are not. The father-trainer of the unified lightweight champion Teofimo Lopez Jr Teofimo Lopez Sr. falls in the latter category. Speaking to fighthype.com Lopez Sr. went off on a suggestion of a possible fight with Gervonta Davis.

”This guy is fighting for regular belts. We got the main belts” he exclaimed. The idea of a bout between Davis and Lopez has been dangled in front of the boxing audience many times.

It would be interesting to see ‘Tank’ test his mettle with an opponent as highly touted as him. However Lopez Sr. believes that the puzzle of Davis won’t be too hard for his son to solve.

“We’ll f*cking knock this dude in less than 4 rounds. That f*cking uppercut he throws he’s never gonna catch my son with that sh**. Cause we got a style that we call the pyramid where we can touch you and you can’t touch us” he says.

The bludgeoning uppercuts of Davis have been his key to victory for the majority of his career. It is interesting to imagine how it will threaten Lopez whose defensive game is amongst the foremost in the lightweight division.

The Beef between Gervonta Davis and Teofimo Lopez Jr.

In a recent interview with boxingscene.com Lopez Jr. said that ‘Tank’ has decided to compete at 140lbs only to avoid a fight with him. He has called out Davis in the past expressing that he would want to knock out Davis in March.

“That’s the bottom line. He skipped two divisions just to fight Mario Barrios who’s not as [good of a fighter]. We can say he’s a C-plus fighter at 140” he said.

The two have shared the squared circle in a sparring session in the past.

The fight is less likely to happen in the near future. Lopez Sr. asserted that the fight may not materialize as Davis may not accept a fight in the future.

“Tank is dead meat to us. Dead meat! And they know it. They’re never going to fight us. ‘Oh no Tank needs another fight before he fights Lopez’. Get the f*ck out of here” he says.

The Challenge

Recently while working on the project for one of my graduate classes I was faced with the question of what is the best way to present database analysis of the multiple datasets I was processing in the Jupyter notebook. Each of these databases contained information collected over a number of years and also had multiple stratification levels such as gender and race for each of the different questions asked in that particular database. In addition each database had information compiled by the state. It is cumbersome and not efficient to have to modify the code and to run each cell over again each time you want to look at the data from a different state or view data by race or gender for example. The solution to this problem lies in ipywidgets. Ipywidgets are interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. They give the user the ability to interact with the data and visualize the changes in the data in a quick easy and efficient manner.

In this article I will show how to set up interactive dropdown menu widgets to do a simple data analysis on the example of ‘Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Aging Data’ CDC database. The 3 dropdown menu widgets will be built to create a user-friendly menu where one can choose a state a stratification level (gender race or overall) and a question the user wants to see information for. I will use Plotly the interactive graphing library to display the graphical representation of the information stored in the database.

The csv file used in this article is publicly available to download on CDC website.

First let’s import all libraries and extensions needed:

Second let’s get the cvs file ready to work on:

For simplicity of the output we will only look at the following 5 questions being evaluated in the dataset:

Percentage of older adults who are currently obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. Percentage of older adults who have not had any leisure time physical activity in the past month. Percentage of older adults with a lifetime diagnosis of depression. Percentage of older adults who have been told they have high blood pressure who report currently taking medication for their high blood pressure. Percentage of older adults who are eating 3 or more vegetables daily.

Columns that are not needed will be dropped.

Now let’s set up all the functions needed for graphical representation of the information stored in the ‘Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Aging Data’ database:

For simplicity of the output we will only concentrate on the all-ages group of datapoints.

Only data available for the years 2015 through 2019 will be analyzed.

Function plot_healthy_aging_data_gender takes 2 letter state abbreviation 3 dataframes with the information needed to make a Plotly graph and a question. This function will be selected if a user specifies in the dropdown widget that they wish to see the data plotted by gender.

Function plot_healthy_aging_data_race takes 2 letter State abbreviation 3 dataframes with the information needed to make a Plotly graph and a question. This function will be selected if a user specifies in the dropdown widget that they wish to see the data plotted by race.

Function plot_healthy_aging_data_overall takes 2 letter State abbreviation 3 dataframes with the information needed to make a Plotly graph and a question. This function will be selected if a user specifies in the dropdown widget that they wish to see the data plotted by overall stratification category.

Function dataset_analysis_aging queries the original dataset to partition the results in 3 different dataframes based on race gender or overall (all races genders and ages) stratification category. This function is designed to pull the required information needed to make a Plotly graph once the user has selected the inputs.

As mentioned previously for simplicity of the output we will only concentrate on the all-ages group of datapoints which is labeled as Overall in the ‘Stratification1’ column of the dataset.

Functions dataset_analysis_aging_gender dataset_analysis_aging_race and dataset_analysis_aging_overall are helper functions used to pass the dataset info for the state question and stratification category(gender race or overall) to dataset_analysis_aging function. The returned dataframes are then passed to the corresponding stratification category plotting function.

Now we are ready to set up 3 dropdown menu widgets to be used for the data analysis of ‘Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Aging Data’ database. This will be done by writing a function that creates a dropdown menu for choosing a particular state question and stratification category and passes this information into dataset analysis functions to get a specific output.

Function dropdown_menu_widget_healthy_aging takes in a dataset related to healthy aging as well as 3 helper functions and a list of questions to query over. Each of the helper functions are used to control the UI-interface for selecting a specific state question and stratification i.e. gender race or overall data.

This function at first returns a dropdown menu to choose a state a question and stratification category to be analyzed and after the user choses the inputs the function returns data analysis based on the dropdown menu choices made.

Finally we are ready to call the interactive dropdown_menu_widget_healthy_aging function. After the initial input choices one can continue to change the inputs in the menu to see graphical outputs for different inputs without having to re-run any cells.

After running the cell above in Jupyter Notebook the dropdown menu displayed below will appear. The dropdown menu choices can be made now to display the corresponding Plotly graph. Dropdown menu demo can be found at the end of the article.

Tesla (TSLA) began recalling more than 285000 vehicles in China on Saturday over a safety risk concerning the vehicle’s cruise control feature.

The cruise control system in certain models can be activated when drivers try to shift gears or accidentally touch the gear selector resulting in accidental acceleration according to China’s State Administration for Market Regulation.

The recall includes 35665 imported Model 3 vehicles and 249855 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in Tesla’s factory in Shanghai. Customers will not be required to return the vehicles. Instead they will receive a free software update either remotely or in-person to resolve the issue.

Tesla apologized for the recall on Saturday in a statement posted on its official Weibo account one of China’s most popular social media sites. Tesla said it will keep improving in accordance with China’s safety regulations.

“We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to our car owners. In the meantime Tesla will strictly follow national regulations and keep improving our safety protection adamantly providing an excellent and safe driving experience to our customers” the automaker said.

China has proven to be a difficult market for Tesla. The company has had five Chinese regulatory agencies questioning the quality of its Shanghai-made Model 3 cars.

The electric car leader sold fewer than 26000 cars in China in April down 27% from March according to figures released by the China Passenger Car Association. The drop came as Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers such as Nio (NIO) Xpeng and Li Auto all reported improved domestic sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy90ZXNsYS1uYXZpZ2F0aW9uLXdoaWNoLWxhbmUuMjMyMjE1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Navigation - which lane?,"You can install our site as a web app on your iOS device by utilizing the Add to Home Screen feature in Safari.

No two companies are taking the same technological path to achieve this plan either. Some make use of remote sensing methods like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) while others rely on radar-based sensors to help pick out hard-to-see obstacles in the roadway. And typically firms working on autonomous tech will use a combination of LiDAR radar and cameras.

Then there’s Tesla which believes vision-based image recognition using only cameras is the key to affordable and reliable autonomy.

But there’s a catch to Tesla’s method: perfecting vision-based autonomy is difficult. It requires the use of a continuously improving system that can quickly adapt to new and changing road conditions and then it must be capable of sharing that information with other vehicles on the roadway. That kind of learning takes significantly more processing power than what is available in a single vehicle—it takes a supercomputer.

[Related: Everything self-driving cars calculate before changing lanes]

During a talk at the International Joint Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition earlier this month Tesla’s senior director of AI Andrej Karpathy revealed that the automaker has been working on a project to do exactly that.

Tesla’s new supercomputer hasn’t been named at least not publicly. The cluster itself consists of 720 individual computers called nodes. Each node has eight Nvidia A100 80GB Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) capable of performing high-intensity floating point calculations with nearly 500 times as much power compared to a standard desktop processor.

In total the cluster has 5760 GPUs or enough hardware to achieve an insane 1.8 exaflops of processing power. Karpathy believes this makes Tesla’s supercomputer the fifth most powerful computing environment in the entire world at least on paper.

Modern Teslas utilize an advanced driver assistance system called Autopilot. This suite of features allows the vehicle to make use of eight exterior-facing cameras to gather data about the vehicle’s surroundings and when engaged and where applicable performs lateral (steering) and longitudinal (acceleration and braking) controls under driver supervision. While this shouldn’t be confused with Waymo’s advanced self-driving it is an interim step that uses partial automation to bridge the gap between manual driving and fully autonomous control.

[Related: How Waymo is teaching self-driving cars to deal with the chaos of parking lots]

Autopilot uses information gathered from all Tesla vehicles on the road to improve its driving decisions. As a Tesla steers along the street its exterior cameras are constantly gathering data on the outside environment. Computers within the car study this data and make predictions of how to behave in any given scenario without actually sending controls to the vehicle itself.

This information is shared on a machine learning architecture called a neural network. The predictions are then recorded and sent back to Tesla to determine if the decision was correct or if any data was misidentified. If it was then the data then continually runs through the supercomputer tweaking its behavior until it processes without a mistake effectively training Tesla’s ever-improving Autopilot model.

[Related: Intel’s new chip puts a teraflop in your desktop. Here’s what that means]

This method not only consumes a large amount of processing power but it also requires significant storage in order to stockpile the one million 10-second clips used to make up the proprietary Tesla dataset training for Autopilot. These clips alone require 1.5 petabytes of storage whereas the system itself is capable of hoarding approximately 10 petabytes of data on ultra-fast NVMe flash storage.

Relatedly Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously teased “Project Dojo” a supercomputer built on proprietary Tesla silicon specifically architectured for neural net model training. Musk noted that establishing high speed communication between components and efficient cooling was an ongoing challenge in late 2020 though the project was ongoing.

Because Karpathy’s cluster uses Nvidia-based GPUs it doesn’t appear to be affiliated with Project Dojo. However it still plays an important role in Tesla’s ultimate goal of being the first automaker capable of a fully self-driving vehicle on public roads.

Tesla’s rather ambitious goal has been met with quite a bit of skepticism by industry leaders and naysayers of vision-only vehicle autonomy especially since the automaker rejected the use of ultra-precision LiDAR as part of its autonomy suite.

[Related: This supercomputer will perform 1000000000000000000 operations per second]

No Tesla vehicle on the road today makes use of LiDAR. In fact Elon Musk called LiDAR a “crutch” in 2018 denouncing the technology in favor of Tesla’s own vision-based system before doing away with supplemental radars earlier this year. That decision alone cost Tesla safety endorsements from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Meanwhile Volvo has chosen to implement LiDAR as a standard feature on the upcoming successor to its XC90 SUV.

As for Tesla its current-generation supercomputer will help to train its Autopilot model and its upcoming Project Dojo likely even moreso. But only time will tell if its vision-based technology will prevail over competitors meaning that it’s a gambit that could make or break its position as a leader in the autonomy segment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi9pLWp1c3Qtcm9kZS1pbi1jYXItZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNob3VsZC1iZS1tb3N0LXdvcnJpZWQtYWJvdXQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Just Rode in the Car Elon Musk Should Be Most Worried About,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/i-just-rode-in-car-elon-musk-should-be-most-worried-about.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi9pLWp1c3Qtcm9kZS1pbi1jYXItZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNob3VsZC1iZS1tb3N0LXdvcnJpZWQtYWJvdXQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9jb21wYXJpc29uLXRlc3QvYTM2ODQ3MDg3LzIwMjEtZm9yZC1tdXN0YW5nLW1hY2gtZS12cy0yMDIwLXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXktY29tcGFyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparison Test: 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E vs. 2020 Tesla Model Y,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparison-test/a36847087/2021-ford-mustang-mach-e-vs-2020-tesla-model-y-compared/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9jb21wYXJpc29uLXRlc3QvYTM2ODQ3MDg3LzIwMjEtZm9yZC1tdXN0YW5nLW1hY2gtZS12cy0yMDIwLXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXktY29tcGFyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Texas Tech University’s atmospheric science program – an affiliate of the university’s National Wind Institute (NWI) and part of the Department of Geosciences – is receiving a much deserved recognition.

On June 15 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it has selected Texas Tech to be part of its new Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations (CISHIWRO). CISHIWRO is funded by the five-year $200 million NOAA grant.

Texas Tech is one of five institutions comprising CISHIWRO. The University of Oklahoma is hosting the cooperative with Howard University Pennsylvania State University and the State University of New York at Albany also contributing. Each institution will receive various amounts of the $200 million.

“All these institutions are recognized for excellence in the field of atmospheric science and this cooperative institute represents a formal path by which collaborative high-impact research can be carried out to further the mission of NOAA to protect life and property from severe weather hazards” said Christopher Weiss a professor of atmospheric science and Texas Tech’s lead investigator in CISHIWRO.

The goal of the research is to improve the fundamental understanding of severe weather hazards and develop techniques and products that can more effectively communicate these threats to the general population Weiss said.

“Ultimately these efforts will save lives and mitigate the damage done to property” he explained.

Texas Tech will focus intensely on topics of mutual interest to the university and NOAA. The university’s atmospheric science group brings a wealth of experience with severe weather observations and numerical modeling expertise with the impacts of severe winds on built structures and growing capabilities with respect to understanding the socioeconomic dimension of these hazards.

Some of the weather-related expertise and instruments offered at Texas Tech include the Hurricane Research Team West Texas Mesonet Debris Impact Facility VorTECH Ka-band Mobile Doppler Radar Trucks and StickNet platforms. A group from NWI – formerly known as the National Wind Science and Engineering Research Center (WiSE) – also were responsible for creating the Enhanced Fujita Scale.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1YXdlaWNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2VtdWktMS10by1lbXVpLTExLWFuZHJvaWQtdmVyc2lvbnMtZGV2aWNlcy1wcm9jZXNzb3JzLWxhdW5jaC1kYXRlcy1hbmQtbW9yZS_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5odWF3ZWljZW50cmFsLmNvbS9lbXVpLTEtdG8tZW11aS0xMS1hbmRyb2lkLXZlcnNpb25zLWRldmljZXMtcHJvY2Vzc29ycy1sYXVuY2gtZGF0ZXMtYW5kLW1vcmUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EMUI 1 to EMUI 11: Android Versions Devices Processors Launch Dates and more,"Finally Huawei has begun to shift the Android-based EMUI to the HarmonyOS 2 operating system which is designed for an all-scenario smart performance. Although the new OS brings a lot of new functionalities along with UI changes but still users are still waiting for their terms to install this latest software.

Talking about the EMUI this mobile skin working on Android interface exists since early 2012. Huawei launched this custom OS as “Emotion UI” and then switched this to a shorter version of “EMUI” after two major launched.

Following its initial introduction the company seen EMUI as a major part of its software ecosystem that always brings new and interesting features for the consumers.

However In 2019 the US Sanction forced Huawei has to stop collaborating with Google. This whole scenario later resulted in the withdrawal of Google Mobile Services (GMS) support from Huawei smartphones.

The transition from EMUI to HarmonyOS is currently taking its initial steps among China-based devices. So even after the launch of HarmonyOS for smartphones global consumers would still rely on EMUI.

From 2012 to 2020 EMUI shows a great evolution and gave many features that are still favored by users. And today we’ll be going to see a sneak peek at some important information regarding the EMUI software system and its journey in Huawei smartphones.

Before that I am going to show you guys a brief journey of the evolution of EMUI and will show you which were the milestones in the history of EMUI custom skin.

While the Army does not announce the competitors the field naturally includes some of the largest and most well known weapons developers. One team is comprised of an interesting industry conglomerate looking to synergize the best in German armored vehicle engineering

with world-leading U.S. combat vehicle expertise and production capacity. American Rheinmetall Defense is the U.S. extension of Germany’s Rheinmetall defense a well known combat vehicle leader responsible for contributing to the Leopard tank and Puma Infantry

Fighting Vehicle. Led by Rheinmetall the “Lynx” team is building a distinct U.S. “variant” intended to align specifically with U.S. Army requirements. While based upon Rheinmetall expertise the vehicle will incorporate major U.S. industry participation and emerge as an entirely new “U.S. variant” of the Lynx. The Rheinmetall team includes Raytheon Textron L3Harris and Allison Transmission.

Building on Rheinmetall’s manufacturing experience Team Lynx will manufacture the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) structure. It will assemble and test the U.S. Army’s OMFV at the Textron Systems manufacturing facility in Louisiana.

“Our land vehicle production facility in Louisiana where we have about 158000 square feet of total manufacturing space with an additional 30000 square feet of onsite warehousing has been used to manufacture over 10000 vehicles” Clark Lindner the director of Global Military Sales Strategy Textron Systems told the National Interest. “The facility includes end-to-end vehicle testing tailored to meet program requirements.”

Textron Systems is known for producing the operational Armored Security Vehicle for the U.S. Army. Its developers say they are also drawing heavily upon their experience in engineering and manufacturing unmanned aerial systems such as the Shadow® for the U.S. Army and more recently their participation in the RCV Medium program. Naturally the RCV Medium program is heavily focused upon autonomy and manned-unmanned coordination something likely to figure prominently in the developmental process.

Allison Transmission which has more than three million square feet of manufacturing facilities in the United States manufactures transmissions for the Army’s Abrams tank Mobile Protected Firepower vehicle Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The company has been manufacturing electric hybrid propulsion systems for commercial markets since 2003.

“We have a large presence in Indiana and the partnership with Team Lynx represents a new product development opportunity that takes advantage of Allison’s considerable manufacturing capability and technical expertise” Dane Rodgers the director of New Product Development Allison Transmission told the National Interest.

The Lynx will be equipped with Allison’s Next-Generation Electrified Transmission to provide the benefits of reduced detection by the enemy and increased soldier survivability.

“We are not only anticipating new product development opportunities but we’re talking about a transformation of a workforce that becomes far more digital and allows for faster cycles Integrating new capabilities onto the vehicle so they can stay competitive against threats” Rodgers added.

The Lynx team has emphasized the need to engineer a vehicle suited for the immediate need of the warfighter and also to optimize the vehicle’s design configuration sensing weapons performance and computing technologies to be ready to respond to future threats. The concept all participants say is to engineer a vehicle that is ready and easily adaptable for necessary growth with the knowledge that major power adversaries will be moving quickly to try to outpace the United States and Lynx must be able to keep up developers say.

In carrying out this developmental work Rheinmetall developers say that they will naturally draw upon and evolve their substantial experience in building armored combat vehicles such as tanks and infantry carriers. Mike Milner the director of business development and strategy for American Rheinmetall Vehicles said. “The U.S. Lynx will draw upon some of the most recent innovations and combat vehicle developments in Europe and combine that experience with considerable U.S. expertise.”

There are many facets plans and technical nuances to the Lynx team’s industrial approach including U.S. production and technology development. The project will entail the introduction of a vast number of new U.S. engineering science and manufacturing jobs as well as a decided developmental emphasis upon bringing new opportunities in modeling simulation and digital engineering.

Rheinmetall is also looking at other U.S. production expansion opportunities as part of the OMFV program. “As we continue throughout the program and different contracts are awarded this does allow us the opportunity to expand the supply base into other areas and additional locations within the U.S. very similar to what we have successfully implemented in Australia and Hungary” Milner said.

Overall the large team of industry players seeks to engineer a vehicle in alignment with Army requirements expand into new modernized U.S.- based manufacturing facilities to create new jobs and build a vehicle of unique value to the Army. An extraordinary effort is likely needed given that the OMFV is drawing a large number of industry competitors.

213800 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s doubling of the child tax credit.

Every income group in every Connecticut congressional district received a tax cut. Nationwide a typical family of four received a $2000 annual tax cut and a single parent with one child received a $1300 annual tax cut.

1028380 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s doubling of the standard deduction. Thanks to the tax cuts nine out of ten households take the standard deduction which provides tax relief and simplifies the tax filing process.

45200 Connecticut households are benefiting from the TCJA’s elimination of the Obamacare individual mandate tax. Most households hit with this tax made less than $50000 per year.

Lower utility bills: As a direct result of the TCJA’s corporate tax rate cut Connecticut residents are saving money on utility bills. Lower electric water and gas bills help households and small businesses operating on tight margins. For example at least eight Connecticut utilities reduced their customers’ bills (see below).

Thanks to the tax cuts Connecticut businesses of all sizes are hiring expanding raising pay and increasing employee benefits:

Charter Communications Inc. (Stamford Connecticut) – Base wage raised to $15 per hour; commitment to hire over 20000 employees by 2020:

With the resources and investment confidence resulting from historic tax reform legislation and the FCC’s removal of the 1930’s era regulatory framework for internet service Charter is increasing our investment in our workforce by ensuring all employees are paid a minimum wage of at least $15 per hour including target commissions within the next year.

In addition the reforms in Washington are allowing Charter to increase its capital investment including in its broadband network. Last year given the general deregulatory environment and anticipating the Administration Congress and the FCC enacting these pro-growth policies we announced we would hire 20000 employees and invest $25 billion in infrastructure.

Today with tax reform and the removal of the Title II statutory framework both a reality Charter will continue the capital investment program we started last year and will complete it by 2020. In 2017 we extended the reach of our high-speed broadband network in rural areas like Meeker CO Lakeview OR Hawthorne NV as well as to more than 42000 underserved and unserved homes and businesses in New York State. Charter remains steadfast in our commitment to continue to bring our broadband service with a minimum speed of 100 Mbps to more communities across the country. – Feb. 2 2018 Charter Communications Inc. statement

Kaman Corp. (Bloomfield Connecticut) – $1000 tax reform bonuses:

Bloomfield manufacturer Kaman Corp. says it’s joining the list of U.S. employers sharing the wealth with workers in the wake of federal tax reform.

The maker-supplier of aeroparts custom aircraft and power-distribution products disclosed Wednesday that about 2400 workers who were on its payroll on or before Oct. 1 2017 and who earned less $75000 a year are eligible for a $1000 bonus. However each must remain on the payroll through Aug. 31 to collect CEO Neal J. Keating told staff in a memo. – April 18 2018 Hartford Business Journal article excerpt

Thomas Hooker Brewery (Bloomfield Connecticut) – The brewery used savings from the tax cut to expand the business and create new jobs:

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says a federal tax credit for small-scale breweries distilleries and wineries has helped create jobs in Connecticut.

The tax credit for small scale alcohol producers was initially part of the 2017 Trump tax cut. It’s been extended in the bipartisan federal budget passed by Congress last month. Blumenthal says he opposed Trump’s tax cuts to big business but this particular tax cut is for small businesses and is a job creator.

“These craft breweries put the savings back into their businesses. They create jobs. They produce more beer. They meet demand. And they provide good value.”

Blumenthal spoke at Thomas Hooker Brewery in Bloomfield. Brewery owner Curt Cameron agrees that he’s putting 100% of his tax cut back into his business “in our case a brand-new pizza kitchen which is an offshoot of our existing business. It will create at least seven jobs immediately.”

If the tax break had not been extended craft breweries like Thomas Hooker would have faced a federal excise tax increase of 400% this year. – Dec. 31 2019 WSHU article.

Shortway Brewing Co. (Newport Connecticut) — Increasing wages and hiring new employees:

Mr. Shortway said the new tax plan along with the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act also passed last year have already helped the brewery save money. The craft beverage act greatly reduced excise taxes on small-scale brewers and the tax plan has additional provisions designed to help small businesses.

Mr. Shortway said he was able to give his employees a small raise and hire more workers as a result of the tax savings. He said although it is a bit early to know what the long-term impact of the tax plan will be he expects it will keep helping going forward.

“Growth is picking up” he said. – May 11 2018 News-Times article excerpt

The Travelers Companies Inc. (Hartford Connecticut) — $1000 bonuses for 14000 employees with a base salary less than $75000:

Today comprehensive U.S. tax reform has been signed into law. One objective of the legislation is to spur economic growth and therefore the U.S. economy.

In addition to benefiting from economic growth Travelers will benefit directly from the legislation in two important ways. First like all companies our corporate tax rate will decrease from 35% to 21%. Second the legislation will level the playing field for U.S. insurers by eliminating a loophole that foreign insurers have used to our disadvantage for decades to move their U.S. profits offshore to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.

One of the opportunities all of these benefits create for us is to make additional investments in our business. I shared at a recent all-employee meeting that our vision as it relates to investment and innovation is to strengthen our competitive advantages with two goals in mind: be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers.

The leadership team decided that given our confidence in our business and the way we are successfully positioned for the opportunities ahead we should start making additional investments immediately. We also came to the conclusion that we should use the opportunity to make our first investment in our most valuable asset and greatest competitive advantage — our people.

I’m pleased to announce that we will be giving approximately 14000 employees with a base salary of $75000 per year or less and who meet our performance expectations a special one-time bonus of $1000. The bonus will be paid in January to then current employees. Eligible employees will hear more shortly.

In addition while we have only a small number of U.S.-based employees making less than $15 an hour we will increase their hourly wage to $15. – The Travelers Companies Inc. note to employees

There's Cuzzo. Poe. Sugarbell. Dippy. And about a dozen or so more. They aren't friends who are the product of a girl's imagination but rather the names of the chickens (and one rooster Nipsey Hussle) they're raising to sell their free range eggs under the banner of Brown Girl Eggs.

""It's fun and it's exciting to get the eggs in the morning"" Alona said. ""Sometimes they lay eggs in the morning. Sometimes they lay eggs in the night. The first time they made an egg my mom was so excited.""

""She's my apprentice"" Brandi Cherry explained. ""I'm the mother hen. That's what (Alona) calls me.""

As a teacher's assistant for special needs children at Banksville School in the Pittsburgh Public Schools system at the outset of the pandemic she suddenly had a lot of time on her hands. She volunteered making and distributing meals at a nearby church in Knoxville but also used the downtime to pursue a lifelong ambition.

Her grandfather had a tree farm in Salem South Carolina a speck of a town (population 152) in the northwestern corner of the Palmetto state near its borders with Georgia and Tennessee.

""My father was born down there but moved here when he was 11 or 12"" Cherry said. ""Every summer we would go back to visit. I had my own horse down there. He taught me how to take care of chickens. I didn't have to wear shoes all summer - I was a country girl. So it was always my dream to have my own farm.""

She did all the necessary research then bought chickens plus an enclosure for them from Tractor Supply that she put together.

""I'm a hands-on type of person. If I wanna do something I'll put my head to it and just go all the way"" she said.

At first she just gave eggs away to friends and family but quickly had more than she knew what to do with.

""It's just been my dream to start something and (Alona) said 'Mommy since we have the chickens why don't we sell the eggs?' and I said why not. We were coming up with names and she said 'Well we're two brown girls. How about Brown Girl Eggs?'

""She's my little entrepreneur. And we ran with it.""

Cherry has 40 adult chickens and 20 chicks and splits them between a few friends' homes to stay in compliance with the city's zoning rules regarding urban livestock. She sells them at $5 a dozen at pop-up events or for delivery. It's a competitive price for a premium product as the chickens are free-range and have a natural diet.

""They eat spinach kale lettuce tomatoes apples - they love apples - and these little mealworms"" Cherry said. ""The more green food they eat the more they'll produce.""

""Sometimes I'll feed the chickens; sometimes I'll collect the eggs"" Alona said. ""They lay probably five or 10 a day. Or sometimes eight. Last night they laid eight eggs.""

More than anything the venture has brought mother and daughter closer together.

""We have a better relationship. We talk more. Before the COVID she was one of those cellphone kids. She doesn't call anybody. She just plays the games. But now we're bonding more and talking more. And it teaches her responsibility - If she doesn't work she doesn't eat"" Cherry joked. Although that isn't entirely untrue: She said Alona makes a point to have one of their eggs every day for breakfast.

""I want her to know responsibility. This is her job and she's getting paid with her allowance but I'm teaching her how to save and not mess up her money"" Cherry said. ""When I was young nobody showed me anything about saving and credit. I'm showing her that responsibility.""

Cherry is looking into purchasing land in Butler County to make this her life's work and build a full-scale chicken farm. That would make her something of a trailblazer - a Black woman urban farmer.

""There's a lot of farmers here but not a lot of them are Black"" Cherry said.

A 2018 Philadelphia Inquirer article about Black farmers in the Commonwealth reported there were ""only 140 African- American farm operators working on 122 farms in Pennsylvania according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 2012 Census of Agriculture.""

""I've got the community behind me and I've been saving my money and have an investor"" she said.

This also would create a springboard for the future of her little 8-year-old entrepreneur Alona.

""I'm trying to show her you can live off your land and produce a lot of equity if you do it the right way.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYXpiaWdtZWRpYS5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvOS1waW5hbC1jb3VudHktaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1wYXJrcy1kcml2aW5nLWdyb3d0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9 Pinal County industrial parks driving growth,"With thousands of acres of flat open land ideally situated midway between Phoenix and Tucson and with easy access to major highway rail and air transportation it’s no wonder that Pinal County hosts an abundance of industrial parks.

The heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) industry has several exciting long-term trends behind it. As such the leading players like Carrier (CARR 1.45%) Trane Technologies (TT 1.62%) and Johnson Controls (JCI 0.77%)will benefit from them. It may not seem like the sexiest industry to invest in but who cares? Sometimes it's the under-the-radar growth industries that generate the best returns. Here's why these HVAC stocks are set for substantial growth for many years to come.

Key growth trends

The growth catalysts come in three buckets:

Long-term end market megatrends including urbanization rising city temperatures and emerging middle class in the developing world demanding HVAC.

Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and the need to reduce carbon emissions will drive customers toward higher-quality HVAC providers like Carrier Trane (Trane American Standard) and Johnson Controls (York).

The growth in connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices and digitalization will shift demand toward leading players rolling out digital tools.

In addition to these trends the post-pandemic environment will likely create an increased awareness of the need for healthier cleaner buildings -- something that starts with the ""V"" in HVAC.

Megatrends

It's not a coincidence that all three companies have been restructured in recent years. The tailwinds behind these industrial businesses are so strong that all three companies have been significantly restructured to focus on investing in them in recent years. For example Carrier was formerly part of a much larger company United Technologies that was split up in 2020.

The split enabled Carrier's management to focus on significantly reducing costs and seek to increase market share through targeted initiatives like growing revenue in emerging markets  and developing its services revenue through its digital initiatives -- more on that later.

Trane Technologies was formerly part of Ingersoll Rand until the latter merged its industrial business with Gardner Denver to create the new Ingersoll Rand company leaving the climate segment to trade as Trane.

Johnson Controls was also a much larger company a few years ago. However its automotive seating business Adient was spun off in 2016 and it sold its power solutions (automotive batteries) business in 2019. Here again the main idea is to focus on its core growth business of HVAC and its complementary building systems (fire and safety) solutions.

Regulatory requirements and reducing carbon emissions

Given that buildings are responsible for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions globally it's clear that HVAC suppliers have a key role to play in helping companies reduce their carbon footprint. In fact at a recent Morgan Stanley conference Trane CEO Mike Lamach said that ""a quarter of the world's emissions happen as a result of HVAC systems in buildings and through food loss and the cold chain"" and he believes that figure will grow to 35% by 2030.

Lamach sees HVAC systems as being responsible for ""40% to 60% of the energy used in the building."" Carrier Trane and Johnson Controls own substantive refrigerated transportation businesses that can help reduce food waste.

Meanwhile Johnson Controls CEO George Oliver believes his company has an opportunity to benefit from the hundreds of billions worth of investment necessary in commercial buildings in order for companies to achieve their aim of net-zero carbon emissions.

Digitization and IoT

The solution to helping companies meet regulatory requirements and meeting demand for HVAC comes from the more efficient pump and refrigerant technology offered by these three companies. However it also comes from the increasing use of digital applications in connected buildings.

By using digital technology such as Johnson Controls OpenBlue solutions building owners can use artificial intelligence to improve a building's performance and better predict maintenance requirements.

That's a win-win scenario for building owners and high-quality HVAC suppliers alike. The owners get more efficient buildings and the HVAC companies get to sell value-added digital solutions. Moreover the addition of digital technology will create more loyal customers and improve attachment rates leading to improved service revenue over the long term -- a key aim for Carrier.

As such digitization will improve revenue growth and profit margins for the leading HVAC players.

Valuation matters

The growth prospects are not lost on Wall Street analysts and the consensus is for mid-single-digit revenue growth for all three for the foreseeable future. Based on the analyst consensus for free cash flow Johnson Controls and Carrier look like a good value right now.

English eventually emerged as the winner after sinking a birdie putt on the eighth playoff hole (matching the second-longest sudden-death playoff in PGA Tour history) but both golfers were improbable entrants into the playoff to begin with. Third-round leader Bubba Watson led midway through the back nine in Sunday's fourth round with English and Hickok drifting in and out of the lead and co-lead. Finally Watson ejected by playing his last five in 6 over and English and Hickok took the stage.

First English hit a 28-footer on the 18th hole in regulation to get to 13 under. Hickok covered him up with a 6-foot par putt on No. 17 and a 9-foot birdie on No. 18. If he'd missed either this column would have been written two hours earlier than it was written.

The playoff felt more like a chaotic U.S. Open than most of last week's U.S. Open did. For much of it the crowd on 18 (which was played six times!) sounded like Cameron Indoor Arena. The standard bearer for the pairing had to be replaced because of exhaustion and Hickok's buddy (and PGA Tour winner) Sam Burns was reading putts from his yardage book to Hickok's family out on the course.

After both players opened with seven straight pars to start the playoff English finally took the marathon playoff on the 8th playoff hole with the first birdie of extra time. The scorecard doesn't tell the story though because 14 straight 4s on two different playoff holes sounds boring and this was anything but that.

The eight-hole playoff – only the 1949 Motor City Open went longer in PGA Tour history – was not a ball-striking exhibition but it did include eight (!!) putts made from 5 or more feet including a 15-footer from Hickok on the sixth playoff hole and a 16-footer from English for the win.

The tide seemed to turn on every hole. When English was up against the side of a bunker on the second playoff hole after Hickok lipped out a 43-footer for birdie it looked for certain that Hickok would win his first PGA Tour title. Then when Hickok blew his putt past the hole to 15 feet on that sixth playoff hole English seemed just as much of a certainty. And yet nobody could make anything but a 4 for the last 100 minutes of the tournament.

Finally English did so and thus ended one of the more bizarre fun moments of the golf season. This is golf. It is not a normal sport. Often the least expected canvases provide the most interesting paintings. That's what we got on Sunday between English and Hickok somebody nobody could have picked out of a lineup before the day started but whose name was being chanted by the end of it. Fourteen straight pars does not sound like much -- and on a Thursday afternoon it would not be -- but somehow on this Sunday evening it was enough to deliver some of the most wonderful golf of the entire season. Grade (for both): A+

Here are the rest of our grades for the 2021 Travelers Championship.

Brooks Koepka (T5): Koepka actually finished third in this field on the week from tee to green but putted horribly (the worst of anyone in the top 10 on the leaderboard). He said after his round Sunday that he's going to take 10 days off from golf following a busy stretch and gave a really fascinating answer to the ubiquitous question – at least with him –

""The focus and discipline is there in a major where it's not here"" said Koepka. ""I kind of go for everything. I'm not trying to finish second. It's just I think the majors are easier to win if you're disciplined. Out here I think there are a lot more guys that have the opportunity to win just the way it sets up. Instead of having [the pin] like three [yards] off the side you've got five [yards]. So you got a little more room for error and I think that's why."" Grade: A-

Bubba Watson (T19): Bubba led for most of the day before that late bogey-bogey-bogey-double bogey-bogey meltdown. It was tough to watch. Everything was blocked so far left and each approach shot was seemingly worse than the one before it. He played so well all week and has been such a monster on this course throughout his career that the finish seemed completely out of place (not to mention unexpected). It was a missed opportunity to tie Billy Casper with four Travelers Championship wins but still mostly was a solid week for him. Grade: B

Dustin Johnson (T25): A strange week for D.J. who bookended a 68-65 middle of his tournament with a 70-71. The big problem for him has been with his irons. He's lost strokes in 14 of his last 27 measured rounds on approach shots including two of four at TPC River Highlands. He was actually nearly last in the field on Sunday alone and this after a fall in which he barely had any negative rounds on approach shots at all. To me it is pretty clearly the thing that needs fixing in his game right now. Grade: B-",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMjQvdHJhdmVsL2FsY29ob2wtZnJlZS12YWNhdGlvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hold the Tequila. The Sunrise Is All Some Travelers Need. (Published 2021),"One year into the coronavirus pandemic after months of gaining weight and feeling groggy Mayra Ramirez stopped drinking. And this summer she’ll mark a new milestone for her sobriety: a completely alcohol-free vacation.

Ms. Ramirez 32 spent the first 12 months of the pandemic working remotely from a tiny Brooklyn apartment drinking every weekend and many weekday evenings as well. In March like many others during this hard year she realized her drinking was spiraling beyond the merely social kind. She has now been sober for three months. So when she began scouting locations for a break with a few non-sober friends she suggested Sedona Ariz. where they all will hike and wake up early and she will avoid potential pitfalls like nightclubs and beachfront bars.

Many Americans turned to alcohol to blunt the stress isolation and fear of the past 15 months: An October study in JAMA Network Open the journal of the American Medical Association found that Americans were drinking 14 percent more than in the previous year. Now as vaccination levels rise and Americans head back to the roads and skies sober travel a subset of vacations once relegated only to 12-steppers and recovering addicts is going mainstream.

Ditching the drinks

In a June poll of more than 23000 people by Branded Research 29 percent of respondents said they planned to take an alcohol-free trip after the pandemic. Forty-seven percent of the respondents to American Express’s Global Travel Trends Report in March said that wellness and mental health were among their top motivators for travel in 2021 and an analysis of social media chatter from Hootsuite a social-media management platform showed mentions of the term “sober vacation” jumping more than 100 percent over Memorial Day weekend.

There are a number of reasons I'm excited to go back to this incredible country such as the picturesque landscapes charming buildings and friendly community but Iceland's support of the LGBTQ+ community is one reason that is especially important to me.

TPG has covered why Iceland is a great place to visit for families and solo travelers but some may not know that it is also an excellent destination for the queer community and allies to consider as Iceland one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly countries in the world.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

A decades-long fight for LGBTQ+ rights in Iceland has led to tremendous strides in gay and lesbian equality. In 2006 same-sex couples received equal access to adoption and same-sex marriage has been legal since 2010. Iceland was also the first country to elect an openly gay head of government after Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir became Prime Minister of Iceland in 2009 and most recently the country passed an identity-affirming bill in 2020 that allows individuals to choose a third gender option known as ""X"" on official documents.

The National Queer Association of Iceland works diligently to ensure equal rights for all queer people in Iceland and to further serve the queer community. Founded in 1978 the organization works to educate and engage politicians on queer issues and hosts an open house every Thursday at their offices located near Reykjavik City Hall.

Bad luck continues to haunt Mike Soroka as the Atlanta Braves pitcher reinjured his Achilles walking to the team's clubhouse.

Per an official announcement from the team Soroka re-tore his Achilles tendon while talking to Truist Park on Thursday. He will undergo surgery to repair the injury and miss the rest of the 2021 season.

Soroka made just three starts during the 2020 season before tearing his Achilles in the third inning of a game against the New York Mets. The 23-year-old had successful surgery on Aug. 8

Speaking to Mark Bowman of MLB.com soon after his surgery Soroka said he was ""hoping to be pushing our [medical] staff"" to letting him get back to pitching activities around the beginning of the year.

Even though that didn't happen Soroka looked to be on track for a return at some point this season. Things took a downward turn on April 7 when he was shut down with shoulder discomfort while pitching at the Braves' alternate training site.

Braves manager Brian Snitker told reporters on May 17 that Soroka underwent exploratory surgery on his Achilles.

Soroka told reporters last week the procedure revealed his body rejected the sutures from a previous surgery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVybG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVuLzI3L29sZ2Etd2VuZ2VydC1qb2lucy1hbWVyaXMtYmFuay1hcy1icmFuY2gtbWFuYWdlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Olga Wengert joins Ameris Bank as branch manager,"by: Ellen Cowens Harrison

Ameris Bank Market President Cecil Gibson announces that Olga Wengert has joined Ameris Bank as branch manager of the Palm Coast location.

In this role Wengert will be responsible for building and maintaining banking relationships in the Palm Coast area and managing the daily operations of the branch.

Prior to joining Ameris she was a branch leader and small business relationship manager at BB&T now Truist.

“We are excited to have Olga join and lead our team in Palm Coast” said Ameris Bank Market President Cecil Gibson. “Her dedication to her clients and community combined with her financial knowledge and leadership experience will be invaluable as we continue to grow and serve Palm Coast.”

Wengert graduated from Keiser University with a bachelor’s in health care administration.

Wengert is proud of all the continued growth throughout Flagler County and enjoys supporting the flourishing community through various volunteer opportunities.

“I have a strong passion for serving my community continuing my personal growth and being part of the solution for my clients’ needs” said Wengert. “I am excited to join the Ameris Bank team and commit to the success of Flagler County.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL21sYi9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzMxNzEyNzYxL2F0bGFudGEtYnJhdmVzLW1pa2Utc29yb2thLXBpdGNoLTIwMjEtdGVhcmluZy1hY2hpbGxlcy10ZW5kb24tYWdhaW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Braves' Mike Soroka unlikely to pitch in 2021 after tearing Achilles tendon again,"CINCINNATI -- Atlanta Braves right-hander Mike Soroka is facing season-ending surgery after again tearing his right Achilles tendon.

The Braves said Saturday that Soroka suffered the new tear Thursday while walking to the clubhouse at Truist Park where he was continuing his rehabilitation while the team is at Cincinnati.

""It was his first day out of the boot'' manager Brian Snitker said before Saturday's game at Great American Ball Park. ""He was just walking. I hate it for him. All signs were a go until he took that step and felt that pop.""

Soroka now faces his third surgery on the Achilles. The team said the procedure will be scheduled within a week.

There was no timetable for Soroka's return prior to this latest setback although Snitker said he was hopeful that he could return by the end of this season. Soroka had not yet started throwing off the mound.

Snitker texted Soroka on Saturday morning after hearing the news and later spoke with him by phone.

""He's put things in perspective'' Snitker said. ""He's ready for this next journey he's going to be on. The day it happened it really punched him in the gut.''

Soroka who was Atlanta's Opening Day starter in 2020 first tore the Achilles against the New York Mets on Aug. 3. He had season-ending surgery and was working to return this season when he suffered a setback in May that led to a follow-up procedure.

He was again working to return this season before tearing the same Achilles. The Braves said an MRI confirmed the new tear.

Soroka emerged as one of the foundations of the Braves' rotation in 2019 when he went 13-4 with a 2.68 ERA. The Canadian pitcher earned a spot in the All-Star Game and finished second in National League Rookie of the Year balloting and sixth for the Cy Young Award.

News of Soroka's setback spread through the Braves' clubhouse Saturday.

""They're all sick for him'' Snitker said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXRobGV0aWMuY29tLzQyMDgzNzQvMjAyMS8wNi8yNi9icmF2ZXMtbWlrZS1zb3Jva2EtdG8taGF2ZS1zZWFzb24tZW5kaW5nLXN1cmdlcnktYWZ0ZXItcmUtdGVhcmluZy1hY2hpbGxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braves' Mike Soroka to have season-ending surgery after re-tearing Achilles,"Atlanta Braves right-hander Mike Soroka will not return this season after re-tearing his Achilles this week the team announced Saturday.

The Braves said Soroka ""felt a pop in his right Achilles"" while walking to the clubhouse at Truist Park on Thursday. An MRI revealed the tendon injury. Soroka will undergo season-ending surgery which will be scheduled within the week.

Soroka tore his right Achilles last August and had surgery to repair it. In mid-May he suffered a setback and underwent exploratory surgery to find out what was going on with his Achilles. Prior to that the team remained optimistic that the 23-year-old might be back by mid-April but certainly no later than May.

In 2020 Soroka posted a 3.95 ERA with eight strikeouts in 13.2 innings pitched before tearing his Achilles. The shortened season followed his standout 2019 campaign in which he finished with a 2.68 ERA and only 14 homers allowed in 174.2 innings.

GO DEEPER Mike Soroka faces more career uncertainty after tearing his Achilles again

Analyzing his injury

Virginia Zakas Inside Injuries: Soroka suffered a complete rupture of his right Achilles tendon for the second time in under a year. This is already a tough injury to come back from but doing it a second time is career-threatening.

Soroka will undergo surgery to repair the Achilles tendon again. He may need a graft this time as a repair wasn’t strong enough the first time.

Soroka's current estimated timeline is a return next July but this is very optimistic. I would not be surprised if Soroka does not pitch at all in 2022. If Soroka is able to return to the majors at some point in the next two years I don’t expect him to be the same pitcher he was before his initial injury.

How big of a blow is this?

David O'Brien Braves beat writer: This is a big blow to the Braves and devastating for Soroka who entered 2020 as a Cy Young candidate after his tremendous performance in 2019 during his first full season in the majors.

He tore the Achilles in his third start in 2020 and was ahead of rehab expectations aiming for an April 2021 return before a series of setbacks and second ""exploratory"" procedure in May.

The Braves still hoped to have him back by September but now that he has re-torn the Achilles he's back to square one. And there will be more concerns not just about whether he'll be ready next spring but how this could affect his career.

New Church NC and Awake Church have each spent $1.3 million on former retail properties along Reynolda Road in the Old Town community.

New Church acquired in August the former AMC Classic 10-screen theater at 3640 Reynolda Road. It has been active in the Winston-Salem area since 2011.

New Church pastor Matt Richardson said renovations began in earnest in March. The goal is to hold worship services in the 40000-square-foot building by Christmas. New Church is moving from the Robinhood Road YMCA.

Last week Awake bought the 73000-square-foot Reynolda Commons shopping center with plans to convert the former Harris Teeter anchor site into 33000 square feet of ministry and office space by June 2022.

Awake is moving from the 7840 North Point Blvd. location next to Rockin’ Jump. It has been active in the Winston-Salem area since 2001.

Awake will lease the shopping center’s remaining 40000 square feet to up to 16 tenants with spaces between 1400 and 9400 square feet available.

Each church had bought property in the Reynolds and Yadkinville roads area that they now plan to sell as new construction costs have climbed sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Richardson said the theater site accomplished the goals of “finding our home as soon as possible while being good managers of what the Lord has blessed us with.”

Matt Peterson Awake’s pastor said renovating the Harris Teeter space will save the church at least 33% on its original project budget.

Awake acquired the shopping center site for a significant discount. According to a Linville Team Partners real-estate flier the asking price for the property was $3.95 million.

Lease payments from tenants will help pay for the projected $3 million to $3.5 million in up-fit expenses “so we’re not solely dependent on tithes and offerings to pay for the changes” Peterson said.

Different looks

Both pastors said that while their new facilities will not present the typical church look on the outside they will convey a sense of comfort and hope on the inside.

“There is a trend away from the traditional church face” Richardson said. “We know it’s not going to be about a building but about building community and uplifting people.”

“We believe the first couple of minutes of people experiencing church is so important” Richardson said in a March Facebook posting that served as a video tour of the theater after it had gone through the gutting stage.

“We want it to feel like home as your friend and neighbors and co-workers come to experience the love of Jesus. This is their first touchpoint with that and it really matters.”

Richardson described the symbolism of tearing down the wall between the main theater viewing areas with “spiritual walls falling for people all over our city ... and what Jesus will accomplish in this space.”

Having its own facilities will allow New Church to expand its outreach “because it will be able to be open when we want to be” Richardson said.

“It has been an amazing blessing to be at the Robinhood YMCA but our ability to congregate was at the discretion of its operating hours.”

Peterson said he has heard rumblings of concerns about the two churches becoming competition for each other for potential members in the Old Town area.

“We believe having the churches close together will lend itself to collaborations and elevating the churches as beacons of Christ” Patterson said.

Peterson said that while the church will have the outdoor structural look of the former Harris Teeter it won’t be all that dissimilar to its North Point Boulevard facade.

“We are energized by this opportunity to become another heart in our new community and expand our mission to outreach and serve” Peterson said.

New experiences

For both churches the main motivation for buying and renovating existing retail space is growth both in terms of Sunday worship services and space for children and adult ministries and church offices.

Peterson said Awake will be able to expand from about 600 in attendance as the church has reopened during the pandemic to at least 800.

Richardson said New Church’s goal is increasing worship capacity from 130 to 450.

Both plan to dedicate lobby space to a coffee shop and other amenities.

Even though Richardson said New Church has attracted viewers through its online presence during the pandemic “we firmly believe that people will want to come back to in-person worship and community.”

“You can’t replicate that community feeling from your couch.”

Awake plans to keep the 24-foot ceiling in the church section and 14-foot ceilings in the tenant spaces.

“There will be a new roof a resurfaced parking lot” Peterson said.

“Since we don’t advertise but depend on word of mouth we believe we will benefit immensely from the traffic along Reynolda and Yadkinville roads along with being closer in proximity to Wake Forest University.

Peterson said Awake selected the shopping center for more than just available space for growth.

“The property’s location holds significance as it sits at the end of the Bethabara Park Trail and only three miles from our current location” the church said on its website.

“Bethabara is where the first Moravian missionaries settled built a large grain-mill which provided food and protection for their whole village and even hundreds of refugees.

“The mill was just a few hundred yards from our new building and in its honor we plan to rename the shopping center to The Mill on Reynolda.”

Similar projects

The soon-to-be Awake and New Church neighbors are just the latest of at least four examples of local churches opting to transform retail or other closed or underused facilities into much-needed growth space.

In 2019 Elevation Church of Matthews paid $3.15 million to buy the Gateway YWCA property at 1310 S. Main St. where a church plant already had been conducting weekly worship services.

The church holds 9:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Sunday worship services there.

The facility has been renovated to provide permanent spaces for worship and children’s ministries and an expanded fitness area for the YWCA.

In 2018 Two Cities Church moved into a former Chatham Manufacturing Co. facility at 854 W. Northwest Blvd. where it holds three Sunday services.

“We are a church for all people. We are diverse socioeconomically as well as generationally with many college students young professionals and many from the medical community” Kyle Mercer lead pastor for Two Cities said in 2018.

“We believe in moral proximity and that it matters where our church gathers. We will dream big start small and go deep.”

Mercer said the church became interested in the developers’ Northwest Boulevard plans out of their “eagerness to be a part of the community (there)” as part of living up to its mission and its name.

“We realize we are at the intersection of many different and diverse neighborhoods. We are moving into that community and are looking forward to learning a lot” Mercer said.

Prudent step

The trend of churches buying or gaining access to retail and other public venues is a prudent financial step said Raymond Collins with Collins Commercial Properties Inc. of Winston-Salem.

“Adaptive reuse of an existing structure is demonstratively cheaper in occupancy cost than ground-up construction particularly at this point in time where construction costs are as much as 50% or more above the norm” Collins said.

“It is better to retrofit an existing vacant structure and parking field rather than go through the throes of acquiring land entitling the land for construction going through architectural and engineering expense and then the very high cost of vertical construction.

“Additionally the user can be in place much faster than ground-up construction” Collins said.

Collins said another benefit from the four churches locating in non-traditional church settings is that “the larger non-denominational often semi-evangelical high-growth churches such as Elevation and perhaps Awake often seek out and cater to the unchurched” Collins said.

“First-time church attendees or long term non-attendees are more likely to attend a non-traditional church facility often offering a more modern and non-traditional church service such as casual dress casual seating and with more popular-based music with guitars basses and drums rather than traditional organ or piano music” Collins said.

Collins said the churches’ infrastructure decision is a promising trend for absorbing existing space at a time when some retail venues are losing tenants to either closings or downsizing.

“It does speak to the fact that property owners are looking to non-retail buyers or tenants to stabilize their assets or to sell to when the likelihood of re-tenanting with traditional retail may be a long shot” Collins said.

“Hanes Mall would be another example of this” he said citing Truliant Federal Credit Union buying the former Macy’s department store property and Novant Health Inc. the former Sears’s department-store property.

Truliant is expected to unveil its new operation by the end of 2021. Its goal is having more than 550 employees in the mall space compared with 425 employees on its nearby headquarters campus.

Novant is using the Sears property in the short term as a mass-vaccination site but has not announced long-term plans.

Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi an economics professor at Winston-Salem State University said the Awake purchase of Reynolda Commons “is a somewhat unique endeavor that could be a model for future malls.”

“By having the main tenant also be the landlord there is a vested interest to maintain complementary tenants that can effectively enhance the mall into a unique shared community.

“This is often missed by mall operators that do not always see how different tenants might interact to create either a cohesive or divisive space” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtZm9vZC5jb20vbmV3cy9mb29kLWdpYW50cy1zaWduLXVwLXRvLW5ldy1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLWVhcnRoLWVjby1sYWJlbGxpbmctc2NoZW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food giants sign up to new Foundation Earth eco-labelling scheme,"A group of food manufacturers and retailers have signed up for a new project Foundation Earth which will see front-of-pack labels put on products to give an indication of environmental impact.

Through a pilot launch this autumn non-profit organisation Foundation Earth will issue front-of-pack eco-scores on food and drink products. The labels will rate a product’s environmental credentials using a traffic-light scoring system devised by the consultancy Mondra.

The system behind the labels looks at farming processing packaging and transport. It assesses the environmental impact of a product based upon carbon (49% weighted) water usage (17%) water pollution (17%) and biodiversity loss (17%).

In parallel to the pilot will be a nine-month research and development programme funded by Nestlé that will combine the Mondra method with a system devised by an EU-funded consortium of Belgium’s Leuven University and Spanish research agency AZTI.

The consortium is brought together under the auspices of the European Commission’s food innovation initiative EIT Food. The aim of the programme is to prepare Foundation Earth for a Europe-wide roll-out in 2022.

“The Mondra and EIT systems are unique globally in that they both allow two products of the same type to be compared on their individual merits via a complete product life cycle analysis as opposed to simply using secondary data to estimate the environmental impact of an entire product group” Jago Pearson chief strategy officer at Finnebrogue told Just Food.

Under the system generic chicken nuggets would get a B label and blueberries a C but the scores for individual products will vary depending on production methods.

Northern Ireland-based Finnebrogue is among the food manufacturers and retailers set to take part in the pilot launch. Participants also include private-label supplier Greencore meat-free business The Meatless Farm and UK retailer Marks and Spencer.

Two other UK food retailers Sainsbury’s and The Co-op as well as Spanish grocer Eroski are also supporting the initiative. Along with M&S Nestle and Tyson they will sit on Foundation Earth’s industry advisory group to discuss how the labels could be rolled out across the industry. None of these companies are taking part in the pilot launch.

Asked why Nestlé was participating in the pilot Johannes Weber the company’s European affairs manager said: “Nestlé is excited about the possibility to partner with Foundation Earth on a research program to look into these environmental footprint approaches. The ultimate goal of this study is to test labelling our products. Since the cooperation has just started today we cannot confirm when the first Nestlé products will be on-shelf. We will do a pilot as soon as possible.”

He added: “This pan-European scientific project will help us to further develop the concept of communicating the environmental impact of our food and beverage products. Foundation Earth will provide us with the opportunity to test environmental footprint methods learn how different products perform and establish how consumers respond. We hope this could help inform discussions in Europe with regards to a universal system for environmental scores.”

The scheme is supported by the UK government. George Eustice the country’s Environment Food and Rural Affairs Secretary said: “Foundation Earth’s ambition to develop eco-labelling on food has the potential to help address the urgent challenges of sustainability and climate change.”

Andy Zynga chief executive of EIT Food added: “The launch of Foundation Earth is a very significant moment for the European food industry. It is the culmination of years of work from our EIT Food consortium and from the likes of Oxford University. It will bring about a credible and clear front-of-pack environmental labelling system on food products right across the continent.”

Professor Chris Elliott chair of the Foundation’s scientific advisory committee said: “The development of a more transparent sustainable global food supply system is of huge importance to the health of our planet and health of all citizens. We need a system based on the core principles of integrity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdyb2Nlci5jby51ay9zb3VyY2luZy9mb3VuZGF0aW9uLWVhcnRoLWZvb2QtY29tcGFuaWVzLWFuZC1yZXRhaWxlcnMtY3JlYXRlLWVjby1sYWJlbGxpbmctc2NoZW1lLzY1NzQ0NS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Foundation Earth: food companies and retailers create eco-labelling scheme,"Global food giants such as Nestlé alongside retailers including M&S the Co-op and Sainsbury’s are among the members of a new non-profit organisation that will roll out front-of-pack eco-scores on food from September.

Foundation Earth which is also supported by a host of UK food brands and top food and environmental scientists was the brainchild of late Finnebrogue Artisan founder Denis Lynn who devised the scheme’s concept but died in May following a freak quadbike accident.

The labelling scheme will draw on data from the world’s two leading systems for measuring the environmental impact of food production – devised by advisory company Mondra and the EU-funded food innovation initiative EIT Food.

The foundation will roll out a pilot of its traffic light-style scores on products sold by M&S Costa Coffee and a group of the UK’s leading food brands in September using the Mondra method – which draws on data from a paper published by researchers at Oxford University and Swiss research institute Agroscope in 2018. It is aiming for a full rollout of the labelling scheme across Europe from next year.

Measuring criteria including a product’s carbon emissions water usage impact on biodiversity loss and water pollution the scheme will also analyse a product’s environmental impact from farming processing packaging and transport.

The foundation’s aim was “to promote more sustainable buying choices from consumers and more environmentally friendly innovation from food producers who will be determined to secure a better score” it said.

Alongside Nestlé and the three UK supermarket chains protein giant Tyson Foods and Spanish supermarket Eroski sit on Foundation Earth’s industry advisory group. Each business has signed up to “explore the potential for environmental labelling on food products and to support Foundation Earth’s ambition to help build a more sustainable food industry”. A separate scientific committee will be led by food safety expert Professor Chris Elliott.

In addition to the September pilot Nestlé is funding an intensive nine-month research & development programme to prepare the foundation for a full Europe-wide rollout by the autumn of 2022.

The R&D programme will combine the Mondra scoring method with a system devised by an EIT-funded consortium of Belgium’s Leuven University and Spanish research agency AZTI.

Foundation Earth said the Mondra and EIT systems were globally unique because they both allowed two products of the same type to be compared on their individual merits via a complete product life cycle analysis as opposed to simply using secondary data to estimate the environmental impact of an entire product group.

The initiative would “create a universal eco-labelling scheme that is based on good science and that customers can easily follow” said M&S while Denis Lynn’s daughters called on the rest of the food sector to support the initiative and “help us finish the job our Dad started”.

Lynn’s company Finnebrogue Artisan and its Naked brand is among those who will take part in the September trial and carry the new eco-scores. Other companies taking part include Meatless Farm Greencore Abel & Cole M&S and Mash Direct.

Environment secretary George Eustice said the foundation’s ambition to develop a universal eco-labelling scheme had “the potential to help address the urgent challenges of sustainability and climate change”.

M&S head of food innovation Dominic Darby added that the retailer – one of the first to launch front-of-pack nutrition traffic lights – saw “real power in the collaboration between supply chains manufacturers brands and retailers to create a universal eco-labelling scheme that is based on good science and that customers can easily follow”.

Meanwhile Nestlé’s European Affairs manager Johannes Weber said the project would “help us to further develop the concept of communicating the environmental impact of our food and beverage products”.

Foundation Earth provided “the opportunity to test environmental footprint methods learn how different products perform and establish how consumers respond” he added. “We hope this could help inform discussions in Europe with regards to a universal system for environmental scores.”"

In spite of the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic China expanded its aggregate Tier 1 capital and total assets in 2020 by 18.6% and 18.4% respectively. In addition its pre-tax profits increased by 5.2% year-on-year while profits fell by 31.5% in the US (see Table 1).

The Chinese banking industry has also improved cost and capital efficiency. China now holds 25.6% of the world’s assets ($148.6 trillion) and generates 37.2% of profits while the US holds 13.5% of assets and generates 18.5% of profits.

The four largest Chinese banks – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China – have consolidated their positions at the top of the Top 1000 World Bank ranking (see Table 2). This is the fourth year running that they have topped the ranking.

Joy Macknight editor of The Banker says “During a challenging year for the world’s banking industry the top Chinese banks have extended their lead over US counterparts with double-digit growth in Tier 1 capital as well as expanding their asset base and increasing profits. They have exhibited impressive resilience in difficult times.”

ICBC has held the top spot since The Banker’s 2013 ranking. This year the world’s largest lender by both Tier 1 capital and total assets grew the former by 15.7% and the latter by 18.6%. The Chinese megabank now has almost double the Tier 1 capital of the largest US bank JPMorgan Chase ($439.9bn versus $234.8bn respectively).

China Construction Bank in second place improved its Tier 1 position by 14.4% ($361.6bn) while Agricultural Bank of China (3rd place) and Bank of China (4th place) grew their Tier 1 capital by 21.1% ($336.2bn) and 18.1% ($305.1bn) respectively. All four banks saw an increase in profits recording the highest profits in the ranking (see Table 3).

Chinese banks in total increased their Tier 1 capital by 18.6% as against 8.5% for US banks.

The stadium is well known for its almost-deafening crowds.

That on top of the facilities that stadium has to offer helped the Vikings’ home field rank as the No. 1 in the NFL according to our friends at Touchdown Wire. Mark Lane of Touchdown Wire wrote:

“The Minnesota Vikings managed to get a venue that mimics having a retractable roof without actually opening it up and exposing the fans and players to the inhospitable Minneapolis weather. The stadium also provides iconic scenes of downtown. The exterior is a bit asymmetrical but it is nevertheless one of the more visually appealing venues in all of sports.”

As of now the Vikings should be able to utilize their home-field advantage once again. The league expects to play with full stadiums in 2021. That should help plenty of teams affect opposing offenses with a hostile environment Minnesota included.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9maW5hbmNlLzU2MDQyMS1jb21tb24tc2Vuc2UtcnVsZXMtY2FuLWN1cmUtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3lzLWN1cnNlL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9maW5hbmNlLzU2MDQyMS1jb21tb24tc2Vuc2UtcnVsZXMtY2FuLWN1cmUtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3lzLWN1cnNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Common sense rules can cure cryptocurrency’s curse,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/560421-common-sense-rules-can-cure-cryptocurrencys-curse/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9maW5hbmNlLzU2MDQyMS1jb21tb24tc2Vuc2UtcnVsZXMtY2FuLWN1cmUtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3lzLWN1cnNlL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9maW5hbmNlLzU2MDQyMS1jb21tb24tc2Vuc2UtcnVsZXMtY2FuLWN1cmUtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3lzLWN1cnNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW53b3JsZC5jb20vbmV3cy91cy1jb2lucy93ZXN0ZXJuLWJhbmstZ2V0cy0yMDIxLWQtaGFsZi1kb2xsYXJzLWluLW5vbi1taW50LXJvbGxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Western bank gets 2021-D half dollars in non-Mint rolls,"Circulation quality 2021-D Kennedy half dollars were obtained at a Washington State bank although such issues have not been put into circulation by the U.S. Mint for two decades.

Washington State collector Daryl Anderson was pleasantly surprised in mid-June when he stopped at his local bank to acquire any rolls of U.S. half dollars he could search and was offered a $500 face value box of circulation-quality 2021-D Kennedy half dollars.

The U.S. Mint has not intentionally issued any Kennedy half dollars into general circulation through the Federal Reserve since 2001. So how did the coins make their way into circulation?

Anderson said the teller at Banner Bank in Anacortes Washington from whom he obtained the half dollars said the bank had inadvertently placed an order for half dollars when they actually needed quarter dollars for customer transactions.

The 1000 half dollars Anderson obtained were boxed in a cardboard container marked $500 / HALVES holding 25 20-coin rolls. The white paper wrappers are not the same that the Mint uses for an outside contractor to roll its coins for numismatic sales. The wrappers read $10 HALVES. The U.S. Mint wrappers are printed with U.S. MINT.

Commercial banks in Washington are served through the Seattle branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco with coins delivered to armored carriers for delivery. Anderson said Anacortes Bank officials declined to identify which armored carrier delivered the half dollars to the facility.

Beginning in 2002 collectors seeking circulation quality Kennedy half dollars from production at the Philadelphia and Denver Mints have had to purchase 20-coin paper-wrapped rolls directly from the U.S. Mint as numismatic products at premiums above face value.

On Friday the Knochenmus family owners of Ralco announced they have signed a purchase agreement with Schwan’s Company for the Landmark Mercantile and New Atlantic Hotel buildings at the corner of Main Street and College Drive. Current tenants Bello Cucina and U.S. Bank will stay on the buildings’ main level but there are plans to turn part of the upper levels into a new corporate ofice for Ralco.

“We are excited about this opportunity to turn this beautiful and historic property into a business center to serve our community” said Jon Knochenmus president emeritus of Ralco. “Ralco is celebrating our 50th anniversary and this is a great way for us to thank the community that has supported us and to show our commitment to Marshall.”

The news was exciting for the Marshall community as well said Marshall EDA Director Lauren Deutz. “It’s a building we would like to see filled” she said. Deutz said the EDA had been working with Ralco for a few months but the Knochenmus family’s plans for the New Atlantic and Mercantile buildings were “bigger than what we imagined.”

The announcement follows Ralco’s recent groundbreaking for both a new distribution center on Highway 23 and a new research farm north of Marshall.

“We have been very blessed to have so many gifted people at Ralco and it is important for us to have work environments that support our growth creativity and collaboration” said Ralco President and CEO Brian Knochenmus.

“We are a company focused on science and technology with 21 patents and 60 additional pending. We need to keep innovating and this new space will enable us to create a great environment for our people to continue expanding solutions for our customers.”

Closing on the purchase agreement is planned for later this summer and Ralco plans to be in their new space in early 2022. Besides converting part of the second floor into Ralco offices there are also plans to complete space for additional retail businesses in the future to convert the third floor of the Mercantile into a community event center and to create short-term room rentals for business travelers on the third floor of the New Atlantic Hotel building.

“We’re very grateful for Ralco’s decision” said Marshall Mayor Bob Byrnes. “It really show’s Ralco’s commitment to Marshall in establishing the new corporate office in downtown.”

Preserving the New Atlantic Hotel building also helps protect a piece of Marshall’s history Byrnes said. The New Atlantic building currently standing at Main Street and College Drive dates back to 1926. However the location has been the site of a hotel for more than 100 years going back before the original Atlantic Hotel was built.

In the early 2000s the Schwan’s Company renovated the New Atlantic Hotel building with restaurant and commercial space on the main floor and built the Mercantile building next door.

The property has more than 45000 square feet of space."

DULUTH Minn. — If you’ve tried ordering an Uber or Lyft in Duluth recently you may have noticed the “few drivers available” warning on the apps.

It’s a national problem Americans are dealing with after the country has reopened for business and there’s no telling how much longer it’s going to continue.

Some college seniors in Duluth say that when they do try ordering an Uber or Lyft the wait is usually 45 minutes and then the driver cancels.

So to enjoy a night out after a year of restrictions these women are walking to the bar at night with pepper spray in hand.

“Usually we walk back from the bars and that is five miles from where we are right now so it’s not always the safest way to get back home” Avery Helback a UMD senior said.

Uber and Lyft driver Jeff Bushnell said the demand is so high as soon as he turns on one of the apps it connects him to a rider in seconds.

He adds that he’s met customers who have waited for a ride for up to two hours after landing at the Duluth International Airport.

“The Ubers and Lyfts there just aren’t enough of us right now” Bushnell said.

The national worker shortage has hit many industries across the country with the conversation focusing on the federal unemployment bonus that began during the pandemic.

In Minnesota and Wisconsin that bonus isn’t expected to expire until September.

“It’s definitely playing a big role there’s no doubt about it…and not having the need to go out and do Uber and make the extra income in their lives that’s what’s left us scarce” Bushnell said.

That means there are less rides for those hitting the bar and restaurant scene again leaving some people to try rationalizing drunk driving as some college students have seen with some of their friends.

“Being more risky for sure like ‘oh I’ve only had like two or three [drinks]’ but you know they’ve had more and it’s like are you sure you’re good to drive and they’re like ‘oh yeah.” Helbeck said of her conversations with friends. ‘They don’t have any other way to get there. so it’s just like that’s kind their only option but I don’t know it’s really dangerous.”

While customers who rely on rideshare services have been suffering from the driver shortage the taxi industry is making a comeback because of it.

“I’d say we’ve probably doubled our business in the last year” Kurt Lagarde co-owner of SK Taxi said. The business offers cab rides in Duluth and Superior.

Lagarde adds that he plans to double the amount of drivers on staff to more than 40 of them and the business is even launching an app in July similar to Uber and Lyft.

“I think when the pandemic hit we actually got busier because you get people taking the cabs and not riding public transportation on the buses” he said. “Now after the pandemic you know we’re definitely seeing new faces we’re seeing a lot more groups on weekends going out.”

The problem goes deeper than those needing a safe ride home after a night out. Those in the Twin Ports without their own wheels are having a harder time getting around with the driver shortage with no end in sight of when this industry will truly get back to normal.

“I’m from Duluth and it’s still I still get amazed sometimes the demand for people needing rides whether it’s a DTA bus or an Uber or a taxi or a boat it’s just a very high demand area for people to need rides” Bushnell said.

Early numbers from the Duluth Police Department show that there hasn’t been a big increase in drunk driving arrests on the roads so far but the city is expecting the numbers to jump around big summer holidays like the 4th of July and Labor Day weekend.

Uber and Lyft sent similar statements to FOX21 acknowledging the problem and hoping that more drivers will start up again soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL3RlY2gvdWJlci11YmVyZWF0cy1jZW8tZGFyYS1raG9zcm93c2hhaGktYjE4NzM2NTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dara Khosrowshahi: Uber CEO works on app for a day and reveals how much drivers can make,"Sign up to our free weekly IndyTech newsletter delivered straight to your inbox Sign up to our free IndyTech newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi whose annual salary is more than $12 million revealed on Twitter how much Uber Eats drivers can make after tweeting about his experience and profits working on the app for a day in San Francisco.

“Spent a few hours delivering for @UberEats” he wrote on Saturday. “SF is an absolutely beautiful town. Restaurant workers were incredibly nice every time. It was busy!!”

Twitter users asked him to share a detailed breakdown of his trips on the food delivery app and the log of deliveries he posted showed that he earned $106.71 during a half-day period meaning his hourly rate was roughly $30 an hour well above the local state and federal minimum wages.

Uber declined to answer questions about the average earnings of drivers in San Francisco and nationally as compared to the minimum wage. According to April 2021 data from the company an Uber driver in San Francisco on the app for 20 hours a week earns a median wage of $25.28 per hour before tips or expenses.

Uber Eats drivers however are part-time contractors who provide their own transportation food healthcare etc and it has been claimed that they can take home less than that median figure sometimes less than minimum wage.

This article was amended on 28 June 2021. The headline and article originally claimed that Mr Khosrowshahi’s tweet revealed that drivers barely make the minimum wage but that was incorrect. We are happy to set the record straight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZHJpdmVyLW93bmVkLXJpZGVzaGFyZS1zZXJ2aWNlLW5ldy15b3JrLWNpdHktcmV2aWV3LTIwMjEtNtIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZHJpdmVyLW93bmVkLXJpZGVzaGFyZS1zZXJ2aWNlLW5ldy15b3JrLWNpdHktcmV2aWV3LTIwMjEtNj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What it's like to use NYC's new driver-owned rideshare service,"The Drivers Cooperative launched in opposition to high commissions Uber and Lyft take from drivers according to the app's website.

Driver Outhay Chokbengboun 46 from Charlotte in the US state of North Carolina filmed the abuse from a passenger at a petrol station last Saturday and shared video of it on the popular social media app.

It’s not clear why Mr Chokbengboun has pulled over or why he’s being abused but it was reported he was driving three people. When they put in the wrong address he told them to correct it leading to the woman’s rant.

In the video a male acquaintance tries to calm the woman and tells her to walk away. He repeatedly apologises to Mr Chokbengboun.

Mr Chokbengboun claims he was called a “c****” and says he’s going to call the police.

The woman named Stella tells the Uber driver to “go f***” himself and to “go back to Asia”.

“This little Asian-American. No I'm not afraid” she says.

“Please take her away before I call 9/11” Mr Chokbengboun tells the man.

The male friend manages to move Stella away and continues to apologise to the Uber driver.

“I work all day and you guys give me the wrong s*** here” Mr Chokbengboun says.

Woman booted from Uber app

The woman identified by Queen City Nerve as Stella Thomas has been suspended from her job at design company AB Ludvig Svensson.

The company told the publication it “strongly” objects to the type of behaviour Ms Thomas exhibited in the video.

She has since resigned.

Uber told WSOC-TV that Ms Stella’s behaviour was “appalling” and it has removed her access to the app.

Anti-Asian hate crimes increase in the US

Anti-Asian hate crimes have been on the rise in the US since the beginning of the Covid pandemic.

A study by California State University’s Center for Study of Hate and Extremism found anti-Asian hate crimes rose 149 per cent from 2019 to 2020. However the figure could is thought to be much higher.

The study found in New York for example the percentage of anti-Asian hate crimes increased 833 per cent.

According to the New York Times to charge a person with a hate crime in the state prosecutors need to show the victim was targeted specifically because of race.

The publication cited some criticisms of the law including a 23-year-old man from Yemen who stabbed a Chinese man in Manhattan.

The perpetrator of the attack was not charged with a hate crime as prosecutors could not find evidence it was racially motivated. The incident prompted anger from New York’s Asian-American leaders who protested.

Such is the concern over the treatment of Asian people during the pandemic the United Nations issued a report in August citing a “serious concern over the rising wave of racist and xenophobic attacks and other incidents against Asian-American communities and individuals”.

Row upon row of green continues to paint the pages of stock sites and apps. The three major indexes -- the S&P 500 Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite -- are at or near all-time highs. There are plenty of reasons the good times could keep on rolling. But eventually a stock market crash will come.

With that in mind we asked some of our Motley Fool contributors which dividend stocks are worth buying even if the market crashes. They chose Brookfield Renewable (BEPC 2.53%) Chevron (CVX 1.79%) and Union Pacific (UNP 0.29%).

Your one-stop clean-energy dividend source

Scott Levine (Brookfield Renewable): From luxury vehicles to heavy-duty trucks each day last summer felt like another electric vehicle (EV) company was hitching a ride with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) to hit the public markets. With so much attention on EVs other areas of the renewable energy sector might have fallen in popularity.

Therein lies an opportunity for savvy investors -- especially those wary of a steep market downturn. Brookfield Renewable provides a simple approach to gaining exposure to the clean-energy industry an approach that also offers investors the chance to get paid handsomely for going green.

A global leader in renewable energy Brookfield Renewable has nearly $60 billion in assets under management. In addition to 8 gigawatts (GW) of hydropower projects the company operates a variety of other renewable energy projects including solar wind energy storage and distributed generation representing a total portfolio of 21 GW.

Because Brookfield Renewable enters into long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with these projects the company has good insight into future cash flows affording it the ability to plan accordingly should a market crash occur. And the cash flows should continue to grow in the days ahead; Brookfield Renewable has 27 GW of projects in its development pipeline.

With the clarity into its future finances that the PPAs afford investors can rest assured that management is well suited to adeptly allocate capital to return cash to shareholders while executing plans to ensure the company's growth. Currently Brookfield Renewable provides investors with an enticing forward dividend yield north of 3% and management aims to increase its payout. In a recent investor presentation for example management reaffirmed its long-stated target of increasing its annual distribution 5% to 9%. And with the company's investment-grade balance sheet which S&P Global Ratings assigns as BBB+ investors can rest easy knowing that the company is in sound financial health a good thing when the market crashes.

A 5% dividend yield that's worth the risk

Daniel Foelber (Chevron): Chevron is one of the rare energy Dividend Aristocrats. Despite booms and busts in the oil and gas market it has been able to boost its annual payout for over 30 consecutive years. This consistency is due in part to the strength of its balance sheet which continues to be arguably the best of the oil majors.

Like its peers Chevron had a rough 2020 but things are looking better so far this year. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude passed $70 per barrel for the first time in over three years which will help Chevron's margins.

For better or worse Chevron stock tends to march to the beat of oil and gas prices rather than if the market is rising or falling. The oil giant has rebounded nicely from its COVID-19 low and is up over 25% year to date handily outperforming the broader indexes.

The expected uptick in earnings due to higher commodity prices is likely baked into its stock price. Chevron did an impressive job slashing its spending and reducing its production costs which has allowed it to return positive free cash flow at lower oil prices. Given this operational advantage a track record for strong financials and consistent dividend raises Chevron is an oil stock worth buying before a market crash.

Union Pacific

Lee Samaha (Union Pacific): It's impossible to predict when a market crash will happen but when it does the likelihood is that most stocks will decline. However what you can do is buy stocks that you are willing to hold through a market decline because they are likely to emerge from a slowdown in good shape. It also helps if they pay a dividend while you wait for better days to come.

In this context a railroad specifically Union Pacific is a great option. Railroads are the veins and arteries of the U.S. industrial economy so if you believe in long-term economic growth then you think railroads will see revenue growth. Moreover they own their infrastructure meaning they have strong market positions. In addition they operate as effective oligopolies. For example Union Pacific and BNSF dominate the West Coast and Norfolk Southern and CSX do the same in the East.

Union Pacific currently pays a well-covered dividend of nearly 2% and management is implementing an ongoing set of initiatives designed to improve profitability over the long term. So all told even when there's a market crash -- likely caused by an economic slowdown -- you can be confident that Union Pacific will emerge from it in good shape when the recovery comes.",,,,,,,,,

Robert Sanford Potter passed away on May 23 2021 in St. Augustine FL as the result of a long life well-lived. His three daughters were with him during his last week and eldest daughter Amy was at his side keeping him company overnight when he passed. Dad was 92 years old. He was loved and will be missed.

Dad came from strong New England and Midwestern stock with a heavy dose of New York ""brass"". Frugal hard working stoic practical stubborn and caring Dad had great common sense an incredible work ethic and an uncanny sense of direction. He might not have said it often but we knew he loved us. Arriving on September 30 1928 in New York City he was the first of three sons born to Harriet Weber Potter and Robert Waldo Potter. Raised in White Plains NY he attended local schools and got into mischief with neighborhood buddies. There are stories of a close call with a friend's father's shotgun siphoning gas during WWII rationing attempting to outrun the local police as an unlicensed driver and always trying to catch the eye of girls. As a teen Dad trained at Camp Smith with a youth program of the NY State Guard. He often commented that the training there was more rigorous and useful than what he later obtained at basic training. He also was a lifeguard at the beach in Rye NY washed dishes at a Howard Johnson on Cape Cod and picked produce at Quaker-run summer camps north of White Plains. One can imagine that these activities were arranged by his parents in an attempt to keep Dad out of trouble and to reinforce some of those New England and Midwestern values.

A life-long lover of cars Dad could gap spark plugs adjust carburetors and drive like a New York cabbie. He could re-point and caulk storm windows and build a bookcase. His musical tastes ranged from Wild Bill Davison to Alison Krauss and everything in-between. He played ice hockey and the drums as a teen. After surprising everyone by graduating from high school in 1945 his parents signed the papers allowing him to enlist in the Army at age 17. Dad received basic training at Fort McClellan and left for Germany on a Liberty Ship embarking from Fort Kilmer NJ. As a member of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment he served for 22 months spending time in Friesling and Inglestaadt.

Never a stellar student by his own admission Dad again surprised everyone by attending Iowa Wesleyan College on the GI Bill. The dapper New Yorker arrived on campus sporting white bucks and soon joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity majored in History and met our mother Georgia ""Jo"" Volkman. After his college graduation they married and settled in her hometown of Hammond Indiana. A stint in area steel mills taught Dad that another path was advisable and he soon began what was to be an almost 30 year career with United Parcel Service in customer service management. Daughters Amy Jan and Jill came along and UPS transferred Dad to Utica NY then to the Metropolitan New York area. Dad moved the family to White Plains and commuted to Long Island Manhattan and Greenwich CT over the course of his career. He made sure he always had a car small enough to park on city streets so that he wouldn't commit the mortal sin of paying for garage parking. Along the way Dad taught himself to sail and all about wine priding himself on discovering bargain reds. Family trips to Michigan Indiana Virginia Quebec New England and Pennsylvania instilled in his daughters either a love or loathing of car trips depending on who you ask. Saturday night drives to Greenwich Village to wander around introduced us to a bigger world. He taught us how to drive a stick shift took us to our first concerts put us through college and walked us down the aisle. He was always willing and able to help with car problems money issues and house projects.

After divorcing and retiring Dad and his second wife Barbara relocated to the Outer Banks NC and later to St. Augustine FL. Dad welcomed Barb's children Neal and Lisa and their families into his world. He was never one to be idle acquiring a long line of boats both sail and power and cars tinkering with them then moving on to another project. Exclamations of ""C'mon Potter"" would echo from his garage as he pushed through a challenging task. He loved working on boats alongside good friends Bob and Jill and getting to know his neighbors on Summer Island. Dad and Barb enjoyed several river boat trips in Europe and their marathon road trips along the Eastern seaboard to visit family and to spend time in Maine. Dad's love for all animals motivated him to volunteer at a bird sanctuary delivering bait to be used for bird food. You can imagine how his cars smelled. As an 80-something Dad rescued an injured pelican from a busy road by throwing his jacket over it wrestling it into his car and reclining his seat to keep it confined to the floor during the trip to the rescue center. Dad and Barb adored many four legged friends including the neighborhood's feral cats. They welcomed regular visits from kids and grandkids. We admired Dad's gumption but feared for his safety when he tried out RV ownership and motorcycle lessons.

After Barbara passed away in 2017 Dad resided with daughter Jan and her husband Alan in Tenants Harbor ME. Two Maine winters were enough and Dad returned to Florida choosing to reside in an assisted living facility in St. Augustine. His last two years were quiet as he lost more mobility and memory. Daughter Jill was his anchor during this time visiting regularly and maintaining a steady cookie supply. Dad's final illness was brief. He leaves behind daughters Amy Rapoza and husband Dan of Marion VA Jan Letourneau and husband Alan of Tenants Harbor ME and Jill Florez and husband Rob of St. Augustine FL. His first wife Jo passed away in 2004. Also surviving him are step-children Neal and Veronica Watkins of Chula Vista CA and Lisa Watkins of New Paltz NY his brothers Theodore and partner Jean Haywood of Pittsfield MA and Joel and Prudence of Worton MD. ""G-Bob"" will be missed by grandchildren Mathew and Kelly Rapoza Seth and Missy Rapoza Kate Letourneau and Andy Lubershane Carrie Letourneau and Will Guinther Daniel Florez Ashley Florez and Andrew and Kadey Florez Jasmine and Dominick Romani Lily Watkins and Ethan Watkins. Great grandchildren include Brody Porter Davis Ryleigh Zoey Eve Natalie Gregory and Luca. Former sister-in-law Jean Potter nieces and nephews from Colorado to the East Coast to Norway also have memories of him to share.

Please talk with your elders and learn of their adventures. Pass the stories on to your loved ones and hold your memories close. Be kind and generous to your family friends and to all animals. If so inclined make a donation to your local animal shelter. Dad would like that.

Everytime you order something off Daraz or make an impulse buy from the latest Instagram thrift store or buy a pair of shoes online from a store because you don’t have it in you to visit an outlet how does your purchase get to you?

Easy. A delivery service picks it up and has it delivered to you in however long it takes. The website will let you know how many business days it is going to take and the delivery service will message you when they have picked up the package when it is on its way to you and when it will be delivered by. In Pakistan the likeliest scenario is that you will be paying cash-on-delivery (COD) for your purchase.

The process you might think is quite simple. What you do not know is that behind the seemingly simple business of eCommerce logistics big bucks are at stake and a number of players are working the field to try and become the undisputed King of eCommerce logistics. At present eCommerce in Pakistan is relatively small although estimated to be a USD 5 billion market.The global average for eCommerce transactions as a percentage of total retail was in the 15 per cent range pre-covid. In comparison Pakistan’s eCommerce sales are between 1 to 2 per cent.

The potential however is massive. Pakistan has a gargantuan population and for the past few years there has been a concentrated effort to make people more comfortable with a digital Pakistan. While eCommerce might be small there are already established marketplaces like Daraz PriceOye and Telemart in Pakistan and there is ample space for more marketplaces to come and for existing ones to grow. So if eCommerce becomes the behemoth so many are counting on it to become managing the logistics of delivery will become a very large and very profitable undertaking.

Currently there are a few different kinds of players in the eCommerce logistics market. The first are the major players which include TCS which is by far the biggest in the logistics business Leopards’ Courier and Muller and Phipps (M&P). (Editor’s note: Even though TCS is twice as large as Leopard’s and M&P but for analysis we have put all three in the same category). Despite eCommerce being very small in Pakistan right now these companies are investing heavily in eCommerce deliveries. These are the companies that are very firmly at the top of this very tiny (for now) hill. Behind them are companies like BlueEx and CallCouriers who also started off as courier companies delivering documents but have made a very obvious pivot towards only doing eCommerce deliveries. And then there are the startups. They seem to be everywhere in Pakistan these days and in every industry imaginable. All of them looking to make it all of them hungry all of them very much in the game. In the eCommerce logistics world the prominent ones are Rider Swyft Logistics and Trax.

The summit is a clear one. Every single one of the companies named above want to be the go to logistics service provider to online marketplaces. The reason TCS and the other legacy companies are on top right now is because of their sheer size and their vast network that has existed for so many years before online marketplaces were even a thing. Others like BlueEx and CallCouriers are in it simply because they got in on the game early. The real players to look out for here or so they claim are the startups. They might be at the bottom of the pile right now but armed with technology they are making quick work of scaling the eCommerce logistics mountain. But will they be able to push ahead of TCS and the old guard of logistics? Or will they get kicked back down the steep slope? Profit looks at the future of eCommerce logistics in Pakistan and what company is most likely to come out as the King of this industry.

How are incumbents set up?

Here’s the rub. Companies like TCS have been around for a very long time. TCS for example started operations in Pakistan in 1983 with 12 stations. In the nearly three decades since they have developed a sprawling infrastructure all over Pakistan and a massive fleet that has proven itself to be reliable. However this infrastructure was built mostly to deliver letters and documents for large clients such as banks corporations and the government.

The new kids on the block like Rider Swyft and Trax believe this is the core of the issue. They think that the big players have tried to fit eCommerce deliveries into the same model that they used for delivering letters and documents. They claim eCommerce logistics is a completely different ball game and that they have the tech to do it right. The big companies have the momentum the infrastructure the experience and most importantly they are cheaper. The startups are more accurate they offer a better customer experience (vital in the eCommerce game) but they are more expensive. Which methodology will succeed?

To be fair to companies like TCS and Leopards they have been trying to delve into this segment for a while and that is despite the fact that it is still a very small as we have mentioned earlier. It was in 2006 that TCS did its first (sort of) online delivery which was COD delivery way before the advent of online marketplaces and online stores and when the internet was restricted to business primarily. The arrangement was with a foreign company that was the distributor of BlackBerry phones in Pakistan that they were selling via TV ads.

“So TV sort of had commercials followed by the customer calling a certain phone number so that’s how we got started in eCommerce and we have been the pioneers and remain the most preferred client for our B2B partners or the online shops owing to our operational excellence and our customer service” says Qasim Awan director and head of eCommerce at TCS.

While their eCommerce business is 15 years old TCS has been in the courier business for the last four decades delivering letters and documents to large clients that include banks corporations and the government and therefore has its operations set up according to that. All the riders and operations are customised to ensure that the courier business flourishes because really eCommerce is a very small portion of the company’s business right now and the major chunk of its revenue comes from the courier business.

“When the internet boom started some of our courier business was taken away by it but it was replaced by eCommerce” says Qasim. This is one place in which there is once again proof of Pakistan being a very slow evolving country. The internet should have wiped out the need for letters and parcels but even today banks send out monthly statements to their customers in print – most of them get thrown away. This should have been a big dent to companies like TCS but it wasn’t so they ended up only puting some resources into eCommerce because of its relatively small size.

While the courier business gives TCS and the likes a natural edge it also puts a burden on them of having a very profitable business in the form of courier business. “Courier business is an extremely profitable business which requires a network effect to do it well so the barrier to entry is very high” says Abid Butt former CEO of E2E Logistics Company. “Because of a high barrier of entry these guys could charge high prices to customers and that resulted in high profitability” he adds.

And because it is very profitable eCommerce business becomes a challenge for these businesses. “Consider this: an envelope on average weighs something like 150-250gms. In a 1kg parcel you can have five envelopes. For delivering one envelope from Lahore to Karachi big logistics companies are going to charge Rs150-200. For a kilogramme that’s Rs1000 for five envelopes if the envelope weighs 200gms” says Butt. “For eCommerce to deliver a package from Lahore to Karachi will cost Rs200 only. So a courier company is getting Rs1000 to utilise a rider to deliver a 1kg envelope against Rs200 for using the same rider to do an eCommerce delivery. So of course their natural inclination would be towards Rs1000. Not only in terms of profits but also in terms of volume” he adds.

Here’s where we would like to explain a bit how these usual courier deliveries are different from eCommerce deliveries. Each one of you reading this piece has some time in your life received a letter at your house that was slid under your house gate. Most of you would also have received bank letters at your home or at your office where they get delivered in bulk. And because they get delivered in bulk at a single location the deliveries are swift seamless and profitable.

For delivering let’s say a bank’s letter at your home the rider does not have to call you to know the directions he will not even ring your doorbell because there is no personal interaction no signatures required. There is also no cash that the rider has to collect either for the delivery that he is making. From estimates given to Profit courier [documents or letters] deliveries take between 20-30 seconds for riders to complete.

Now compare that to an eCommerce delivery. The rider appears at the residence to deliver the parcel has to ring the bell asks for the name of the recipient discloses the order charges gets the signatures and then waits for a few minutes to collect cash against the order. The entire duration for the rider can easily go to about 15-20 minutes for single delivery. “For the document deliveries that we do in a single day we do just half of that in eCommerce parcels” a rider from one of the older logistics companies told Profit.

It is wildly simple: documents bring higher revenue for companies like TCS and Leopards Courier and are delivered easily. On the contrary eCommerce deliveries are tough and timely and require more dedicated manpower. “eCommerce is not a high margin business. It is not a great margin sub component of the courier industry to be in which is why you would see a phenomenon that traditional courier companies all over the world do not react as enthusiastically to eCommerce as newer entrants.There is an economics angle as well. But volumes keep us interested in this particular game” says Qasim.

That is why eCommerce does not constitute a large component of TCS’ overall business. It is in fact quite small but a fast growing one as Qasim tells us. Now your usual courier delivery experience does not require cash collection and the eCommerce delivery experience for the large incumbents becomes more difficult because there is cash involved that the rider collects most of the times he makes a delivery and has to make a stop to deposit that cash. It is cash most of the time because cash is still the king and market estimates put the number of cash on delivery (COD) orders in eCommerce at 90-95% and only the remaining 5-10% are orders for which payments are made before the product is delivered.

Sorting kerfuffle

This is where the problem comes in. Up until now we have been talking about how legacy companies have the advantage of experience and infrastructure. However they have the wrong kind of experience. Their fleet is not used to or good with cash handling and it takes much longer to deliver an eCommerce package than it does to deliver simple letters.

“Things are bound to be difficult. Legacy companies have a fleet of thousands that are trained to deliver documents which they have been doing for decades now. They will naturally have trouble if you ask them to deliver eCommerce deliveries. Another friction is that these riders receive incentives based on the number of deliveries they make. Courier deliveries can be done quickly while eCommerce ones take time. That’s simply a lost incentive for these riders and that frustrates them” says Abid Butt.

For every pickup that a rider makes at a B2B client like bank for documents or at a marketplace’s fulfilment centre in case of eCommerce orders he takes it to the hub or the warehouse of the company where these parcels are sorted based on their dropoff location.

While Profit was not able to get a tour of these facilities and spectate the processes involved from a version in the market the scenes at the hub where sorting is done looks something like this: experienced workers would be manually putting envelopes in boxes labelled according to the city and the neighborhood where they have to be delivered. There would be boxes which would be labelled as Gulberg Lahore or DHA Lahore and like that for other cities and localities running in hundreds. These parcels would be placed in these boxes by these workers who have been around for a while who know the exact location of the box for let’s say Johar Town Lahore and wouldn’t mind throwing the parcel confident that it went into the right box because hey they have been doing this for a while. All the corresponding entries would be recorded manually on paper sheets that would be time consuming and inefficient and difficult to reconcile.

The workers at these stations are in a rush and they are incentivized to sort at high speeds. So a lot of the time they are throwing products into the relevant boxes and not even looking back to see they are going in the right bins. The problem with this arrangement is that if the package goes into the wrong box there is little chance that the company would know who made the mistake and the error can not be pointed out. And the parcel is also lost. Now if it had been a bank letter it wouldn’t have been much of a problem. However when it comes to eCommerce it is a big problem. Imagine ordering a trendy pair of earphones on Daraz never to see it and only rate Daraz worse because you had a bad experience. And because the package went AWOL at the sorting station it is a cost for the online marketplace if it is lost for good and a cost again if the parcel was retrieved but went back to the marketplace and a re-attempt at delivery is to be made. Furthermore there are no constant engagements with customers about their delivery orders.

“If you look at the market landscape in Pakistan only 80-85 percent of orders reach their end destination. The reason for this shocking statistic is that there is simply no visibility because things are done manually” says Salman Allana founder of logistics startup Rider.

It is not only that however. Online marketplaces and logistics companies have identified fake attempts by riders for products that they report were delivered but weren’t actually. “With legacy courier companies nobody would really know if the rider went to the address where he was supposed to make a delivery or if the customer was really not available” says Muhammad Uns CEO of Swyft Logistics.

Then you have riders who would start calling customers about the address without trying themselves to figure it out. Sometimes customers won’t pick up the phone or someone won’t be at the house and that would result in a failed delivery which would have to be delivered again. That would eventually lead to sometimes the arrangement becoming expensive for the logistics company while sometimes it would be a bad experience for the customers.

TCS’ Qasim Awan while talking to Profit acknowledged that while sometimes deliveries can get late because of their riders sometimes it would be late because the riders would keep waiting at the fulfilment centre of an online marketplace and the parcel would not be handed over to the rider timely.

The challengers

At this point you might be thinking that the startups have it in the bag and that the legacy companies are bound to face a meteoric crash. They have fewer successful deliveries and their culture is not client friendly. And the startups claim they are going to fix all of it through technology and innovative scalable processes.

The serious competitors here are three. Rider which was founded in early 2019. Swyft Logistics which started operations in late 2019 and Trax Logistics which was founded in mid 2017. All heavy on technology. Rider claims to have adopted a lean fleet model maintaining 300 full-time riders and growing in line with their Shipper base. They leverage their crowd-sourced ‘Out Rider Program’ to fulfil demand spikes scaling to 800+ riders during peak sales such as 11/11.They claim this lean model gives them competitiveness amongst the new players. Both Swyft and Trax claim to have a last-mile delivery fleet of 1000 plus riders.

Their process all the way from picking an order from a marketplace to delivering the parcel to the end customer is very different. As Salman Allana CEO of Rider explained to us technology and process innovation has been incorporated into these cycles to make deliveries more efficient and successful. This is how it works.

After picking a customer’s parcel from a marketplace’s facility in say Lahore Rider brings it back to its warehouse just like it happens in the case of TCS. “At the time of pick-up our team already has visibility on when this parcel is arriving and to which sorting center so our inbound team is standing ready pre-alerted expecting the shipment” says Salman. “All our staff have automated devices. Parcels are scanned inbound. The moment the scan happens the customer gets an SMS or notification through the Rider Customer App with an estimated delivery time. The customer is provided with a customer service phone number should they have any questions or concerns For Rider removing customers’ ‘package anxiety’ is key to our tech and process design. We want customers to take back control and visibility of their online orders” he says.

“Behind the scenes between pickup and delivery a single parcel moves through multiple stages. The orders are scanned inbound by operations staff armed with android-based in-house developed applications. This app guides them through an accurate primary sort – a split based on cities. Different city orders are transported through our own B2B trucking network. We used to outsource city to city truck movement but quickly found major pain points associated with that. So we built our own B2B trucking solution which is becoming a major part of our business.”

With pick-up sorting and city to city transit processes completed the package is then sent to the closest delivery station depending on the customer’s location. “These delivery stations are the last stop before the parcel reaches your doorstep. Our route optimization technology tells us which parcels should be in which delivery bags and for which delivery routes. This gives us an edge on delivery time efficiency. Once ready to deliver the rider scans your parcel and you receive a notification that your order is out for delivery Your live tracking lin tells you the parcel will arrive in 10 stops or five stops. We calculate the ETA based on maps and traffic data letting you know the exact time slot your parcel will be with you” Salman says.

At delivery if the customer is not reachable the rider marks this delivery as ‘failed’ and ‘ready for a second delivery attempt’. The customer will receive a notification that their delivery was attempted but failed for a specific reason (customer not available cash not available etc.). Through customer verification Rider operations staff are able to check if the delivery agent made a legitimate delivery attempt or not solving a key problem in the industry. Here Rider seems to go one step further by analyzing delivery agent behavioural patterns and geo-tagging technology to catch problematic riders. TCS and others have nothing of the sort which is why they have to rely on their rider’s word.

Essentially Rider’s technology and process optimization decreases the lead time that makes the delivery faster. Iterations with regards to customer engagement means that the customer also has visibility of the order and constant engagement with the customer and notifications allowing them to change address based on the time slot between which rider is going to arrive means that the attempt is more likely to become successful than in the absence of such engagements.

Why does success rate matter? The majority of the eCommerce deliveries are cash on delivery and failed delivery means the cost of the delivery was incurred but cash against it was not collected. Reattempt means further cost and if the bulk of these deliveries are unsuccessful chronic cash flow issues can choke growth especially of small online marketplaces.

Similar optimisations have been brought about by Swyft Logistics. It has also brought technology where sorting would happen not in hours but in minutes based on AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning). The parcels are sorted automatically rather than people doing it and technology helps the startup decide which parcel has to go to which side of the city.

“At Trax we have built plugins for Shopify Magento and built customs solutions our delivery management system. Our bookings and integrations are done through APIs. All that is based on a cloud system. Even if 50000 orders are booked our system is not down and we are integrated with major players in the industry” says Muhammad Hassan Khan CEO at Trax Logistics.

“Once the order is delivered our rider collects the cash and because everything is live as soon as the order is delivered we close our receivable with the rider and open the payable with our shipper and we are able to IBFT that money to our shippers which removes a huge pain point for them” adds Salman.

Timely cash settlements are important for online marketplaces. Let’s just say it’s make or break for these companies especially smaller ones. If a logistics company takes 15-20 days to settle the cash they collect on COD orders with a marketplace it can be really bad for small online retailers. And 15-20 days is what startups say was the time that the big companies took to reimburse cash to marketplaces for these orders. And because these startups have digital payments arrangements they are friends of these eCommerce startups that they have partnered with and also their saviours.

“We have partnered with JazzCash and EasyPaisa and our riders also carry card machines in case customers do not have cash and the rider comes back which can incur additional costs” says Muhammad Uns CEO of Swyft Logistics.

All of these startups have been able to get some eCommerce delivery volumes. In the case of Rider Salman claims that his startup has been able to do as many as 1 million deliveries since its inception with a first attempt success rate of 87% and an overall success rate of 92-95%. On the other hand Swyft claims a success rate of as high as 96% while for Trax an online marketplace shared that Trax’s success rate on their platform was in the high 80s.

But incumbents are here to stay

Let us make one thing clear however. Despite all of this companies like TCS are not going to be easy to dislodge especially since they seem to be making a real and concentrated effort of moving towards tech forward solutions themselves. From the market intelligence collected by Profit legacy players in the last mile eCommerce delivery space also have success rates above 80 per cent and they are improving. Certain commentators also questioned if Rider or others would be able to maintain their success rates when they scale. To recall Rider has a full time fleet size of 300 riders (scaling to 800+ in peak time) and both Swyft and Trax have a last mile delivery fleet of 1000 plus riders whereas heavyweight TCS has over 6000 riders. Would they be able to maintain the same success rates when they reach the scale of TCS? Also what will happen when the venture capital money runs out?

Marketplace owners who have worked with startups as well as legacy logistics companies and who chose not to be named also tell Profit that legacy logistics companies offer same day deliveries within the city and more or less deliver in the same timeframe as startups which essentially means that the unique propositions on the back of technology are being matched by legacy logistics companies because and it will come later they have also started focusing on automation. They further say that legacy companies can be less expensive because they tend to undercut prices to stay ahead of competition and have started doing instant cash settlements (24-48 hours) like startups.

Let’s pause here a bit.

Pricing makes the startups uncompetitive right now. For instance for within city deliveries legacy companies would charge Rs80 for a single parcel which can go as low as Rs60 because these companies are resorting to price wars. In contrast Rider could cost as much as Rs120 for the same intracity delivery. On the same note Swyft also said that they were not inexpensive without disclosing any numbers.

Why do these startups charge more? Because the better success rate they claim in the 90s that Rider and Swyft claim saves losses that come with a lower success rate that legacy companies have when reattempts are made. Because these losses are being averted these startups think a premium should be paid to them. But as per testament from a marketplace owner they would rather opt for a lower price with TCS because it has another differentiation factor that makes it most compelling: TCS has the widest coverage for these deliveries in Pakistan delivering parcels to destinations more than others.

“The differentiation factor here is coverage. When you are signing up a company for delivery you would prefer to partner with a single company rather than multiple companies and then you would prefer one that offers the best coverage. We can’t ignore this” says an online marketplace CEO.

In response to the point on coverage Rider CEO Salman concedes that traditional players have a large established network consisting of brick and mortar branches. However according to him the startups including Rider having learnt from the successful global e-com logistics players are developing innovative low-cost efficient and flexible ways to aggressively expand their networks. “Solutions such as micro-distribution centers and mobile warehouses will enable us to expand quickly in the near future” says Salman.

The way the requirements of the eCommerce marketplaces are structured players like TCS because they are so big are simply not expendable. “There would be areas of expertise that we won’t have at Daraz Express but TCS would have that expertise and we work with to improve our customer experience” says Ehsan Saya managing director at Daraz.

A problem here is also that besides Daraz many of the online retailers are big fashion brands that form the bulk of the eCommerce volumes which have an established presence in physical retail and therefore have less cash flow issues. Khaadi Sapphire and the likes because they have less cash flow issues happily partner with the big in business because they are also big in business and don’t really mind long cash settlement cycles. Companies like TCS also know that they are big and leverage their position to negotiate deals that ensure that they remain big. For instance TCS would make its network and vast coverage available to companies if they give the entirety of their volumes to the company.

They would also offer better prices to secure big clients effectively staying ahead of all others and that reflects in TCS’ top position in this pyramid. While there are no solid numbers of how much market share is owned by companies in eCommerce logistics most versions in the market put TCS at the top spot followed by Leopards Courier as a close second. CallCouriers and Muller and Phipps (M&P) contend for the third and fourth spots and then rank the startups Swyft and Rider. Boldly however Trax claims the third spot for itself based on its in-house market research and boldly it also says that its delivery network now matches that of TCS and Leopards. Whatever the case with all of the startups fighting for fourth place TCS and Leopards are firmly in first and second place.

Now eCommerce volumes are erratic throughout the year with over 50 per cent of the volume coming on a handful of big days like Eid days or 11/11. Last mile logistics companies are therefore faced with the tough choice of staffing for the entire year low days or days when there is a boom. It is also here that because of the year round staffing for their courier business TCS’ apparent weakness becomes its strength. It simply becomes the go-to option for marketplaces because it is the only one that can handle the large volumes on these days.

“It’s the days when eCommerce is on the boom that our expertise comes into play. Not only do we have large fleets we have operational flexibility with which we can carry out these deliveries. The size of the company means that we are able to take this volume in and cater to it and make these deliveries” says Qasim. “For us customer satisfaction is of prime importance. If our customer is running let’s say a lawn campaign we can dedicate entire sets of fleets to ensure timely deliveries for our customers” he adds.

Startups have been able to scale on the back of technology. The question is would legacy companies sit idly by and let these companies scale further? Legacy companies are already ahead in terms of size scale and market share. They are matching the USPs of the startups already and in our conversation with TCS Qasim said that his company was taking automation seriously and working on strengthening the human resources component of the business to consolidate further. They are also improving their tech capabilities but it is always easier to build a tech infrastructure from the ground up rather than from the top down.

“Automation has benefits. It increases your speed it decreases your costs and it decreases human error in this business which can be really costly because of a lot of permutations and combinations in the deliveries especially in eCommerce. Automation is important for us and we invested in hardware and software in this regard. It is also important for us that our workforce remains highly motivated. Automation is important but I would not say it is a panacea for how to improve this business even though it is very critical” he says.

Now Rider and others have started with technology learning while the scale was small and bringing optimisations on that. While TCS is big and can’t really incorporate technology into the giant corporate machine in one go or at least that is what the startups believe. Any automation would mean training professionals and fleets which could affect customer experience and eventually hurt the company’s market presence. But Qasim does not seem worried.

“Innovation is not difficult for TCS. We have been evolving and innovating based on customer demand and this is another phase in our evolution in terms of bringing certain investment certain Capex and vehicles. We have just gone through the largest fleet revamp in our history right in the middle of Covid-19. This was a big investment. We have also had automation spells driven by a dedicated team that did time motion studies figuring out all what has been happening with regards to all our hubs and warehouses and how all the processes can be turned. So yes our scale is larger but I don’t think it will be difficult for us” he says.

“We have carved out TCS eCommerce Solutions which can be considered sort of a startup and we are trying to make it as agile as possible. Being a startup is great but it is also not the be all and end all because startups also lack a certain network. The key for us is not to have an agile business unit. The key for us is to have an agile logistics network overall. Yes we could have a specific unit set up in Karachi but if the agility could not be there in Khyber Agency what good would it do? It is not a bad idea but we are a very operation-focused group. That remains our main priority and if that is achieved everything becomes smooth” he says.

While TCS shared its plans we have only heard of a version that mentioned Leopards Courier’s plans to also scale aggressively in the eCommerce last mile delivery space. The company has reportedly set up a new facility in Karachi to cater to increasing volumes but the automation plans of the company are unknown.

The threat to all

Here’s the scary part. All of this all of the efforts being made by TCS and the high flying attempts could be for naught. Why? Because the eCommerce marketplaces could try and dominate the logistics themselves. eCommerce is currently only around 1-2 percent of the total retail in Pakistan and we can only make assumptions about who is going to dominate the industry as the industry grows in volumes. So while it is difficult to give a verdict here we can make sense of the direction this industry is going to go and the example we have is of Amazon the global eCommerce giant that started its deliveries partnering with logistics companies United Parcel Service (UPS) and United States Postal Postal Service (USPS) started its own logistics fleet and grew it to a scale large enough to threaten even the existence of its once delivery partners.

In Pakistan the logical equivalent of Amazon is Daraz that started its own logistics fleet Daraz Express (DEX) through which it does around 50 per cent of the deliveries. For the rest it has partnered with TCS LCS and even Rider.

The market sentiment in eCommerce is that marketplaces should not outsource customer experience to third party logistics companies something companies like Amazon have been religious in following. That is the way it went for Amazon and it will be logical if it goes the same way for Daraz. On the other hand Daraz contended that is not the way they would go.

“No we will not remove partners because the main reason is that when we have campaigns we also scale our business quickly and we will never be so efficient that we can do it all ourselves. Our relationship with partners is phenomenal. Nor do they look at DEX as competitors and nor do we look at them as competitors. We get into the room and we say that we did this this is the data that we improved you should do the same. So we will not get to the place where 100% of the orders will be covered by DEX and we don’t aim for that. What we have internally aimed for is 60-65% of our orders will be done through Daraz Express and we will continue to partner with other players” says Ehsan Saya.

Yes we are questioning the existence of the last mile eCommerce industry but that is for some time to come according to industry stakeholders. “There is enough in the pie for everyone. The opportunity has been further exploded by the pandemic. There is enough room for everyone. Though it is worth noting that it is not an easy business to get into. A lot of players rush into it but it only gives illusions of returns” says Qasim.

“In fact a testament to that is we don’t just have partners that are big in smaller cities we have launched a platform called logistics marketplace where we partner with small players where we get them up and running. You look at this one city where the success rate is not as good and neither for our partners so why don’t you start doing deliveries in the city because you know it well and if your costs are good we will give it to you because you can do it more efficiently. We are trying to make sure logistics overall gets stronger. So no we are not planning to replace others. On days where our volumes go up we can not just do it on our own. We need our partners. That is not on the cards for us at all” Saya says.",,,,,,,,,

Nearly 200 volunteers joined Serve Santa Maria to help clean weed and plant at local homes all over the city Saturday.

This is the first cleanup they’ve been able to organize since the start of the pandemic.

“It’s people of good faith working together for the good of the community” retired Pastor Carl Nielsen said.

Nielsen was a pastor for 40 years and is now the leader of Serve Santa Maria.

After volunteering in New Orleans four years after houses were devastated by Hurricane Katrina he came back to Santa Maria proposing to City Council the start of this beautification organization.

“I thought ‘Wow why can’t we do something like that on a smaller scale in our own community'"" Nielsen said.

Starting at 8 o’clock on Saturday morning community members brought their yard tools to help out in Northwest Santa Maria along West Monroe Street West Carmen Lane and Buena Vista Park.

“The carpenters we’re trying to come out and just show we’re here to help and just be part of the community” Rick Jenne Carpenters Local 805 Volunteer Committee Chair said

Serve Santa Maria finds their projects is by listening to the needs of the community.

“Some of our volunteers say ‘Hey I got a neighbor here that needs some help'and I say ‘Well give me a name and an address’ and I go and knock on their door and visit and say ‘Would you like some help?’” Nielsen said.

Local businesses like United Rentals have offered the organization their services for free. They have also received donations from the Santa Barbara foundation and other family trusts.

“When all of these different forces can come together then you come with what you call Serve Santa Maria” Nielsen added.

Now the organization has “beautified” over 20 houses and has been serving Santa Maria for over 11 years with an exception to last year during the pandemic.

“We couldn’t do anything” Nielsen said. “There was so much fear and anxiety once COVID hit.”

Volunteers said they couldn’t wait to get back to helping out their community.

“To me it’s just important to give back” Jenne said. “We’re helping out a lady here that just couldn’t take care of her yard any more so just giving back to that.”

“I feel so blessed in my life that I want to bless other people and that’s what motivates me to do what I do"" Nielsen added.

Pastor Carl Nielsen said they’re hoping to announce the next Serve Santa Maria event later this summer.

Wade is overturned. We looked to other countries for answers.

Consider this: Every day around the world some 96000 women risk their lives to an unsafe abortion seeking to end an unintended pregnancy. Millions of women face complications following an unsafe abortion and at least 22000 die every year. This latest push to overturn Roe v. Wade aims to deny women autonomous control over their own bodies and presages a return to the days before Roe in the U.S. when the death rate due to illegal abortion among women of color was 12 times that of white women.

MSI Reproductive Choices works in many countries where abortion is heavily restricted and we are called on daily to provide life-saving post-abortion care to women and girls who tried to end an unwanted pregnancy themselves. Faith Pyentim a midwife from Nigeria described one teenage girl who sought help after a desperate attempt to end an unintended pregnancy. “There was a bad smell so we knew there was infection. She was 17 then unmarried with a child at home already.”

That young woman received treatment for her infection left with contraception to prevent future unintended pregnancies and has since returned to school. But not everyone in this situation can access life-saving post-abortion care.

Restrictions Increase Unsafe Abortions

Wherever they live whatever the laws of their countries women will terminate unintended pregnancies—so access to a safe abortion must be included in essential health care. In fact abortion-related deaths and disability are highest in countries where abortion is most heavily restricted. Analysis by the Guttmacher Institute showed that in countries where abortion is very restricted and in those where there are fewer restrictions the incidence rate of abortion is similar with about 40 percent of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion.

But while the rate of abortion is similar in countries where abortion is restricted and highly stigmatized women resort to unsafe methods that significantly increase complications and death. In sub-Saharan Africa where laws are generally more restrictive deaths from unsafe abortion have increased steadily since the 1990s. Adolescents from rural areas like the young woman Faith served are particularly at risk.

Bárbara Pérez an MSI team member in Mexico described what she sees in rural areas where access to abortion services is limited: “On many occasions women do things like sticking wires into themselves to end the pregnancy. We have had cases where women have taken a pesticide used in fields when they found out they were pregnant.”

Unsafe abortions are the cause of an estimated 13 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in many developing countries—and because of underreporting the real number is likely much higher. The consequences are far-reaching. Seven million women face complications each year including serious health conditions such as hemorrhage infection incomplete abortion and infertility. Public health facilities bear much of the burden of treating these injuries and women carry the added burden of stigma. Many women suffer chronic abortion-related illness without receiving the medical care they need.

Unsafe abortions are the cause of an estimated 13 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in many developing countries—and because of underreporting the real number is likely much higher.

Beyond the direct health care costs of treating women who have had an unsafe abortion there are significant indirect consequences: social stigma because a woman or girl had to resort to an unsafe procedure; children orphaned when they lose mothers; women disabled and unable to work; families whose hopes are dashed by infertility. These are preventable tragedies easily remedied by access to low-cost safe abortion services.

Fewer Abortion Restrictions Save Lives

At MSI we know laws alone don’t fix the problem. In Zambia for example abortion is legal on several grounds including to protect the physical or mental health of the woman. But the law required three doctors to sign off before a woman received care. In a country with one doctor for every 12000 people this requirement meant that it was frequently impossible to deliver the services women need. What seemed harmless on paper was a major obstacle to safe and timely care in practice and deaths from unsafe abortion remained high accounting for 30 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in the country.

MSI Zambia knew change was needed for the women who could not secure the required signatures and were at risk of seeking unsafe abortion. MSI Zambia began working with the Ministry of Health and other stakeholders to develop new guidelines to supplement the law that would make safe abortion more available. In 2018 after four years of persistent advocacy new guidelines were finally approved and now only one doctor’s signature is required in case of “emergency” defined broadly enough to include risk of unsafe abortion or threats to a woman’s health. Now we are pushing to change the law to align with practice.

Ensuring Access Through Policy

Other countries—such as Nepal—are leading the way. Nepal legalized abortion in 2002 but when unsafe practices continued the government included abortion care under the country’s Universal Health Care plan in 2016. Progress towards universally safe services is still uneven but there are promising signs. The Nepal Demographic Health Surveys from 2011 and 2016 showed an increase in the proportion of women who know safe abortion is available at government facilities (71.4 percent to 79 percent). More people know abortion is legal now (38 percent to 41 percent) and clinics have also seen an increase in women seeking safe abortion care.

Shraddha Adhikari an MSI health care provider in Nepal explained the impact of universal health care: “Sustainable and equitable access to abortion service can only be achieved when safe abortion care is not separated from other components of health care. As a health care provider I am very proud that I am serving to save women’s lives. If we are unable to provide service then many women face health care complications and even die.”

Restrictive laws don’t stop women who are determined to end an unplanned pregnancy from finding ways to do this—they never have and never will. MSI Reproductive Choices will continue to care for women and girls who need us and push for legal and policy changes to protect their right to choose.

Queen Freelove of New Haven Connecticut remembers when the pandemic transformed the daycare she ran out of her home abruptly turning the atmosphere from cozy to clinical: “Things got extremely traumatic for us” she recalled. She was constantly trying to keep the environment sanitized keeping a stockpile of masks wipes and other equipment stopping parents in the hallway when they arrived to pick up their kids to take their temperature and give them a squirt of sanitizer — the protocol for “contactless” drop-offs and pick-ups. Keeping parents outside to minimize direct interaction she said was “hard because we look forward to having that great relationship with the parents and that really helps. But we could no longer have that relationship that we once had because of the pandemic.”

Despite the social distancing Freelove’s work providing child care to local workers many of them working rough so-called “essential” jobs made her feel closer to the community because her services were indispensable. But she just wishes the government that pays her salary understood that.

“We had to do what those health care providers did for us and we did our part to get this country back up and open” Freelove told Truthout. “We were vital and sometimes I think [the people in government] know it. They know it. But when they’re allocating funds…. No absolutely not.”

Child care in the United States is frustrating for everyone involved: Families pay way too much for daycare or are priced out of child care programs altogether and care providers earn far too little. The pandemic has made a child care overhaul both more challenging and more necessary. Though child care services are crucial for enabling parents to go back to work many child care providers have shut down permanently over the past year and countless parents in the coming months may struggle to find a spot in a quality daycare that they can afford.

“A lot of the issues that we saw happen during the pandemic are a result of pretty consistent under-investment in child care over the course of several decades” said Mario Cardona Chief of Policy and Practice for Child Care Aware of America a child care provider advocacy group. “We have a system that places far too high a burden on families paying for the high price of care and for providers to operate on very very thin margins so they can keep their doors open and meet the needs of families.”

The Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan passed in March provided nearly $40 billion to help child care providers keep operating through the pandemic and pay their workers. Biden also recently rolled out his “American Families Plan” which if it becomes law would dramatically expand subsidy eligibility and raise child care workers’ minimum hourly pay to $15 per hour. Advocates have welcomed Biden’s plan as a down payment on an overhaul of a system that was in tatters even before the pandemic forced many child care providers out of work.

Among those formerly employed by child care programs the average pre-pandemic annual income of a child care worker or early childhood educator was just $11.65 per hour or $24230 in 2019 — less than half of what kindergarten teachers earn. In every state the median wage for child care workers — who are nearly all women and more racially diverse than K-12 educators — was below the living wage for a parent with one child. There are also many home-based child care providers or family child care homes who are essentially self-employed but struggle to scrape by due to the low reimbursement rates provided by the state child care subsidy systems. During the pandemic many daycare centers and family child care homes closed due to a drop in enrollment and increased operating costs of additional sanitizing and protective equipment. Some saw their revenue plummet because states lowered enrollment caps as a safety precaution which meant fewer subsidies just as their overhead costs were rising.

A nationwide survey of daycare centers and family child care homes conducted last November by the professional organization National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) found that more than half of child care centers reported “losing money each day they remain open” and 44 percent of all respondents reported “confronting so much uncertainty that they are unable to say how much longer they will be able to stay open.” According to federal data the number of child care employees declined by more than 130000 nationwide between February 2020 and May 2021.

Maria del Carmen Macias a home-based child care provider in Belmont Cragin Illinois said that family child care homes like hers play an especially critical role in her community. “In these 14 years that I’ve been a child care provider 100 percent of my kids 100 percent of my families live blocks away from me” she said noting that many do not have a car so they need to place their kids with a daycare that they can walk to. But as executive board chair of her union Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Healthcare Illinois she noted that during the pandemic “We know of many centers that have closed their doors. And we also know that many family child care providers [who] have decided to close the doors [had] more than 25 30 years of experience.”

Though child care services are crucial for enabling parents to go back to work many child care providers have shut down permanently over the past year.

These closures exacerbate massive deficits in the availability of care for low-income households. According to federal data state and federal child care subsidies — based heavily on limited Child Care and Development Block Grant funds a large pot of federal funding that is administered by states — reach only about one in seven federally eligible children as of 2017 and just 18 percent of low-income children are enrolled in “high-quality” preschool (a structured program with effective professional teachers a research-based curriculum and other features of a supportive learning environment).

Prior to the pandemic the total average cost of full-time child care for a typical family was between $9200 and $9600 a year — over 10 percent of household income for a two-parent household and about a third of that of a single parent according to Child Care Aware. In most regions of the country child care is the largest household expense — above housing health care and food — and often costs more than public university tuition. Although some states’ child care subsidy programs exempt low-income families from child care co-pays most states require low-income parents to pay fees that can cost up to several hundred dollars per month. Child care costs will place an even heavier burden on families who have struggled with lost income or unemployment during the pandemic. Both child care providers and families lose out when cash-strapped parents get stuck on waiting lists or ensnared in the complex application process for subsidies.

On top of the unaffordability of child care for low- and middle-income parents many communities simply lack access to affordable quality licensed daycare. Latinx and Native American populations are especially likely to live in a “child care desert” or a census tract with at least 50 children and either no licensed child care providers or no more than one child care slot per three kids under the age of 5. Rural families suffer from some of the most severe child care shortages in part because they rely heavily on smaller family child care homes in which enrollment is limited to just a handful of kids per provider.

Like many other child care providers who have kids of their own Tunja Daniels a family support worker at the Mary Crane Center in Chicago has struggled to arrange care for her own children. After the daycare where she works shut down temporarily during the first months of the pandemic she recalled “my child care provider took the parents that were still going to work. And [because of] them having limited space I lost my slot.” Now that she is working again her children have to stay at home and attend virtual classes because neither parent would be able to pick the kids up from in-person school.

The Biden administration’s American Families Plan aims to invest in child care as part of the nation’s economic infrastructure pumping $225 billion into federally supported child care programs. That would cap the cost of care at 7 percent of a family earning 150 percent of the state median income (that’s about $70000 in Alaska and $94000 in New York).

In addition to the increased access to child care Biden’s plan to set a $15 per hour wage floor for child care workers may have an even bigger impact on the quality and availability of child care as it could bring equity to a labor sector that has been historically dismissed as “women’s work.” The early childhood educator workforce which is more than 40 percent people of color suffers an extreme pay gap with their counterparts teaching in elementary or middle school: The poverty rate among early childhood educators is nearly eight times that of teachers in grades kindergarten through 8. Child care workers also often lack basic benefits like employer-sponsored health insurance and rely on public assistance programs. And within the early childhood education workforce those working with infants and toddlers earn less than preschool teachers and Black workers make nearly 80 cents an hour less than white workers.

An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would boost take-home pay for as many as 560000 child care workers or more than 40 percent; the vast majority would be women more than a third Black and Latinx. Improved wages could also help stabilize the workforce by curbing the currently high turnover rates which would help daycare programs attract and retain qualified staff and put early educators on a sustainable career path. Early education advocacy and professional organizations such as the NAEYC have been pushing for more resources and infrastructure for educators seeking professional development and training.

In most regions of the country child care is the largest household expense … and often costs more than public university tuition.

Biden’s plan also broadly aims to promote parity between the pay of kindergarten teachers and comparably credentialed early childhood education workers which parallel parity initiatives in some state and local universal pre-kindergarten programs including Los Angeles Oklahoma and Portland’s Multnomah County that seek to reduce the pay gap between preschool and public school teachers.

Nonetheless Biden’s child care plan would still fall short of what advocates say is needed to overhaul the system. Stephanie Schmit director of child care and early education at the Center for Law and Social Policy says a $700 billion long-term investment would be needed to truly meet the overall need for subsidized child care. Although Biden’s plan was “a very big improvement over the current system that we have” she said it should be seen as just the start of a long-term effort to “build a more sustainable and equitable child care system that will have a really big impact for children and families and workers.”

A parallel bill introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-New York) earlier this year would ensure universal access through expanding center-based care and family child care homes and guarantee that households that earn less than twice the federal poverty line (about $53000 for a family of four) would be entitled to free child care. It would cost $70 billion per year or $700 billion over 10 years or more than triple what Biden promised funded by an “Ultra Millionaire Tax.”

Daniels wants to see the system support everyone involved; while parents struggle to pay for child care while she is dealing with the student debt burden from trying to gain the educational credentials that will help her advance her career. “I want to see just universal child care where the parents are not going into debt wondering if they should pay the child care or rent or utility bill because they can’t make those child care payments. We can afford to have universal child care. We can afford to have local colleges award bachelor’s degrees in early education.”

As a member-organizer with SEIU Daniels believes the child care crisis reflects lawmakers’ longstanding lack of respect for child care and early education workers. “I believe because we’ve never gotten credit for being educators we’ve been considered babysitters in early education. So they felt that the funding wasn’t necessary for us” she said. “But if we don’t work parents can’t work. If we’re not there to support and educate children the parents won’t be able to work and support their families.”

This uplifting yearly notification is known as the World Happiness Report.

With the release of each report which is published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network the question is not which country will appear at the top of the rankings but rather which Northern European country will. Finland has been the world’s happiest country for four years running; Denmark and Norway hold all but one of the other titles (which went to Switzerland in 2015).

The rankings are reliably discouraging for Americans who have never cracked the global top 10. We are merely in the upper middle class of happiness—respectable but underwhelming for a country with our level of wealth and self-regard.

Sort of like how the launch of Sputnik in 1957 led Americans to feel like their country was falling behind technologically or how the results of international standardized tests in the 2000s led them to feel like their kids were falling behind educationally the happiness rankings have subtly encouraged an anxiety fit for our era of self-optimization: that somewhere other people are doing things that make them much happier than we are.

This disturbing thought has contributed to the rise of a genre of lifestyle content that aims to help unhappy Americans emulate the daily practices and philosophies of happier places whether that means taking a dip in frigid water or making your living room super-cozy. Wanting to copy the happiest people in the world is an understandable impulse but it distracts from a key message of the happiness rankings—that equitable balanced societies make for happier residents. In the process a research-heavy policy-oriented document gets mistaken through a terrible global game of telephone for a trove of self-help advice.

Happier isn’t quite the right word for how the Finns compare with the rest of the world—the World Happiness Report is more about contentment than exuberant smiley happiness. Its rankings are based on each country’s average response to a question that goes something like this: If you imagine a ladder whose rungs are numbered zero to 10 and zero represents your worst possible life and 10 represents your best which rung would you be on? (Posing this question to at least 1000 people in 150 or so countries is a resource-intensive undertaking. Gallup which provides the survey data behind the rankings declined to tell me the cost of collecting them as part of the Gallup World Poll but if you’d like you can buy access to that broader data set for $30000 a year.)

The UN first took an interest in people’s imaginary life-ladders 10 years ago after Bhutan’s prime minister at the time Jigme Thinley encouraged the organization’s member countries to better incorporate well-being into measurements of social and economic development. His recommendation inspired the first World Happiness Report released in 2012.

The happiness rankings are a useful countervailing force in a world that tends to take GDP as a proxy for a country’s success and in the past five years some governments have launched initiatives dedicated to their citizens’ life satisfaction: The United Kingdom appointed a minister for loneliness the United Arab Emirates appointed a minister of happiness and New Zealand reviewed its national budget based on how government spending would affect people’s well-being.

For the people who come up with policies and run countries the lessons of the report are not shocking: People are more satisfied with their lives when they have a comfortable standard of living a supportive social network good health the latitude to choose their course in life and a government they trust. The highest echelon of happy countries also tends to have universal health care ample paid vacation time and affordable child care.

Arthur C. Brooks: Find the place you love. Then move there.

A central takeaway from nine years of happiness reports is that a wealthier country is not always a happier country. In the U.S. “we are living with such incredibly frayed social trust and bad vibes and addictions and so many other things and still [people say] ‘Don't tax me’ ‘Don’t tax the rich’” Jeffrey Sachs an economist at Columbia University and an editor of the report told me. “This is part of our politics that I think is all wrong and that I think is what puts us well behind countries that are not quite as rich as the United States but in my view are much more balanced in their lives.”

Less clear is what an individual person should make of a list of the world’s happiest countries. Sure it may yield some abstract wisdom about the good life: Sachs views it as a reminder that once you’re comfortable materially moderation is a healthier attitude than chasing more money and possessions.

Read: Who actually feels satisfied about money?

And William Davies the author of The Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business Sold Us Well-Being observed to me that the list implies “a social understanding of happiness—something that happens between people” which is a welcome alternative to the default assumption that individual people are responsible for their own misery. He also thinks it can show people which policies to vote for if they want to nudge their society in a happier direction.

The rankings though have less to say about what people can do differently in their own lives. Data from the World Happiness Report do indicate that moving to a country higher up in the rankings makes people happier but personally I’m not going to uproot myself and move thousands of miles away from most of the people I care about.

This vacuum of actionable information gets filled by media coverage that suggests mimicking aspects of other cultures in hopes that some of their happiness will transfer to you. Most egregious are the articles about various countries’ “secrets” to happiness that readers can implement such as taking a cold shower in the morning or baking cinnamon buns. Even nuanced reporting can leave the impression that some quirky local custom is essential to people’s fulfillment. Marveling at the warm communal pools in Iceland (No. 4 in the most recent rankings released in March) writers for The New York Times and the BBC both thought that they could be “key” to the country’s happiness.

One media phenomenon though towers above the rest: hygge a Danish word evoking warmth and coziness that is implied to carry an entire country through harsh Northern European winters and to the top of the happiness rankings. In the mid-2010s after Denmark had taken the top spot in three out of the first four World Happiness Reports a spate of hygge-themed books were published including The Little Book of Hygge: Danish Secrets to Happy Living and How to Hygge: The Nordic Secrets to a Happy Life. Hygge has served as marketing copy for sweaters blankets and candles and was once blamed by the Financial Times for helping spike the prices of cozy spices such as cinnamon and cardamom.

Some countries also promote their status when courting tourists. “We do believe that being one of the happiest countries creates curiosity among travelers to come and see themselves what makes us Finns happy” said Sari Hey a spokesperson for Visit Finland and representatives of the tourism boards for Denmark and Norway also told me that they’ve incorporated their happy reputation into their marketing efforts. Visit Finland’s website says that the country’s happiness “has a lot to do with our daily habits: a short walk in the forest going ice swimming or tasting something fresh from nature.”

Sachs of the World Happiness Report doesn’t think that interest in the happiest countries’ customs is entirely misplaced. Denmark and other happy countries embody “a different kind of prosperity a more equal and shared prosperity and I think things like hygge are a reflection of that norm” he told me. “I think it’s something to emulate at an individual level and something to propound at a political level.”

Taking forest walks and foraging for berries do sound delightful but a focus on activities and habits reduces entire cultures to individual lifestyle trends and obscures the structural forces that make people satisfied with their lives. No quantity of blankets or candles is going to make up for living in an unequal society with a weak social safety net. The folly of fixating on local customs becomes even clearer if you consider the poverty and violence that are common at the bottom of the rankings: No lifestyle blogger is studying Afghanistan the least happy country in this year’s report and recommending that readers avoid Afghan pastimes and customs such as flying kites and going to communal bathhouses.

When I asked Elizabeth Dunn a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia who studies happiness how much happier I’d be if I cultivated hygge in my life she said “Probably not at all.” She told me that a better way to think about the happiest countries is as putting forward a menu of things that might make some people happier—a list of fresh hypotheses to test in your own life and see what you like. You can’t replicate the structural features that make other countries happier but experimenting with new habits and activities certainly can’t hurt.

Bear in mind though that happiness isn’t found only at the top of the rankings. Sebastian Modak a freelance travel writer told me that when he was The New York Times’ 52 Places Traveler in 2019 he met people at every destination who seemed truly happy and had habits that brought them pleasure. “Everywhere had a custom that I could latch on to” he said. “I hung out with a guy in Siberia who ended every evening with a generous pour of vodka and half a pack of cigarettes. He seemed pretty happy—is that the secret to happiness?”

Perhaps deeper insights can be gained from looking beyond the trends of cozy hearths and nature walks. Even the Nordic countries themselves have a lesser-known cultural ideal that probably brings happiness more reliably than hygge. Jukka Savolainen a Finnish American sociology professor at Wayne State University in Michigan argued in Slate that the essence of his happy home region is best captured by lagom a Swedish and Norwegian word meaning “just the right amount.”

Savolainen even theorizes that this inclination toward moderation shapes residents’ responses to the happiness ranking’s central question. “The Nordic countries are united in their embrace of curbed aspirations for the best possible life” he writes. “In these societies the imaginary 10-step ladder is not so tall.”

Lower expectations: Maybe they’ll make you happier. At the very least they’ll come in handy for Americans when the 10th World Happiness Report comes out next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTE0NTExM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CDO hospital first accredited center in NorMin under UHC,"The JR Borja General Hospital (JRBGH) a hospital managed by the city government of Cagayan de Oro. (File photo courtesy of Stephen Capillas CIO)

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY – The JR Borja General Hospital (JRBGH) a hospital managed by the city government here is the first accredited Out-Patient Department (OPD) consultation center in Region 10 by the Department of Health (DOH) under the Universal Health Care (UHC) program.

City mayor Oscar Moreno announced this accomplishment on Saturday after it was reported by Dr. William Bernardo acting city health officer and in-charge of the UHC program of the city government.

""This is also one of the reasons why I asked him to head the city health department so that it would harmonize and synchronize our universal healthcare participation"" he said in the online briefer.

According to the DOH the UHC also referred to as ""Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP)” is the provision to every Filipino of the highest possible quality of health care that is accessible efficient equitably distributed adequately funded fairly financed and appropriately used by an informed and empowered public.

Moreno said the city government has targeted to accredit 35 to 40 consultation or ""konsulta"" centers in the city based on the total population. Each center targets to serve around 20000 city residents.

""The importance of that is we should improve our health centers in partnership with the national government through the Department of Health"" he said.

Moreno congratulated employees of JRBGH and encouraged them to work hard to provide the best public service to the people.

Meanwhile city information officer Maricel Casiño-Rivera urged the public to visit the official Facebook pages of JRBGH and the city government to secure the contact numbers for teleconsultation.

Aside from the hospital the City Health Office (CHO) and the Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) also have ""Telekonsulta"" services.

The Psychosocial Division of the city's Social Welfare and Development Office has also a mental health hotline for those who are suffering from depression and a hotline exclusive for individuals under quarantine.

Zero cases under home quarantine

Meanwhile as the city continues to respond to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic Moreno said cases under home quarantine have been transferred to quarantine facilities.

""I'm so happy now because all (Covid-19 cases) who have been under home quarantine in yesterday's reports and all previous reports are now gone. We have now zero cases under home quarantine in previous reports"" he said.

Moreno said there were a total of 32 confirmed cases under home quarantine but these were much lower numbers compared to the previous weeks when these reached over a hundred mark.

Moreno thanked all officials and personnel who have been instrumental to the transfer of all confirmed cases under home quarantine to temporary treatment and monitoring facilities (TTMF) and city isolation units (CIU).

As of June 25 the CHO recorded a total of 896 confirmed cases that are currently placed at the TTMFs and CIUs. The figure was part of 1207 active cases in the city.

""This is part of our strategy that the administration and operation in our TTMFs and CIUs will be assigned to another group so that they would focus their coordination on each other"" he added.

Moreno said the health team will now be more focused on the medical issues.

CHO resident city epidemiologist Dr. Teodulfo Joselito Retuya reported 66 new confirmed Covid-19 cases bringing the total to 9770 cases.

The number of admitted cases in the hospital system in the city remains at 300-mark.

Moreno also reported a total of 352 Covid-19 positives admitted in all hospitals situated in the city a reduction of just one case compared to Saturday.

Based on the data the majority of the positive cases admitted are city residents with 301 cases. This was followed by the positive patients from Misamis Oriental 39; Bukidnon six; Iligan City five and Lanao del Norte one.

Moreno said the city government also monitors the Covid-19 cases in the other local government units (LGU) in Northern Mindanao as all severe to critical positive patients are admitted to the Northern Mindanao Medical Center the region's Covid-19 referral hospital.

He underscored the importance of complying with minimum public health standards to prevent the rise of new infections and not to burden the hospital system.

This is to improve he said the city's current quarantine classification which is under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) until the end of the month.

These medical tourists often seek modern healthcare at usually high costs in countries that are perceived to be better developed than Nigeria in the areas of healthcare.

Medical tourism is a worldwide phenomenon. Although the themes may be similar the reasons for it vary from patient to patient as do the factors that affect the choices of destination. In developed countries medical tourism flows towards less developed countries for reasons such as lack of insurance coverage which makes healthcare rather expensive.

From less developed nations such as Nigeria patients typically go to major medical hubs in developed countries for advanced healthcare services. Nigeria reportedly loses about £1 billion to medical tourism yearly.

Medical tourism for Nigerians is usually for varied reasons such as cosmetic procedures fertility treatments births medical and surgical care for cancer kidney disease bone surgeries and brain surgeries.

Below are the most popular medical tourism destinations for Nigerians.

1. India

India is arguably the most common destination for medical tourism not only for Nigerians but worldwide receiving about 700000 medical tourists yearly. Many reasons contribute to the success of India as a medical tourism destination. Beyond the abundance of trained manpower the Indian government has a variety of policies and visa programmes that facilitate the process of travelling to India.

Cost: Healthcare in India is less than a tenth of the costs obtainable in the United States and the United Kingdom while providing a competitive level of care.

Quality of Care: India is known to have abundant medical manpower trained at world-class medical universities in India. Many of India’s healthcare experts are also trained abroad in the United States and the United Kingdom. They often return afterwards to work in India.

India is the choice destination for surgical procedures such as transplants eye surgery and more. The country has over 39 Joint Commission International-accredited healthcare providers most of them in Chennai. The Joint Commission International is the International branch of United States Based non-profit organisation that recognises and accredits medical services.

Ease of Travel: The government of India has removed a lot of visa restrictions for travellers and also issues visa on arrival to many travellers. Chennai the Medical Tourism capital of India is known to be optimised to cater to the needs of travellers and communication is in English. Hospitals in India also have translators on staff to interpret for the patients under their care.

2. Singapore

Singapore is the second most common destination for medical tourism for Nigerians owing to its excellent healthcare services and affordability. The small city-state receives about 500000 medical tourists yearly into its many hospitals including its over 21 JCI accredited hospitals. In addition to its many policies to attract medical tourism to Singapore the city-state offers an international health insurance plan.

Cost: Singapore is typically more expensive than India for the same procedures but with the help of their loudly advertised international health insurance plans they have often offered affordable care and competitive prices compared to India.

Quality of Care: The country’s medical tourism sector is built on high-quality services and the involvement of up to 21 accredited hospitals that are Joint Commission International (JCI) accredited.

Ease of Travel: Medical Tourism to Singapore is provided by many international medical tourism agencies that connect patients in source countries to doctors in destination countries. Singapore is also an English-speaking country and Nigerians who find themselves there would not find communication a challenge.

3. United Kingdom

The relationship between Nigeria and United Kingdom in the post-colonial era has continued in many spheres chief of which are education and medical tourism. The United Kingdom has one of the best universal healthcare services in the world and for many affluent Nigerians who require healthcare United Kingdom is a popular destination. Nigeria’s president as of June 2021 is one of the most popular patrons of British healthcare services.

Cost: Medical care in the charge of the National Health Service (NHS) subsidises healthcare to British residents and citizens making it one of the most affordable in the world. However health tourists usually come to the country and visit the hospital costing the NHS approximately 1.8 billion pounds yearly although most of the tourists pay directly to the hospital at rates affordable to these usually affluent Nigerians.

Quality of Care: The United Kingdom has a high quality of care and offers world-class services at affordable rates. They are a global pacesetter in healthcare and they train international healthcare workers who often return to their own countries to mirror their practices to that of the UK. Many healthcare services in other medical tourism destinations are trained in the United Kingdom.

Ease of Travel: Just as the United Kingdom plays a central role in global politics and the global economy they are also a popular destination for travel and tourism making the country one of the easiest countries to visit.

4. Turkey

Turkey is an unlikely destination on this list but with the burgeoning popularity of cosmetic surgery especially Brazilian Butt Lift one place where you can get that is Turkey receiving more than 700000 international patients yearly mostly for plastic surgery.

Cost: A Brazilian butt lift in Turkey costs about $3500 and the country is one of the cheapest places where this is done. With hundreds of plastic surgery centres in the country their prices are competitive offering special discounts and inclusive services.

Quality of Care: Turkish healthcare is among the best in the world where doctors are continually encouraged to update their skills and knowledge. They compete globally and are one of the popular destinations for academic events such as international conferences. Turkish doctors practise in state-of-the-art Turkish hospitals and are also sought worldwide.

Ease of Travel: Each patient who arrives to get a Brazilian butt lift in Turkey needs not worry about organizational issues. Right from the visa application and travel a personal coordinator is often assigned to each patient and the cost of the surgery already covers this cost including language assistance accommodation and even meals in some clinics. Turkish airlines provides a direct flight for Nigerians going over there.

Seúl 27 de junio (Yonhap) -- Las ventas acumuladas de vehículos eléctricos (VE) en Europa de los dos fabricantes de automóviles más grandes de Corea del Sur Hyundai Motor Co. y Kia Corp. han superado las 200.000 unidades según mostraron este domingo los datos de las compañías.

Hyundai y Kia ambos del Grupo Hyundai Motor han vendido un total de 227.919 VE en el mercado automotriz europeo a fecha de mayo desde que comenzaron a vender VE allí en 2014. Las ventas de VE de Hyundai alcanzaron las 131.719 unidades mientras que las de Kia totalizaron 96.200 unidades.

Sus ventas acumuladas de VE en Europa superaron las 10.000 unidades en 2017 y superaron las 100.000 unidades el año pasado.

Este año Hyundai y Kia han vendido un total de 43.865 VE en Europa hasta mayo un 995 por ciento más que el año anterior.

El VE Kona de Hyundai fue el modelo más vendido en Europa con ventas acumuladas de 91.302 unidades seguido por el VE Niro de Kia con 58.774 unidades.

Los dos fabricantes de automóviles esperan más ventas de VE en Europa con el lanzamiento de sus nuevos modelos. Hyundai lanzó su IONIQ 5 totalmente eléctrico el mes pasado y Kia comenzará a vender su EV6 en la segunda mitad del año.

Europa es considerado un importante mercado de VE para los fabricantes de coches surcoreanos. Las ventas mundiales de VE el año pasado alcanzaron los 324 millones de unidades y Europa representó alrededor del 40 por ciento según datos del investigador de mercado EV-Volumes.

Hyundai prometió anteriormente electrizar completamente su línea de vehículos en los principales mercados incluidos Europa Estados Unidos y China para 2040. Kia tiene como objetivo vender 308.000 unidades de VE en Europa para 2030.

Hyundai y Kia también han adquirido una participación del 20 por ciento en IONITY GmbH que administra la red de estaciones de carga de VE de alta potencia más grande de Europa para expandir su infraestructura de VE.

Buen inicio de faena por debajo de Sergio Serrano remató con un pase de pecho. Siguió algo despegado pero por derechazos de gran trazo que llegaron a los tendidos. Otra tanda más por derechazos que remató con un pase de pecho mirando al tendido. Al natural el toro se quedó más corto destacando alguno por su templanza. Remató la faena con una tanda de derechazos y un pase de desprecio mirando al tendido de nuevo. Tras una estocada algo contraria y petición el presidente le concedió una oreja.

Abrió la tarde Gallatero cárdeno oscuro que recibió con una larga cambiada a porta gayola Manuel Escribano que volvía a Las Ventas tras la grave cornada que sufrió el 30 de mayo de 2019.

Manuel Escribano puso banderillas y brindó a Isabel Díaz Ayuso presidenta de Madrid. Sin apenas lucimiento debido a la escasez de fuerza del toro muy protestado por el respetable. Dejó una estocada hasta la bola.

Volvió a la puerta de toriles para recibir de nuevo a porta gayola. Esta vez el toro salió muy parado y cruzado por lo que tuvo que cambiar la larga cambiada. Puso banderillas los dos primeros pares a toro pasado. Un arriesgado tercer par en el estribo para saludar la ovación del público.

La faena fue de más a menos. El toro embistió con alegría. Destacó una tanda de profundos derechazos rematados con un trincherazo. Aunque el respetable se quedó con ganas de más ya que a su juicio el toro estuvo por encima. Tras estocada entera y petición paseó una oreja.

El segundo de la tarde un toro cárdeno bragado meano que recibió palmas en su salida de corrales. Muy protestado por su escasez de fuerzas. Sergio Serrano sacó todo lo que tuvo el de Victorino que se defendió con cierto peligro. Además fuertes rachas de viento dificultaron el manejo de la muleta. Un pinchazo y una estocada baja.

No se asentó con el capote Jiménez Fortes con el tercero de la tarde que se quedó corto en los lances. Empezó por abajo la faena de muleta. Continuó con naturales aunque sin mucho lucimiento debido en parte a los enganchones y a que el toro salía con la cara arriba de los muletazos. Destacó algún natural aunque con poco acople. Pinchazo y estocada entera.

Para cerrar la tarde saltó al ruedo Muchopan un toro de cárdeno bragado meano que recibió palmas de salida por su presentación. En el inicio de faena tropezó Fortes quedando a merced del toro que acometió contra el sin consecuencias aparentes. Tras este susto Fortes lo macheteo y pronto fue a por la espada. Erró en varias ocasiones con la espada dejando finalmente una estocada.

Los aficionados mexicanos al automovilismo se han volcado por las playeras gorras y otros artículos relacionados con el deportista nacional situación que en algunos casos ha provocado la escasez de productos debido a la alta demanda.

En recorridos realizados por EL UNIVERSAL en varias tiendas de la Ciudad de México y zona conurbada se constató la escasez de mercancía oficial relacionada con Checo Pérez además de que los fanáticos que recurrieron a compras en línea también experimentaron la falta de productos ante la euforia que ha desatado en el país la buena racha del piloto mexicano.

Si se trata de comprar la mercancía de Checo Pérez en la página oficial de Red Bull Racing el interesado tendrá muy pocos artículos disponibles. Varios productos muestran la leyenda de que están a punto de agotarse con lo que gorras playeras o sudaderas por mencionar los más populares estarán disponibles hasta nuevo aviso por parte de la escudería del piloto.

Sin importar el precio los aficionados mexicanos al automovilismo se han acercado a todas las tiendas y canales de compra disponible de los productos relacionados con el mexicano que actualmente se ubica en el tercer lugar del campeonato de pilotos de la máxima categoría del automovilismo mundial. Por ejemplo una sudadera con los colores de la bandera mexicana y el nombre de Checo Pérez cuesta 103 dólares en la página oficial de Red Bull Racing a lo cual hay que agregarlos costos de envío.

La marca Puma produce y distribuye la mercancía oficial de Red Bull Racing. En el caso de México la firma ha experimentado un fuerte crecimiento en tiendas y en línea de los productos de la escudería impulsados por el efecto Checo Pérez ante la buena racha que atraviesa el conductor de la escudería que actualmente ocupa el primer lugar del campeonato de Constructores de la Fórmula 1.

La marca insignia de la ropa de la escudería Red Bull Racing compartió con EL UNIVERSAL el buen desempeño que han tenido las ventas de sus prendas en forma física en territorio mexicano. De acuerdo con Puma luego de los primeros días de los buenos resultados del piloto nacional en consecuencia la venta de su mercancía en las tiendas de la marca se disparó 23%.

Triunfos de Checo Pérez disparan venta de ropa de Red Bull Racing

En tanto se mantuvo por algunas semanas en el top de ventas en las tiendas de Puma con varios de sus productos donde resalta la chamarra Softshell Red Bull Racing Team; la camiseta polo Red Bull Racing Team para hombre la camiseta Red Bull Racing Team así como la gorra Red Bull Racing replica Verstappen y la gorra Red Bull Racing.

El buen desempeño del Checo Pérez ha provocado que los productos se mantengan agotados en compras por internet además de un incremento de 8% en el interés de compra por parte de los aficionados mexicanos.

Deportistas mexicanos garantía de ventas

En momentos de grandes fichajes de deportistas mexicanos la comercialización de productos relacionados con sus equipos reporta altas ventas. Uno de los casos más recientes fue la llegada de Javier Chicharito Hernández a LA Galaxy donde la demanda de playeras de la liga de futbol de Estados Unidos provocó una fuerte competencia entre el jersey de Carlos Vela de LAFC sobre el exjugador del Real Madrid y Manchester United.

Ante la euforia por sus buenos resultados los deportistas mexicanos también se encuentran bien clasificados debido a los ingresos que obtienen por su buen desempeño. En 2020 La revista Forbes colocó a Saúl Canelo Álvarez con los mayores ingresos dentro de la élite deportiva mexicana con más de 37 millones de dólares al año.

En segundo sitio se encuentra el delantero del Wolverhampton de Inglaterra Raúl Jiménez quien obtiene ingresos superiores a 8.3 millones de dólares muy lejos del buen desempeño del boxeador mexicano.

Al final de la lista de Forbes Chicharito Hernández Hirving Lozano o Héctor Herrera se colocan como los mexicanos con mejores ingresos lo que en consecuencia coloca a la mercancía relacionada con sus equipos entre la más solicitada por parte de los fanáticos mexicanos.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm11bmRvdG9yby5jb20vbm90aWNpYS9kZXRhbGxlcy0xNC8xNTc5NDI30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los detalles del regreso de las corridas de toros a Las Ventas,Somos un grupo de profesionales periodistas apasionados por el mundo del toro.

This year the must-have Hamptons accoutrement is neither a reservation at Nick & Toni’s nor a rental within walking distance of Cooper’s Beach but a cellphone booster bought through cellphone providers or places like Best Buy and which costs $200 to $1100 plus fees.

The Hamptons a 30-mile stretch of hamlets east of Long Island’s Shinnecock Canal have pristine beaches excellent restaurants and a celebrity crowd. But the area’s infrastructure fails to meet the needs of its swelling summer population a problem that seems to have grown worse with an influx of urban expatriates during lockdown.

“The infrastructure was adequate for maybe nine months of the year but would be stressed even before the pandemic during the summer” said Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr. whose district includes the Hamptons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L2N1bHR1cmUvbWFqb3ItY2VsbC1jYXJyaWVycy1hcmUtYWxsZWdlZGx5LWJsb2NraW5nLXNsdXRib3Qtc2V4dHMtZXNwZWNpYWxseS1xdWVlci1vbmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ghosted by your sext chatbot? Your cell carrier may be blocking it.,"Though they won’t tell you much about it if you ask all the major phone companies are automatically screening your text messages. This process is for the most part meant to protect users from spam text messages — less pervasive than email spam yes but a problem across the world nonetheless. (Apple even recently added official support for third-party SMS spam filter apps.)

Much of this process is completed automatically through the use of back-end screening technology trained to specifically flag spammy messages. Sometimes these systems slip up and allow spam texts to come through — but the opposite is true too. Text messages often go undelivered with no explanation and unlike more modern systems SMS does not usually alert users to their messages’ failure.

But what happens when the automatic screening process wrongly flags messages that the user explicitly opted into receiving? This is the nature of the problem being faced by SlutBot a sexting AI that operates via SMS. SlutBot users have been flocking to the community’s official Discord channel to complain that they’re not receiving some of SlutBot’s messages — especially when they concern LGBTQ material.

One of the introductory messages being filtered for SlutBot users.

Errors aplenty — The SlutBot team first became aware of this issue when users started complaining in the community’s Discord channel. Some users — there doesn’t seem to be a pattern — will receive SlutBot’s initial text message but any follow-up content simply won’t go through. There doesn’t seem to be a pattern to which content is blocked. SlutBot is currently running a program about queer sex though and it’s largely messages related to this program that are being filtered.

Here’s the Twilio back-end.

SlutBot’s only insight into why this might be happening comes via Twilio a communication API used for scheduling automatic SMS communications. Twilio reports errors through unique codes and there’s a special one just for carrier filtering issues: 30007. The SlutBot team is seeing lots of those lately as well as a similar 30008 error that essentially means Twilio couldn’t confirm carrier involvement in the issue.

Honest mistake or not it’s a problem — This likely boils down to an issue with carriers’ SMS filtering programs. Machine learning models are notoriously finicky; whichever models are being utilized by carriers like Verizon and AT&T are likely flagging SlutBot’s messages as spam.

The SlutBot team tells Input they’ve faced SMS filtering problems before but never to quite this extent. “Carriers are not transparent about the algorithms they use to scan customers' text messages. Protecting customers from spam is one thing” a SlutBot team member said. “Censoring sex-positive LGBTQ content that customers explicitly sign up to receive is another.”

This is a larger issue of carrier transparency (Twilio has an entire FAQ dedicated to SMS filtering in the U.S and Canada) but it’s also a business issue for companies like SlutBot. Twilio and similar services still charge for messages that are filtered by carriers. And from the perspective of a SlutBot customer it just seems like SlutBot isn’t working properly. This leads to frustrations and potentially even customer departure.

When reached for comment on the matter a representative from AT&T said: “Our systems for protecting our customers from unwanted or SPAM text messages don’t work that way and any suggestion otherwise is wrong.”

Verizon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this issue. We’ll update our piece if they get back to us.

We’re hopeful this transparency issue is one carriers are forced to deal with in the not-too-distant future — there’s no good reason consumers shouldn’t be privy to the reasons why their SMS messages are rendered undeliverable.

Khan said.

“The company has had discussions with a number of established Indian generics manufacturers and is in discussion with the Medicines Patent Pool to explore the potential for additional licences in India as well licences with manufacturers outside of India to broaden the geographic footprint of MSD’s generic partners"" Khan told Mint in an email interview.

US-based MSD known as Merck and Co. in its home country and Canada has so far signed pacts with eight generic drug manufacturers in India including Aurobindo Pharma Cipla Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Emcure Pharmaceuticals Hetero Labs Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Torrent Pharmaceuticals and Viatris for manufacturing the drug which is in phase 3 trial in the US. Viatris is the merged entity of Mylan and Pfizer arm Upjohn.

The drug manufactured by these firms will be supplied to about 100 low-and-middle-income countries. It is aimed at treating non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate covid-19 and as part of the agreement with MSD the authorized partners will conduct clinical trials in India.

“They have already been engaging with the regulatory authority on the design of the phase 3 clinical trials and will base these trials on learnings from MSD’s global phase 2 trials for Indian patients to have access to Molnupiravir as soon as possible"" Khan said. They will seek expedited approvals for faster access to molnupiravir in India he said.

MSD expects to make a submission for an emergency use authorization with the US Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2021 after which it would seek authorization from others.

There is “a nominal royalty standard to voluntary licensing agreements shared between the company and its development partners"" but the company is not entering into these agreements for financial gain Khan said. However he refused to divulge the details on royalty as they are confidential.

MSD also plans to make its drug part of the MPP to help improve access. MPP was formed by Unitaid in 2010 and is aimed at improving access to affordable treatments in low and middle income countries via non-exclusive voluntary licensing. Its mandate initially was for drugs that treated HIV hepatitis C and tuberculosis but it was last year expanded to include covid-19 as well.

Storms floods and droughts can be catastrophic for people and the environment but are these events on the rise? We asked 4 experts in climate science 'Are extreme weather events becoming more frequent globally?' here is what we found.

What are extreme weather events?

Extreme weather means weather events that are rare for the place and time that they are in such as a snowstorm in Hawaii. It can also mean weather that strongly impacts day-to-day life such as severe storms and droughts.

Blizzards floods droughts hurricanes tornados and heatwaves are extreme weather events. To understand if extreme weather events are changing experts say it varies depending on the type of weather event.

Dr Geert Jan van Oldenborgh an expert in climate science from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute says ""Some types of weather events are becoming more extreme such as heatwaves or intense precipitation. Others are becoming less extreme such as cold waves. And many fall in between: in some areas drought becomes more extreme in others less so"".

What is the evidence that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent?

Dr Michael Wehner an expert in climatology from the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory in the US says ""Certain types of extreme weather have already become more severe because of human-induced climate change. Other types of extreme weather are expected to become more severe as the climate warms but changes have not definitely been found so far.""

The types of extreme weather that have been observed to become more severe include heatwaves droughts and extreme precipitation. While snowstorms and blizzards will likely become less frequent and severe.

For other types of extreme weather events like hurricanes the evidence is more nuanced. Scientists expect more intense bigger and longer-lasting storms but actually fewer storms overall. These bigger hurricanes might also produce much more rainfall.

Dr Wehner says ""Hurricanes and tropical cyclones have been extensively studied and found to have greater amounts of precipitation than there would have been had humans not interfered with the climate system…While increases in hurricane precipitation are well-established increases in the wind speed of intense hurricanes are also expected. However these expected extreme wind speed increases are yet to be robustly detected due to signal to noise issues.""

Some forms of extreme weather are so difficult to measure that it is not possible to definitely say if they are becoming more severe or not.

""Very localized storms such as tornadoes mesoscale convective systems and derechos are data limited so formal detection and attribution has not yet been performed"" explains Dr Wehner.

Professor Kevin Trenberth a leading atmospheric scientist makes an important distinction for us relating to this question: ""A key point here is that there are not more of these events (mostly) but rather the events that do occur are associated with greater extremes on the warm side for temperatures and at both ends of the water cycle.""

Why are extreme weather events on the rise?

As highlighted by Dr Wehner it is well established that extreme weather events are and will continue to increase because of climate change.

Dr Walter Robinson an expert in climate science from North Carolina State University in the US says ""As the climate warms not surprisingly we see more and more extreme heat events"".

Warm climates then have knock-on effects. Dr Robinson explains: ""Because extreme heat increases evaporation soils and vegetation dry out faster when it is hotter. Thus heatwaves are often associated with drought.""

Interestingly warmer climates can cause extreme precipitation as well as droughts. Dr Walter goes on ""As temperatures increase the amount of water vapor in the air in moist conditions increases (we say the atmosphere can 'hold' more water vapor). This is a strong effect – roughly a 7 percent increase in water vapor (at saturation) for every degree Celsius rise in temperature. Because atmospheric water vapor converts to rain in clouds as climate warms we expect the heaviest rains will become heavier. There is strong observational evidence that this is happening.""

The effect of increased temperature on cloud formation also influences extreme storms. Dr Walter says ""When water vapor condenses in clouds it releases heat. This 'latent' heat provides the fuel for many kinds of storms: tropical cyclones (hurricanes) and ordinary and severe thunderstorms. It is likely therefore that some storms are becoming more violent as climate warms – for example the strengths of the strongest tropical cyclones appear to be increasing.""

He concludes ""There are many other ways through which climate change can lead to increases in extreme weather. These are less certain than the direct effects of heat drying and water-holding capacity described above however and the topics of very active research in climate science.""

The takeaway

Extreme weather events like heatwaves droughts and extreme rainfall are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change. Others like snowstorms are likely becoming less frequent. Hurricanes are likely to become bigger and longer-lasting but actually fewer in number – but the observational evidence for this is not yet clear.

After the Season 2 Finale Fans Think So,"Although the Apple TV Plus+ comedy has only been on-air for two seasons Mythic Quest has quickly become popular among viewers. We were initially introduced to the MQ team in February 2020 but the series of events that take place in the final episodes of Season 2 led fans to wonder if their quest has come to an end. Now that Ian and Poppy have made their exit from the company Brad has found himself in jail and Rachel has left town is Mythic Quest over?

Is ‘Mythic Quest’ over?

As of now showrunners have not announced whether Mythical Quest will be canceled or renewed for Season 3. There is no indication that the series is ending anytime soon however. In a previous interview with Forbes cast members revealed what viewers should expect when and if the series returns Season 3. According to Charlotte Nicdao who plays Poppy Li in Mythic Quest the best is yet to come.

Nicdao explained “I love the idea that there’s this openness to explore a whole different kind of dynamic between them. In Season 1 Ian’s the boss [and] Poppy is kind of his underling. And then [in] Season 2 they have this equal power.”

“And then [in] Season 3 we’re going into this new space hopefully where Poppy has got a lot of power.” The Mythic Quest actress added “It’s her idea. And I’m personally interested to see what she does with that and what it does to the dynamic between the two of them.”

While Jesse Ennis (who plays Jo) could not confirm if the series will return for a third season the actress was optimistic about the future. She shared “We don’t know yet if we have a Season 3 but we know that Season 3 will probably come back and be stuck with a lot of the same hijinks that Poppy and Ian provide to these characters.”

Meanwhile Rachel (Ashly Burch) and Dana (Imani Hakim) will have their own set of issues in the potentially upcoming season. With Rachel pursuing her passion for writing at Berkley fans wonder how the couple will cope. But Hakim predicts that although they may have some bumps in the road Rachel and Dana will eventually find their way.

“I see them becoming powerhouses. I think it’s really fun that we’re gonna start hopefully exploring these two women outside of the testers’ room and seeing them really take their careers into their own hands and how we can implement that in the world of Mythic Quest. I think that’s gonna be really cool” Hakim explained.

So when is 'Mythic Quest' returning for Season 3?

Although there has been no official confirmation of Mythic Quest returning for Season 3 some fans anticipate that the network will announce their decision following the Season 2 finale. On Reddit a fan wrote “It’s a no-brainer renewal. Many of the other big Apple TV Plus hits got renewal announcements even before the second season aired.”",,,,,,

And currently $3.38 for an eight-pack keeping these in the cooler is a great way to stay hydrated… and they might even make a fun mixer for an easy summer cocktail if you're 21 or older.

Kinder's Blackened with Cayenne and Lemon Rub

Kinder's rubs are a favorite of Costco members too. If you love a blackened salmon or chicken but sometimes find it tough to get a homemade rub just right this rub currently on Walmart's site for $1.98 could save you a few steps before you throw things on the grill next weekend.

The Equality Act passed the House of Representatives in February but is yet to be passed by the Senate.

All but three Republicans in the House voted against LGBTQ+ equality. Those 206 politicians were bolstered in part by huge donations from US corporations.

Amazon for instance donated over $450000 to politicians who voted against the Act according to data from The Center for Responsive Politics for the 2020 election cycle.

But the company is still happy to garner profits from queer identities. The company offers a special Pride store offering unicorn pool floats and rainbow-striped K-Swiss sneakers.

Fran Tirado a writer and LGBTQ+ strategist is critical of these advertising efforts. “In an ideal world there would be no Pride campaigns. Brands and companies profiting off marginalized identities with bad rainbow-washed advertising ploys is an abhorrent tradition of this country” he said.

It’s not just products. Tirado watches his inbox get flooded every June with work requests. “Most queer and trans folks who get wrapped into any kind of marketing initiative this month often end up feeling exhausted underpaid tokenized and exploited. But because we exist under capitalism Pride campaigns are obligatory – and often a key source of income for queer and trans people in media and entertainment spaces.”

Walmart has also donated over $400000 to politicians that sought to block equality. The food giant has changed its Twitter avatar this month to be a rainbow colored-version of its logo.

Reporting record earnings (tied to pandemic-induced home improvement projects) Home Depot has also shown support for politicians that blocked the Equality Act. The company’s billionaire co-founder Ken Langone is a longtime donor to the Republican party.

Like Amazon and Walmart Home Depot also makes donations to Democratic candidates (for instance giving a quarter of a million dollars to the Biden campaign). Many firms donate to candidates from both parties to hedge their bets when it comes to political influence.

AT&T also provided a huge boost to Republican politicians trying to prevent a federal law that would protect LGBTQ+ people. The company donated over $1m to 163 different Republicans including Steve Scalise ($22150) and Kevin McCarthy ($20881).

These totals only include donations to politicians that voted against the bill. But many corporations also made large donations to Mitch McConnell (for example AT&T gave him $56295 in the 2020 cycle) despite his persistent obstructions to the Equality Act. In 2020 McConnell then the Senate majority leader refused to bring the act to the Senate floor.

There has been widespread anger in the LGBTQ+ community in recent years over the perceived corporate hijacking of Pride marches. In 2019 the Reclaim Pride Coalition launched the Queer Liberation March as an “antidote to the corporate-infused police-entangled politician-heavy Parades that now dominate Pride celebrations in a grotesque expression of societal forms of marginalization and oppression for Queer and Trans people”.

For Tirado engaging with big brands is often necessary but “holding them accountable is a crucial part of how we ethically engage with these campaigns”. He adds that’s why it’s added salt to the wound for any company to brag “allyship” and a rainbow logo while also donating to anti-queer efforts. “If you’re going to perform advocacy we need to see it matched on your dollars too resourcing queer and trans communities year-round.”

This year’s Queer Liberation March in New York will take place on Sunday the same day as New York City Pride one of the largest annual Pride marches in the world. Amazon Walmart Home Depot and others will not be welcome.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGFsa2J1c2luZXNzLm5ldC8yMDIxLzA2L3RoZS1zdXBwbHktc2lkZS1tZXdhbG1hcnQtYXBwLWFpbXMtdG8taW1wcm92ZS1zdG9yZS1lZmZpY2llbmN5LXN1cHBvcnQtZW1wbG95ZWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Supply Side: Me@Walmart app aims to improve store efficiency support employees,"Walmart has in recent years implemented a lot of technology to help store employees but the latest investment in the Me@Walmart mobile app is the best thing local store employees said they have seen in a long time.

The app was built in-house by Walmart’s Global Tech for U.S. store employees and has been tested in a handful of stores since November 2020. Walmart Store No. 2686 (1703 E. Central Ave. in Bentonville) was among the first to get the technology which is on Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro smartphones that Walmart makes available to store employees at no cost. Walmart issues the phones which run on store Wi-Fi but if employees want to add phone and texting service they can do so at their own expense. Walmart said it covers the cost of the phone case and warranty.

The company recently said the Me@Walmart pilot was expanded twice and will be added to hundreds of more stores over the next several months. Walmart said it will give out more than 740000 smartphones equipped with the app to help employees with multiple aspects from checking in and out of work to quickly locating which boxes need to go from the back room out to the sales floor.

Drew Holler senior vice president Walmart U.S. People Operations said the app idea started as a way to manage employee schedules and has grown into a tool to help workers save time and be more efficient.

“We believe it’s the first of its kind in the retail industry” Holler noted in a recent blog post. “As we make enhancements for our customers we’re also rethinking how we can help our associates succeed in their roles today and deliver some of what they’ll need for the future. The right tools can be the difference between fast and frustrating.”

Zachary Moore store manager at Walmart No. 2686 told the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal before the Me@Walmart app and the new Samsung smartphones employees had to share handheld devices. He said there were a limited number of the Zebra Telxon devices introduced about three years ago for store workers to share. Moore said with a limited number of handheld Telxon devices per store employees were often looking for one to use to complete their tasks. He said they would get taken home or misplaced and searching for them often became the norm. When the Me@Walmart app was introduced this past fall he said all store employees got the Samsung device and productivity increased.

One of the first functions in the app was scheduling which allows employees to view their shifts up to two weeks in advance. They can also check upcoming paid time off and request changes to their schedule. The mobile clock-in function was added and has become the favored way to clock in and out. The mobile time clock uses geofencing technology around the store and employees tap the button once when they arrive at the store and can go right to work.

Justin Tallman stocking team lead at store No. 2686 said this saves employees five to 15 minutes by not having to walk to the back of the store and often wait in line to clock in or out as shifts change. The mobile clock-in is the way most employees start work and clock out of their shifts or sign out for breaks.

Another function the app has is the “push to talk” feature. Moore said only store managers have walkie-talkies and there are times when co-workers and their team leaders need to talk or exchange information. This new feature allows workers to see everyone who is in the system and then push a button to send them an instant message.

“We are just now starting to use this function and it allows associates to stay connected at all times” Moore said.

The app also has the “Ask Sam” feature that is a voice-activated assistant to help employees find products check processes or get the information they need to do their job. Julianne Fitchue the front-end lead at store No. 2686 uses the “Ask Sam” feature every day.

“I am up front and when I get customer calls to see if we have products in stock all I have to do is use the ‘Ask Sam’ feature” Fitchue said. “And I can see the inventory we have on hand and also see what is available at other stores nearby. Before this last iteration of ‘Ask Sam’ on Samsung I would have had to find a Telxon or go look for myself and then I still wouldn’t know what was in other stores.”

Moore said this function is great for new employees and keeps them working and not having to locate a supervisor for help. He said with store remodels this function is frequently used to locate items that have been moved to other aisles. He said “Ask Sam” is also used for training and other development opportunities.

But one of the biggest assets to the Me@Walmart app is the Visual Picking function (VizPic) that is a timesaver for those who check boxes out of the back room for shelf replenishment. Tallman and Anthony Apple operations lead said this function is a game-changer. Apple said VizPic allows stockers to speed up the time it takes to get items from the back room to the sales floor. Before VizPic employees had to physically scan the QR codes on each box. This was time-consuming and laborious but necessary to ensure the items in the shortest supply were the first ones sent out to the shelves.

The old program for checking inventory for replenishment was called CAPS and was largely a manual process that used a Telxon to read each QR Code and store that information. With VizPic the Samsung camera is aimed at the QR codes on boxes. Using augmented reality the app can detect which boxes need to be moved to the floor first. As the phone is held up and aimed at the boxes with the camera activated the boxes that need to be moved will have a blue plus-mark on them visible through the phone camera.

Tallman said what used to take two hours to complete can now be done in a few minutes. He said in just 10 seconds he can scan a whole section and be moving items out to the floor more quickly. He and Apple said this function is the best tool they have had to work within their Walmart tenure of a combined 12 years.

Walmart said the patent is pending on this technology for the VizPic function. Keeping shelves well-stocked is important and an area where Walmart continues to need improvement. Walmart said since piloting VizPic last year the function takes a third of the time of the previous manual process.

When Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Concertmaster Margaret Batjer took the stage at Walt Disney Concert Hall Saturday she dramatically removed her black mask and cast it aside beaming as she bowed to a full audience which applauded vigorously.

The moment felt especially triumphant: it was LACO's first live concert since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 and it also marked the reopening of Los Angeles' iconic Disney Hall for live performances.

Before the performance concert-goers gathered in front of the hall waiting to show proof of vaccination to get in. It had the feeling of an informal reunion. Old friends hugged -- with some hesitancy after so much time ""social distancing.""

Without masks people saw full faces and recognized friends trading stories and asking after each other. I was happy to reunite with some fellow violinists students journalists and community friends and even to meet a few new people and hear some new stories. I met LACO's new Executive Director Ben Cadwallader whose first day on the job was March 9 2020.



LACO Executive Director Ben Cadwallader.

What a year to begin but as he said from the stage before the concert ""We made it!""

Of course all this hopeful activity took place alongside signs of COVID's losses. The large LA Phil posters at the entrance to Disney Hall served as a reminder that this venue was vacated suddenly and that it has stood dormant for more than a year.

""What's Next - Walt Disney Concert Hall 2019/2020"" reads one poster with the others advertising concert highlights for January through May 2020. Painful the concerts that never happened.

Stepping inside Disney Hall had the feeling of a place that has been asleep and is just barely ready to wake up. The escalators haven't been in constant motion since March 2020 have they? And surely not too many people have been walking on this carpet or sitting on these benches or using these restrooms. But here they come...

As I sat down in the audience of about 800 people I overheard someone in front of me exclaim to a friend ""I'm very excited this is my first concert since the pandemic!"" California only officially re-opened on June 15 so this was likely the case for many in attendance.

The orchestra assembled on stage with one person to a music stand. As described before Batjer discarded her mask with style and then tuned the orchestra. The audience applauded even louder when conductor Jaime Martín took the stage - so much applause before the orchestra had even played a note!

But something even better than applause happened when Martín raised his baton: silence. I'd forgotten the visceral magic of a silence that hundreds of people willingly enter together. Here it was.

LACO's Andrew Shulman gently broke that silence with a quiet and captivating cello solo played with harpist Elisabeth Zosseder at the beginning of Ginastera's ""Variaciones concertantes."" The piece unfolds with textures both thick and thin with quiet moments and sections blasting with energy. What a nice way to wake up a hall I thought.

Then I wondered is a hall like a violin?

A violin needs to be played in order to keep its voice strong. This concept sounds kooky at first but it is widely accepted among violin players and makers: a violin viola or cello needs those constant in-tune vibrations in order to stay live-sounding and resonant. Left untouched for a long period a stringed instrument will ""shut down"" in a noticeable way and opening it back up will require playing it frequently.

Whether or not a hall can undergo a similar phenomenon LACO filled Disney Hall with a lot of good vibes on Saturday.

After the Ginastera LA-based composer Juan Pablo Contreras' 2016 piece ""Mariachitlán"" filled the air with sounds inspired by the mariachi music of his native Mexican state of Jalisco. The mariachi sound was certainly there from the beginning as well as plenty of percussion perhaps a slide whistle and some great fiddling from Batjer while Zosseder actually knocked on the wood of her harp. At one point a whistle blew (police trying to stop the party according to the program notes). The whistle made audience members laugh out loud. The party goes on despite it with members of the orchestra reciting ""Mariachitlán!"" over and over as the music grows even more intense. Certainly music to vigorously awaken any sleeping hall!

The composer was in attendance and he brought onto the stage for even more applause.

Mendelssohn's joyful ""Italian"" Symphony No. 4 followed and the final movement stood out as the highlight. Martín took a very fast tempo that seemed on the edge of physics. No problem for the musicians in LACO though - they nailed the fiendish passagework that permeates the entire movement playing beautifully in sync.

This was to be the end of the concert but it was not. Maestro Martín took the microphone to address the audience and to specifically thank Los Angeles philanthropists Terri and Jerry Kohl whose extraordinary generosity sustained LACO and many of the city's classical music institutions through the pandemic.

Knowing that Martín was a principal flutist for many years in orchestras all over London Jerry Kohl had told the conductor he'd like to hear him play the flute.

""So I'm doing this just for him"" Martín said taking out his flute ""you all can listen too.""

With cellist Shulman accompanying Martín played Telemann's ""Cunando"" a beautiful short piece.



Jaime Martín plays an encore. Photo by Greg Grudt/Mathew Imaging courtesy of LACO.

He was truly enchanting like a piper from a children's story turning to different parts of the audience and walking around as he played.

Afterwards perhaps to break us out of the spell he had cast Martín led the orchestra in an exuberant Spanish overture: ""Intermedio de la Boda de Luis Alonzo"" by Gerónimo Giménez. Martín's final gesture of the evening looked like the winning home-run swing of a baseball game.

Disney Hall and live music are officially open for business in Los Angeles - play ball!



Yay! I finally met LA Times critic Mark Swed after years of admiring his writing.

Disney said they would be testing fireworks at Magic Kingdom Saturday and Tuesday night ahead of the revival of firework spectaculars set to return July 1 at the resort.

“Put on your favorite pajamas cozy up and look to the skies” Disney officials said in a Facebook post. ”We understand the evening noise impacts may not be ideal and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to your routines. We hope you enjoy the show! “

Disney said the firework testing would happen after regular park hours.

Firework displays have been suspended since the theme parks reopening following a months-long closure due to the pandemic.

On July 1 Happily Ever After will once again transform Cinderella Castle with “lights projections and pyrotechnics as moments from favorite Disney stories encourage you to grab hold of your dreams and make them come true” Disney said on its blog. “And as part of the ongoing transformation of EPCOT “EPCOT Forever” will produce a spectacle of fireworks music and lighting effects over World Showcase Lagoon highlighting the themes of innovation exploration imagination and celebration at the core of the park’s past present and future.”

Disney officials said fireworks have been a tradition at Disney theme parks since 1957.

And while we can’t wait to experience all the new attractions stores and shows to come we can’t help but think back on all the things that you used to be able to do in the parks.

To stoke our nostalgia we’re going through all the “remember whens” and other things you may not know no longer exist at Disney World anymore!

You can’t do these 16 things in Disney World anymore!

Wear a Costume as an Adult

If you’re an adult headed to Disney World you’re going to have to leave the Cinderella costume behind because Disney no longer allows guests over the age of 14 to wear a costume in the park.

Why? Well a lot of costumes can make you look a whole lot like a character when you’re exploring the parks and Disney doesn’t want guests and kids to confuse the real Disney characters in the parks with guests who are dressed up. Plus this ensures that they can maintain character integrity and keep the storylines going.

However there are a few circumstances when adults can wear costumes according to Disney’s website including Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party and some outfits inspired by Star Wars.

Swim in the Lakes

Not many Disney goers will remember this but Disney used to allow guests to swim in Bay Lake and Seven Seas Lagoon. As you can imagine that has now been long gone.

Alligators are really what stopped this from happening but there was also the risk for guests to contract a disease or illness from the unpurified water. In fact Disney’s first water park River Country used water from Bay Lake and a young boy did reportedly contract a fatal disease from the park’s water. Swimming in the water from the lake is no more at Disney World.

Smoke in the Parks

Another thing that is no longer allowed in Disney World is smoking. It used to be that there were a few designated areas that guests could smoke or vape in the parks but Disney changed this a few years ago and made the parks entirely smoke-free.

That being said though there still are some spots that smoking is allowed it’s just VERY limited and located outside the park gates.

Bring a Selfie Stick

When selfie sticks first became popular you could find A LOT of them in Disney World. People would hold them up on rides during parades at fireworks shows and more.

As you might guess the selfie sticks were obstructing park-goers’ views and were pretty dangerous on rides so Disney banned the accessory in the parks in 2015. Now Disney will confiscate your selfie stick at security if you bring one along.

Ride Up Front on the Monorail

One of the cooler experiences that used to be offered to select families was the opportunity to ride up front with the pilot in the monorail. Only a few lucky guests got to sit up there but if you were chosen you were treated to some pretty great views along your ride to Magic Kingdom or EPCOT.

However this was discontinued after a monorail accident that resulted in the death of a Cast Member.

Wake Tinker Bell

Over in the Magic Kingdom Tink used to live in Tinker Bell’s Fairy Treasures gift shop (now Castle Couture) and each day Disney would choose one lucky kiddo to wake her up. The chosen guest would ring a bell and Tink would soar up above the shelves and land behind the registers to briefly say hi before heading out for her day’s work in the shop.

This was wildly popular and lots of people wanted to be the chosen one but it went away in 2010 when the store was renovated and became Castle Couture.

Meet a Talking Mickey Mouse

Back in 2013 Mickey got a bit of an upgrade in his meet and greet location at the front of Main Street U.S.A. in Town Square Theater at Magic Kingdom and could TALK to guests who visited!

Mickey would say hi to guests perform a magic trick and interact with the guests before sending them on their way. It was kinda creepy and cool all in the same but Mickey ended up going silent in 2018 and he’s been back to his old miming ways ever since.

Say Hi to PUSH the Trash Can

Way back when there was another unique meet and greet in Magic Kingdom — its name was PUSH the talking trash can! Yup you read that right! You could MEET a trash can that roamed Tomorrowland throughout the day.

It became a celebrity to guests over the 20 years that the trash can was out saying hi to guests but Disney ended up retiring PUSH in 2014. It can still be found roaming the international parks from time to time.

Rent a Cabana in Tomorrowland

Speaking of Tomorrowland there was also a time when you could rent a cabana for the day to hang out with your family and escape from the heat in Magic Kingdom.

These cabana stations came with charging stations sunscreen snacks water and lockable storage and accommodated up to eight people. They were an eyesore but the real reason that the rentals didn’t take off and ended up being eliminated was that they cost a whopping $691 (plus tax) for a day’s rental.

Get a Pirate Tutorial from Captain Jack Sparrow

In Disney World kids can train with a Jedi Master get decked out like a princess in the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique and used to be able to learn how to be a pirate from Captain Jack Sparrow himself!

Captain Jack Sparrow’s Pirate Tutorial began in 2006 and took place in Magic Kingdom on the stage across from Pirates of the Caribbean in Adventureland. Kids could learn how to fight with a sword and swore the oath “a pirate’s life for me.” This show was discontinued in 2018 and now Captain Jack Sparrow can be caught here meeting guests from time to time instead.

Play Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom

Another Magic Kingdom activity that was loved by many park-goers was Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom. In this game guests picked up a stack of magic cards from the Main Street Fire Station and made their way through the park unlocking interactive displays.

But the last spell was cast in January 2021 and we’ve been watching as many of the game stations have been removed throughout the park this year.

See a Morning Welcome Show at Magic Kingdom’s Main Street Railroad Station

For all the early rising Disney vacationers Disney used to host a show right up front at the Magic Kingdom gate called the Morning Welcome Show. If you got to the park right at opening you could watch as the mayor welcomed guests say hi to Mickey and his pals meet the “family of the day” and do some singing and dancing at the Railroad station.

This show was replaced back in 2017 with a new welcome show called “Let the Magic Begin” which takes place down Main Street U.S.A. on the Cinderella Castle stage.

See a Nighttime Parade

Speaking of Magic Kingdom shows the park used to have a nighttime parade that took place twice every night and featured some really cool light-up floats! It started with Spectromagic! which ran from 1991 to 2010 and then was replaced by the Main Street Electrical Parade.

However the Main Street Electrical Paraded ended in 2016 and no nighttime parade has been available in Disney World since.

Attend Star Wars Weekends

Before there was Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge in Disney’s Hollywood Studios there were Star Wars Weekends! These specially-themed weekends were where guests could meet some celebrities from the saga plus there was meet and greet opportunities with rare Star Wars characters and specialty eats and drinks throughout the park.

Disney canceled the weekends after 2015 and now guests can experience many of the offerings in the dedicated Star Wars land in the park instead.

Audition for American Idol

If you were a singer or had a singer in your family then you might remember The American Idol Experience in Disney’s Hollywood Studios. This show took place in the Hyperion Theater near Echo Lake and guests actually auditioned to be in the show in the morning. Those who were selected would then sing in a competition against other competitors and at the end of the day the grand winner got a golden ticket to actually audition for American Idol on TV.

Guests can no longer get their golden ticket in Disney’s Hollywood Studios as the show closed in 2014 and was replaced by For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration which is still there today.

View the Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights

The last thing that you can no longer do in Disney World is perhaps one of the most missed attractions by fans — the Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights. This “show” came to Disney’s Hollywood Studios around Christmas time each year and featured 5 million lights snow music and took place in the Streets of America.

Sadly the final season you could view this “spectacle” was 2015 as the Streets of America was torn down to be replaced by Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge.

Well that was a trip down memory lane! You can check out more of the canceled Disney World shows attractions and activities in our video below!

But as Disney continues modifying its operations as we move forward with the ongoing pandemic will the EPCOT Monorail reopen? Well one Disney Guest spotted Cast Members on the platform of the EPCOT Monorail and many hope this is a sign towards its return!

As seen in the video below which was taken by Disney Guest and Annual Passholders – Walt Disney World Resort Facebook group member Hunter M. several Disney Cast Members were spotted heading up the EPCOT Monorail platform!

Though at this time Disney World has not announced when the EPCOT Monorail would return service to and from the Ticket and Transportation Center many hope this to be a good sign.

Inside the Magic will continue to update you as we get information regarding the EPCOT Monorail. At this time if you wish to Park Hop to or from EPCOT please utilize the Disney Skyliner which has transportation to Disney’s Riviera Resort Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort Disney’s Pop Century Resort Disney’s Art of Animation Resort and Disney’s Hollywood Studios or one of Disney World’s buses.

Additionally the Monorail running from the Ticket and Transportation Center to Magic Kingdom is currently up and running.

Do you hope to see the EPCOT Monorail return soon? Let us know in the comments below.

If you want to visit Walt Disney World on your next vacation start planning today!"

After being moved to October 1st Dune’s release has been pushed back yet again this time to October 22nd Variety reports. The move was one of several releases Warner Bros. rescheduled with the Clint Eastwood-directed Cry Macho moved to September 17th and The Many Saints of Newark a prequel to The Sopranos moved to October 1st.

The adaptation of the 1965 Frank Herbert sci-fi classic has an all-star cast that includes Timothée Chalamet Rebecca Ferguson Oscar Isaac Stellan Skarsgård Zendaya Jason Momoa Josh Brolin Dave Bautista and Javier Bardem. Dune is slated to be the first of two movies based on the book. The movie coming out in October (at this point anyway) will cover the massive novel’s first half while a second as-yet-unnamed movie is planned to cover the rest. There was also an HBO Max prequel series in the works.

Dune is among the upcoming Warner Bros. movies slated to debut on HBO Max at the same time it hits theaters. That controversial decision announced by Warner Bros. in December didn’t sit well with many in the industry including Villenueve. He blasted the studio’s then-parent company AT&T saying in a Variety op-ed that it had “hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history.” AT&T announced in May that it would spin off its WarnerMedia business to merge it with TV company Discovery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdXMvbGl2ZS1uZXdzL21pYW1pLWZsb3JpZGEtYnVpbGRpbmctY29sbGFwc2UtMDYtMjctMjEtaW50bC9oXzhkZmQxZDg2YmJlYzE3M2Y2NDY4NDU1ZDAyODZjMjMx0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdXMvbGl2ZS1uZXdzL21pYW1pLWZsb3JpZGEtYnVpbGRpbmctY29sbGFwc2UtMDYtMjctMjEtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At least 9 dead after partial building collapse near Miami: Live updates,"Rescue workers search the rubble of the Champlain Towers South condominium Saturday June 26 in the Surfside area of Miami. Lynne Sladky/AP

A structural field survey report completed nearly three years before the collapse of the Champlain Towers south condominium complex in Surfside raised concerns about structural damage to the concrete slab below the pool deck and “cracking and spalling” located in the parking garage.

The report from October 2018 was included in a series of public records documents that were published overnight on the Surfside Florida town website. The New York Times was the first media outlet to publish a story about the field survey report.

Page seven of the report the goal of which was to ""understand and document the extent of structural issues that require(d) repair and/or remediation in the immediate and near future"" detailed signs of “distress/fatigue” in the parking garage:

“Abundant cracking and spalling of various degrees was observed in the concrete columns beams and walls. Several sizeable spalls were noted in both the topside of the entrance drive ramp and underside of the pool/ entrance drive/ planter slabs which included instances with exposed deteriorating rebar. Though some of this damage is minor most of the concrete deterioration needs to be repaired in a timely fashion.”

Spalling is a term used to describe areas of concrete that have cracked or crumbled.

The 2018 report also noted that ""many of the previous garage concrete repairs"" were ""failing.""

The report also said the waterproofing below the pool deck was failing and causing ""major structural damage.""

“…the waterproofing below the pool deck and Entrance Drive as well as all of the planter waterproofing is beyond its useful life and therefore must all be completely removed and replaced. The failed waterproofing is causing major structural damage to the concrete structural slab below these areas. Failure to replace the waterproofing in the near future will cause the extent of the concrete deterioration to expand exponentially” the report read.

It further noted that ""the replacement of the existing deck waterproofing will be extremely expensive...be disruptive and create a major disturbance to the occupants of this condominium building.""

The report which didn't give any indication that the structure was at risk of collapse was completed by Frank Morabito with Morabito Consultants. CNN reached out to Morabito Consultants on Friday who offered no comment.

An attorney for the building's condominium association Kenneth Direktor warned against early speculation. The building he told CNN on Friday had been subject to a series of inspections ""over the last several months"" as part of its milestone 40-year safety certification process.

""Nothing like this was foreseeable"" Direktor said. ""At least it wasn't seen by the engineers who were looking at the building from a structural perspective.""

CNN reached out to Kenneth Direktor on Saturday for comment.",,,,,,,,,
WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYWNsdWIub3JnL3Blbm5zeWx2YW5pYS9ibG9nLzIwMjEvMDYvdHJhc2gtc3RlYW0tZXF1YWxzLXRyYXNoLWlsbC1oZWFsdGjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Trash to Steam” Equals Trash to Ill Health,"By Sue Edwards Member ExComm Southeast PA Group Sierra Club



“When you’re living among the trash you begin to feel like trash yourself.”[i] So said Zulene Mayfield about her neighborhood close to the Covanta Resource Recovery Facility which is a waste incinerator also called “trash to steam’ in Chester PA. “[T]he way that we manage waste—or don’t manage waste—has severe health impacts on communities located near incinerators and polluting facilities” said Denise Patel of the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA).[ii]



In the spring of 2021 as part of a campaign led by a Chester residents' organization several nearby borough councils passed resolutions[iii] asking Delaware County Council not to extend its contract that sends the majority of the county's trash to Covanta (along with trash from NY NJ and a number of other places) and to develop a Zero Waste Plan. In the existing contract Delaware County municipalities have been penalized if they sent less than 300000 tons of trash per year to Covanta. So much for encouraging recycling and reducing waste.



A 2019 study[iv] by The New School concluded that so-called “waste to energy” plants emit mercury lead particulate matter 2.5 and 10 sulfur dioxide nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide. Incinerators in the U.S. emit more of these pollutants (as well as carbon dioxide) per kilowatt hour of energy generated than fossil fuel power plants. These greenhouse gases are feeding the fire of global warming and particulate matter increases the risk of respiratory death in infants and increases death rates from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases including lung cancer and asthma. Incinerators also create toxic ash which contains poisonous concentrations of dioxins and heavy metals.



Research indicates that Chester’s residents suffer from heart disease asthma and other chronic illnesses at levels far higher than the national average.[v] Covanta’s Chester plant is one of the “the dirty dozen” of the 73 trash-to-steam plants in the US. It has fewer pollution controls than similar incinerators around the country.



If enough municipalities in Delaware County persuade the county to cut its ties with Covanta this will mean more waste will go to landfills in the region which is also not a great alternative but at least less harmful since the incinerator ash is far more toxic than untreated waste.



What is needed is a reduction in the amount of waste created. What are some actions that cities and towns can take to reduce their waste? There is an international campaign called Zero Waste International Alliance (zwia.org) and there is useful information about Delaware County efforts regarding zero waste at the website of Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living. at https://www.chesterresidents.org/zerowaste/#ZW.



Here are a few avenues to explore:

A Zero Waste Commission could be established to come up with alternatives such as a Material Recovery Facility that would separate out items that could be re-used as well as glass tin and aluminum.

An organic waste (garbage) collecting operation could be created so that this valuable resource can be composted and used in gardens and farms not burned.

Manufacturers and other businesses can be pressured to re-think their products and packaging. We can patronize stores that encourage bringing our own containers. And each of us can consider the packaging whenever we buy something (or decide not to). Before throwing away things that could be of use we can donate them to thrift stores and free stores or hold a yard sale.

Towns can institute a ""Pay As You Throw"" system in which residents pay based upon how much trash they put out at the curb. Where it has been tried trash has been substantially reduced and recycling has increased. Yes recycling has significant challenges but it is worth improving for the sake of neighbors who suffer the consequences of living next to a polluting plant. This is an Environmental Justice issue.

Education directed to all county residents can urge them to avoid as many single-use plastics as possible such as water bottles explain how to recycle properly and the importance of doing this including the impact of waste in neighboring communities when it is burned.

Look at construction and demolition waste. Where does it go now? How can it be reduced? It is said to be the largest component of waste in many countries including the U.S. which has the third largest amount of waste per capita in the world.[vi]



The Sierra Club's position on incineration is as follows:

Guidance on Hazardous Waste Incinerators by the Hazardous Materials Committee[vii]

Incinerators should not be used to manage hazardous waste unless it can be demonstrated that there is no other technically feasible method for management of a specific waste. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s new incinerator regulations are not yet in place. Adequate regulatory frameworks do not exist at the state and federal level to protect public health and the environment from the hazards of incineration. Technologies other than incineration are more appropriate for managing many hazardous wastes and a region must give priority to siting and permitting such facilities. The programs that direct manufacturers to produce less waste are neither strong enough nor fully implemented. Disposers must document that they have done all they can to avoid minimize recycle or otherwise treat a waste before sending it to an incinerator. Incinerator permits must allow only such residuals to be accepted.

AMMAN — Growing industrialisation high population growth and immigration rate have led to a rapid increase in solid waste generation in Jordan which has in turn put increasing pressure on the waste management infrastructure according to reports.

Mohammad Ziad Yamin an environmental scientist said that around 2 million tonnes of municipal waste is generated in Jordan each year most of which is diverted to unsanitary landfills and dumpsites.

Improper solid waste disposal is leading to public health risks adverse environmental impacts as well as socioeconomic problems he said.

Amman accounts for almost half of the total solid waste generated in Jordan. The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) collects transports and disposes the waste to Al Ghabawi landfill site which is considered to be the largest landfill in Jordan serving Amman and 10 other major cities according to the GAM website.

Al Ghabawi landfill is “the first of its kind” in Jordan as it employs a bio-gas electricity-generating system with financial assistance from the World Bank.

The waste-to-energy project once connected with the Jordan Electricity Company’s grid will generate 4.8 megawatts per hour by burning methane collected from waste at Al Ghabawi landfill according to a report by GAM.

According to a report by USAID’s Recycling in Jordan Activity project Al Ghabawi landfill receives 4000-4300 tonnes of Amman’s waste serving almost 50 per cent of Jordanians. According to GAM estimates the commercial sector generates at least 40 per cent of this waste.

The USAID report noted that low levels of awareness on recycling and high price sensitivity are among obstacles to waste management in the country.

The Ministry of Environment together with GAM are working on many recycling projects according to the GAM website.

These include the Jordan Vision 2025 the National Municipal Solid Waste Management Strategy (2015-2034) the National Green Growth Plan the National Strategy and Action Plan for Sustainable Consumption and Production (2016-2025) and the National Environmental Strategy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZXNtYW5qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDYvMjcvbWFyaW9uLWNvdW50eS1jb3ZhbnRhLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtbXVuaWNpcGFsLW1lZGljYWwtd2FzdGUtaW5jZW5lcmF0b3IvNTI5Njc3MTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Covanta is burning waste in Marion County,"No commitment required.

While the pandemic has led to a significant increase in biomedical waste generation disposal facilities have not gone up proportionately said the study. Global studies have associated increased Covid risks with a rise in biomedical waste.

The “Assessment of Bio-Medical Waste Before and During the Emergency of Novel Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in India: A Gap Analysis” study published recently in the journal Waste Management & Research highlights how most states fare poorly in terms of Covid-19 waste management. The study said 23 of the 35 states and union territories (UTs) including Maharashtra still follow deep burial methods for waste disposal restricted by the Centre. It said 70% of the states do not have well-established systems to regularly monitor their common BMW waste treatment facilities (CBMWTFs) and only 12 have upgraded their facilities as per new emission rules. Two hundred CBMWTFs are available across India but are insufficient to treat the large quantity of waste. Most states and UTs have almost reached their threshold capacity it said.

Today Swarbrick is best known as the athletic director at the University of Notre Dame which has had to deal with its own problems surrounding sexual assaults by football players. He has also been an adviser to USA Gymnastics whose various scandals — most notably the hundreds of molestations of young athletes by Dr. Larry Nassar who landed in prison for life — have given it a somewhat higher profile on this issue than USA Swimming.

But if the challenges of swimming have come with fewer front-page headlines despite its much larger footprint on daily American life swimming is nonetheless battling scores of claims in courts across the country that coaches preyed on underage athletes. USA Swimming also reportedly finds itself the subject of a federal grand jury investigation for allegations of insurance fraud concealing its assets and covering up abuse cases.

(Grand jury deliberations are secret. The office of Audrey Strauss the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York which is directing the probe declined Salon's request for comment.)

Critics such as lawyer and former swimming gold medalist Nancy Hogshead-Makar who heads the advocacy group Champion Women describe swimming's legal problems as the inevitable fallout of a culture that took it for granted that competitive youth swimming should enable an unsafe and overly sexualized environment for young athletes. For generations prior to the pandemic swimming's after-school practices and year-round weekend meets a largely recreational activity for many of its nearly half-million participants has been a staple of Americana while simultaneously serving as the country's Olympic medal developmental system.

""Not every coach is a pedophile but every pedophile wants to be a coach"" says Hogshead-Makar. ""Why? Because you get to spend hour after hour in an authority position over athletes unsupervised with almost no oversight or consequences to really horrible behavior.""

Hogshead-Makar also co-chairs the reform group Team Integrity whose theme in her words is that ""sexual abuse is a symptom of athletes having no power"" in the higher councils of the Olympic movement.

Swarbrick was at that aquatics convention more than 20 years ago because he then represented USA Swimming at of the Indianapolis firm where he practiced law then called Baker & Daniels. He was an old friend of the late Chuck Wielgus at the time executive director of USA Swimming; they had gotten acquainted when Wielgus headed U.S. Canoe and Kayak. Swarbrick was also part of the Stanford Law School network of swimming's top lawyer Richard Young of the Denver office of Holmes Robert & Owen a law firm since absorbed by Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.

Finally as chair of the Indiana Sports Corp which promoted the placement of marquee events in the state Swarbrick had a close business relationship with another board member Indianapolis sports consultant Dale Neuburger a longtime top official of both USA Swimming (for which he served a term as president) and FINA the governing body of worldwide competitive swimming.

Swarbrick's observation about the oncoming sexual abuse issue came to light years later in a 2010 deposition in a civil lawsuit against USA Swimming by swimmer Jancy Thompson who was abused across a period of years by her coach Norm Havercroft. John Leonard who was executive director of the American Swimming Coaches Association (ASCA) until his retirement last year recalled the remark. He also testified as to his own reaction.

""Show me the numbers"" Leonard said he told Swarbrick. ""Show me where this [abuse] is an issue that is large.""

The crisis emerges

Leonard's remark encapsulated swimming's passive attitude toward widespread abuse. But perhaps on the basis of Swarbrick's advice USA Swimming in 1999 established its first Code of Conduct for coaches. Four years later the group set up a task force to study the problem of sexual abuse after former Olympic gold medalist David Berkoff spoke out about rumored instances of top coaches having sex with their swimmers many of them underage.

In an email to an activist in 2010 Berkoff recalled that he had been told ""by several of Mitch Ivey's swimmers that he was sleeping with Lisa Dorman in 1988. I heard the whole Suzette Moran story"" from gold medalist Pablo Morales. (Morales denies the conversation.) ""I was told that Rick Curl was molesting Kelley Davies for years starting when she was 12 by some of the Texas guys.""

(Ivey was a swimmer and coach whose career began at the legendary Santa Clara Swim Club in California and ended in a hail of abuse allegations at the University of Florida. Curl was a Maryland club coach whose statutory rapes of Davies came to the surface when she swam at the University of Texas.)

Berkoff's former coach at the Germantown Academy outside Philadelphia Dick Shoulberg was also on the task force. During one of the panel's email discussion chains Shoulberg wrote: ""I would hate to see our organization ever in the predicament of the current Roman Catholic Church — protecting child molesters!""

As leader of ASCA the professional coaches' body Leonard was the task force's most truculent voice. He felt any standard for coach discipline less rigorous than the proof ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" required in criminal cases would unfairly imperiled careers and reputations. In 2012 Leonard emailed a journalist to claim: ""We do not have an organization that deals directly with children nor is that part of our purpose in any way shape or form.""

In 2006 USA Swimming instituted criminal background checks for its thousands of sanctioned coaches. (Around 11000 are ASCA members.) They are spread out across the country at age-group clubs of all sizes and shapes and with various business models. Some clubs are owned by their coaches; others are run by self-perpetuating parent nonprofit boards. Nearly all rent public facilities such as park district pools or high school or community college aquatic centers at subsidized rates. From there a few of the young athletes become the Michael Phelpses and Katie Ledeckys who provide a fortnight of entertainment and an upswell of national pride during the quadrennial Olympics.

In 2010 Jack Swarbrick's foreboding took shape when ABC's ""20/20"" broadcast an investigative segment on swimming's abuse problem. The report's most sensational accusation was that Deena Deardurff a gold medalist at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich had been serially molested during her teen years in Cincinnati by her coach Paul Bergen a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

Asked on camera for comment swimming chief executive Wielgus assumed a defensive posture. ""You feel I need to apologize to them?"" he said apparently referring to victims of sexual abuse.

Amid mounting public criticism of his televised interview performances on both ""20/20"" and in a similar report on ESPN's ""Outside the Lines"" Wielgus established a USA Swimming program called Safe Sport which the parent Olympic Committee would expand in 2017 with a new agency the U.S. Center for SafeSport. Scott Blackmun president of the Olympic Committee until the gymnastics scandals exploded in 2018 frequently cited swimming as its model sport for addressing abuse issues.

Swimming began publishing the names of coaches banned for sexual misconduct. Today the banned list has grown to 191 names. However it does not include figures like Bergen the late Jack Nelson (a Hall of Fame coach who Diana Nyad the celebrity open-water swimmer has claimed molested her in the 1960s as a high school student in Fort Lauderdale) the quasi-fugitive Irish coach George Gibney and others. USA Swimming insiders say many of them are likely on a separate secret document known as the ""flagged"" list.

In 2014 Wielgus himself was scheduled for induction into the Hall of Fame but stood down in the face of a public petition by victims of abuse who charged him with presiding over a generation of cover-ups. Most infuriatingly for the petitioners Wielgus had spoken misleadingly about his knowledge of an abusive coach Andy King who regularly hopped from one position to another across different states and who was labeled ""a monster"" by the prosecutor who brought him to justice for raping and impregnating a 14-year-old girl among other offenses. This victim confided in her pastor setting in motion King's long overdue arrest. (In 2009 King pleaded no contest to 20 counts of felony child molestation. Now 73 King remains in a California prison serving a life sentence.)

Wielgus' death from cancer in 2017 along with the deaths or retirements of other key figures going back four or more decades is cited by some observers of the current grand jury investigation as an indication that it's unlikely to produce criminal charges. Regardless the accumulation and pattern of anecdotes portray a youth-serving sports organization that consistently appeared to put the safety of young swimmers below the quest for medals profits and prestige.

Among the thousands of pages of documents before the grand jury according to sources close to prosecutors is a trove of internal USA Swimming memos emails and coach complaint dossiers which the group previously attempted to withhold during California civil suits by former swimmers who claimed sexual abuse by their coaches. For its defiance of lower court discovery orders the organization paid tens of thousands of dollars in sanctions before finally producing the documents under seal in 2012 on order of the California Supreme Court. This cache of materials subsequently subpoenaed by the FBI field office in Campbell California is the basis for some of the reporting for this article.

At the top USA Swimming's revenue streams are significant. Its annual nonprofit Form 990 filings with the IRS show that the book value of the organization's assets has been as high as $54 million in recent years. At the time of his death Wielgus drew annual compensation of more than $1.2 million. In 2019 13 executives ranging up to Wielgus's successor Timothy Hinchey at $792207 made an average of more $300000 a year. (Staff at the organization's Colorado Springs headquarters totals around 100.)

By way of perspective the PR and marketing budget lines of USA Swimming alone might very well exceed the combined expenditures for everything in all Olympic sports in a number of Third World countries.

According to filings the St. Louis-based Bryan Cave law firm's three Colorado offices after many years and millions of dollars in billable hours were supplanted three years ago by Atlanta's King & Spalding LLP.

USA Swimming's ""captive"" insurance company — headquartered in Barbados

Belying their homegrown image youth sports are big business. So is organization insurance for youth sports. The grand jury is scrutinizing swimming's insurance structure as well the underlying activity of sexual abuse which gave rise to the sport's liability crisis. The two go hand in hand.

Around the same time of Jack Swarbrick's warning internal documents show the parent U.S. Olympic Committee was telling swimming that it could no longer use the Olympic Training Center facilities in Colorado Springs. The reason was insurance: USA Swimming was the only sport body without what the USOC considered appropriate coverage; at the time its general liability policy contained a clause excluding coverage for claims of abuse or molestation.

USOC's risk manager explained all this bluntly in writing to USA Swimming's consultant Risk Management Services. In turn on May 3 1999 the senior vice president of RMS Sandy Blumit submitted notes to swimming executives detailing the problem.

""[USOC] mandates innocents should be protected by their [national governing body]. Therefore can't delete abuse and molestation"" Blumit wrote adding that as a consequence USOC ""would not allow any local members' clubs volunteers or members on premises (training center).""

This impasse was resolved two days later when swimming advised USOC that it would amend its insurance coverage to include claims of abuse and molestation. Swimmers and their coaches were allowed back to the training center.

What appears most significant about this from 22 years' distance is that Blumit's presentation of the controversy was made not to USA Swimming's board but to its wholly owned subsidiary United States Sports Insurance Company Inc. The story of USSIC embodies some of the financial maneuvers of corporate insurance practices that are likely a focus of the current federal investigation according to lawyers who have been involved in civil lawsuits and dissidents who formerly served in sport leadership positions.

USSIC had been incorporated in 1988 when USA Swimming's main insurance carrier AIG was complaining that premiums were too low in multiple areas of liability including abuse. Given the level of exposure AIG would only discuss an annual premium in the range of $1 million. Previously they had been closer to $200000.

""We would have to pay a million dollars to get a million dollars of coverage"" explained Ronnie Lee Van Pool USA Swimming board president from 2002 to 2006 in a 2010 deposition in a ""Jane Doe"" abuse lawsuit against swimming.

In that period both for-profit and nonprofit entities faced the same problem of steeply rising liability premiums. Their collective response was a new industry wrinkle called ""captive reinsurance."" With smart leveraging of tax breaks and regulatory gimmicks corporations could save money through a combination of insuring themselves managing claims themselves or underwriting the risks of their third-party commercial carriers. The Catholic Church for example has a captive called National Catholic Risk Retention Group Inc.

By the time USA Swimming got around to forming USSIC the USOC already had its own captive Panol Insurance. But foreshadowing the dispute over swimming's access to the training center a decade later Panol was just as reluctant to underwrite swimming's risks at the established premiums as AIG had been. While other sport bodies saw their premiums reduced or coverages remain stable underwriters for swimming considered it uniquely beset both with greater risks and with poor risk management.

USA Swimming had to figure out where to locate its own captive reinsurer. In the late 1980s Caribbean countries competed to be the preferred home of captives. For USSIC Barbados won the prize. The Caribbean island nation offered many years of tax abatement as well as a structure so loose that all the operation really required was a dummy bank account and a set of books domiciled on the island. The clincher may have been the absence of a tax treaty between Barbados and the U.S. After all the less exposure to American laws and their pesky inspectors and enforcers the better.

USSIC set up shop on White Town Road in Bridgetown the Barbadian capital. Local law mandated an annual board of directors meeting on site which in practice became a beachfront bacchanal below the radar of dues-paying families and their swimmers and a favorite perk for officials in the know.

The phenomenon of offshore captives has receded in recent years as Delaware and other U.S. states have escalated their own inducements to become insurance regulatory havens. As the image of swimming suffered during the publicity of abuse scandals officials also realized that an offshore subsidiary although entirely legal was a bad look for an organization that marketed patriotism as much as athletics. In 2013 USSIC was brought onshore and put into what is known as ""runoff mode."" Three years later London's Randall & Quilter Investment Holdings Ltd purchased USSIC's assets for $2.1 million and swimming was out of the captive business.

Throw clubs under the bus — but protect the national brand

In its heyday USSIC featured an unorthodox wrinkle in swimming's insurance structure known as the ""wasting"" provision. This is believed to be one focus of the federal investigation.

Meanwhile USA Swimming worked around USOC's mandate to include specific abuse coverage in its umbrella liability coverage: That coverage did not extend to the 2000 member clubs across the country. Instead those clubs were given USSIC-underwritten coverage to cover claims of abuse or molestation by coaches — coverage capped at $100000 per claim.

The wasting clause in insurance policies acted like the ultimate deductible: Every dollar spent on defending a claim was correspondingly reduced from the coverage. Thus if investigators and lawyers for USA Swimming ran up a tab of $100000 in a particular case a victim-claimant stood to collect a maximum of $100000 minus $100000: zero dollars.

The club being sued in such a case would also have zero dollars remaining to defend itself its coaches and its club boards. Furthermore the coverage limited member clubs to two claims a year.

The working concept here was that an individual club could be thrown under the bus in contemporary parlance with its coaches forced into bankruptcy and any parent board left holding the bag. The larger goals were twofold: protecting USA Swimming from claims made against its member clubs and denying settlements to victims that would actually cover their injuries therapy and treatment.

There was only one way under this system for plaintiffs to find effective relief: Get past the member clubs' coverage and all the way to USA Swimming's general liability coverage. Strategies meant to pierce the national organization's financial veil are largely what have driven the lawsuits of recent years. These are also being studied by federal prosecutors.

This line of attack was emboldened in April when the California Supreme Court ruled that USA Taekwondo — and not just an individual predator the convicted coach Marc Gitelman -- was liable under the principle of ""duty of care"" in the case of Yasmin Brown Kendra Gatt and Brianna Bordon who had won $60 million in a lawsuit against Gitelman. That decision potentially means that abuse survivors can go after the deeper pockets of national sport governing bodies (although the USOC remains excluded from liability).

Swimming's insurance practices did more than just protect the people at the top. They also generated paper profits. In return for tamping down victims' claims USSIC formulated a ""safety rebate"" reflecting successful years when premiums and underwriting costs were exceeded by savings.

As safety rebates flourished USSIC's assets reached as high as $27 million according to IRS filings. In 2008 the company held a portfolio of U.S. government bonds totaling more than $12 million. Two years later the value of corporate bond holdings and other fixed income approached $15 million.

A congressional probe fizzles — but it's not the end of the story

In 2012 Kelley Davies the swimming abuse victim from the 1980s who had been identified by whistleblower David Berkoff saw her old coach Rick Curl on the pool deck during televised coverage of the Olympic Trials in Omaha and she was furious. Co-owner of the Curl-Burke Swim Club a prominent age-group program in the Washington D.C. area Curl had lost his coaching position at the University of Maryland and relocated to Australia. But now Curl was back and had resumed his American coaching career with no apparent resistance.

Davies told her story to a Washington Post reporter and Curl was banned by USA Swimming and indicted in Maryland. After appearing at the 2013 sentencing hearing which followed a plea deal Davies advocated for a congressional investigation and the Post editorial page echoed her. (Curl now 71 was sentenced to seven years in state prison and paroled in 2016.)

Rep. George Miller a California Democrat heeded the call. With Republicans in the House majority at the time he served as ranking minority member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Though Miller did not control the committee or have the power to call hearings he asked the Government Accountability Office to produce a study of laws relating to youth sports programs. And his staff investigated and fielded tips.

In a July 2 2013 memo to the USA Swimming board of directors Wielgus and then board president Bruce Stratton announced emergency measures in response.

""We recognize that some of the issues we face today are an increasing unfortunate fact of life for all youth-serving organizations and that our evolving role and responsibilities related to inappropriate conduct by our members is permanently with us"" Wielgus and Stratton wrote. ""... [O]ur strategy moving forward will have the ultimate goal of improving the overall perceptions of USA Swimming's Safe Sport Program efforts.""

At a cost Wielgus and Stratton estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to be drawn from ""the Executive and Business Development budgets"" their steps included commissioning an ""independent review"" of the Safe Sport program which would be carried out by the Wisconsin-based Gundersen Health System. This review would be ""by far the most expensive piece"" of swimming's counter-measures.

In addition Wielgus and the then director of Safe Sport Susan Woessner would undergo ""intensive media training."" This training and other crisis communications services would be coordinated by GroundFloor Media a Denver marketing and public relations firm. Other resources were targeted to local teams and regional governing affiliates for whenever ""an issue of sexual misconduct arises [and] there is a flare-up of local media attention.""

(Woessner resigned in 2018 after she was accused of having had an undisclosed relationship with Sean Hutchison one of the first subjects of an investigation by swimming's newly formed Safe Sport program in 2010. This came about after Ariana Kukors a gold medalist swimmer who had been groomed and abused by Hutchison over a period of years filed suit against him and the organization. In her resignation statement Woessner claimed she had only ""kissed"" Hutchison once and denied any sexual relationship. Hutchison under criminal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and others is believed to have fled to Brazil.)

The Gundersen Health System review publicly released in early 2014 without having been distributed beforehand to the board concluded that USA Swimming was doing a good job of meeting the coach sexual abuse problem.

Miller retired from Congress at the end of 2014. Before leaving he released an exchange of letters with the FBI. In his July 9 2014 letter to then-director James Comey Miller requested ""that you fully investigate USA Swimming's handling of both past and present cases of child sexual abuse.""

Miller's 11-page letter did not elicit a response from Comey. Instead Maxwell Marker acting deputy assistant director of the bureau's Criminal Investigation Division delivered a pallid three-paragraph memo. ""FBI representatives recently met with USA Swimming officials and discussed applicable federal violations associated with child exploitation matters the vulnerabilities of those within USA Swimming and provided information to assist in USA Swimming's effort to educate their membership regarding the sexual exploitation of children"" he wrote.

The GAO report requested by Miller in 2013 was not published until 2015 after he left Congress. This report turned out to be a perfunctory rundown of sexual abuse statutes. USA Swimming's investment in public relations initiatives seemed to have paid off.

It didn't last. In 2018 the USA Gymnastics scandals made national headlines and the federal grand jury investigation of USA Swimming began.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L2J1c2luZXNzL3dpbGwtdGhpcy1pY2t5LXN0cmluZ3ktc2Vhd2VlZC1yZXBsYWNlLWxvYnN0ZXItbWFpbmVzLXNpZ25hdHVyZS1wcm9kdWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Maine’s warming waters kelp emerges as a potentially lucrative cash crop,"So for the last two years she’s been developing a new source of income. Heaving the rope aloft she showed off her bounty: ribbons of brown curly sugar kelp raised on her 10-acre undersea farm.

She has been lobstering for a decade and a half she says but as climate change warms local waters and forces lobsters northward  she’s been finding it harder to envision a future in that industry.

FALMOUTH MAINE — One bright brisk morning last month Colleen Francke steered her skiff a mile off the coast of Falmouth and cut the gas. A few white buoys bobbed in straight lines on the water. Francke reached down and hoisted a rope.

Kelp a seaweed more often thought of as a nuisance by fishermen is emerging as a potentially lucrative crop hailed for its many uses as a miracle food to an ingredient in bioplastics to a revolutionary way to feed beef cattle. And Maine officials confronting a likely decline of the state’s iconic lobster fishing industry in coming decades are now looking to kelp farming as a possible economic and environmental savior.

The state is working with local institutions to support training and grants for entrepreneurs such as Francke willing to move into kelp farming or other aquaculture ventures. It also labeled kelp a “natural climate solution” in its recently-released Climate Action plan. The goal officials say is to dramatically expand kelp farming as part of a reinvention of Maine’s seafood industry — and imagining a future in which kelp from Maine is held in something akin to the esteem that Maine lobster is now.

“We think kelp and other aquaculture offer…a connection to a next generation workforce and innovation for a heritage industry” said Heather Johnson Maine’s commissioner of economic and community development. “That is key to the longstanding sustainability of the existing supply chains.”

Rich in nutrients and vitamins kelp has long been consumed as a staple in Asian cultures. In the last several years it’s been increasingly incorporated into health beauty and food products in the United States. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations named seaweed farming the fastest growing sector in aquaculture and the research firm Global Market Insights estimates the worldwide market for seaweed will grow to $85 billion by 2026.

Now 35 Francke helped build the first kelp farm in Maine a decade ago. Today the industry has taken off in the state with over 100 farming sites now dotting the coast. It’s a relatively simple and remarkably sustainable process: There are no inputs like fresh water fertilizer or feed. Fishermen place spore-holding sorus tissue along lengths of rope and submerge them letting Mother Nature do the rest. Just 4 pounds of sorus can seed 30000 pounds of kelp for harvest.

Maine kelp farms in 2020 produced 450000 pounds nearly double the harvest of just two years before. This year they’re on track to bring in more than 800000 pounds and in so doing are leading the nation in this nascent industry which is seeing some farms pop up in Alaska and on the West Coast.

But that’s a fraction of what the Island Institute a community development corporation in Rockland Maine that has funded aquaculture business development programs in the state estimates is possible. By its calculations that figure could soar to nearly 6 million pounds by 2035. But even those numbers are dwarfed by China which according to the UN produced more than 14 million tons of farmed seaweed in 2017.

Climate change has warmed Maine’s coastal waters by 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit a year over the past three decades with the Gulf of Maine warming faster than 99 percent of the global ocean. It’s made the lobster industry more volatile and has decreased catches of groundfish shrimp or soft shell clams that lobstermen could rely on in an off year said Susie Arnold a marine scientist at the Island Institute.

Kelp farming she said offers lobstermen additional off-season income using equipment they already have on hand. There’s also the added benefit of kelp’s “halo effect”: it sucks up carbon dioxide in the water where it grows and reduces acidification and nutrient pollution in the state’s coastal waters.

“We have actually found that if you grow your shellfish in close proximity to a kelp farm they can have thicker shells denser shells and they’re harder to break” said Arnold.

The challenge now she said is convincing US consumers that kelp is not just a way to diversify one’s diet but also a way to help fight climate change.

“Americans aren’t necessarily used to eating seaweed. And in order to change hearts and minds about that especially people who care about climate change it’s really important to sell the product in that way” said Arnold. “It’s good for these local businesses. It’s also — and I mean it — truly is good for the planet.”

It may help that Maine’s appetite for kelp farming comes as the country’s food establishment has been questioning its relationship with meat. Citing the beef industry’s contributions to climate change Epicurious the ubiquitous Condé Nast food blog recently announced that it had ceased publishing recipes with beef and the acclaimed New York restaurant Eleven Madison Park announced in May that it was switching to an all-vegan menu.

Francke sells most of her harvest to a local startup called AKUA that makes kelp jerky and this summer released a kelp burger that was favorably reviewed by the New York Times and Bon Appétit.

Advocates are hoping kelp can become another buzzy alternative protein with a sustainability aura that could bring in millions of venture funding such as faux burger brands Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.

But that’s “just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we can do with kelp” said Briana Warner the CEO of Atlantic Sea Farms the largest processor of kelp in Maine. “We’re seeing innovation in bioplastics and kelp-made textiles food additives and animal feeds. Food is just the start... the possibilities are really endless.”

Bioplastics which are typically made from renewable sources such as kelp are just one way seaweed could have a huge impact on climate change. A subset of the industry is also looking at whether kelp farming could be used to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And researchers at the University of California Davis have found that feeding seaweed to beef cows can help reduce the amount of methane they produce by 82 percent.

But to get to the point where Maine could actually produce enough kelp to sustain any of these big ideas means wading into some fraught territory.

Maine’s Department of Marine Resources oversees the distribution of aquaculture leases in the state and there’s been increasing pushback from local fishermen and wealthy waterfront landowners about plans for the rapid expansion of such farms along the coast. Most of that opposition has been directed at large fisheries where salmon or other species are grown in pens but kelp farms because they operate using the same aquaculture lease permitting system have become ensnared in those debates.

Francke who has applied to the Maine Department of Marine Resources to expand her farm from 10 acres to 100 which would be the largest in the state has become a target of critics. If her application succeeds said Crystal Canney executive director of Protect Maine’s Fishing Heritage Foundation a foundation opposing the expansion of aquaculture you’ve “lost all that bottom to lobstering. You cannot put lobster traps in that area — you get tangled.”

Canney claims that over the past 15 years Maine has haphazardly increased access to aquaculture leases and now allows farmers to lease more than 1000 acres of water for up to 20 years. In April a state lawmaker proposed legislation that would limit the size of aquaculture leases and change how leases are transferred in Maine.

“Kelp has great potential for the state of Maine no question about that” Canney said. But letting a kelp farmer such as Francke expand to 100 acres could end up displacing lobstermen in the process she argues. Soon she said “10 more Colleen Franckes can do the same thing in the same area because lease approvals are at 97 percent.”

Entangling things further is new statewide legislation passed in 2019 that allows homeowners with waterfront property in Maine to weigh in on the aquaculture permitting process — offering testimony and presenting witnesses at public hearings.

Aquaculture advocates say that many wealthy homeowners are paying top dollar to hire lawyers to keep oyster mussel or kelp farms away from their waterfront views. “The landowners don’t want to look at it or smell it” Sebastian Belle the executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association. “They will often lawyer up and throw everything they can at the situation and see what sticks.”

Belle says such wealthy backers are behind the Protect Maine’s Fishing Heritage Foundation which aligns itself with some lobsterman to oppose such farms. But he argues that such action could be the fishermen’s own undoing.

“A fundamental demographic shift is happening on the coast of Maine and COVID has accelerated that” he said. “The gentrification of the Maine coastline is really pushing working waterfront families out.”

“Aquaculture is really the only way left open for a traditional working waterfront family to add to their income” he said.

Should her expanded farm come to fruition Francke says she’s designed it with enough space between her lines that lobstermen could steer their boats through it.

“Colleen is one of our newer farmers and she has some different approaches” said Belle. “She’s more interested in going big than some of the other farms are.”

And that’s made her among the first to experience growing pains in the industry.

“I think people look at that 100-acre number and they pass judgement before they even know what the design of the lease is” Francke said. But what concerns her more is that if she’s thwarted in her effort to scale up it means the industry won’t grow and she’ll have less of an impact on climate change.

“I look at growing this farm in one of these uber-rich communities and look at these McMansions with these neon green lawns and I know my farm is only going to do so much to combat what it’s like to maintain and heat that home and the chemicals on that lawn” she said.

She’d love to sustain herself financially through kelp farming but her larger goal is to inspire others to do their part.

“If one individual can actually make a positive change” she said “there’s something else everyone can be doing to make their own positive impact toward our climate problem.”

DALLAS — A bank is supposed to do two things: collect deposits and make loans. And many do – if you live in the right part of town.

Banking Below 30 WFAA’s ongoing investigation of banking practices has found that south of Interstate 30 where most of the residents are Black or Hispanic many bank branches take deposits but those same banks don’t lend much back out to customers in the surrounding neighborhoods.

“It’s devastating and it sets you back financially for years” said Traswell Livingston III. “You can’t catch that up.”

The first time Livingston tried to buy a home in South Dallas three banks turned him down.

“Very frustrating very disheartening” he said “It makes you build up a thick skin.”

Today Livingston owns a home in an historic block near Fair Park where he said many neighbors don’t trust banks.

“They don’t even … inquire anymore because they don’t even think it’s possible to get a loan” he said.

The homeownership gap

Without home loans there is no homeownership. And homeownership is an important way for parents to build up and transfer assets to their children experts say. Research shows however that many Black families lag far behind.

According to the Federal Reserve by age 55 the rate of homeownership among Blacks is 32% lower than it is for whites. And the homes Black families own are worth 35% less.

The disparity gets worse as people age. According to Brookings by age 75 median wealth for a Black family is $46000 compared to $302000 for a white family.

Livingston funneled his negative experiences into a career in real estate and today he is concerned about some of his neighbors who have lived here for decades and are desperate for a small loan to keep up their properties.

“But most of them know that’s not going to happen” he said adding that many are forced to defer maintenance further eroding their home’s value. “Patch it up. Close off the door. Don’t go in that room. Keep moving. Do it with cash or don’t do it at all.”

North-south disparity

WFAA’s analysis of banking data shows in the northern half of Dallas there are 296 bank branches. In the southern half there are 55.

But according to the Child Poverty Action Lab 43% of the city’s population lives below I-30 or about 560000 people. And our analysis shows they are only getting 26% of the bank loans.

But of the banks that do have branches in Southern Dallas how are they performing?

Neighborhoods in DFW are broken down into census tracts. The one Livingston lives in is near Fair Park and includes a Bank of America and a Chase Bank.

We clustered this tract with adjacent tracts -- to create a large area that a bank branch might serve. Then using federal government home loan data which banks are obligated to report publicly we counted all the loans the bank – though not necessarily originated from that branch – made here in 2018 and 2019.

Over two years Chase made four home-related loans and Bank of America made five.

By comparison six miles away in a census tract cluster around a Chase and Bank of America in Lakewood Chase had 171 loans. Bank of America reported 143.

“That’s a smoking gun” said John Taylor a fair lending advocate and head of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. The NCRC has assisted WFAA in analyzing government loan data throughout the Banking Below 30 investigation.

“Should banks be investing in credit-worthy borrowers in South Dallas? If they can show they can pay these loans back that they have enough income should the banks be doing it? The answer is yes of course. That’s the law” he said.

What’s the overall picture for Chase and Bank of America north and south of I-30? In the neighborhoods around Chase’s northern branches there were on average 102 loans around each branch. In the south there are 32. Around Bank of America’s northern branches the average was 67 and 23 to the south. Wells Fargo made an average of 65 around its northern branches and 18 to the south.

In statements to WFAA Chase wrote that it “regularly ranked first or second in southern Dallas for all mortgage lenders and typically ranked first among banks. However we recognize that too many people are not sharing in the region’s prosperity. In southern Dallas and within communities of color we know we can do better…”

Bank of America told WFAA that loan data from 2018 and 2019 doesn't capture the bank's more recent affordable homeownership initiative in Southern Dallas which has recently lent $75 million dollars to 365 low- to moderate-income borrowers and made $4 million in down payment grants to first-time buyers.

Bank of America's latest initiative ""focuses on closing the racial wealth gap in Black and Hispanic-Latino communities with a focus on affordable housing health and healthcare jobs/reskilling and small business"" the company said in a news release earlier this year. ""Through the Community Homeownership Commitment Bank of America is addressing two of the biggest barriers to homeownership -- down payments and closing costs -- which will increase access to homeownership for thousands who have historically not been able to own a home.""

Wells Fargo told WFAA that on its bank exams its distribution of loans to low- to moderate-income borrowers ""exceeded the aggregate lending and received a rating of “good” despite affordability challenges…"" in Dallas.

""Wells Fargo remains committed to helping the southern Dallas community and others thrive with a variety of offerings to address low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities and small businesses"" the bank wrote in a statement to WFAA.

“If the regulators just raised the question ‘Gee you only made four or five loans in all South Dallas what the heck is going on here?’ – that’s what examiners regulators are supposed to do” Taylor said. “They won’t do it unfortunately unless someone makes an issue of it.”

Big banks are regulated by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency. In a statement to WFAA it says: “… examiners do not have the authority to require a bank to make mortgage loans or to make such loans in a specific area.” And that the localized lending data used in our story can be influenced by the level of owner-occupied housing income level market volatility and population trends the OCC said.

A call to activism

Again the definition of a bank is a “financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans.” Advocates say a keyword is “licensed.” The government grants a bank the right to operate and make big profits. But in exchange there are rules.

And they include the Community Reinvestment Act. It’s a powerful federal law that says banks are required to meet the credit needs of the entire community and reinvest in the minority neighborhoods they’ve long ignored.

“We have to confront their greed” said Diane Ragsdale a former Dallas city council member with the Intercity Community Development a nonprofit that helps working families in low- to moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods achieve homeownership.

“The law was created for a reason – banks refused to lend to LMI communities” Ragsdale said. But she acknowledged the law doesn’t work unless the public knows about it and acts. “And that’s where a movement comes into play” she said.

She said people need to understand their roles as advocates for themselves and their neighborhoods and banks need to understand – and take seriously – their roles under the law.

“What is your role? To sit there and do nothing? Just sit there and receive deposits. No!” Ragsdale said. “Your role is to get out there and develop relationships with people – communicate with the people and determine what I can do to meet your lending needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Bob3RvL2lucTIvbW92aW5nLWZvcndhcmQtMjAyMTA2MjcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After more than a year of isolation these vignettes show how much Philly is moving forward,Keep reading by creating a free account or signing in.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMjYvYmVhY29uLWJ1eXMtb2ZmaWNlLWJ1aWxkaW5nLW9uLXBsYXR0ZS1zdHJlZXQtZm9yLTYwbS_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L2JlYWNvbi1idXlzLW9mZmljZS1idWlsZGluZy1vbi1wbGF0dGUtc3RyZWV0LWZvci02MG0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beacon buys office building on Platte Street for $60M,"Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners has added to its holdings in Denver.

The real estate firm purchased the Circa office building at 1615 Platte St. this week for $60 million according to public records.

The building is 96000 square feet according to its website which makes the deal worth $625 per square foot. It is four stories although a mezzanine level makes it appear five stories on one end.

Beacon declined to comment on the purchase. The company already owns at least a partial stake in a number of other prominent local office buildings including the Wells Fargo Center and Tabor Center downtown and The Hub in RiNo. Within the past 18 months Beacon has purchased the Wells Fargo bank branch building at 1740 Broadway and sold a stake in the Wells Fargo Center to Brookfield.

Circa was developed by Seattle-based Unico Properties and Denver-based Confluent Development. The building is one of 27 that Unico said in 2019 that it had sold to Broad Street Principal Investments LLC an affiliate of Goldman Sachs for $710 million. But Unico said it maintained a stake in the portfolio and would continue to manage the properties on behalf of the partnership.

Circa’s office tenants include Xero and WeWork. Ground-floor retail tenants include Blue Sparrow Coffee Room for Milly cocktail bar and restaurant chain Dave’s Hot Chicken which has yet to open."

The whole point of using a network-attached storage device is to have a hard drive where you can back up important data and then access the files over the internet while you're out and about. But unknown hackers are turning Western Digital My Book NAS hard drives into nightmare backup tools by compromising users' devices and then deleting all the data from them. The My Books are controlled by an app WD My Book Live which allows customers to access their data remotely and manage their NAS. But users worldwide are reporting that their devices have been hijacked and wiped. When they attempt to log in and gain access the remote management dashboard says “Invalid password.” Western Digital told Bleeping Computer in a statement that it is actively investigating the situation. So far though victims who have lost data are simply out of luck. The devices in question are at least six years old and received their most recent firmware update in 2015. “Western Digital has determined that some My Book Live devices are being compromised by malicious software. In some cases this compromise has led to a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device"" the company said. ""At this time we recommend you disconnect your My Book Live from the Internet to protect your data on the device.""

Seven months ago former president Donald Trump fired-by-tweet the last director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs for agreeing with intelligence agencies’ conclusion that the 2020 election had been secure against foreign meddling. Since then Krebs has yet to be replaced—even as the United States has faced some of the worst cyberattacks on government agencies and critical infrastructure in history including the SolarWinds intrusions the mass compromise of Exchange servers by China’s Hafnium hackers and the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline. And yet this week US Senator Rick Scott (R-Florida) announced that he would block the appointment of a new CISA director the eminently qualified Jen Easterly until Vice President Kamala Harris visits the southern border—delaying the appointment until after the Senate’s summer recess. Fellow officials and cybersecurity practitioners appalled by the highly politicized delay to a critical post for US national security spoke out on Twitter. “The cyberthreat facing America is too real and too immediate to be using the nomination of one of the most important cyberofficials as a hostage to an unrelated policy matter” Senator Angus King (I-Maine) said in a statement. “This is a spectacular dereliction of duty by Sen. Scott” tweeted former Facebook CSO Alex Stamos. “Have a great summer!”

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced this week that it had worked with law enforcement to help trace cryptocurrency used in the operations of the Cl0p ransomware gang six of whom were arrested by the Ukrainian police in Kyiv last week. According to Binance the ransomware operators were also running their own money-laundering-focused cryptocurrency exchange helping to cash out the criminal proceeds of Cl0p’s hacking operations as well as those of other groups. In total the Cl0p gang laundered no less than half a billion dollars according to Binance and two blockchain analysis firms it worked with TRM Labs and Crystal. In fact the six operators arrested last week may represent the money laundering component of Cl0p’s operations more than its actual hacking team. Despite last week’s arrests Cl0p added a new company to its ransomware victim list on Tuesday of this week.

Amazon Web Services announced on Friday that it has acquired the end-to-end encrypted chat app Wickr. The service offers secure communication and collaboration for individual users as well as companies governments and military customers. Wickr had raised close to $60 million in funding since its founding in 2012. AWS says it will continue to operate Wickr in its current form and offer the platform to AWS customers. “This gives security conscious enterprises and government agencies the ability to implement important governance and security controls to help them meet their compliance requirements"" AWS vice president and chief information security officer Stephen Schmidt wrote on Friday.

Between work documents photos videos and games it’s no wonder that terabyte drives and other devices are becoming more common and affordable.

Cloud storage is also growing in popularity but what happens to your stuff if the company decides to stop the service? That’s what people are experiencing as Samsung Cloud is being shut down. Tap or click here for instructions on what to do if you are affected by this.

A hacker can absolutely get into your computer and through there access your hard drive. But when you have your drive directly connected to a network this opens new paths for mischief. This is what seems to have happened to some owners of a popular external hard drive.

Here’s the backstory

Western Digital My Book Live is a network-attached storage (NAS) device. Rather than plugging this drive into your computer via a USB cable you connect it to an Ethernet port on your Wi-Fi router or network.

Thus you can access the drive from any device connected to that network be it your phone computer laptop tablet etc. The advantage is you can share and access all types of files between these devices and the drive and back up your data all in one place.

While convenient having a chunk of your data remotely accessible does carry risk. Unfortunately some WD My Book Live users recently found out the hard way reporting their drives have been wiped clean.

RELATED: Your privacy can also be compromised as cloud storage services often collect your data

Wiped out

In a post on its community forum Western Digital said that “some My Book Live devices are being compromised by malicious software. In some cases this compromise has led to a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device.”

Users attempting to access their My Book Live drive are getting a landing page requesting a password they don’t have. Some report that their drives have experienced a factory reset which likely means the data is unrecoverable.

“We do not have any indications of a breach or compromise of Western Digital cloud services or systems” Western Digital told Ars Technica. While we hope that this isn’t the result of a data breach which would put many more users’ data at risk you can’t be too cautious.

How to save your data

Western Digital recommends that you disconnect and power down your My Book Live from the internet to not only prevent further damage but to protect other devices sharing its network. Here is an official statement from the company:

“At this time we recommend you disconnect your My Book Live from the Internet to protect your data on the device. We are actively investigating and we will provide updates to this thread when they are available.”

An important note is that these devices received their final firmware update all the way back in 2015. Hopefully Western Digital is working on a fix and will push a much-needed update soon.

Do you own a WD My Book Live or My Book Duo Live NAS drive? If you do stop whatever you are doing right now and disconnect them.

WD has just issued this warning after a number of users have reported their data being mysteriously deleted with no action on their part.

Users have also reported that their devices have been factory reset and others said they are seeing a page requesting for a password that they do not know.

Users who suffered this issue shared their logs which shows a factory reset being requested by an unknown source. Take a look:

WD is currently investigation this issue and in the meantime is advising its customers to disconnect their drives.

WD said:

Western Digital has determined that some My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices are being compromised through exploitation of a remote command execution vulnerability. In some cases this compromise has led to a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device. The My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices received its final firmware update in 2015. We understand that our customers’ data is very important. We are actively investigating the issue and will provide an updated advisory when we have more information.

At this point there's no indication that this issue affects WD's other NAS products.

**Update on 27 June 2021 1130 hrs**

WD has shared a statement with BleepComputer and it says:

Western Digital has determined that some My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices are being compromised through exploitation of a remote command execution vulnerability. In some cases the attackers have triggered a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device.



We are reviewing log files which we have received from affected customers to further characterize the attack and the mechanism of access. The log files we have reviewed show that the attackers directly connected to the affected My Book Live devices from a variety of IP addresses in different countries. This indicates that the affected devices were directly accessible from the Internet either through direct connection or through port forwarding that was enabled either manually or automatically via UPnP.



Additionally the log files show that on some devices the attackers installed a trojan with a file named “.nttpd1-ppc-be-t1-z” which is a Linux ELF binary compiled for the PowerPC architecture used by the My Book Live and Live Duo. A sample of this trojan has been captured for further analysis and it has been uploaded to VirusTotal.



Our investigation of this incident has not uncovered any evidence that Western Digital cloud services firmware update servers or customer credentials were compromised. As the My Book Live devices can be directly exposed to the internet through port forwarding the attackers may be able to discover vulnerable devices through port scanning.



We understand that our customers’ data is very important. We do not yet understand why the attacker triggered the factory reset; however we have obtained a sample of an affected device and are investigating further. Additionally some customers have reported that data recovery tools may be able to recover data from affected devices and we are currently investigating the effectiveness of these tools.

BleepingComputer goes on to report that these WD My Book Live devices received their final firmware update over 6 years ago in 2015.

And since that final update a remote code execution vulnerability was discovered and tracked as CVE-2018-18472 and disclosed along with a public proof-of-concept exploit.

It is believed that it is this very exploit that the attacker used to reset users' WD My Book Live devices around the world.



**Update on 9 October 2021 2030 hrs**

Still why did this happen and which WD NAS models are affected?

We have a follow-up report that covers the reasons and what exploits were used. WD has also listed the exact My Book Live and My Book Duo SKUs affected on this support page.

Alternative suggestions for those affected?

WD has offered registered users of the affected SKUs for My Book Live and My Book Duo trade-in offers and the procedures are listed here. Otherwise WD recommends to disconnect them from the internet.

As discovered by app investigator Jane Wong Twitter is looking into enabling Google Account integration 9To5Google reported.

For years Google has offered a way for apps to let their users sign up or log in with nothing more than their Google Account saving the step of needing to fill in basic information like your name and email address or even picking a password.

In a screenshot of the enabled feature Twitter's sign-in page on the web shows ""Sign up"" ""Log in"" and a third option ""Continue with Google"".

Presumably this button will allow you to attach your Google Account to an existing Twitter account create a new Twitter account with your Google Account details or login to your Twitter account if you've already associated it with your Google Account.

According to tot the report there are ups and downs to signing in through a service like Sign In with Google.

On the plus side it's more convenient to only need to remember one password and much faster.

However if your Google Account should be compromised in any way an attacker would then also have access to your Twitter account. Or if your account were ever banned you'd be unable to get into Twitter the report said.

The new addition to the Wilson Center which will be accessible from the lower lobby of the building will feature a special event space and donor lounge as well as expanded student office space expanded Guest Services facilities lobby support space and will relocate Ticket Central to a more visible and accessible location.

The expansion was designed by LS3P the architectural firm responsible for designing the Wilson Center itself. When the venue opened in October 2015 the Wilson Center became the largest and most technologically advanced performing arts center in eastern North Carolina. It was designed to accommodate national Broadway touring productions concerts symphonic performances recitals dance productions and more.

The Wilson Center serves as a laboratory for student learning with students working on every show; performing on the stage in CFCC Drama Department productions and local productions; and making use of the 26 instructional spaces as part of their learning journey. The building also houses a 108-seat studio/black-box theatre which allows for a more intimate audience setting.

“Since the Wilson Center opened its doors to the community more than five years ago we have welcomed hundreds of thousands of guests for Broadway productions concerts dance comedy commencements and numerous other events” said Shane Fernando who has helmed the performing arts center since prior to its opening. “We are excited about this new expansion and how it will allow us to move forward with both our educational and artistic missions. We are tremendously grateful to Henry and Roya Weyerhaeuser for their continued support of Cape Fear Community College’s Wilson Center.”

“Cape Fear Community College continues to grow to serve our students and community” said CFCC President Jim Morton. “We are so fortunate to have the support of donors who believe in what we are doing at the College and the Wilson Center. This wonderful gift will enhance our ability to serve our students and our community. I want to sincerely thank the Weyerhaeusers for spearheading this campaign and extend my gratitude to all those who will be involved in seeing this expansion come to fruition.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

In newly bustling shops in and around Manhattan’s Garment District gallon-sized bins of glittering bugle beads and sequins are popping open after a dark hiatus that the Costume Industry Coalition says cost them $26 million in revenue last year.

Many of the group’s 50 member businesses are still hanging on by a thread. But with the help of some creative fundraising and an influx of television and film work — including from costume-heavy hits such as “The Gilded Age” “Dickinson” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” — not one has gone under.

“This is a story of resilience” says Michael Peck managing director for one of the city’s largest full-service custom costume shops Eric Winterling Inc.

“The costume business is worth saving and if we come out the other side we will all flourish — and that’s what’s happening now.”

Evan Riley an intern transfers markings from a pattern to fabric with a tracing wheel at Eric Winterling Inc. Friday June 25 in Manhattan New York.

On a recent afternoon Winterling’s 8200-square foot shop was finishing the final costume — a black and teal cocktail dress its bodice newly covered in lace flower appliqués — for the upcoming season of “Maisel” now wrapping at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn.

“They’ve needed a bazillion dresses made” for Rachel Brosnahan’s clothes-horse character “Midge” over the past four seasons says Eric Winterling the shop’s founder and CEO for 30 years. “We literally didn’t count.”

At other work tables twenty artisans — still half of the shop’s prepandemic payroll — finished costumes for newly-revived tours of Aladdin and Kinky Boots.

Seamstress Louise Hardison sews a design at Eric Winterling Inc. Friday June 25 in Manhattan New York.

The bulk of the W. 20th Street shop’s current work though is for a major motion picture — Winterling is sworn to secrecy on the project — that needs a rack of custom-made period costumes depicting Victorian London.

The work is intricate and labor intensive.

A single puffy green velvet sleeve that was being worked on last week will be handled by no fewer than six artisans before it’s done a process that starts with Winterling draping the fabric on a form to bring a costume designer’s sketch to 3-D life.

A pattern maker steps in next deconstructing the draped fabric’s dimensions back onto paper.

A “cutter” uses those patterns to cut the sleeve’s four component pieces of fabric and a tailor assembles them at a sewing machine. The sleeve will next be hand-finished by yet another artisan.

And once the entire garment sleeve and all is fitted on the actor there will still be more adjustments — tailoring hand-finishing — before it’s finished.

A big Broadway musical can spend $500000 or more on costumes work that will be divided among several shops keeping them busy for 6 to 10 weeks. But stage performances — not just Broadway but opera dance and theaters nationwide including on cruise ships and at theme parks — have been stalled for a year and are coming back excruciatingly slowly.

And so this film and television work has been a lifesaver say Winterling and Peck who are married to their work and to each other. Before the pandemic 75 % of the shop’s work was for the theater — but for now the bulk is for the screen.

“There’s been as many as five film projects at once including from overseas” says Winterling

“Maisel and [the HBO series] ‘The Gilded Age’ saved us” adds Peck.

Uptown on W. 38th St. in the heart of the Garment District the mid-sized Bethany Joy Costumes shop is also thrumming.

A very difficult depth-of-the-pandemic dry spell was survived thanks in part to two TV productions: Netflix’s “Halston” and HBO’s “White House Plumbers.”

“When the pandemic hit we were making Camilla’s suits and dresses” for the upcoming Broadway show “Diana” owner Bethany Itterly recalls.

Now her artisans are awaiting long-delayed fittings for “Diana” and for the Mary Louise Parker vehicle “How I learned to Drive” two stalled projects whose costumes are being taken out of garment bags and readied for Broadway openings this fall.

Her ten workers — “We’re small but mighty” she jokes — are largely focused on making new costumes for two productions for the Santa Fe Opera and for a third opera being mounted for the Bard College SummerScape festival all set for this summer.

“These opera companies they are established relationships I have had and if I didn’t have this seasonal work I wouldn’t have a working shop” she explains.

Still “It’s stop and go” she adds. “A lot of hurry up and wait and then ‘We need things immediately.’ And then mid-July is literally dead.”

It’s the same story for Helen Uffner owner of the city’s largest vintage clothing rental shop. Uffner Vintage in Long Island City has some 100000 vintage garments dating back to the mid-1800s and has been in business for 40 years.

Among the stars who have worn her suits and dresses are Tom Hanks Beyonce Meryl Streep Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore.

“We’re having a great week” she says after a rack of 1950s men’s suits was picked up by the Maisel production’s props department. The suits will be seen briefly inside the glass window of a clothing shop in the background of a shot.

“But we don’t know where our next job is coming from” she says.

“Theater is still fairly dead. We do summer stock and Off-Broadway but that’s not really happening yet. Basically we’re only doing movies and TV shows. It’s been very hard.”

Compounding the effects of the pandemic Uffner’s building is being demolished to make way for a new residential tower. If she doesn’t move out in three months her landlord can fine her $1000 a day.

Any new industrial space she’s looked at is charging twice the rent she’s paying now she says and she can’t afford the estimated $50000 it will cost to move a collection that includes some 5000 hats and 1000 delicate hand-sewn Victorian and Edwardian gowns.

She’s currently looking for a buyer — ideally one that will keep the collection in New York City.

“They build all these residential buildings and give them tax breaks for low income units” she notes. “Why not tell people building commercial space that they can get a tax break too if they provide units at a lower price to an arts institution?”

The much-touted federal “Save our Stages Act” will directly benefit theater owners and producers not their supporting industries notes Brian Blythe a founder of the year-old Costume Industry Coalition.

The CIC is working hard to help members via some creative networking and fund raising including through the sale of costume patterns from “Hamilton” and in the coming months from “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”

So far $500000 has been raised allowing the fund to make much-needed micro-grants to members still digging out from their rent arrears and stacks of bills.

“Last year was devastating” says Blythe whose partner John Kristiansen owns an eponymous costume shop on W. 38th St. that’s also surviving on TV and movie work while Broadway revs back up to speed.

“The whole theater industry is not screaming back to work” at least not yet says Kristiansen.

Stitcher Liz Williamson works on a design at Eric Winterling Inc. Friday June 25 in Manhattan New York.

The city’s largest costume shop Parsons-Meares Ltd. in Long Island City is gearing up for big new orders from several Broadway blockbusters including “Hamilton” “Moulin Rouge” and “Hadestown” says owner Sally Ann Parsons.

Still “All of the shops are in debt” says Parsons. “So yes we are starting back to work but that will only pay for what’s happening during the work — it won’t pay for past debt” she adds calling the costume industry a vital part of the nation’s theater ecosystem.

“You’d have naked people on stage without us” she points out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzI2L2lzLXN1bm9jby1zdG9jay1hLWJ1eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Sunoco Stock a Buy?,"There's a big shift taking place in the energy sector but Sunoco's business isn't likely to falter anytime soon. Does that make it a buy?

There must be something wrong with Sunoco's (SUN -2.09%) business.

Its dividend is offering investors a fat 8.7% yield at a time when the S&P 500 Index is near all-time highs and yielding just 1.3% or so. Surely a yield that high suggests the company is either in trouble or headed that way right? Not really. Here's a look at why income-focused investors might want to consider Sunoco and its huge distribution yield today...and why they might not.

The core of the business

Sunoco is a master limited partnership (MLP) that is primarily focused on the distribution of gasoline. That said its business falls into two categories. First it actually trucks fuel to gas stations in 33 states. Second it has been expanding into the pipeline and refined products terminals business which is basically the step before you truck the gas to the station. They are complementary assets and allow Sunoco to grow its business in two different ways.

The key here is that gasoline is still a vital and dominant fuel and that's not likely to change very fast. In fact Sunoco estimates that even if the sales of electric vehicles are very strong EVs will only account for around 25% of the U.S. automobile fleet in 2040. If sales of EVs are slow that number could be in the single digits noting that in 2019 EVs represented less than 2% of vehicle sales -- a tiny number. But even if the 25% figure plays out that still leaves 75% of cars using gasoline nearly 20 years from now and someone will have to make that gas available.

Moreover with operations in just 33 states there's still room for acquisition-led growth with Sunoco expanding via a spreading geographic footprint. That would be true on both the terminal and pipeline side as well as the gas distribution side of the business. So there are clean energy headwinds to consider here but there also appears to be ample room for Sunoco to support a profitable and growing energy business as well.

What about that distribution

Sunoco with a less than decade-long history hasn't been a publicly traded entity for all that long. Its big 8.7% distribution yield is toward the high end of that history but it has been much higher before. In fact the units are up some 50% over the past three years having more than fully recovered from the dip during the 2020 coronavirus-led bear market. Investors appear to be getting more comfortable with Sunoco's business and growth prospects.

A key piece of that is the partnership's distribution given that MLPs are specifically designed to pass income on to investors. The distribution has been stuck at $0.8255 per share per quarter since mid-2016. The distributable cash flow coverage ratio in the first quarter meanwhile was roughly 1.25 times. Historically speaking that would be considered fairly strong coverage in the MLP sector that would leave room for some distribution growth. However given the current environment Sunoco is looking to get its coverage up above 1.4 times. In other words don't expect distribution growth but do expect a safer distribution.

Leverage meanwhile is about in-line with the partnership's target with the current debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) ratio sitting at roughly 3.5 times. However acquisitions are a key piece of the partnership's plan. And that means that Sunoco will likely be making use of its balance sheet to help finance future growth. This is one more reason why distributions are likely to remain stagnant since cash that doesn't go to shareholders can be used to limit the leverage needed in future deals.

That said there are some additional caveats here. For example Sunoco sold off its gas stations to 7-Eleven in 2017 in what was a major strategic shift. Prior to that owning and operating gas stations was considered a core growth initiative. Goals change so this isn't the end of the world but it was a material directional shift. Also Sunoco's general partner is Energy Transfer (ET -0.12%) a name that doesn't have the best track record of putting unitholders first. This was highlighted by Energy Transfer's aborted attempt to acquire The Williams Companies last decade. It was a complicated break up that simplifying things involved Energy Transfer issuing convertible debt that would have protected the partnership's CEO at the expense of shareholders.

Is it worth buying?

So all in this is not a good option for investors looking for dividend growth. For dividend investors focused on maximizing the current income their portfolios generate however it could be an interesting option. That said it would be hard to call it a screaming buy given that there are more diversified midstream partnerships with equally strong businesses growing distributions and similar though perhaps not quite as high yields. In the end a generous yield is probably the most attractive feature here a fact that will likely make this partnership desirable to only a modest number of investors given the other options available in the midstream space today.",,,,,,

When Resorts World Las Vegas opens to guests and gamblers late Thursday card players will bet with house chips implanted with sensors at tables that take cashless transactions and track every bet split double-down and side wager.

""It's all RFID"" casino operations chief Rick Hutchins said referring to radio-frequency identification technology built into the first new Las Vegas resort to open since 2010. ""The table knows exactly what I'm betting.""

Cashless technology was retrofitted in recent years at existing properties. It was made part of Resorts World from the start executives told reporters during a preview tour Tuesday.

Doors of the $4.3 billion resort open to the public at 11 p.m.

""We're really excited"" property President Scott Sibella said. ""It's been a decade since a property like this has opened. We kind of broke the mold.""

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas debuted in 2010. Among other major Strip resorts The Bellagio opened in 1998 Wynn Las Vegas in 2005 and Wynn's Encore tower in 2008. MGM Resorts' multi-resort City Center complex opened in 2009 at an overall cost of $1.6 billion.

Resorts World is expected to boost a tourism-dependent local economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic but rebounding since closures imposed in March 2020 were lifted and travel restrictions eased.

Customers who are vaccinated against COVID-19 do not have to wear masks according to local and state regulations. Employees at many businesses still do.

""Resorts World is certainly a contributing factor to the expectation for improved economic conditions during the second half of 2021"" said Jeremy Aguero principal at Las Vegas-based Applied Analysis.

""Historically the opening of new large-scale resorts has tended to grow the tourism sector and the Las Vegas economy"" Aguero said. ""Visitors staying at Resorts World will benefit the entire market and Resorts World will undoubtedly benefit from visitors staying in the region's 146000 existing hotel rooms that will want to experience all the new property has to offer.""

At a blackjack table Hutchins said players still can use cash. But those with member rewards accounts and wireless wallets will be able to scan their phones with the dealer instead of visiting casino cages.

""I have $25 on the spot the RFID chip knows that and the (table) antenna underneath it. And if I bet these side bets it also knows that as well"" Hutchins explained. ""I can cash out at the table I can walk with my chips I can get a (paper ticket-in ticket-out voucher) here or I can put it back on my (cellphone) wallet.""

Slot machine players who have the app also can scan cellphone QR codes to play.

A player's stake will be spendable throughout the resort — except sports wagering which is handled under a different regulatory process by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The immense high-ceiling main gambling floor is longer than two football fields and honeycombed with slot machines. It's the gambling centerpiece.

Marbled halls lead to separate registration entries for three Hilton-branded hotels. They total 3506 rooms in two curved red-colored towers.

A hall leading to self-parking displays some of collector Michael Fux's whimsically colored Rolls Royce sedans.

A Sky Casino salon is on the top 66th floor. A nearly ground-to-roof LED facade faces the Las Vegas Strip.

Parts of the complex are still under construction including developer Elon Musk's underground Tesla vehicle transit system that will connect with the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center.

For now the daytime view beyond the resort's infinity pool is of tractors and trucks and landscape grading operations. At night the view will be the lights of the Strip.

Malaysia-based Genting Group an operator of resorts and casinos around the world bought the big 88-acre (35.6-hectare) property in 2013 from Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming for $350 million. Construction began in May 2015.

The site used to be the Stardust an iconic Las Vegas landmark that opened in 1958 as the largest hotel in the world at 1500 rooms. Its 32-story tower was imploded in 2007.

The Stardust's smoky mirror-walled casino was a playpen for ""Rat Pack"" members including Frank Sinatra. Its showroom hosted comedians Don Rickles Tim Conway and Phyllis Diller; groups like The Temptations and Four Tops; and the duo Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. Wayne Newton was the resident headliner at the 920-seat Stardust Theater before the casino closed in 2006.

Celine Dion will open the new 4700-seat Theatre at Resorts World still under construction on Nov. 5 said John Nelson senior vice president of AEG Presents the venue manager. Residencies by Carrie Underwood Katy Perry and Luke Bryan will follow.

DJs including Zedd and Tiësto will headline at the 2000-capacity Zouk Nightclub and the outdoor AYU Dayclub.

At the hotels amenities increase from the 1774-room Las Vegas Hilton at Resorts World to the 1496-room Conrad Las Vegas and the exclusive 236-suite Crockfords where general manager Whitney Mulaj noted its tie to the luxury LXR Hotels brand.

Each hotel has a separate lobby.

""We're using completely ticketless technology"" said Prescott Yee front office director for Resorts World. When guests arrive at valet parking they will receive a digital QR code letting them bypass registration and go straight to their room.

""No more tickets. No more paper"" Yee said. ""That is the essence throughout the entire guest experience.""

The design shows the rising importance of room rentals conference space entertainment dining and shopping to a tourism destination where Aguero said non-gambling revenues in fiscal 2019-2020 accounted for more than 70% of revenue. Twenty years ago gambling accounted for 60% of revenues.

Hutchins at the blackjack table said everything a guest does will be bundled into the Resorts World mobile app. Wireless connectivity and a customer's cellphone also eliminate the need for a physical member rewards card he said.

""The things that you do within the property we're going to be able to recognize you reward you for that or incentivize you"" the casino operations chief said.

""If you ate at the steakhouse maybe you want a dessert at Wally's later"" Hutchins said referring to one of the resort's nearly 40 restaurants and eateries. ""We'll be able to serve up a badge digitally that says. 'Hey try a dessert on us.'""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvSW5zaWdodHMvUmVzb3J0cy1Xb3JsZC1MYXMtVmVnYXMtb3BlbmluZy1jb3VsZC1yZXZpdmUtdGhlLW5vcnRoLVN0cmlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Resorts World Las Vegas opening could revive the north Strip,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/North-America-Travel/Insights/Resorts-World-Las-Vegas-opening-could-revive-the-north-Strip on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvSW5zaWdodHMvUmVzb3J0cy1Xb3JsZC1MYXMtVmVnYXMtb3BlbmluZy1jb3VsZC1yZXZpdmUtdGhlLW5vcnRoLVN0cmlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXNpbm9zLWdhbWluZy9iZWZvcmUtcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1jb3Ntb3BvbGl0YW4td2FzLWxhc3QtbmV3LWhvdGVsLW9uLXRoZS1zdHJpcC0yMzg4NDI1L9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXNpbm9zLWdhbWluZy9iZWZvcmUtcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1jb3Ntb3BvbGl0YW4td2FzLWxhc3QtbmV3LWhvdGVsLW9uLXRoZS1zdHJpcC0yMzg4NDI1L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Before Resorts World Cosmopolitan was last new hotel on the Strip,"The market for new casinos in the famed resort corridor was shaky long before the pandemic hit.

With Las Vegas’ real estate market roaring New York developer Ian Bruce Eichner held a ceremonial groundbreaking in 2005 for a towering resort on the Strip: The Cosmopolitan.

A midmorning thunderstorm didn’t stop him from holding the event either.

“About six people in the last two minutes told me a little rain brings good luck” Eichner said at the time.

Three years later with the economy spiraling downward and the real estate market cratering its lender foreclosed on the partially built resort. It finished construction opened the multibillion-dollar project in late 2010 during the worst recession in decades and after the resort lost plenty of money sold it at a steep discount.

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was the last newly built hotel-casino to debut on the Strip until Thursday when the $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas opened to huge crowds. The market for new casinos in the famed resort corridor was shaky long before the pandemic devastated tourism last year and like countless other projects around the valley The Cosmopolitan got started during the frenzied real estate bubble and later ran into steep financial problems.

Eichner 76 told the Review-Journal in a recent interview that people have often said real estate is all about “location location location.”

He offered another description: “It’s timing timing timing.”

Mixed results

Before the pandemic shut off much of the economy last year Las Vegas had spent about a decade crawling back from the Great Recession. The construction industry — which was all but wiped out after the easy-money-fueled boom of the mid-2000s screeched to a halt — mounted a comeback as developers put up housing tracts apartment complexes and other projects.

Along the Strip investors have developed retail projects and bought malls casinos and land over the past several years but resort construction has seen mixed results.

Resorts World was initially supposed to debut in 2016 but its expected opening kept getting pushed back as the project showed little progress for a while after developer Genting Group bought the site in 2013. Other plans for new supersized resorts on Las Vegas Boulevard have since come and gone or stalled.

Las Vegas real estate broker Michael Parks a hotel-casino specialist with CBRE Group noted that megaresorts on the Strip cost billions of dollars to build and that major financial backers have been “hesitant to invest in Las Vegas” for such projects coming out of the Great Recession.

“The costs of these projects have grown exponentially” Parks said.

Southern Nevada has a long history of developers pitching big plans and never following through and one of multiple ideas on the Strip to go nowhere in recent years was Alon Las Vegas.

Parks said that Alon a proposed 1100-room hotel-casino on the former New Frontier site would have been a great project. But Australian billionaire James Packer who was behind the plans reportedly had trouble raising project funds.

The resort was never built and the land went up for up sale in 2017. As Parks described it capital markets “didn’t cooperate” with the project.

The site purchased by casino operator Wynn Resorts remains empty.

‘They lost billions’

Resorts along the Strip sit on huge parcels of land — Bellagio sits on 75 acres and MGM Grand is on more than 100 — but Eichner and partners bought a vastly smaller plot for The Cosmopolitan in 2004 at about 8.5 acres.

Eichner founder of the Continuum Co. boasts of a portfolio of high-rises and said recently that the size of The Cosmopolitan’s site is like “half the city” in New York. It also meant that in Las Vegas “in a world of horizontal projects” he went vertical.

He set out to build a hotel-condo project with around 3000 rooms spread among two 50-story towers county records show. Eichner announced in early 2006 that Deutsche Bank had loaned $415 million for the project and in spring 2007 project officials held a traditional Japanese blessing and sake ceremony to mark the first piece of structural steel going up according to news reports.

But soon enough the economy started to stumble. Deutsche Bank issued a default notice in March 2008 and foreclosed on the partially built project later that year records show.

Eichner said that the German financial giant had put $1 billion into the project and bought him out for “a lot of money.” He also stated that he did not take a loss on the project.

“I personally did not lose any money” Eichner said. “The bank did; they lost billions.”

Deutsche Bank declined to comment for this story.

Discounted deal

The economy only worsened after the foreclosure and as The Wall Street Journal previously reported Deutsche Bank was unable to find new partners or investors and decided to finish The Cosmopolitan itself.

Its opening on Dec. 15 2010 drew big crowds and featured a three-song set from The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers followed a few weeks later by New Year’s Eve performances from Coldplay and Jay-Z.

The resort became known as a trendy spot with its lavish Chandelier Bar and its Marquee dayclub and nightclub. But overall the business was deep in the red.

The Cosmopolitan lost $97 million in 2011 $106.6 million in 2012 and $94.8 million in 2013 a securities filing shows.

Enter The Blackstone Group. After the economy crashed and property values plunged the New York financial giant bought real estate across hard-hit Southern Nevada including in 2014 The Cosmopolitan.

It acquired the resort for $1.73 billion — a huge sum by any measure but less than half of the project’s development cost which according to Blackstone exceeded $4 billion.

$500M in upgrades

Tyler Henritze head of real estate acquisitions for the Americas at Blackstone said in a statement to the Review-Journal that the company “had been tracking The Cosmopolitan for years prior to the acquisition” and was drawn by its quality brand and location “on the centerline” of the Strip.

He also said Blackstone has spent around $500 million in improvements including building 21 penthouse suites on four unfinished floors and full renovations of The Cosmopolitan’s guest rooms.

Patrick Nichols general manager and chief strategy officer at The Cosmopolitan told the Review-Journal that Blackstone’s five-year plan for the property totaled more than 200 pages.

Among other things several new food and beverage concepts were brought in and the casino was spruced up with new lightning carpeting and high-limit gambling areas he said.

Eichner said that he views The Cosmopolitan as a body of work and that he can’t get upset about it.

If the idea had been terrible or the project had never been finished he said there would be a certain amount of regret. But more than a decade later the resort is bustling with guests.

“There’s nobody that doesn’t know The Cosmopolitan” he said.

With massive events at Wynn and Venetian underway or on the horizon the local poker industry is booming almost like it’s a normal summer.

Over at Venetian the DeepStack Championship Series a Las Vegas summer staple hosted two events for the Mid-States Poker Tour in early June. Harlen Miller a 63-year-old from North Dakota shipped a $1.5 million guarantee event (June 2-7) beating out an enormous field of 2790 runners to win the $1100 buy-in event for $367801.

One week later the MSPT returned to the Venetian for a $1600 tournament with $2 million guaranteed. Chance Kornuth the Chip Leader Coaching founder beat out another massive field of 2011 entrants for a nice $412068.

Those events were only the start of big things to come for the Las Vegas tournament scene in the WSOP-less summer of 2021. Next door to the Venetian at the Wynn a historic event is currently underway — the $10000 buy-in Wynn Millions a $10 million guaranteed tournament.

If you had any inkling that the Wynn Millions would fail to reach that lofty guaranteed prize pool you were sadly mistaken. On Day 1C the final Day 1 starting flight a total of 1152 entries were in the mix with six hours remaining until registration closed. That comes out to a prize pool of $11520000 (minus rake of course).

Tournament poker is booming

Not only did the Wynn Millions attract a large field many heavy hitters came out to compete. Pros such as Daniel Negreanu (fired four bullets) Johnny Chan (fired two bullets) Erik Seidel Bryn Kenney (bagged Day 1B chip lead) John Hennigan Alex Foxen and numerous others took their shot at the eventual seven-figure payday (prize pool unavailable at the time of publishing). The event is scheduled to conclude with the final table on July 2.

The Wynn Millions features the largest $10000 buy-in prize pool in Las Vegas poker history excluding WSOP bracelet events. And while it’s certainly the highlight of tournament poker this summer it’s far from the only major event in town this summer.

On July 2 back at the Venetian the World Poker Tour will return to the Silver State for a $5000 buy-in Main Tour event. The WPT promises at least a $3 million guaranteed prize pool in its second live event of the 2021-2022 season. The WPT’s first event was at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tampa Florida won by last season’s Player of the Year Brian Altman.

Two days following the Main Tour final table (June 7) the Venetian will host a WPT DeepStacks Tour event — $2400 buy-in with $2 million guaranteed.

Having no World Series of Poker in town clearly hasn’t been an issue for the Las Vegas poker industry. Cash game traffic is a bit down (shorter waitlists) compared to previous summers (save for 2020 of course). But the card rooms all over town are still packed despite the WSOP traffic.

Prosecutors had sought a 16-year-sentence against Mimran 49 over the 2015 kidnapping.

The financier Yomi Rodrig testified he was forced to buy several million euros worth of stock in a empty shell company controlled by Mimran during the six days he was held in captivity according to Bloomberg.

At the time of the kidnapping French prosecutors said Mimram owed money to friends but his bank accounts had been seized as part of a major fraud scheme he was convicted over in 2016 or to cover debts worth 5 million euros ($5.9 million) at the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas.

The court sentenced three other defendants in the kidnapping to prison terms of 4-8 years while acquitting two others. A seventh man a British financier who fled to Dubai was tried in absentia and sentenced to 1-year in prison.

Mimran is currently serving an 8-year prison term for his 2016 conviction for carbon VAT fraud a crime known as the “swindle of the century” in France an in April was indicted in two separate murder cases.

French prosecutors allege Mimran murdered his accomplice French-Israeli fraudster Samy Souied in 2010 as well as his former father-in-law billionaire Claude Dray a year later.

Prior to his 2016 fraud conviction Mimran often touted his friendship with former premier Benjamin Netanyahu whom he claimed to have supported materially to the tune of €1 million over the years. More specifically Mimran reportedly told French investigators that he had contributed $200000 to Netanyahu’s 2009 prime ministerial campaign an amount that exceeds the NIS 11480 (€2922) campaign contribution limit set by Israeli law.

Mimran was one of about 50 French citizens working in teams of three or so who committed carbon-VAT fraud in 2008-2009. The fraudsters took advantage of differing tax rules in different EU countries to buy and sell carbon credits or permission to emit carbon dioxide on exchanges in Europe. The fraudsters would buy the credits in a country with no value-added tax and quickly sell them in France or other countries that did charge VAT. Generally merchants have 90 days to remit the VAT they collect to the French government. The fraudsters took advantage of the time window to divert the money offshore and transfer it through a series of shell companies until it effectively vanished.

The French government has estimated it lost €1.6 billion in unpaid VAT taxes this way and the total loss to all European countries is estimated at €5-10 billion."
XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VybWFnLmNvbS94Y2VsLXNjcmFwcGluZy1wbGFuLXRvLWJ1aWxkLW5ldy04MDAtbXctZ2FzLWZpcmVkLXBsYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel Scrapping Plan to Build New 800-MW Gas-Fired Plant,"Xcel Energy is pivoting from its plan to build a new 800-MW natural gas-fired power plant at the site of its Sherco coal-fired facility in Becker Minnesota. Instead Xcel plans to build two smaller gas-fired “peaker” plants one in Minnesota and one in North Dakota as part of a new initiative for the utility’s power generation in the Midwest.

Xcel also proposed two repowered gas-fired plants—one in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and another in Wisconsin—that also would run only during periods of high demand for electricity. The utility based in Minneapolis and with operations in eight states outlined its proposal in a plan submitted to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) on June 25.

Xcel’s still plans to close its Minnesota coal-fired power plants include Sherco’s three units that have more than 2200 MW of generation capacity by 2030. Sherco—short for Sherburne County Generating Station—began operating in the 1970s. Xcel in the plan released Friday reiterated that it plans to keep its single-reactor nuclear plant in Monticello Minnesota operating until at least 2040 which is a decade beyond its current operating license. Xcel also said it would add more solar and wind power generation capacity in the region along with energy storage for renewable energy in the next several years.

Cost Savings Emissions Reductions

Xcel said the latest plan would save the utility about $600 million compared to the earlier proposal. The utility said the new effort would reduce carbon emissions 85% by 2030 from 2005 levels compared to 80% in its previous plan. The utility has said it wants to produce carbon-free electricity by 2050.

Investor-owned utilities in Minnesota are required by law to submit plans every two years to the PUC that outline how they aim to meet their energy demands for the next 15 years. Xcel filed its first IRP which included construction of the new Sherco gas-fired plant in 2019.

Xcel in announcing its latest plan said it acknowledged opposition to the new Sherco facility. The utility received thousands of comments related to its original resource plan that included the new facility with much of the commentary related to why the utility would build a new large fossil fuel power plant at the same time it set a carbon-free goal.

Public Opposition

Chris Clark president of Xcel in Minnesota and the Dakotas told Minnesota Public Radio “We really did take seriously the comments that were filed. And we also believe we needed to step back and be able to answer for the commission whether there was an alternative to the [Becker] combined-cycle plant that would still preserve affordability and reliability.”

Bria Shea director regulatory strategy for Xcel said the four smaller gas-fired peaker plants would probably only operate about 5% of the time usually when needed to back up renewable power generation or in the event of a power emergency.

Xcel had received special authority in 2017 from Minnesota lawmakers to build the new plant at the Sherco site forgoing the usual approval procedure from state regulators. The plant did have support within Sherburne County particularly from those concerned about the economic impact of the coal plant’s closure. Clark said Xcel will work to support economic development in the region and also plans to build a large solar power facility in the area. Xcel earlier had said it wanted to add about 500 MW of new solar power generation near the Sherco plant.

“I think that’s part of the dialogue that we want to have is what are the things that we can do to continue to support the city of Becker Sherburne County … that have been such a great host to the Sherco facility” Clark told MPR.

The state PUC could still back Xcel’s initial plan though Clark said the utility wants the PUC to support the new proposal. Shea said the PUC could ask for more public comment before issuing a decision later this year.

Environmental Groups Praise Move

The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy along with other environmental groups issued a statement Friday saying the new Xcel plan reflects “a welcome and necessary realignment with the utility company’s promise to achieve a carbon-free electric system by 2050.” The statement continued: “We appreciate Xcel’s willingness to respond to Minnesota and the nation’s imperative to get to 100 percent clean energy sooner while minimizing fossil fuels.”

“We applaud Xcel Energy putting forward an innovative solution that utilizes significant amounts of new wind solar and transmission rather than a very large and risky new fossil gas plant” said Allen Gleckner lead director Clean Electricity at Fresh Energy another environmental group. “Creatively leveraging existing grid connections along with some of the Upper Midwest’s best wind and solar resources is a responsible way to both help Minnesota meet its climate goals and keep costs down for customers.”

The groups though said they will continue to look at the details of the plan. “While the new proposal is undoubtedly a significant improvement from Xcel’s earlier IRP our CEOs look forward to taking a closer look at the plan and digging into the data and details in the coming weeks” the statement read. “We want to see if data and modeling shows that other components of the proposal—such as the construction of two smaller peaker power plants that will run only occasionally—are truly necessary or whether alternative carbon-free solutions are available.”

Xcel in 2020 received approval from the state PUC to run two of the three coal-fired units at the Sherco site on a seasonal basis allowing the utility to idle the units for six months of the year to achieve cost savings and emissions reductions. Xcel had earlier conducted a seasonal dispatch analysis and found that seasonal operation would save customers nearly $1.5 million in 2020 and nearly $3.5 million by 2023. The utility has said Unit 1 at Sherco would be retired in 2026 with Unit 2 going offline in 2023 and Unit 3 shutting down in 2030.

On Feb. 20 after UND beat Omaha 7-1 to clinch the league's regular-season title Fenton called UND captain Jordan Kawaguchi to center ice and handed him the Penrose Cup.

Three-and-a-half weeks later after UND beat St. Cloud State 5-3 to win the league's playoff title Fenton called Kawaguchi back to center ice and handed him the. . . NCHC playoff trophy? The NCHC Frozen Faceoff trophy?

While the hockey world loves to name its trophies the NCHC's postseason championship trophy remains conspicuously unnamed eight years into the league's existence.

It has become an outlier in men's college hockey.

Hockey East's playoff championship trophy is the Lamoriello Trophy named after the league's first commissioner Lou Lamoriello.

The Eastern College Athletic Conference's playoff championship trophy is the Whitelaw Cup named after former ECAC commissioner Robert Whitelaw.

Atlantic Hockey's playoff championship trophy is the Riley Trophy named after former longtime Army coach Jack Riley.

The Western Collegiate Hockey Association which will officially disband next month played for the Jeff Sauer Trophy named after the longtime college hockey coach at Wisconsin and Colorado College.

And when the Central Collegiate Hockey Association resumes play next season after an eight-year hiatus its playoff championship trophy will be called Mason Cup just as it was before the league disbanded in 2013. It is named after Ron Mason the second-winningest coach in college hockey history.

The Big Ten and NCHC are the only men's college hockey leagues that have not named their playoff trophies.

It's unlikely the Big Ten will do it -- it doesn't name any of its playoff trophies in any sport -- but is it time for the NCHC to consider naming its playoff trophy?

It's certainly not necessary. The league has gotten along just fine without that minor detail. But it could help in branding efforts and marketing the league's annual tournament the NCHC Frozen Faceoff. After all there is a reason it named its regular-season trophy before its inaugural season.

If the league decides to do it there are a couple possibilities sitting out there.

The first is the Broadmoor Trophy.

Next season will be the first since the NCAA began sponsoring hockey in the 1940s that the Broadmoor name will be missing from the sport's landscape.

Beginning in 1948 the Broadmoor Ice Palace in Colorado Springs Colo. hosted the first 10 NCAA Frozen Fours.

In 1985 the WCHA named its postseason championship prize the Broadmoor Trophy. That lasted until 2018 when the league introduced a new trophy named after Sauer.

The Broadmoor name continued to live on Colorado College's hockey arena. Even when a new rink was built in the 1990s it carried the name Broadmoor World Arena. But Colorado College will open its new rink Ed Robson Arena this fall.

The Broadmoor Arenas -- the original one that hosted the first Frozen Fours and the newer one -- will both be gone from the college hockey world. The trophy is gone too.

It would be an appropriate name for the NCHC considering the league's offices are located in the shadows of the Broadmoor Hotel.

The league also could choose to revive the Sauer Trophy as Sauer was a former Colorado College player and coach. Perhaps there's a new idea out there too whether it's someone with a long association with college hockey or someone who was involved in the league's launch.

In March the NCHC Frozen Faceoff will return to its pre-pandemic home of the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. Fenton will again walk to center ice make a short speech call up a team captain and pass off the trophy.
