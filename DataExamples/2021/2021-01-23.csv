No sport can truly survive without the need for sponsors. Even NASCAR falls under this blanket and has attracted several major sponsors. This also includes all three classes Cup Xfinity and Truck.

The main partners are Busch Beer Coca-Cola GEICO and Xfinity. As the name suggests Busch beer is the official beer sponsor while Coca-Cola is the official beverage for the fans. GEICO is regarded as the official insurance partner and Xfinity is the cable service provider.

There are also series partners like Xfinity and Camping World. These two brands lend their names to the Xfinity and Truck Series respectively.

Construction on the Waipā section of the Te Awa River Ride path between Hamilton and Cambridge is set to start by the end of January.

The section includes 3km of 3m-wide concrete path 1.4km of boardwalks two bridges drainage culverts landscaping and fencing which will be placed alongside the Waikato River.

The 10-month build is planned to start by the end of this month with completion earmarked for early November.

Waipā District mayor Jim Mylchreest says: ""Our district hosts many internationally competitive cyclists and the Te Awa River Ride is already so well used. This additional section which takes people across farmlands and through the trees will only enhance the outstanding asset it already is.""

He says the Waipā section of the Te Awa River Ride between Banks Rd and the Velodrome will follow the Waikato River wherever possible.

""Cyclists will have some breathtaking views across the river.""

The full Hamilton to Cambridge section will be built by four different organisations Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) Waipā District Council Waikato District Council and Hamilton City Council as it traverses three district boundaries.

NZTA also contributed $2.95 million. Another $2.84m came from the Provincial Development Unit following the council's successful application to the Infrastructure Industry Reference Group for ""Shovel Ready"" project funding during the Covid-19 level 4 lockdown last year.

Waipā Council is also contributing $1.14m of loan-funded resources into the community asset.

The $5.92m construction contract was awarded by Waipā District Council to Cambridge-based Civil Construction Services.

General manager of Te Awa River Ride Charitable Trust Jennifer Palmer says: ""We cannot wait to open the entire path later this year.

Te Awa is already one of New Zealand's busiest cycleways and having 60km of connected off-road cycleway travelling through beautiful and diverse scenery has so many social and economic benefits for our region.""

The new section will run from Hamilton Gardens to Cambridge's Avantidrome linking together the existing routes that will make up the full 60km Te Awa River Ride.

The full path will run from Ngaruawahia through Hamilton and Cambridge finishing in Horahora south of Lake Karapiro. It is estimated the Cambridge to Hamilton shared path may be used by up to 225 walkers and cyclists each day.

The Te Awa shared path includes riding over the award-winning Perry Cycle Bridge that opened in 2017 at Ngaruawahia.

Chairman of The Perry Group Simon Perry said previously: ""A lot of our community said they did not feel connected to the river. You couldn't access it or see and it was hidden by overgrown vegetation and private land ownership.

""We recognised that by creating a shared community facility next to it would be beneficial for the region.""

Mylchreest said he was excited for the work to be completed. ""It will provide residents with the opportunity to use a different form of transport between two of the main hubs of the Waikato.

""This trail will become iconic and we are keen on expanding more cycleways in the region.""",,,,,,

The six-part AbbottVision series which will be officially announced on Monday as part of a slate of Sky originals is written by a team led by Abbott and will co-star Amanda Abbington (Sherlock) Natalia Tena (Harry Potter) Naomi Yang (The Salisbury Poisonings) Adam Long (Vera) and Shaniqua Okwok (Small Axe).

Ceesay leads the crime-of-the-week series as Professor Wolfe Kinteh the finest crime scene investigator in the north of England. He is a mercurial genius when it comes to piecing together evidence but is prone to being a liability and has been kicked out of his family home by his wife Val (Tena).

Wolfe is propped up by a team that includes child prodigy Maggy (Yang) middle-aged single mom Dot (Abbington) team entomologist Steve (Long) and new recruit Dominique (Okwok) who has a dark past that brings her into conflict with Wolfe.

Writing Wolfe alongside Abbott is Cat Jones Georgia Lester Furquan Akhtar and Freddy Syborn. The series is directed by Adrian Shergold (Mag Dogs) and Sean Spencer (Panic). Executive producers are Abbott Martin Carr and Paul Coe. Emma Burge is the producer.

Zai Bennett Sky’s managing director of content in the UK and Ireland said he has been looking for a procedural series for Sky One for some time having been inspired by ITV’s iconic Robbie Coltrane detective series Cracker. “It’s a heightened witty version [of Cracker] and that’s what really impressed us about it” he told Deadline.

Abbott added that the series will deliver “energy and insight with wit and attitude.” He added: “I’ve loved creating the character of Wolfe. I dredged a lot of my own flaws to get him onto the page. I can’t think of anyone better than Babou to breathe life into the guy.”

Wolfe will premiere on Sky One and streamer Now TV in the fall. It is made in association with Sky Studios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYmlnLWJyb3RoZXItY2hyaXN0bWFzLWFiYm90dC1hbGwtc3RhcnMtc29uLW1lbXBoaXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Brother: Why Christmas Abbott Called All Star Season 'Traumatizing',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYmlnLWJyb3RoZXItY2hyaXN0bWFzLWFiYm90dC1hbGwtc3RhcnMtc29uLW1lbXBoaXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL2FydGljbGUtOTE4MjMyMy9GcmFuY2VzLUFiYm90dC1odXNiYW5kLVNhbS1Mb2NoLXJldmVhbHMtc2hvY2tpbmctbWVsYW5vbWEtZGlhZ25vc2lzLWp1c3Qtd2Vla3MtYmFieS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL2ZlbWFpbC9hcnRpY2xlLTkxODIzMjMvYW1wL0ZyYW5jZXMtQWJib3R0LWh1c2JhbmQtU2FtLUxvY2gtcmV2ZWFscy1zaG9ja2luZy1tZWxhbm9tYS1kaWFnbm9zaXMtanVzdC13ZWVrcy1iYWJ5LW5ld3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frances Abbott husband Sam Loch reveals shocking melanoma diagnosis just weeks after baby news,"Former Olympic rower Sam Loch has revealed how a spot on his shin turned out to be a melanoma just weeks after his wife Frances Abbott announced her pregnancy.

The 37-year-old from Sydney but now lives in Portland Oregon underwent surgery about a week ago to have the cancer removed from his shin and four lymph nodes from his groin to 'see if the issue had spread further'.

In a lengthy post on social media the bodybuilder - who's expecting his first child with the daughter of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott - said he 'f***ed up' because 'it took years' for him to 'do something about the moles that seemed a bit iffy'.

'Firstly it's definitely good news as far as all are concerned. The one on my shin was the most problematic issue but not the only one. I have another date with a scalpel this week but it is much better than it could have been' he wrote on Instagram.

'Here's the important part - it didn't need to be this way. I f***ed up and now I have a partly f***ed up tattoo to remind me.

'My sun smartness in recent years has improved greatly but overall it's been rarely diligent generally lax and often with complete disregard for the risks I knew well.'

Former Olympic rower Sam Loch (pictured in hospital a week ago before undergoing surgery to remove the cancer on his leg) has revealed how a spot on his shin turned out to be a melanoma just weeks after his wife Frances Abbott announced her pregnancy

Loch underwent surgery about a week ago to have the cancer removed from his shin and four lymph nodes from his groin to 'see if the issue had spread further'. While he hasn't pinpointed exactly where the mole is he explained the melanoma was removed from his shin

Loch said it wasn't until years after his 'great mate' battled cancer and his wife getting pregnant he finally decided to go get his skin checked.

For most of his life the athlete - who's a two time bronze medal winner and a world record holder for rowing machine - said he put sport first before his health.

'I refused to think more than four years into the future and often much less than that. Performance was so important to me that health was only relevant insofar as it fed performance and long-term health was basically irrelevant' Loch explained.

'Not all and perhaps not most but many elite athletes think this way. However it should only be on very limited occasions that you put your health at the expensive of performance - Olympics World Cups World Records - that sort of thing.

'Ideally it never happens but certainly not as a default position. Athletes can develop somewhat of a paranoia around doctors because they are the people that if you tell them what's wrong with you can stop you doing the singular pursuit you have in life.

'But what are your options here really? You've only got one life and it extends beyond your years of peak athleticism. So take care of yourself and especially if it's because you're lazy and/or scared (men mostly).'

Frances Loch announced earlier this month she's expecting a baby with her husband Sam Loch. She shared a candid picture of herself cradling her burgeoning bump

The pair were legally married at a registry in February 2018 (pictured showing off their wedding bands after getting married on Valentine's Day)

His revelation comes just weeks after Frances announced on Instagram she's expecting a baby with her husband.

The 29-year-old fitness instructor shared a picture of herself cradling her burgeoning bump with the caption: 'Big little baby Loch. Joining the party Summer '21.'

The exciting baby news comes after the couple moved from Sydney to the US to start a new life together.

The pair tied the knot in a surprise wedding ceremony on Valentine's Day 2018 just three months after she met the bodybuilder in November 2017 - and got engaged two weeks later.

'Two weeks was all it took to know that forever with you was a mighty fine idea' she wrote in an Instagram post at the time of their shock engagement.

Frances said the proposal happened in the kitchen when Sam popped the question as she was putting peas in the freezer.

During the proposal Sam had a bottle of champagne in his hands and cleverly convinced her to ask him why.

When she obliged he replied that he brought it to drink after he asked her to marry him.

That was two weeks after they first met and the couple waited another two weeks before telling the world about their whirlwind romance.

Former PM Tony Abbott also congratulated the couple at the time tweeting: 'Really thrilled at the news of Francie and Sam's engagement. We are very proud of her and the Abbotts are looking forward to welcoming Sam into the family.'

Despite concerns the couple were moving too fast Frances previously revealed her family including her dad were very supportive of their engagement.

'I think meeting Tones [Tony] can be quite intimidating for anyone but that's what I love about Sam' Frances said.

'He's so grounded and so settled in his own skin it felt totally natural. There was no change in voice no sitting upright. Dad liked him.'

As for her mother Margie she was just as surprised as everyone when her middle daughter told her of Sam's proposal.

'Mum was like 'Frances you are quite impulsive'' Frances recalled.

The pair were legally married at a registry in February 2018 - but waited to celebrate with their nearest and dearest at Sydney's exclusive Palm Beach in April.

'The celebratory component isn't for a couple of months but we made it official in the eyes of the law' Sam wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of the pair showing off their wedding bands.

But the comedian never really recovered from a tragic loss.

Before there was Key and Peele there was Abbott and Costello — a comic duo that kept audiences laughing and inspired the next generation of joke-tellers. Known best for letting us know exactly who is “on first” the pair brought about lots of joy throughout their comedy career.

Unfortunately they also stand as proof that even the funniest people can have great sadness in their personal lives. Bud Abbott’s financial woes followed him until the end but they pale in comparison to the heartbreaking loss faced by Lou Costello.

The iconic partnership was started by accident

Abbott and Costello worked on the burlesque scene which contributed to the fast-paced slapstick style of their routines. According to Britannica the circuit had many well-known routines that allowed members to easily switch up partners and roles.

This meant the two occasionally appeared on-stage together but an official partnership wasn’t formed until Costello’s original co-star fell ill.

The two men put on an extremely dynamic show and their success demonstrated audiences’ love for them. Although MeTV notes that one man had to change the pitch of his voice because listeners couldn’t tell the two personalities apart over the radio Abbott and Costello seemed otherwise to be a perfect pair.

When the comics joined The Kate Smith Hour radio show in 1938 they gained access to a national audience. This opportunity to perform their hits — including most notably “Who’s On First?” — took the pair to new heights. Tragically in just five years Costello would be forever changed.

The death of Lou Costello’s young son was devastating

On November 4 1943 Costello was in the midst of rehearsing a comedy radio show when he got extremely sobering news.

According to the LA Times Costello’s wife had left their son named for his father in a backyard playpen. She took her eyes off of the boy for just a moment and looked back to see him gone. He had found his way to the family pool and tragically drowned. Lou “Butch” Costello Jr. was not yet one year old.

Abbott was said to have received news of the young Costello’s passing while watching an old recording of “Who’s on First?” In a testament to the strength of the pair’s relationship Costello still chose to appear with Abbott that night with Abbott making the heartbreaking announcement of Lou’s death at the conclusion of their performance.

Although the comedy pair stuck together for 14 more years Costello was deeply impacted by the loss and was stricken with grief. It is a challenging task to make others laugh when you are hopelessly in despair.

Many factors contributed to the duo’s end

Related Abbott and Costello Both Had Scandalous FBI Files

Of course the loss of Lou Costello’s son was far from the only challenge faced by the duo. Disagreements over pay staffing and stardom led to many intense off-stage moments. The pair also began to find it difficult to maintain the same quantity and quality of content output after over two decades of working together.

Many of their spats were high-profile and came with even higher dollar amounts. The LA Times recalled a lawsuit for over $200000 regarding a TV contract and the men were frequently at odds regarding their partnership’s lack of a 50/50 split.

Perhaps the financial debates were foreshadowing for the scandal that would rock Abbott later in life. Following a taxation dispute with the IRS he died from cancer nearly penniless.

Costello didn’t get a happily ever after either. He was just 52 when he died following an unexpected collapse in his apartment. He was buried next to his son and left behind a legacy of iconic skits and punchlines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvbmF0aW9uYWwtZ3VhcmQtdHJvb3BzLWRjLTQ2MTU5N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Several governors order National Guard troops out of D.C.,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/23/national-guard-troops-dc-461597 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvbmF0aW9uYWwtZ3VhcmQtdHJvb3BzLWRjLTQ2MTU5N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

You're reading Entrepreneur India an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.

""I feel I was never cut out for a job"" says Abhishek Gupta.

The 28-year-old was bitten by the metaphorical entrepreneurial bug quite early in his career. As a second year student at IIT-Delhi Gupta founded Zumbl a social application for strangers to chat and make friends which later got acquired. ""The acquisition gave me financial stability and early success"" he says.

But it also made him question his relationship with money Gupta points. So when he went on to build his second Venture Frankly.me backed by heavyweights like Matrix Partners Gupta called it quits within two years to find his calling in social work.

""I couldn't find much use of the money I was making and after introspecting further I realised that I actually want to work towards creating a strong impact in the society and not for money or success"" recalls Gupta.

Soon after Gupta took up a role with Delhi's government's Education Task Force where he found the problem he wanted to solve.

""I realised that the students who are doing well in school virtually end up not getting higher education and subsequently in poor careers"" he says. ""I wanted to work on that problem - to ensure fair representation.""

In September 2016 Gupta collaborated with Rishabh Verma former co-founder of Airwoot to establish NavGurukul a non-profit that offers a one-year residential programme for youth from humble backgrounds in software engineering skills to help them get employment. Verma exited the company in November 2019.

The program is aimed at young adults aged between 16 and 25 with a family income below INR 8000. The organisation has tied up with several NGOs and schools to identify and reach out to potential students who are then required to take a test basis which selections are made.

NavGurukul offers training in vernacular languages through its e-learning platform SARAL to solve the language barrier that often keeps higher education (mostly available in English) out of reach of children from low income groups.

The organisation spends an average INR 1 lakh on each student annually. Students are expected and not mandated to pay within three years after getting the job to pay forward for the education of the current students.

""We call it pay-forward and not paying-back as the student is donating for more students to join the institution and not paying for their own education"" says gupta.

As for job placement every student enrolled in the one-year program gets placed says Gupta. ""Some students get a job in six months most in a year's time and some take up to 18 months"" he explains. ""We support every student until they get a job and ensure that they are growing every day on campus.""

Over 100 students have landed jobs so far in companies including Mindtree Unacademy Gaming Monk and Directi among others with monthly salary ranging between INR 20000 and INR 60000 as per the company.

Apart from the residential program NavGurukul offers two remote online courses - Code Stars a three-month online crash course that teaches the basics of programming and Meraki a mobile application that offers several self-learning courses. However currently the one-year software programming residential course is the most important offering for the company as it guarantees a job.

Enabling Representation of Marginalised Sections in Tech

Though the ultimate aim behind NavGurukul is to offer employable skill training Gupta makes it clear that the organisation is not a vehicle of giving jobs but about ensuring fair representation of marginalised and disadvantaged people. By marginalised Gupta does not mean just those from economically weaker backgrounds.

""I believe it is very important that a crucial sector like tech has solid representation from different sections of the society including women transgenders HIV positive people differently abled people and sex workers among others.""

For this reason the many successful stories of students from diverse backgrounds who enroll in NavGurukul serve as high points for Gupta's entrepreneurial journey. ""Only recently I was informed that a girl who works as a ragpicker and was rescued has cleared our test. Knowing that she would come out with strong financial and social mobility after this course is a high point in my mission"" he says.

""It always tears me up to know the great work being done in our team to reach out to people near and far and create a diverse group of students.""

Currently NavGurukul has three facilities--two for women in Pune and Bengaluru and one for men in Dharamshala (Himachal Pradesh)--and is soon going to launch one more.

The company has raised a total of about USD 1 million from Microsoft Accenture KPMG Wingify Games24x7 DCX Technologies Macquarie Dunnhumby for the upcoming financial year. Many of these corporates also provide volunteering support to NavGurukul.

On being asked how was the pandemic year 2020 for the company Gupta informs that it has been a lot of work and scaling up to their visions and dreams. ""From 80 students two centres and a team of four in March 2020 we now have three centres we have launched a mobile application which has registered 2000 installations our capacity has increased to train 600 women and 60 men annually we are a team of 22 members and work for launching three more courses is underway"" points Gupta.

Over the next four years the company aims to increase its residential capacity to atleast 5000 women for five different courses and onboard more than 2 million learners on its android application that will enable employability of the learners across sectors of IT design and management as per Gupta.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS96b21iaWUtZmxhc2gtc2VjdXJpdHktcHJvYmxlbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flash Is Dead—but Not Gone,"On January 12 just after 8:15 am local time computers started to malfunction at the Dalian Train Operation Depot in northeast China. The dispatcher's browsers weren't loading train schedule details. Six hours later dispatchers also lost the ability to print train data from the web app. According to the depot's account on Weibo and WeChat and a follow up post a couple of days later the system flickered on and off for 20 hours before IT staff finally stabilized it. The culprit appears to have been a seismic but not unforeseen shift on the internet: the death of Adobe Flash Player.

As 2020 came to a close Adobe fully ended support for its infamous yet nostalgia-laced multimedia platform. On January 12 Adobe took things a step further triggering a kill switch it had been distributing in Flash updates for months that blocks content from running in the player—essentially rendering the software inoperable. The company had warned about the transition for years while browsers like Chrome and Firefox gradually nudged users toward other standards. Apple spent a full decade attempting to wean web developers off of Flash. But organizations like the Dalian Depot didn't get the memo. Frantic staffers ended up pirating old versions of the software even modifying them to run on all different versions of Windows to stabilize the system.

“Twenty-plus hours of fight. No one complained. No one gave up. In solving the Flash problem we turned the glimpse of hope into the fuel for advancement” officials wrote in a post mortem as translated by journalist Tony Lin.

The Dalian Depot incident speaks to the reality that Flash is not really dead yet and will persist untouched—and sometimes unbeknownst to anyone—in networks around the world. Mainland China is the only region of the world where Flash will still be officially available through a distributor that Adobe partnered with in 2018. But some users have complained about problems with the dedicated Chinese version of the program and have found workarounds to keep using the regular edition.

After decades of abuse by hackers particularly those running “malvertising” ad schemes Flash installations—whether forgotten or intentionally maintained—could expose networks for years to come. Versions of the software that haven't been updated recently don't have the kill switch inside after all. And because Adobe isn't supporting the software anymore there won't be security patches for any new Flash vulnerabilities that come to light.

“Flash Player may remain on your system unless you uninstall it"" Adobe says in an FAQ. “Adobe blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12 2021 and the major browser vendors have disabled and will continue to disable Flash Player from running after the EOL Date.”

In October Microsoft also released an optional update for Windows 8 and above that removes the operating system's built-in version of Flash.

In spite of this multipronged strategy though some installations will persist. On top of the risk that organizations won't update their software Adobe's last release of Flash included a special enterprise feature that lets network administrators essentially override the kill switch and place Flash functions on an “allow” list. “Any use of the domain-level allow list … is strongly discouraged will not be supported by Adobe and is entirely at the user’s own risk” the company says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmVzZS1yYWlsLXN5c3RlbS1zdG9wcGVkLWFkb2JlLWZsYXNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Finally Kills Flash And Comically Brings A China Railroad To A Grinding Halt,"



Dalian IT loads a car with PCs to replace non-functioning systems

At 4:30 AM everything was finally working again. This guy was no doubt happy

During more than 20 hours of fighting no one complained and no one gave up. The slim hope motivated each and every one and turned into the fuel to push forward. In the solving of the Flash malfunction the depot displayed true initiative innovation and brilliance.



Everyone was afraid of the ""Y2K bug"" that would leave un-patched systems in a quandary but January 1 2000 came and went with hardly a whimper. Instead it's January 12 2021 that will live in infamy perhaps. Adobe announced the coming end of Flash  its long-lived and much maligned multimedia plugin way back in 2017 but that wasn't enough motivation to some developers apparently. The bad news is that it's end users that suffer as some mission-critical apps stopped working on January 12 after the final Flash plugin update came with a timed lifespan. In one painful example that meant that a local railroad system in Dalian China went offline for about 20 hours stranding passengers in the process.The original story on Chinese media has been pulled but thanks to the intrepid Duty-Machine bot on GitHub  the story as it unfolded has been preserved for all to see. At 8:15 AM local time on January 12 the computer room at a Dalian railway station received a support call reporting that the internal website that showed things like the train schedule and the current ordering of train cars had gone offline. Within 30 minutes every PC on the rail operator's network was experiencing the same issue. At midnight GMT on January 12 the Flash plugin triggered its built-in kill switch rendering the plugin totally useless and now these PCs were starting to feel the effects.According to Google's translation of the Duty-Machine mirror of the original story (which has since gone offline) local IT had to search the internet to discover that the Flash plugin had in fact been forcefully stopped by Adobe. Railway IT members remotely connected to affected PCs and performed ""temporary product replacement"" which we think means downgrading the Flash plugin. An hour later PCs were still struggling to keep the maps and schedule functional. Every couple hours local IT would have to remotely connect to a PC to temporarily fix it.This went on for about 20 hours as machines would struggle to load the web pages correctly and the mirrored story reports that the train system was not running as it was not possible to keep trains moving safely. The Dalian train system's IT staff split up into hardware and software teams and the software team would restore an older version of the Adobe Flash plugin from a backup PC that had been kept offline and still had a version that wouldn't stop functioning after the drop-dead date of the latest version.At 1:10 AM on January 13 the Flash-based representation of the train cars were moving again. An hour later IT staff went to the Dalian West Power Plant station and replaced the hardware entirely to get Flash working again at that site. Finally at around 4:30 local time IT reported that all stations were operating normally again. Needless to say everyone involved was exhausted due to the long work day and the story reflects a happy IT team.According to an official statement from the Dalian Depot's administration which said the ""complete paralysis"" of the Dalian train system was not true. The mirrored story which seems to say otherwise. Officially the issue was limited to newer computers that were having problems. ""According to the statistics of this section the current train system has always been operating normally the railway train dispatching system has been operating normally and the railway transportation production has not been affected in any way.""We have to wonder why it took a catastrophic failure to get the railway's attention since Adobe has been trumpeting about this change and the final demise of Flash for over three years now. This should be a warning to all those who cling to ancient systems based on outdated tech. Hopefully history won't repeat itself the next time a vendor chooses to retire a technology that causes more problems and headaches than it solves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvZW5kLWFkb2JlLWZsYXNoLWJyb2tlLWNoaW5lc2UtcmFpbC1saW5lLWRhbGlhbtIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvZW5kLWFkb2JlLWZsYXNoLWJyb2tlLWNoaW5lc2UtcmFpbC1saW5lLWRhbGlhbj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The End of Adobe Flash Broke a Chinese Rail Line,"Once Adobe Flash was a ubiquitous part of the internet. Gradually security vulnerabilities and the evolution of the web made Flash less and less vital; finally on December 31 2020 it took its final bow. And while nearly all currently operational websites had planned for this changeover the end of Flash did have one unexpected result — it took a railroad in China out of operation.



Not a railroad in a Flash game mind you. An actual railroad.



Writing at Jalopnik Jason Torchinsky offers more details about this strange convergence between mass transit and outmoded coded methods. The railroads that Flash took out of service were in the city of Dalian serving a population of around 6.7 million people.



An article from AppleDaily provides a little more information noting that “[s]taffers were reportedly unable to view train operation diagrams formulate train sequencing schedules and arrange shunting plans” in the absence of Flash.



The train system was out of service for about a day. The fix for the problem managed to be both ingenious and a little worrying on its own: engineers installed a pirated version of Flash to keep the system running. And lo the problem was solved at least for now.



So many questions remain unanswered though — not the least of which is why a city nearly as big as New York had an outmoded piece of software still in operation. But at least the trains in Dalian are running again now.

In fact the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 120.4%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way.

A Big Run: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has had a bumpy ride since 2016. But despite lots of struggles along the way Intel investors have gotten some decent overall returns.

The rise of smartphones online gaming cloud computing cryptocurrency and other innovations created a boom in semiconductor demand over the past decade. Unfortunately for Intel innovation missteps and production delays led to missed opportunities for company in the past five years.

Throughout 2018 and 2019 Intel was unable to produce enough CPUs to supply its customers essentially turning over market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and others for free. In 2020 Intel said chip manufacturing issues would once again be delaying production of its 7-nanometer chips and the company may be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers for the first time.

At the beginning of 2016 Intel shares were trading at around $34. The stock hit its low point of the past five years in mid-2016 dipping down to $24.87.

From that point the stock steadily churned higher over the next several years reaching $50 in early 2018 and $60 for the first time in early 2020.

Intel In 2021 Beyond: Intel peaked at $59.29 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic sell-off which pushed the stock back down to $43.63 in March. Intel revisited its 2020 lows again in late October but skyrocketed back up to above $57 per share in January after the company announced a new CEO Pat Gelsinger.

Investors who had no knowledge of the massive gains from semiconductor peers like AMD in the past five years would be fairly satisfied with their Intel returns.

Intel investors that bought and held on through a volatile five-year period turned a significant profit. In fact $1000 worth of Intel stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $2408 today assuming reinvested dividends.

Looking ahead analysts expect Intel to grind higher in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 33 analysts covering the stock is $60 suggesting only 4.5% upside from current levels.

Samsung is scouting two locations in and around Phoenix two locations in and near Austin and a large industrial campus in western New York’s Genesee County according to one of the people.

An important factor in whether Samsung moves forward with the expansion will be the availability of U.S. federal government incentives to offset those offered by foreign countries and cheaper costs in other parts of the world according to a person familiar with the matter.

The proposal comes as the U.S. weighs allocating billions of dollars in funding to grow U.S. chip manufacturing and reduce its reliance on Taiwan China and South Korea. New chip-making incentives were included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed in January although the measures have yet to receive funding.

Samsung’s proposed plant would employ up to 1900 people and aims to be operational by October of 2022 according to correspondence viewed by The Wall Street Journal between Samsung and the city manager of Goodyear Ariz. one of the places the company is considering. As is customary with large industrial projects the local Goodyear authorities are offering a range of incentives including tax breaks and infrastructure upgrades to lure the factory according to the letter.

The U.S. has historically not offered federal aid for chip plants. But the coronavirus pandemic highlighted how disruptions in the global supply chain could interrupt the flow of key ingredients needed to make vital technologies ranging from 5G smartphones to jet fighters and sparked U.S. interest in becoming more self-sufficient.

With the rise of the chip industry in Asia over recent decades the U.S. share of chip manufacturing has fallen to around 12% according to a Boston Consulting Group report last year.

It said significant new financial help would be needed for the country to reverse the trend.

Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Samsung’s move would follow last year’s blockbuster chip-making investment decision by rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC said it would build a plant north of Phoenix and in December bought land for the $12 billion project.

TSMC is a contract chip manufacturer meaning it makes chips according to others’ designs. Samsung has a contract chip-making business that would be the focus of its new U.S. plant but it also has an array of its own consumer products that use chips coming from its factories.

Samsung has had chip-making facilities in Austin since the 1990s and has expanded there over the years. The company bought additional land near its existing facilities last year according to local land records. Next week it is asking local officials to relocate a roadway near those facilities according to a City Council agenda. Discussions about development incentives for the project have appeared on agendas of public entities in Austin and the nearby city of Taylor.

Officials in Texas Arizona and New York either declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Bloomberg earlier reported Samsung was considering investing $10 billion or more in a facility in Austin.

A wave of new U.S. chip-plant developments add to changes taking place across the semiconductor industry.

Intel Corp. the U.S.’s leading chip maker has fallen behind foreign rivals and plans to outsource production of more of its most advanced chips to factories in Asia. Intel’s embrace of more outsourcing comes as competitors are chipping away at its dominance aided by chips that rival or exceed Intel’s in performance and rising stock prices that are spurring a spree of acquisitions.

Graphics-chip giant Nvidia Corp. is proposing to buy the British chip-design company Arm Holdings for $40 billion in what would be the largest-ever deal in the industry. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Analog Devices Inc. are poised to gain heft through their own megadeals on the horizon.

Samsung has largely sat out the rapid consolidation. Its leadership is in fresh disarray after the company’s vice chairman and de facto leader Lee Jae-yong returned to prison Monday following a Seoul appeals court’s retrial in a long-running bribery case. Mr. Lee the third-generation heir has been responsible for ultimately approving all major business decisions.

Tom Brady fuels himself by remembering that he was pick 199 in the draft. Michael Jordan rembered that he was cut from his high school basketball team. Other athletes remember brutal losses.

Perhaps that is what we saw from Stefon Diggs after the AFC Championship game.

While the Kansas City Chiefs were celebrating on the field and being awarded the Lamar Hunt trophy as the champions of the conference a sole figure clad in Bills’ road whites was lingering away from the celebration. It was Diggs the wide receiver standing on the sidelines watching the victorious Chiefs celebrate as the confetti poured down from above and the fans in attendance soaked it all in.

So too did Diggs:

New York Jan. 24 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lifestyle changes and styles like working and using screens for long periods of time have brought about migraines and headaches. Headaches can be such a nuisance while taking a toll on your health. At times they can be so debilitating that they affect how you go about your day. They are also prevalent in individuals who have diabetes due to high or low blood sugars.

Consequently people may resort to using painkillers to alleviate the pain. The painkillers purchased are frequently over-the-counter medications. Such medications have assured you to assist you in eradicating your migraine for good; unfortunately a few of them have stood up to their assurance and been successful. In addition to that some individuals opt to try out new preventative supplements purchased both on a doctor's prescription and over-the-counter. However most reviews and studies show that the new preventative supplements failed to work hence did not please the consumers.

Besides acquiring a perfect solution to achieve tension relief has been such an endeavor and constant stress for many patients. Most individuals suffering from tension may often opt for a cooling and calming practice that can help free themselves from pain.

Luckily Aculief is the best alternative to both prescription and over the counter drugs. It is a portable wearable device meant to help reduce migraine tension headaches. Migraines are characterized by burning sensations in the body sensitivity to mild sound smell excessive throbbing aches accompanied nausea and vomiting. Tension relief Aculief is well suited for you if you continuously experience a lack of energy constant stress and energy imbalance.

History Of Aculief

The brain behind the wearable gadget for tension relief is a man named Jon Doogan who had suffered from constant migraines and related issues such as tension and stress. While in college he complained about his frequent pains and one of his friends recommended exerting pressure on his LI4 acupressure point.

If you go read through the history of his discovery you'll be astounded by how he went on to do at the stop between the thumb and index finger and discovered that it was an ideal method for tension relief. Jon Doogan shared how this tension relief solution could help other people who suffered from similar and related issues.

Story continues

He provided the following steps in applying pressure at the He Gu point;

Use your right thumb and index finger and place it on the spot on your left hand in the middle of the base of your left thumb and index finger. Afterward press down the acupoint for five minutes. Move your thumb in a circular manner while exerting pressure simultaneously. Be sure to be firm; however do not press so hard that it hurts. Afterward repeat the whole process on your right hand.

This procedure needed to be repeated several times or as you please for your symptoms to go away.

However people were thrown off by the difficulty of applying pressure consistently onto the spot between the thumb and index finger to eradicate the pain. It was a tiresome process and individuals still needed to go about their work.

Consequently Jon Doogan wanted to find a way that would treat people without much hassle. He then came up with Aculief the short form of the word ""Acupressure Relief"" which became a patented solution used to treat millions of headache sufferers seeking a drug-free treatment for their pain relief.

By A Lot

Is Airbnb the top booking source for vacation rental managers? Not by a long shot.

Looking at $2.4 billion in 2020 rental revenue received by US vacation rental management companies Vrbo outperformed Airbnb as a booking source by more than double (Key Data 2021).

What might surprise Airbnb’s pundits is that 55 percent of rental revenue is coming directly though managers’ own websites and call centers.

Rental Revenue per Booking

The research also shows that the rental revenue per booking differed significantly across channels for vacation rental managers. In 2020 the average booking coming from Vrbo was $1505 while the average booking coming from Airbnb was $941. Booking.com was even lower at $695.

Direct bookings were more valuable than those coming from channels with $1813 in average rental revenue per direct reservation.

In an upcoming article in VRM Intel Magazine’s winter issue Key Data CEO Jason Sprenkle writes “VRBO is steady throughout the year. Airbnb performs poorly in the summer months and stronger in the winter months and direct bookings capture the largest share in peak summer months.”

Why are Direct Bookings So Strong for Vacation Rental Management Companies?

In spite of billions in marketing spend from OTAs there are several reasons that direct bookings still account for over 55 percent of rental revenue for management companies:

Repeat guests

Higher conversion rates with better more personalized customer service

Travelers who are familiar with the destination and coming from drive-to feeder markets

Building a brand that is known nationwide is near impossible for local vacation rental management companies. However developing a recognizable brand within their main drive-to feeder markets and with their core demographic is doable. Guests who are familiar with the destination know the area in which they want to stay; often they know the exact community street or condo building they want. Local companies not only have developed strong in-market and feeder-market branding they also better optimize for specific areas and communities in search engines.

Warning: The Percentage of Direct Bookings is Slowly Decreasing

Although direct revenue activity is strong Key Data’s research shows the percentage is decreasing.

For vacation rental marketers this is not good news. Rental revenue per direct booking almost doubles that of bookings from Airbnb.

However when we look at the number of reservations Airbnb gained ground in 2020 while the percentage of direct reservations decreased.

To be fair to Airbnb the company was clear in its pre-IPO S-1 filing that it is not looking to grow its business from professional vacation rental managers. Instead the company says it is focused on the individual host. Moreover Airbnb’s S-1 did not use the term vacation rental at all labeling the decades-old sector as rural rentals.

When considering expanding presence on Airbnb vacation rental companies have additional considerations. Dozens of managers are reporting more problems with Airbnb guests than those coming through Vrbo or direct channels. Further Airbnb holds the power to override providers’ cancellation policies causing headaches for managers. As you will read in Sprenkle’s article in VRM Intel Magazine Winter 2021 the average booking window for professional vacation rentals in the US is 212 days for stays between March and July. In 2020 Airbnb made several unilateral decisions to cancel reservations with short notice and most properties were unable to rebook in that time frame without significant rate reductions.

Over the past several years we’ve seen vacation rental management companies evolve into two general camps in their marketing paradigms:

Those who mainly rely on OTAs for bookings (Large national companies that master distribution optimization and small local companies that don’t wish to compete with larger local brands for awareness) Those building a recognizable consumer brand (Primarily local management companies with strong destination awareness drive-to feeder markets repeat guests and high levels of participation in the community.)

It is worth noting that the first group is dependent on—and rides the coattails of—the second group which works within the community to build and maintain a viable sustainable tourism destination for everyone else . . . but that’s a story for another day.

The legislation titled the “Reduction of Illegal Public Consumption by Allowing for Compassionate Access to Medical Marijuana Act” would require the state Department of Health and Senior Services to create a new “medical marijuana lodging establishment” license for the facilities. They would have to submit an application and a $50 fee to the agency in order to obtain the new approval.

Once licensed lodging facilities would have to follow certain rules such as confirming that guests are registered medical cannabis patients posting signage that says marijuana can be consumed on the property and ensuring that consumption areas are at least 25 feet away from sections where its prohibited.

Places that knowingly permit cannabis to be used without a license would be subject to a $1000 fine for a first offense $2000 for a second $5000 for a third and the suspension of their business license for a fourth.

Theoretically if this bill is approved it could promote tourism in the state as it specifically allows hotels and other facilities to accept out-of-state medical cannabis certifications for guests.

There’s a similar policy on the books in Colorado where a bill providing for social consumption site licenses was signed last year.

In a new related study researchers took a look at the prevalence of Airbnbs allowing marijuana consumptions in Denver and found that it’s surprisingly common—much more so than for tobacco use.

“A substantial number of Airbnb listings in Denver Colorado permit cannabis use and venues permitting cannabis use may be more likely to also permit tobacco smoking” the abstract says.

About one-in-four facilities included details about their marijuana policy in the listing and 76 percent of those permitted cannabis use while 31 percent let guests use tobacco.

The focus of the study published this month in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs was to analyze indoor clear air issues related to marijuana at Airbnbs. It concluded that the facilities should “consider including cannabis use in house rules in jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis to help guests identify spaces with clean air.”

Missouri’s marijuana laws might not be as progressive as Colorado’s but a Republican lawmaker did file a joint resolution last month that calls for adult-use legalization to be placed before voters on the 2022 ballot.

Companies that were highly anticipated to go public in the early part of 2020 — Airbnb DoorDash and Asana — paused plans amid COVID-19 concerns.

That all changed in early summer. The market turned and a goldrush of IPOs followed including the three aforementioned companies.

By the end of December 480 companies went public a 106 percent increase over 2019’s tallies.

Additionally more IPOs last year doubled in value during their opening days than any year since 1999. In September Snowflake made history clocking in the largest software IPO of all time and Airbnb continued its trend as a tech darling raising $3.5 billion in its public debut.

As experts look to what is likely to be another marquee year for tech IPOs in 2021 — see Roblox Nextdoor and Instacart among others — Built In reflects on 2020’s notable tech IPO wins.

Owners can list their homes to be used for commercial video shoots and earn around R1200 an hour.

Filmspace handles the admin and offers R1 million host liability underwritten by Santam.

For more articles go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.

An online platform described as the “Airbnb of film locations” is now connecting commercial video crews with property owners in South Africa.

With over 400 locations already listed in and around Cape Town – and an imminent rollout to hosts in Durban and Johannesburg – Filmspace says it will simplify production and increase profits for crews and proprietors alike.

South Africa’s film industry is worth over R12.2 billion with 89% of the market value reliant on production according to the National Film and Video Foundation. It’s estimated that the sector employs 25000 South Africans.

Limited bureaucratic red tape and comparatively low production costs had made South Africa a film destination for foreign productions on top of increasing local production.

The film industry like almost all economic sectors has been hard-hit by the global pandemic. This is especially true for the seasonal trade which welcomes international crews to the Cape during the warm summer months. The film industry’s losses were eclipsed by the those suffered by the hospitality sector in particular holiday accommodation like Airbnb rentals which were banned during the three months of hard lockdown..

“Property owners called hosts are able to list residential commercial studio and mobile property all of which has dramatically expanded the industry offering” says Filmspace founder Blanche Franken.

“Unique cars wine farms homes mansions hotels and more are now on the market at substantially lower costs and without the traditional labour-intensive scouting process.”

Filmspace provides a place for property owners to list their offerings and allows scouting agents to browse these spaces according to geographical location price range and type. Communication and agreements between the parties are done via the platform while Filmspace covers all the admin including R1 million host liability underwritten by Santam.

It's free to list a property on the platform but Filmspace will take a 15% commission fee for each successful booking.

“A host can set their own rates when listing their properties” says Franken.

“We generally recommend residential homeowners to charge two to three times more than they would when renting out to accommodation/travellers and dividing that amount by 12 to get their hourly rate on the platform.”

This can be a very lucrative deal for homeowners who have a second under-utilised property which they are willing to open to film crews. It’s even an option for hosts who find themselves away from home for most of the day.

“The industry average for renting a residential space is around R14000 for a full 12-hour day. Roughly R1200 per hour” says Franken. Rates will differ according to the property type and film crews’ requirements he says.

“The great thing about renting to the film industry is that you can rent your house for the day and still come back and live in your home… it doesn’t need to be an extra room or holiday home that you are renting out it’s also peace of mind knowing that you are renting to industry professionals.”

Knowing what filmmakers are looking for in a location gives homeowners an edge but according to Franken trends are ever-changing and it’s not so much about the specific home but rather specific elements within the property.

“Categories we see do very well are natural-looking spaces (contemporary modern) villas farm-style homes lofts rooftops colourful spaces everyday homes beautiful kitchens open fields.”

“It is important for hosts to know that filmmakers are only looking to use a certain section of their spaces which means if you have unique features in your space you can list it on Filmspace.”

The investment comes despite challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.

New solar installations nationwide are expected to increase 43 percent from 2019 to a record 19 gigawatts of capacity installed in 2020 according to projections from the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar also accounted for 43 percent of all new electricity generating capacity added this year.

The state currently has 20 solar farms under active development that will generate more than 2.2 gigawatts of power according to Michael Vickerman policy director for RENEW Wisconsin. Vickerman said that’s enough capacity to account for roughly 7 percent of the state’s annual electricity use.

“So there will have to be another wave — several waves in fact — of solar coming down the pike after the first 20 projects have been built” said Vickerman.

The shift in the electricity generation mix has been driven by declining costs of utility-scale solar as coal has become more costly to operate Vickerman said. Solar costs have dropped more than 80 percent in the last decade.

Vickerman added that customer demand tax incentives relative ease of permitting and willing landowners have also led utilities to invest in solar power.

Madison-based Alliant Energy announced this year that it would phase out coal from its electricity generation by 2040 including the retirement of its Edgewater coal plant in Sheboygan. In May Alliant detailed plans to invest $900 million to add 675 megawatts of solar as part of a goal to add 1 gigawatt of solar power by the end of 2023.

“Our solar projects we’re very attractive from the standpoint that they are the right choice for our customers thinking about this long term and looking at the generation” said David de Leon president of Alliant subsidiary Wisconsin Power and Light. “So not only is it that the cost of these projects have been coming down and have given us an opportunity to really incorporate those into our operations from a cost perspective. But also it’s doing the right thing for the environment.”

Alliant also purchased solar projects in Rock and Green counties this fall that are expected to contribute to the utility’s goal of building 1 gigawatt of solar.

WEC Energy Group which owns We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service also pledged to go carbon neutral in the next three decades. In November the utility company announced it was retiring 1800 megawatts of fossil fuel generation and investing $2 billion in renewable energy that includes 800 megawatts of new solar power.

“A lot of this is made possible also because of the drop in prices from solar from (the) last five or 10 years” said Brendan Conway spokesperson for WEC Energy Group. “Things like this would not have been possible in the past because obviously anytime we’re looking at a project it has to make sense fiscally because that’s what our customers expect.”

WEC Energy Group has already received approval from regulators to invest in 300 megawatts of utility-scale solar projects. They include the state’s largest solar farm Badger Hollow in Iowa County and the Two Creeks solar project which went online in November. Subsidiaries We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service co-own those projects with Madison Gas and Electric.

The first phase of the Badger Hollow solar farm was set to go into service by the end of this year but the coronavirus pandemic set the project back four months. However the COVID-19 crisis has created only minor delays for utility project construction and little slowdown in new announcements according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The recently passed $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill may provide additional incentive for solar development with the inclusion of a two-year extension on a solar energy investment tax credit at 26 percent. The tax incentive was expected to wind down next year.

Tom Content executive director of the Citizens Utility Board said the challenge with making a rapid transition to renewables and solar power is that customers don’t want to pay twice.

“You don’t want to have to pay for the solar plants that will be needed but continue paying ad nauseam for the coal plants that are no longer needed and the utilities want to shut down” said Content.

Ratepayers have been paying off utility investments in pollution controls that were installed at coal plants in the last decade. Content urged utilities to consider innovative financing to pay off those investments noting customers shouldn’t be penalized as part of the rapid energy transition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zaGVib3lnYW5wcmVzcy9uYW1lL2tlaXRoLW1lbmtlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMzQ0MTg30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keith Menke Obituary (1962 - 2021) - Sheboygan Falls WI - Sheboygan Press,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sheboyganpress/name/keith-menke-obituary?id=32344187 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zaGVib3lnYW5wcmVzcy9uYW1lL2tlaXRoLW1lbmtlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMzQ0MTg30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

After graduation Stone was starting to learn the family optical business and began rehabbing a house he bought with his twin brother. His mother said he had plans to open a store in Clifton so he could be close to two of his favorite places UC and Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

""We are heartbroken to lose our dear son but grateful that in his short time spent here on earth he impacted so many"" Dee Stone Mitch's mother said in a Facebook post. ""Mitch had a long road with his cancer diagnosis at the age of 11 but he came out the other side healthy and fit. He was a truly good and caring person --everybody liked him. He always took the time to listen and appreciated a well-told story and a good laugh. He loved UC football collecting weird things thrift shopping running hiking & camping spending time with his family and many many friends. He will be in our hearts forever. We are grateful for your prayers and support.""

This acronym is used by traders to refer to stocks of seven of the biggest tech companies in the world.

The combined market capitalization of these stocks is about $7.9 trillion which is roughly 25% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 companies. To put things in perspective the combined market cap of these seven stocks is more than the GDP of Japan Germany or India which are the third fourth and fifth largest economies of the world respectively.

The Constituents

The stocks in the FANGMAN group are:

Facebook Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB)

Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX)

Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)

Buoying S&P 500 Performance: 2020 was a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to economic contraction worldwide due to disruptions to businesses and other activities. The stock market given its forward-looking approach weathered the setback and ended the year with gains.

For instance the S&P 500 Index ended 2020 at a record high and in the process generated a return of 16.2% for the year. The FANGMAN stocks played a big role int that as they outperformed the broader gauge:

Facebook: 33%

Amazon: 76.3%

Netflix: 67.1%

Alphabet: 30.9%

Microsoft: 42.5%

Apple: 82.3%

Nvidia: 129.3%

FANGMAN A Predictor of Stock Market Moves? Given the outsized weighting in different indices it is logical to view FANGMAN stocks as a good predictor of which way the broader market is headed.

FANGMAN Invariably Outperforms Market: For those investors who are looking for above-market returns or ""high-alpha"" stocks FANGMAN could be the better bet. These stocks outperform the broader market thanks to their transformational business models high growth and financial might among other things.

FANGMAN In Bubble Territory? From the perspective of topline growth earnings potential and prospects it is evident that the lofty valuations are justified. Higher P/E multiples of some of these stocks imply investors are willing to pay a premium to partake in their growth.

Investors see them as compelling as they are most levered to the digital transformation that is picking up pace.

But the stretched valuations of these stocks could conjure up fears of a deep correction.

One of the biggest risks faced by these companies is regulatory scrutiny. Analysts see the changing of the guard at the White House as a slight negative for these high-flying names.

Story continues

""To be blunt it's a clear negative for Big Tech as ultimately with a Senate now likely controlled by Democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around FAANG names with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a Jan. 6 note.

That said the analyst remains bullish on tech stocks for 2021 but sees the tech rally will be more tame until the Street gets a better sense of the legislative agenda under President Joe Biden.

According to People Ratajkowski took to her Instagram Stories on Friday to respond to comments that she might have had lip injections during her pregnancy. The model and actress was quick to shut down the rumors and said she'd ""never had lip injections"" but wasn't ""judging folks who do.""

She continued ""You can't even get injections when you're pregnant! ... A woman's blood volume increases 50% which is why ladies can get a little puffy in the face and lips during pregnancy.""

As for Instagram users who'd been suggesting that the Gone Girl actress had been pregnant ""forever"" Ratajkowski clapped back ""LOL yes pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks which can definitely feel like a long time but I announced halfway into my pregnancy and it's only been 3 months since then! Actually it's weirdly gone by very quickly to me.""

EmRata also noted that she'd seen a plethora of changes in her body throughout her pregnancy. ""Weird to have your body change so much in a matter of months"" she explained noting that she now has a ""whole new appreciation for what [her] body can do and what is beautiful ... I'm gonna celebrate it on here when I feel like it 😊.""

The US tech giant is arguing against new laws which would force it and other companies like Facebook to share royalties with news publishers which it said would be onerous and damage local access to their services.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed lawmakers will not yield to ""threats"".

The proposed news code would tie Google and Facebook to mediated negotiations with publishers over the value of news content if no agreement could be reached first.

Auckland University of Technology computer science professor Dave Parry said Google might well follow through with the threats because barring Australians won't affect their bottom line too much.

Parry said Google uses a ""parasitic"" business model where they make money off other people's content.

""If they are seen as being under threat by having to pay for some of that content which they don't usually then I can see [Google] wanting to make an example out of Australia on this.""

The potential ban would put a ""mark in the ground"" over with how far Google was willing to go to defend its business interests and the New Zealand Government should take note if it planned to introduce similar laws to Australia's he said.

He added that New Zealand websites may benefit if the search engine was pulled as Australian users would flock to Aotearoa's version of Google.

""Google really has to consider whether they want to go down this track for the whole world because alternatives will turn up and there are other free [search engines] out there.

""They may also find that if they drive users from their site to elsewhere they might not come back"" he said.

Parry said there is a growing appetite to look at how search engines and social media companies deal with local content and now is the time for both media and tech enterprises to develop models which work because they ""don't seem to be working at the moment.""

""When we look in five years time it will be different it won't be the free for all we see now. Google is not as well protected against competition as they think they are and there will be development in this area."""

This acronym is used by traders to refer to stocks of seven of the biggest tech companies in the world.

The combined market capitalization of these stocks is about $7.9 trillion which is roughly 25% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 companies. To put things in perspective the combined market cap of these seven stocks is more than the GDP of Japan Germany or India which are the third fourth and fifth largest economies of the world respectively.

The Constituents

The stocks in the FANGMAN group are:

Facebook Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB)

Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX)

Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)

Buoying S&P 500 Performance: 2020 was a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to economic contraction worldwide due to disruptions to businesses and other activities. The stock market given its forward-looking approach weathered the setback and ended the year with gains.

For instance the S&P 500 Index ended 2020 at a record high and in the process generated a return of 16.2% for the year. The FANGMAN stocks played a big role int that as they outperformed the broader gauge:

Facebook: 33%

Amazon: 76.3%

Netflix: 67.1%

Alphabet: 30.9%

Microsoft: 42.5%

Apple: 82.3%

Nvidia: 129.3%

FANGMAN A Predictor of Stock Market Moves? Given the outsized weighting in different indices it is logical to view FANGMAN stocks as a good predictor of which way the broader market is headed.

FANGMAN Invariably Outperforms Market: For those investors who are looking for above-market returns or ""high-alpha"" stocks FANGMAN could be the better bet. These stocks outperform the broader market thanks to their transformational business models high growth and financial might among other things.

FANGMAN In Bubble Territory? From the perspective of topline growth earnings potential and prospects it is evident that the lofty valuations are justified. Higher P/E multiples of some of these stocks imply investors are willing to pay a premium to partake in their growth.

Investors see them as compelling as they are most levered to the digital transformation that is picking up pace.

But the stretched valuations of these stocks could conjure up fears of a deep correction.

One of the biggest risks faced by these companies is regulatory scrutiny. Analysts see the changing of the guard at the White House as a slight negative for these high-flying names.

Story continues

""To be blunt it's a clear negative for Big Tech as ultimately with a Senate now likely controlled by Democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around FAANG names with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a Jan. 6 note.

That said the analyst remains bullish on tech stocks for 2021 but sees the tech rally will be more tame until the Street gets a better sense of the legislative agenda under President Joe Biden.

Like many in the tech industry Amazon has cozied up to the Democratic Party. Its political action committee and company executives are among those who threw their money behind President Joe Biden on the campaign trail while Amazon's top spokesperson Jay Carney has longstanding ties to Biden. But that doesn't guarantee the next four years of the Biden administration will be smooth sailing for the online retail giant. Antitrust reform stronger privacy standards and a renewed push for workers' rights are just a few of the issues that could be on the new administration's agenda. Here's what's at stake for Amazon in the Biden administration:

New union push

After a rocky relationship with Trump's administration organized labor is hopeful that Biden will make good on his promises to be ""the most pro-union president."" Amazon is likely to keep a close eye on the new administration's moves on the labor front as it faces a renewed push from unions to organize its warehouse workers. Biden has made empowering workers a key tenet of his labor agenda which also proposes various reforms to labor laws and expanding worker protections. His plan includes policies that would consider a company's labor record when awarding federal contracts and codify into law an Obama-era change to National Labor Relations Board rules aimed at speeding up union election campaigns. Biden has also voiced support for the Protecting the Right to Organize Act which passed the House last February and would levy fines against companies that interfere with workers' organizing efforts. While the bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate it could generate new scrutiny of Amazon's efforts to track workplace unrest as well as its labor practices.

""I would say [the PRO Act] has very little chance of passing"" said Gordon Lafer a labor studies professor at the University of Oregon and a research associate at the Economic Policy Institute. ""So other than that the question is what could the Biden-appointed Labor Board do unilaterally without needing legislation? There is a lot they could do that would be significant."" From a high level Biden's support of the labor movement has the potential to reignite union membership after years of steady declines. This could pose a threat to Amazon which has staunchly opposed unions in its workforce. Amazon's appetite for unions is currently being tested in Alabama where workers at its Bessemer warehouse are set to vote next month on whether to join the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union. While Biden and Amazon may not see eye to eye on unions the company is in agreement with Biden on one issue: raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. In a tweet replying to Biden last week Amazon touted its $15 minimum wage and said it hopes to work with the administration on making it the national standard. An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to questions seeking clarity on how it would work with the Biden administration on minimum wage issues.

Greater OSHA oversight

Biden has also telegraphed plans to expand workplace protections by restoring some Obama-era reforms to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration which were rolled back by the Trump administration. Biden plans to increase the number of OSHA investigators and require companies to electronically report their workplace injuries among other changes. This could mean that Amazon and other companies face stricter enforcement of OSHA standards. With more investigators on staff the agency may be more likely to take up OSHA complaints filed by employees and inspect facilities as well as levy fines against companies that are found to be in violation of OSHA rules said Debbie Berkowitz a former OSHA official who now works for the National Employment Law Project. ""The enforcement switch at OSHA has been turned off but it'll get turned back on"" Berkowitz said. ""OSHA will again respond to complaints with inspections and there will be a willingness to enforce the law to protect workers."" Amazon's workplace safety record continues to be a topic of controversy including during the coronavirus pandemic. California's attorney general is investigating working conditions at Amazon's California warehouses during the pandemic while some lawmakers have scrutinized the company's response to the coronavirus crisis.

The company has previously said it continues to invest in creating a safer work environment at its facilities. Amazon has bolstered its workplace safety team with a number of people who have ties to OSHA and employment litigation as scrutiny of its warehouse working conditions continues to grow. The company added another staffer from the agency to the workplace safety team this month when it brought on Madeleine T. Le a former OSHA lawyer as senior governance and compliance manager. ""Amazon has lawyered up for this"" Berkowitz said. ""They are lawyering up to start fighting OSHA inspections."" Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said the company has expanded its workplace health and safety team as part of its efforts to ensure its workplaces are ""leading in state-of-the-art safety investments training and education and safety programs."" ""Today our global workplace health and safety team is comprised of more than 5000 employees who use Amazon's innovation technology and data insights combined with exceptional experience and leadership in the safety industry to ensure the highest standards to keep our employees safe"" Lighty said.

Breaking up Big Tech

Biden has offered few hints on how he would approach antitrust issues beyond expressing concern over the power Silicon Valley giants wield in tech and other industries. But there are signs he will take a tougher stance on reining in Big Tech than the Obama administration which has been criticized for its close ties to tech companies. While Google and Facebook are currently the focus of investigations on the federal level Amazon is unlikely to escape antitrust scrutiny with Biden in the Oval Office. Amazon is already being probed by Federal Trade Commission officials over its business practices in retail and cloud computing according to reports from several outlets. Last year the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust found that Amazon has monopoly power over third-party sellers. Amazon and its rivals including Facebook Google and Apple  also face a separate probe from the Justice Department.

Groups that are critical of Amazon's power are closely watching who Biden appoints to key posts handling tech policy matters fearing that any influence from Silicon Valley could derail antitrust investigations or diminish scrutiny. Alex Harman competition policy advocate at advocacy group Public Citizen said he expressed those concerns in meetings with Biden's agency review teams last November. ""This was a problem in the Obama administration that I was part of"" Harman said. ""There was a flavor of 'Google is great and a Google revolving door is a positive thing.' That is no longer OK.""

Section 230 under attack

Another tech policy that's likely to be in focus in the new administration is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which shields tech companies from being liable for what users post on their platforms. Talks of Section 230 reform are often targeted toward social media companies like Facebook  Twitter and Google 's YouTube. But the law affords Amazon and other e-commerce companies some protections as well. Similar to social media companies the law protects e-commerce sites from being held liable for any user-generated content on their platforms like product descriptions or customer reviews. Amazon has invoked Section 230 as a defense in some product liability lawsuits concerning faulty products sold on its website arguing that it merely provides the platform for third-party merchants to hawk their wares so it's not actually the seller. The company also pointed to Section 230 in defending its decision to drop Parler a social media site popular with Trump supporters from its cloud-computing platform in the wake of the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6. Biden has called for Section 230 to be revoked arguing that companies should be held accountable for hosting content they know to be false. It's unclear how the Biden administration may seek to reform Section 230. Democrats and Republicans agree there are issues with the law but they're divided on why it merits a review. Generally Democrats hope to hold platforms more responsible for policing false speech and calls to violence while Republicans worry about inconsistent moderation practices that censor politically conservative viewpoints.

Privacy and facial recognition

With Democrats in control of Congress lawmakers could revive attempts to regulate facial recognition technology and establish a federal privacy law. Amazon has previously come under fire from advocacy groups politicians and employees who have pressured the company to stop selling its facial recognition software to government agencies. Last June Amazon imposed a one-year moratorium on facial recognition software contracts with police but it didn't say if the ban applied to federal agencies. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris recognized the need for changes to privacy and facial recognition laws before they entered the White House. Biden said in an interview with The New York Times last year that the U.S. ""should be setting standards not unlike the Europeans are doing relative to privacy."" Last year two partisan privacy bills were introduced by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker R-Miss. and Ranking Member Maria Cantwell D-Wash. While lawmakers agree on the need for a federal privacy law they continue to disagree on whether the national law should preempt state bills and if individuals should be allowed to sue companies over privacy violations. Lawmakers are already examining the data Amazon collects from consumers. Last month the Federal Trade Commission sent letters to Amazon Facebook Twitter and several other tech companies requiring them to hand over information about how they collect and use data. In 2019 Amazon and other members of the Business Roundtable wrote to congressional leaders saying the support the creation of a consumer data privacy law. When it comes to facial recognition as a U.S. Senator for California Harris expressed skepticism around facial recognition technology. Harris in 2018 wrote to three federal agencies to highlight research showing how facial recognition can produce or reinforce racial and gender bias. Amazon would be impacted by any federal limits on facial recognition technology such as those proposed in the Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act a bill that seeks to ban federal law enforcement use of the technology.

Indigenous leaders in Brazil and human rights groups are urging the court to investigate the Brazilian president over his dismantling of environmental policies and violations of indigenous rights which they say amount to ecocide.

William Bourdon a Paris-based lawyer submitted a request for a preliminary examination to the tribunal in The Hague Netherlands on Friday. The chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda will then determine whether there are grounds for an investigation against Bolsonaro.

There is no deadline for a decision but “it is a matter of great urgency” Bourdon said. “We are running against the clock considering the devastation of the Amazon.”

Since Bolsonaro took office in 2019 vast stretches of the rainforest have been destroyed and traditional communities threatened. Deforestation has soared nearly 50% in two years and has reached its highest level since 2008. Invasions of indigenous territories increased 135% in 2019 and at least 18 people were murdered in land conflicts last year.

Despite that fines for environmental crimes dropped 42% in the Amazon basin in 2019 and the federal government cut the budget for enforcement by 27.4% this year a report revealed.

“While the scenario is getting worse and worse the government is reducing enforcement” said Marcio Astrini the executive director of Climate Observatory the group of NGOs behind the report. “It is frightening to see that there is a coordinated attack on the climate the forest and its people.”

The UN-backed court has mostly ruled on cases of genocide and war crimes since it was created in 2002. However after facing criticism it decided in 2016 to assess offences in a broader context which could include major environmental and cultural crimes.

Bourdon believes this case could lead to Bolsonaro standing trial for ecocide a term defined as causing serious and lasting harm to the environment and people. The lawyer filed the case on behalf of indigenous chiefs Almir Suruí and Raoni Metuktire.

Several members of NGOs and lawyers from the US Brazil and France also worked on the 68-page report describing what they claim are crimes against humanity. It includes cases of murder forced transfer and persecution of indigenous people in Brazil.

Raoni is renowned for his fight for the preservation of the Amazon rainforest and indigenous culture. The 91-year-old chief of the Kayapo people is currently isolated in his village at the Xingu indigenous territory due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Patxon Metuktire his 35-year-old grandson followed him in his quest for help in the international community over the past year: “My grandfather thought it was important to make the complaint because the chief of the nation should protect communities but he is not doing so.

“People are feeling endorsed to commit crimes as the president supports them” Patxon added. “My grandfather believes the Brazilian population cannot make the president stop acting against the indigenous people. He keeps violating our rights so this is our last resort. My grandfather is ready to testify and clarify anything for prosecutors if needed.”

Scientists have warned that Bolsonaro’s destructive policies could push the Amazon rainforest to an irreversible tipping point turning swathes of the tropical forest into savannah. This would make it impossible to control climate change.

“Bolsonaro is not only a risk for indigenous peoples he turned into a global problem because what he does here has an impact on the planet” said Sônia Guajajara the leader of the Association of Brazil’s Indigenous Peoples. “He commits one crime after another against the peoples of the forest and against the environment.”

In November 2019 Brazilian activists delivered an “informative note” at the ICC arguing that Bolsonaro encouraged the genocide against indigenous people. More than a year later the prosecutor’s office said it was analysing the case to determine whether it would open an examination.

Eloísa Machado a member of Brazil’s Human Rights Advocacy Collective who worked on the legal action said: “Bolsonaro has his actions under analysis now even if preliminarily.”

Although the proceedings are still at an early stage Machado said it was an important sign from The Hague: “It is an indication that the facts reported are serious and that the prosecutor’s office is sensitive to the issue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9idXNpbmVzcy9wYWNrYWdlLWRpZG50LW9yZGVyLWJydXNoaW5nL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzAxLzIzL2J1c2luZXNzL3BhY2thZ2UtZGlkbnQtb3JkZXItYnJ1c2hpbmc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Got a package you didn't order? It could be a scam,"CNN Business —

Most people who buy things online just have to worry about their deliveries being delayed or never arriving. But some people are dealing with a different problem altogether: getting weird stuff like hair clippers face creams and sunglasses they never even ordered at all.

The Federal Trade Commission and cyber experts have been warning consumers about these deliveries which can be part of something known as “brushing” scams.

Here’s how these scams work: Third-party sellers on Amazon eBay and other online marketplaces pay people to write fake positive reviews about their products or do it themselves. To be able to post the reviews these so-called “brushers” need to trick the site into making it appear that a legitimate transaction took place. So they’ll use a fake account to place gift orders and address them to a random person whose name and address they find online. Then instead of actually mailing the item for which they want to post a review the brushers will send a cheap often lightweight item that costs less to ship.

Sending an item (even the wrong one) creates a tracking number and when the package is delivered it enables brushers to write a verified review. If you’re on the receiving end you usually aren’t charged for the purchase and your real account isn’t hacked — but you are left in the dark as to who is repeatedly sending the mystery packages. In many cases there’s no return address. You don’t need to worry that anything bad has happened to you or will happen to you if you get a package that might be part of a brushing scam experts say. But we all need to be concerned about the scams affecting reviews we rely on when buying products.

Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” Jen Blinn

Brushing scams reportedly took off on e-commerce sites in China around five years ago. They resurfaced in headlines last summer when all 50 states issued warnings about mysterious unsolicited packages of seeds that people across the nation received in the mail.

But it’s not just seeds. Unsuspecting recipients have also found boxes with goods ranging from dog pooper-scoopers to power cords to soap dispensers on their doorsteps.

Jen Blinn of Thousand Oaks California told CNN Business she has been receiving random packages since June including most recently a briefcase a backpack a hair straightener and a coffee-cup warmer.

“Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” she said. Blinn notified Amazon of the issue but a customer service agent “didn’t really understand what I was saying. She obviously didn’t know about it” she said. The agent looked at Blinn’s account and found nothing wrong with it.

Jen Blinn holds up some of the unusual items she received in Amazon packages. She didn't order these goods and doesn't know who sent them to her. CNN

It’s not illegal to send customers unordered merchandise. But “the [Federal Trade Commission] has long gone after marketers that use fake reviews” said David Vladeck a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and a law professor at Georgetown University.

Amazon says its policy prohibits sellers sending unsolicited merchandise to customers and that sellers can be removed from the site for doing so.

“Third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and we take action on those who violate our policies including withholding payments suspending or removing selling privileges or working with law enforcement” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Amazon would not say how how many brushing scams have been found on the site or how many sellers have been removed due to these scams.

An eBay spokesperson said in an email that brushing schemes “do not appear to be highly prevalent” on the site. It violates eBay policy to send unsolicited merchandise to customers or falsify reviews and can result in eBay restricting sellers’ accounts or suspending them from the site.

Experts also say it’s difficult to quantify the frequency of such scams because it can be hard for companies to know whether reviews are fake and scams often go unreported by consumers.

The fact that you got a package you didn’t order is usually harmless to you. The harm is to people who rely on reviews when deciding on a purchase said Chris McCabe a former policy enforcement investigator at Amazon tasked with stopping scams and fraud. He is now a consultant to sellers on the site.

The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews” Chris McCabe consultant and former Amazon policy enforcement investigator

“The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews because they might see 100 positive reviews and then there may only be 60 or 70 of them that are legitimate” he said.

The likelihood that a consumer will buy a product that has five reviews is 270% higher than the likelihood they will buy a product with zero reviews according to a 2017 report by Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center.

Some fake reviews are also being driven by Facebook groups where sellers offer buyers money if they write positive product reviews said McCabe. Amazon and Facebook should work together to crack down on these groups he said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company analyzes more than 10 million reviews every week to try to keep fake ones from being published and that it provides details of its investigations to social media companies “so they can stop these bad actors from abusing their platforms.”

A Facebook spokesperson said in an email that when the company is told of groups that may encourage fake reviews it reviews them and removes them if they violate its policies.

Unwanted sheets and Shiatsu massagers

For consumers the unexpected deliveries can be jarring. The packages Ashanté Nicole never ordered started arriving at her home in Fort Lauderdale Florida in 2019.

iPhone and portable car chargers. An iPad case. A heated shiatsu massage. A nail cleaning brush and a blow dryer. Sheets. A mattress cover. A floppy fish toy.

They didn’t have return addresses so Nicole wasn’t sure who was sending the packages. She reached out to Amazon to try to stop them from coming but they still keep arriving at her doorstep.

“It was just kind of a little bit concerning because I don’t know who has my information” she said. “I don’t know what they’re going to send me. Like they could send something illegal and then I’m in trouble because I didn’t know whoever that person was or what they were sending me.”

If you get merchandise you didn’t order it could mean that scammers have created an account in your name or taken over your account an FTC spokesperson said in an email. Scammers may have even created new accounts in other names tied to your address allowing them to post lots of seemingly-real reviews.

“We recommend keeping an eye on your online shopping accounts. If you spot activity that isn’t yours report it to the site right away and think about changing your password for that site” the spokesperson said.

There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” Ashanté Nicole

Nicole feels she has done all she can by alerting Amazon each time unsolicited packages from the retailer arrive at her doorstep.

“There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” she said.

Amazon declined to comment directly on Nicole and Blinn’s accounts but said if a customer receives a package that was unsolicited they should contact Amazon’s customer service team.

Nicole said she hopes Amazon will do more to stop brushing and ban sellers who participate in the scams.

“I just think they need to be a little bit more concerned with shutting those stores down and making sure those sellers can’t use the platform.”"

After all you can't use loyalty benefits when you're not in the air. That's why we've seen every major airline extend perks through the entirety of the 2021 status year with some carriers even reducing elite qualification requirements for 2022.

However slower travel also becomes the perfect opportunity for airlines to poach customers -- and get them into a loyalty ecosystem for the years ahead. Delta did exactly that with its targeted status match opportunity in the fall of 2020.

And I took the bait. As a years-long American Airlines Executive Platinum member I wanted to get a better sense of the competition. So I matched my American status to Delta becoming a newly-minted Diamond Medallion through (at least) March 31 2021.

For more TPG news and reviews delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

With two nearly equivalent statuses in-hand I took several flights on both American and Delta for work trips and an outdoor getaway. Here were five things that I learned while flying these two airlines during the pandemic.

Delta takes COVID-19 precautions way more seriously

The pandemic has changed the way people look at travel especially when it comes to flying. While price and schedule remain important factors for choosing an airline cleanliness and safety have taken on a new importance for obvious reasons.

I've been impressed with Delta's commitment to COVID-19 precautions and while not inherently a benefit of elite status it did convince me to book a flight with Delta instead of the competition. Elite status combined with safety measures made it an easy choice.

Both Delta and American have COVID-19 sanitation standards in place with similar messaging about how they care for passengers during every step of the journey. However on paper Delta already does two things better. First Delta has blocked middle seats through at least March 30 2021 which limits capacity on flights. Second it boards aircraft from back to front limiting crowding on the plane's aisles.

In practice I noticed these to be tangible benefits to the flying experience. My flights on Delta not only felt more comfortable but I observed Delta employees enforce mask-wearing and distancing during boarding and deplaning. Sanitizer was provided on Delta flights but not on American.

The biggest surprise here was that American didn't nearly have this same level of exacting attention from flight attendants and gate agents. The difference was night and day.

Upgrades are plentiful for both airlines

Business travelers often make up the bulk of the first and business class cabin. With fewer passengers flying for work upgrades were readily available on both Delta and American. In fact that meant an upgrade on every single one of my Delta and American flights including on the premium transcontinental route between New York (JFK) and Los Angeles (LAX).

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chris Dong (@thechrisflyer)

I was particularly surprised to see these upgrades clear in advance on Delta for two reasons.

First with Delta's blocked seating policy there are fewer seats available in the first-class cabin for upgrades. In fact for any narrowbody plane your odds of an upgrade are reduced by half with only two seats occupied per row (instead of four). Second I was even upgraded to the highly-coveted Delta One cabin between JFK and LAX -- and those upgrades only clear on the day of departure.

These upgrades as both a Delta Diamond and an American Executive Platinum show just how few elite passengers were flying in 2020 and how empty planes have been.

Delta has a more polished experience

While it was a small sample size of just a few flights I was surprised to see how much more polished the Delta experience has been during the pandemic. These may seem minor but in the grand scheme of things make a significant difference in the flying experience -- especially if you take to the skies often.

(Photo by Chris Dong/The Points Guy)

For instance Delta emails passengers about 48 hours prior to their flight to notify them of COVID-19 safety procedures. The airline also texts passengers immediately upon landing (and before arriving at the gate) with a simple yet effective message. This is the text that I received from Delta upon landing in Los Angeles.

Welcome to LAX! To help your flight crew provide a safe experience for everyone please allow some extra space between you and your fellow passengers when exiting the plane.

Additionally Delta gate agents crew and Sky Club staff consistently recognized my status and thanked me for my loyalty. This was notably lacking for all of my flights with American in 2020.

American has much faster more reliable Wi-Fi

As a frequent American flyer I had never purchased Wi-Fi with Delta before last year. American has streamlined its Wi-Fi offerings with almost all flights having a high-speed gate-to-gate option (at least for narrowbody aircraft).

This is an element of the American experience that I had taken for granted. After being onboard several Delta flights with Gogo 2ku service I found the Wi-Fi experience to be consistently slower and less reliable than comparable American flights.

However Delta recognizes this as its Achilles' heel and plans to lay the groundwork for better (and eventually free) Wi-Fi by partnering with ViaSat.

American has a significantly better premium transcon product

Earlier this fall I flew back to back on both American and Delta between New York and Los Angeles a long-time premium route but one that has also seen significant schedule and service cuts during the pandemic.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chris Dong (@thechrisflyer)

American excelled on this flight with hot meals full service and an experience that rivaled that of before the pandemic. Delta meanwhile retains a reduced onboard experience in Delta One -- even on its most premium domestic route -- with snack boxes beer wine and water served only.

While an upgrade is appreciated to a lie-flat bed American clearly came out ahead. I'm surprised to see Delta remain staunchly against the return of meal service and full catering onboard.

Bottom line

Overall as a new Delta elite member -- and infrequent Delta flyer -- I've been impressed with the Atlanta-based airline. However one sore point remains: Delta SkyMiles. In short I just don't find I get as much value out of each mile with SkyMiles when redeeming for the type of reward flights I take when compared to other airlines.

While the flying experience during the pandemic (except for catering and Wi-Fi) was in Delta's favor I much prefer earning and redeeming American AAdvantage miles. What does this mean for the future of my loyalty to a specific airline?

Well with travel remaining in flux in 2021 I have yet to decide which airline to throw my money at. For now Delta and American are neck-in-neck for a share of my wallet. Stay tuned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZWtyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy10by1zdGFydC1mbGlnaHRzLWJldHdlZW4tbmV3LXlvcmstYW5kLWF0aGVucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines to Start Flights Between New York and Athens - GreekReporter.com,"American Airlines will launch a new service for the summer 2021 season from Athens to New York (JFK) starting June 3.

Flights on a Boeing 777-200 will be available for booking beginning this Monday January 25.

The Fort Worth-based carrier announced that it will start flying a seasonal daily flight to Athens that will operate through Oct. 30.

“We are looking forward to launching our new route between New York and Athens which will offer enhanced connectivity between these two great cities” said Tom Lattig Vice President of EMEA Sales and Distribution at American Airlines.

“The safety and comfort of our customers and team is always our top priority and we look forward to serving our customers on this popular business and leisure route” he said.

Vacation in Greece

Flights to Athens will likely be popular among those looking to vacation in Greece.

In Summer 2021 Delta is slated to fly two daily nonstop JFK to Athens flights while Emirates and United will each fly once daily from Newark according to Cirium schedules. Of course timetables could change depending on vaccine rollout and worldwide COVID-19 case counts.

For its part American flew once-daily seasonal service to Athens from Chicago (ORD) and Philadelphia (PHL) before the pandemic and it remains to be seen if either of those will return in addition to the new JFK flight as demand recovers.

On May 6 2021 American will also takeoff to Tel Aviv marking the carrier’s return to Israel it last operated a nonstop flight there in 2016 from Philadelphia (PHL).

Boosting connectivity

Both new long-haul JFK flights will be featuring 37 seats in fully flat business class 24 premium economy recliners 66 extra-legroom main cabin extra seats and 146 standard coach seats.

Wi-Fi and seat-back entertainment will be available on all flights.

American and JetBlue are also working together to provide flights and both promised to boost connectivity in the region with a focus on Boston and New York. JetBlue will provide much of the domestic connectivity to American’s international routes from the area.

American Airlines is the world’s largest airline when measured by fleet size scheduled passengers carried and revenue passenger mile.

Before the pandemic the airline handled more than 200 million passengers annually with an average of more than 500000 passengers daily. As of 2019 the company employed nearly 130000 people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy03ODctc2l4LXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Happy Anniversary: Six Years Of American Airlines' Boeing 787s,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy03ODctc2l4LXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vY2VudHJlZm9yYXZpYXRpb24uY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL3JlcG9ydHMvY2FwYS1saXZlLXFhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtdGVjaC1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWV4cGFuZHMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXBzLTU0OTA3OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CAPA Live Transcript: Qatar Airways' tech investment expands partnerships | CAPA,"CAPA Live is broadcast monthly on the second Wednesday of each month. The next CAPA Live will be on 10-Feb-2021. For more information please see CAPA Live - 10 February

Qatar Airways has increased frequencies from 33 countries at beginning of the pandemic to 110 destinations today and will end up with 129 destinations by March

""After this pandemic is over there will be fewer airlines that will be operating. For certain by the grace of God we will be one of them because we have persevered we have established ourself very strongly we have made everybody aware of our brand our product and most importantly carried the flag of Qatar internationally. I think though by RPK we are one of the three but when you look at the number of international destinations we are the largest international operator connecting people and we will continue to do so.""

""We have increased frequencies from 33 countries at the beginning of the pandemic to 110 destinations today and we will end up 129 destinations by March. So you can see the commitment we have to our industry and to our passengers like no other airline.""

We have invested a lot in technology and were one of the first airports to use UV robots contactless processes for passengers and the latest technology UV equipment to sanitise our aircraft.

""Fortunately we are in a very unique position which no other airline in the world is that we both operate the airport as an airline so it gives us responsibility for total passenger experience. Once you check in at Qatar Airways until you board your airplane. So this is something that is helped us to provide to our people a very safe and sanitised way of travelling during this very serious situation the world is facing since nearly over a century ago.

""If you notice what we did from the beginning of the pandemic we invested a lot in technology that will make our airport and the airline safe. We were one of the first airports that used UV robots contactless processes for the passengers sanitisation and including using latest technology UV equipment to sanitise our aircraft. We were one of the only international carriers to provide mandatory face shield mask gloves sanitisers to every single passenger and made sure that they use it while they're onboard our airplane.""

""So these are the things that we did to bring confidence of the people. And we have already received five-star rating by Skytrax for the COVID mitigating factors we have introduced in our airport. So we have met all the requirements of our ministry of public health including international organisations.""

We are going to expand our partnerships with other carriers. We are part of a larger aviation family and can contribute to each other's bottom line

""You know that we had huge disagreement with American. Today we are very close to them and we are very close to JetBlue. We are now going to expand our partnerships with other carriers. Air Canada is an example where two CEOs that have same understanding about the industry two CEOs that are very progressive have come to an agreement whereby we contribute to each other traffic. And this is a very good example for everybody else that in our industry we are not adversaries but we are part of a larger aviation family and we can contribute to each other's bottom line to each other's progress to each other's increase in traffic and contributing to facilitations for their passengers and most importantly to their frequent flyer members.""

""I hope that this is a very good learning curve for all the other people in our industry that think that we should only keep the pie for ourselves and eat it alone. And now that the pie is very small after this pandemic is over and it is for everybody else to make sure that they can learn from us of how to generate partnerships and meet the demand that will be very much reduced over the next three to four years.""

""It also gives a very good example to other oneworld members who are not openly working with us or working with us to the level that the alliance should work with each other. I'm a businessman and I look at win-win for two sides. You can never have a relationship with somebody where it is a one-way street. And both American JetBlue and Air Canada start to realise that with Qatar Airways there is a mutual benefit partnership not like some other airlines that they are only looking to their benefit and using other people in order for them to get and eat the cake for themself.""

CAPA Live January 2021 Highlight: H.E Akbar Al Baker Group CEO Qatar Airways

We have invested right across the globe from South America to China and now in Africa. So we are covering nearly the entire globe

""If you really look at the way we have invested we have invested right across the globe from South America with LATAM to North America our relationship with American Airlines JetBlue and now with building relationship with Alaskan then going back to the Far East doing it with China and Cathay and now investing in Africa. So we are really covering nearly the entire globe and with our developing strong relationship and the shareholding with IAG. So we ought to be satisfied that we have enough exposure to our business growth over the entire globe.""

Business traffic will start growing once the pandemic is brought under control. High net worth people are now fed up being locked in their countries and will want to start travelling

""There will not be too much business traffic but this is only for the time being. I am certain that the business traffic will start growing once the pandemic is brought under control. To a lot of people that I spoke to always feel that they can do and conduct their business better when it is a face to face meeting than doing it over a TV screen or on a laptop. What is very important for people to know that we have passed through epidemics not a pandemic but we have passed through pandemics which also indicated that business travel will be affected it didn't happen. And I think the same will happen keeping in mind that there will be so much reduced capacity of premium carriers that we think people will still fill our premium seats in not too distant future.""

""I think mostly the traffic in the premium will come from the high-net-worth people who are now fed up by being locked in their countries and would suddenly want to go and start travelling. I'll give you an example. Even at the peak of the pandemic people are still travelling to the Maldives Seychelles Zanzibar on Qatar Airways. So our premium seats in these routes are full. We started with one flight a day to the Maldives and now we are operating three flights a day to the Maldives. Two of them are widebody and one is a narrowbody and the narrowbody is because that aircraft is operating between two bubbles carrying point to point traffic between my country and the Maldives.""

""We came up with a very clever system where people can go being tested and then go to dedicated islands that has been requisitioned. When I say requisitioned space we have taken the entire capacity of those three islands. People go to those islands and then come back straight without going to quarantine because they are on the return again tested. So by this way we have generated a model that is giving a very good high value traffic between these two destinations. So we always come up with new types of inventions to keep our airline continuing to fly.""

""I think that the entire network business traffic will start growing once the pandemic is brought under control and I hope that it will happen sooner than later even though there's no 100% guarantee that the vaccine is going to work. You don't know how long will be the effect of the vaccine. Will it be six months nine months one year? Will it be permanent or will you have to get vaccinated every year? Will the vaccine producers have the capacity to cater for the world's population if it is to be taken year-round? Every year? And even if you get vaccinated still science cannot prove that you will not be infectious to other people. Especially when not everybody will get vaccine. So you could still be a carrier though you are not getting effected because you have been vaccinated. So all these things need to be clarified. And I don't think it will happen in a day or two.""

""If a new variant of COVID comes out which is then difficult to treat or the spread is more aggressive than what it was then we would be in trouble and this may extend recovery beyond 2024.""

""People will eventually forget about this pandemic. Or if it gets extended I'm sure humans will always find a way around of how to get along and live with whatever is at hand.""

We want to be a dominant player in the cargo business. People have learnt from us how to convert passenger aircraft into freighters

""In the long run we will still be one of the largest cargo operators. But I don't think that once passenger numbers started ramping that we will still have the same capacity in the belly that we have today. However we already have nearly 30 freighters and those numbers are going to increase. We want to be a dominant player in the cargo business. People learnt it from us of how to convert passenger aircraft into freighters.""

The A350 is a very efficient airplane when it comes to emissions. The A380 is the worst aircraft when it comes to emissions that is flying around today so we will not operate them for the foreseeable future

""The 350s and the 78s are very efficient airplane when it comes to emissions. Especially with the 350-1000. We never expected that aircraft to be the efficiency that it is producing today. The 380 I think is one of the worst aircraft when it comes to emission that is flying around today. This is why we have decided that we will not operate them for the foreseeable future. And even when we operate them we will only operate half of the numbers we have.""

We have one of the most comfortably economy class seats flying. We give you the same product in economy that other airlines give in premium economy

""We have one of the most comfortable economic class seats that are today flying in the air because even our economic class seats are designed with feedback from the airline. So we look at all the requirements that you have. We give you the same product that other airlines will give you in premium economy we give it to you in the economy. So why should we reinvent the wheel?""

""Frankly speaking I rather rest my feet on the floor of the aeroplanes stretched under the seat in front of me than have this funny leg rest that comes out from underneath the premium economic seat that is so uncomfortable to your calf that after sometime it starts hurting you. So you need to look at all the comforts pros and cons of the both product and you will eventually come to the conclusion that a normal economic seat with proper amenities and ergonomics of the seat that it is a more comfortable proposition than a premium economy.""

I don't think airlines will start taking advantage and start charging higher fares. We will always find ways to make money but it doesn't mean that you have to overcharge passengers

""I disagree that airlines will start charging people an arm and a leg just because there is reduced capacity or the airline industry has shrunk. I don't think that will be the case. Eventually the airlines really start growing again but in the short and medium term yes there will be a reduction in the number of airplanes and the network. But also keep in mind that less people will want to travel in that period of time. So I don't think that there will be lower capacity or people or airlines will start taking advantage of what is happening to start charging people higher fares. I don't think that is going to happen.""

""We have introduced in Qatar Airways different fare levels in different classes to encourage people to travel and this is what we will continue to do. So you'll have different fare classes which you could choose depending on when you are booking and how close to the date of departure you're booking. So we are not going to change that.

Gillette Wyoming CNN —

This Wyoming coal town is a place of contradictions. At dawn the land looks heavenly: Winds rattle the sagebrush; cotton-candy skies make a dusting of snow glow in pastel hues. Later in the afternoon though you look to the horizon and see the Earth hemorrhaging gray dust as trucks haul coal from pits the size of suburbs.

John D. Sutter

Gillette is the hub of a region called the Powder River Basin which produces roughly 40% of US coal. West Virginia’s coal country gets more attention but Wyoming produces more coal at this point. Gillette is the town that powers America – at least it did for decades.

But as the urgency of the climate crisis has become more apparent markets have shifted toward cheaper and cleaner electricity sources – wind solar and natural gas. Residents here know that the Biden administration which rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change and promises a 100% clean electric grid by 2035 could help push Gillette out of existence.

Moving away from coal is essential to fighting back against worsening droughts storms and sea-level rise around the world. That fight will only get harder if America keeps burning coal.

To some degree Gillette understand this. It’s a place that simultaneously calls itself the “Energy Capital of the Nation” while also planning for a future in which the fossil fuel industry may not exist.

I drove here in January after Steve Gray a 56-year-old resident who’s been laid off from both the coal and oil industries in northeastern Wyoming left CNN a voicemail after the 2020 presidential election. I’ve been exploring your questions about the climate crisis as part of an ongoing series for CNN Opinion and Gray’s message seemed to bring up some of the toughest questions concerning what must be a rapid transition away from fossil fuels.

“Everybody in this town is afraid that it is going to become a ghost town” he said.

Steve Gray called CNN concerned that following the election of President Biden that Gillette could become a ""ghost town."" He says he was laid off from an oil field job in 2015 then subsequently from another job in oil and then one in coal last year. McKenna Ewen

Implicitly Gray seemed to be asking: What will happen to Gillette – and other fossil fuel towns – as the coal industry recedes and clean-energy goals are realized? And what difference could the Biden administration or Congress make for a dying town built on coal?

Climate advocates tend to lump solutions to all of these issues under an umbrella term: “just transition.” Not like “just get on with this transition already.” “Just” as in fair.

Gray the man who called CNN doesn’t see anything fair about it.

“People are getting left behind” he told me.

He and others I met in Gillette want the rest of the country to realize that they’ve worked hard for decades to supply the United States with electricity. They didn’t own the companies that got rich off the boom in coal and other fossil fuels – companies that hid research showing the disastrous effects of climate change or that funded disinformation campaigns.

They were just working.

Working in an industry created by federal policies that failed to price carbon pollution – that encouraged the mining of coal on land owned by the US government.

And now they’re being asked to stop.

Both by markets which value cheaper energy sources.

And importantly by climate advocates like myself who understand based on science that’s been amassing for decades that global warming poses an existential threat to humanity.

What do we owe Gillette and its workers?

Boomtown

There’s an important irony hidden in the story of Gillette.

The US government willed much of this place into existence.

This nudge came in a few forms. One was federal support for domestic energy production in the early 1970s – a time when overseas markets were seen as volatile and problematic.

Another was environmental regulation.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 and its 1990 amendments targeted among other pollutants sulfur dioxide which is a component of smog and acid rain. Powder River Basin coal just so happens to be naturally lower in sulfur than coal found in Appalachia and elsewhere.

Before 1970 there were a few coal mines and oil rigs in the Gillette area Robert Henning director of a local history museum the Campbell County Rockpile Museum told me. We were standing in front of a wall-sized image of 1920s Gillette which had the look of a sepia-tone Western outpost – a dusty landscape with wooden fences and magnificent rolling hills on the horizon. Gillette was founded in the late 1800s as a railroad town – named for a surveyor. But after 1970 and the Clean Air Act Henning told me the then-localized mining industry exploded.

In 1960 the population of Campbell County which includes Gillette was about 5800.

By 1970 it had more than doubled – to nearly 13000.

During the boom the town was so crowded and chaotic that some families lived in tents said Jim Ford a Gillette resident who advises local government agencies and non-profits on economic and energy issues. Ford told me that when he was a child his elementary school adopted a two-shift schedule to accommodate all the students. One group started at 6:00 AM and went until noon. Then the other started ending at 6:00 p.m.

Steve Gray told me that his family was one of the ones that came to the region to work in the fossil fuel industry in the early 1970s. His dad worked in the oil fields and so did Gray at least for a time.

That was when life was good. Work was free-flowing. Wages were high.

The coal in the Powder River Basin sits near the surface and is mined with giant trucks carrying shovels so big you can fit a large family inside. The scale of the operation is difficult to comprehend. “Our largest mine is roughly 90 square miles” said Shannon Anderson staff attorney at the Powder River Basin Resource Council an environmental group.

These mines grew and grew.

But any boomtown worker knows that kind of growth can’t last forever.

‘The economy just collapsed’

The year 2016 – that was the worst of it according to the mayor.

That was when the “economy just collapsed.”

“The energy industries always have been boom-and-bust but this was a big one” said Gillette Mayor Louise Carter-King who keeps an image of her father who also was mayor of Gillette hanging behind her desk. Her roots in the community are deep and her husband works in coal. From her office window you can see one of two coal-fired power-plants puffing smoke into the sky. “It was like a perfect storm because oil went down coal went down natural gas – everything.” The bust was caused primarily by lower natural gas and renewable energy prices less demand from coal-fired power plants which continue to close and concerns about climate-change regulations according to economists.

Most of the coal mined near Gillette sits on public land meaning that the state government collects royalty payments and other taxes on its production. Wyoming doesn’t have a state income tax and its property and sales taxes are notoriously low. Many years well over half of the state’s tax revenue comes from the coal oil and gas industries.

After the bust Carter-King said she knew Gillette would have rethink everything.

Gray told me that his call to CNN was influenced by how things fell apart with the oil and coal industries shortly before and after 2016 the year US voters elected President Donald Trump – who’d promised to bring back “beautiful clean coal.” Nearly 90% of Campbell County residents voted for Trump again in 2020. But you won’t find too many people in Gillette who believe Trump kept his promises to coal workers – or that it was even possible to keep them.

Wyoming coal production peaked in 2008 at 468 million short tons according to the US Energy Information Administration. By 2016 it was 297 million tons creeping down to 277 million in 2019 nearing the end of Trump’s term. Last year’s figures are not yet available but the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact on demand for energy is known to have contributed to widespread collapse in the energy industry.

Gray says he was laid off from an oil field job in 2015 then subsequently from another job in oil and then one in coal last year. His wife left him shortly after the first layoff he said.

These days Gray is working again driving railroad workers to and from job sites – part of a broader industry that supports the mines and fossil fuels. (Mayor Carter-King estimates most people’s jobs in Gillette are linked to coal and other fossil fuel industries – whether directly or indirectly). But Gray said that he’s eaten through his savings.

My “bank accounts were drained – lost my house all the repossessions” he said.

“It was tough.”

He’s living on the razor-thin margins of a bust economy.

‘The coal industry’s on its last leg’

Here’s an inconvenient truth: Towns like Gillette tend to fail.

I asked economists environmentalists and policy experts. None could provide a sunny case study – the story of a town whose main industry didn’t take the initiative to remake itself.

“There’s not a sterling example” said Jake Higdon a senior US climate policy analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund who has contributed to several reports on fossil fuel communities.

Timber towns auto towns military town mining towns – the logical progression is toward “ghost town” status if the town isn’t big enough or industries aren’t diverse enough.

In even trying to rebuild then Gillette aims to do something unprecedented.

That doesn’t mean it’s impossible. “Maybe our chances of remaking our community in a generation – so my kids have something to come back to – are 10%” said Ford the county consultant. “But I know if we don’t try the chances are zero.”

On a recent snowy morning I dropped by Lula Belle’s Café – “non-smoking as of 4/1/2020” – near the railyard in Gillette. It’s a welcoming chatty kind of place – fruit pies on display behind the diner counter. I wanted to learn whether people here were in denial about coal’s demise.

“Will the mines bounce back? No” said Doug Wood a retired coal miner with a mustache that’s twirls at the tips. “The coal industry’s kind of on its last leg.”

What’s next then?

“I don’t know if you’re familiar with a TV show called ‘The Jetsons?’”

I found that sentiment – the coal part not the Jetsons – to be a common refrain in Gillette. Frankly I was stunned by the degree to which the mayor county development officials and people like Gray accept the unsettling facts of coal’s decline.

Phil Christopherson CEO of Energy Capital Economic Development a local non-profit that’s funded by industry as well as city and county government told me that he hopes children who are growing up in Gillette 50 years from now won’t even know that this was a coal town.

“It’s going to be a tough transition for this community” Christopherson said “and we’re doing our best to prepare for that so we still have a community here in five 10 or 50 years.”

Carbon Valley

Yet Gillette remains conflicted.

While claiming it wants something new local and state leadership continues to push coal products and technologies – many of them expensive and unproven – as the future.

You’ll hear some people calling Gillette “Carbon Valley” – as in the Silicon Valley of coal. Coal research they say is what’s next. As are new and supposedly cleaner uses for coal.

One such project called the Wyoming Integrated Test Center or ITC sits at the base of a coal-fired power plant – painted blue and white as if it might blend into the sky.

Jason Begger the project’s managing director told me to think of the site as an “RV park” for researchers interested in capturing carbon-dioxide pollution from the power plant and doing something else with it – potentially “sequestering” the gas deep in the rock underfoot.

The idea is that if most of that CO2 pollution is captured and stored away somewhere coal can keep burning because it wouldn’t contribute heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere. It’s reasonable to place some hope in the technology given the fact that carbon pollution needs to reach “net zero” by about 2050 in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. But carbon-capture and storage has proven to be costly and troublesome compared to alternatives.

Begger told me the world needs to recalibrate its expectations.

“I have a 2-year-old daughter and it’s kind of like saying ‘Well in 20 years she’ll be in the Olympics” he said. “We [would] have to see if she can crawl and walk” before signing her up for the Olympics.

The state has been trying coal-spending technology for years said Anderson the environmentalist with little to no results. She says she remains “very skeptical” of it – as do I.

Wyoming meanwhile also has some of the nation’s greatest potential for wind energy according to the American Clean Power Association an industry group. PacifiCorp the massive power company that is retiring some of its coal power plants in Wyoming recently opened a large wind farm – 520 megawatts enough to power about 150000 homes according to Laine Anderson the company’s director of wind operations – about an hour-and-a-half drive south of Gillette.

Yet Wyoming is a rare state that also taxes wind power – rather than incentivizing its production as a much-needed clean energy source.

“Wyoming’s leaders have done little to pivot our state’s economy away from this volatile industry” the Casper Star-Tribune’s editorial board wrote of coal in 2019.

Just transition

Perhaps Gillette is less a place of contradictions than one of surprises.

Steve Gray lives in a small apartment complex near the highway. He answered the door on a recent blizzardy morning wearing a denim pearl-snap shirt and fuzzy red slippers.

After his layoffs from the oil and coal industries he lost the house he shared with his ex-wife and son who is now 25. For a while he moved back in with his father. But now here’s here and when he welcomes you in you can feel the pride he takes in the place.

On the living room walls are the portraits he’s taken with his son an oil field worker in a community south of Gillette and Steve’s grandchildren. In these photos Steve wears his trademark cowboy hat a broomstick mustache and a contented grandfather’s grin.

Nearby you’ll find the military honors – a Purple Heart and Bronze Star – bestowed on his elder relatives. Gray says he too served in the Navy and he values service to country.

It’s hard to talk here about a “just transition” for fossil fuel workers – as if any transition for workers in dying US industries ever has been “just.” Jason Walsh executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance which aims to unite labor and environmental interests around the issue of a transition for dislocated fossil fuel workers told me there’s no justice in what happened to auto workers or timber workers – or in what’s happening to fossil fuel workers now.

“We are insisting that policy makers pay attention” Walsh said. “It is not acceptable to leave any workers or any communities behind. We have an obligation to fulfill to workers and communities that have powered this country for generations and have often paid a very stiff price in terms of the health of their environments and their people and their workers.”

I agree with that sentiment. In seeking a transition away from fossil fuels – which again is required by science if we want to continue living on a habitable planet – we must learn from the mistakes of the past. That’s the only way America can inch closer toward justice.

Among history’s lessons according to Walsh: The investments must be bigger than before.

Walsh advised the Obama administration on a grants program – called the POWER+ Plan – that aimed to help diversify the economies of coal towns in the Appalachian Mountains.

That program and others failed to fully address the full needs of these communities according to policy experts I interviewed. But there’s a consensus emerging on what’s needed now including: job retraining community college investments wage replacement healthcare extensions pension extensions – and jobs that help repair land scarred from decades of intensive mining. Advocates are smartly in my view pushing the White House to create an office focused on this economic transition – assisting fossil fuel communities and creating new jobs according to advocates involved in these efforts.

Colorado recently took a step in this direction by creating an Office of Just Transition. Wyoming and other fossil-fuel states should do the same. And importantly it would be wise of the Biden administration to make good on its campaign promises to fight climate change aggressively – getting to “net zero” emissions as soon as possible – while also creating jobs.

Their focus should be on struggling towns like Gillette.

Listening to them – and helping – could be both a political and moral victory.

Wyoming is a state as red as they come.

President Joe Biden and the Democrats who now control Congress could earn respect if not votes for telling coal country the truth – that coal must be phased out of the national energy mix but that workers will not be left behind. That means they should get job training health care wage replacement and when possible jobs in the new industries that are popping up to replace fossil fuels. This suite of policy solutions is complex but they must be taken seriously and the discussion must forward the voices of fossil-fuel workers. Workers need to know that climate advocates respect and support them before we can move forward.

This requires risk.

It requires trust.

That’s something Gray showed when he reached across cultural lines to call CNN.

“I figured well yeah I’m going to call. I’ll never get any return but it’ll make me feel better you know?” Gray said. “I just – I’m kind of glad that you guys did contact me.”

The Biden administration should answer the call too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9hbGliYWJhLWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGUtb2YtdGhlLXdlZWstbWluaS1lbGVjdHJpYy1waWNrdXAtdHJ1Y2stcGlja21hbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Awesomely weird Alibaba electric vehicle of the week: $4000 electric pickup truck,"Alibaba is one of the best places around to find the coolest and sometimes weirdest electric vehicles in the world. As part of a new series known as Awesomely weird Alibaba electric vehicle of the week we’re taking a look at some of our favorites.

This week’s feature is a small-yet-mighty electric pickup truck designed for utility and off-road usage though it may even be street legal as an NEV in the US.

If the proportions look at bit odd on this electric pickup truck that’s because they are.

It’s a mini-truck and its specs are mini too.

We’re talking 12-inch wheels an intimate two person cab and a payload capacity of 500 kg (1100 lb) in the 1.6 m (5’3″) long bed .

But while it may be small this is still a fully functional truck. The bed doesn’t just have a tailgate the sides fold down as well to transform into a flat bed. The cab has all the basic automotive accoutrements you’d expect such as a radio air vents (A/C costs extra) windshield wipers adjustable seats manual locks/windows and three-point seat belts for safety. There’s even a 64L (2.3 cubic feet) frunk up front!

This isn’t just a glorified golf cart it’s a small yet well-equipped utility vehicle.

I chatted with Reyna Zoe from the company who shared with me the more detailed spec sheet.

The best price she could offer me was US$3950 for the standard model or US$4880 for the extended cab model that comes with four seats larger 13-inch wheels and a few other upgrades including power steering electric locks/windows and even a child safety lock.

As helpful as she is I’ve been waiting days for a shipping quote to my nearest port in the US (Reyna explained to me that they unfortunately don’t offer door-to-door shipping as an option). I’m guessing we’re going to be looking at somewhere around US$1000 to US$1500 in shipping charges though these can vary wildly.

All told even if the total price breaks US$5000 that’s not bad for what looks like a nice little utility truck. And if you think about how much the cost of gas and diesel adds up for farmers or construction workers who use utility vehicles every day this price might actually make sense.

And even for the rest of us it looks like fun little runabout. Don’t believe me? Check out the seller’s video below and try to tell me that doesn’t look like fun!

Keep in mind though that this is an NEV (Neighborhood Electric Vehicle) and thus has a max speed of just 40 km/h (25 mph). The 4 kW motor providing rear-wheel drive is geared low for torque not speed.

This isn’t for cruising the highway it’s for getting local errands done or cruising around a job site. You aren’t going to be hauling a dozen bags of cement in a golf cart but you could in this little thing.

And it even has decent range at 120 km (75 miles) from its 72V and 7.2 kWh battery pack.

As you might have guessed the truck uses old-fashioned lead acid batteries. The weight savings alone from li-ion batteries would likely boost the range significantly though they’d also boost the price as well.

If the truck looks familiar to you then you might be recognizing it as the Pickman a Chinese electric mini-truck we’ve covered before.

I’m not sure if this listing is the same truck being resold on Alibaba or if they are just playing fast and loose with copyright laws regarding the Pickman’s photos.

If it is this would be a much cheaper way to get yourself a Pickman electric truck. They are actually currently being sold in the US but start at $10k for the base model. They are even street legal as Low Speed Vehicles (LSVs) on public roads posted up to 35 mph.

CGTN did a piece on the Pickman truck in LA which you can see below.

As you can see the little truck actually seems to be decently capable despite its small stature.

While this isn’t going to replace a Cybertruck or electric F-150 it could be an interesting little utility EV for work sites and transport jobs that don’t need the power speed and payload capacity of a full-size EV truck.







Shopping on Alibaba – is it safe?

I’m something of an Alibaba junkie. I’ve made a few dozen purchases on the platform not to mention several hundred purchases on the more retail-focused AliExpress platform.

It’s a great to place to find weird interesting and awesome products at weird interesting and awesome prices.

To ease your worried mind they hold your money in escrow and offer trade assurance to make interactions safer. I’ve rarely had an issue with an order. The few times I’ve had problems I’ve almost always gotten all or most of my money back.

However none of this should be taken as an endorsement of Alibaba or this product itself. While it’s fun to window shop through Alibaba like this and find the most interesting niche electric vehicles out there the ordering process requires a combination of finesse patience and courage. You have to be very clear in communicating what you want to ensure that you and the seller are on the same page and that you receive what you’re expecting.

There’s also inevitably going to be a number of fees thrown on top by the time the product reaches you even if you’ve agreed with the seller on door to door shipping paid upfront.

Shopping on Alibaba especially for large purchases is not for the faint of heart. But it can be quite rewarding when you find interesting products at rock bottom prices.

Joseph Chu from ThePickman in Rancho Cucamonga California reached out to us about this truck and gave us some more background info.

ThePickman handles international imports of the Pickman truck. When they import it it comes with all relevant DOT/LSV/L7e components that make it street legal if you want to operate it on public roads. He warned that buying directly from a local reseller via Alibaba means you likely won’t get these components.

The pricing from a local reseller on Alibaba also likely doesn’t cover associate fees such as “fees to get the vehicle packed get it to port prep container ocean freight as well as relevant importation and duties for whichever country the vehicle maybe exported to.”

These are all good things to be aware of. If you want to order a Pickman electric truck like this in the US you can check out the US importer’s site for help.

The smallest model the VF31 will be the first to go on sale (at first only in Vietnam) with up to 200 horsepower a 42 kWh battery pack and a claimed range of up to 300 km (186 miles). The larger VF32 will go on sale in about a year’s time with up to 400 horsepower and a 90 kWh battery pack.

Along with the VF32 VinFast will also launch the VF33 at the same time and it will have similar power levels and an even bigger 106 kWh battery pack that will give it a range as high as 550 km (342 miles) on a single charge according to the manufacturer.

Based on what we understood from the official press release (translated from Vietnamese into English) the VF31 only seems destined to be sold locally in Vietnam. The larger VF32 and VF33 however will go on sale in Vietnam in September of this year (first deliveries expected in February 2022) but the company will apparently begin accepting orders from the US Canada and Europe starting in November of this year with first deliveries pegged for June 2022.

Two rounds are complete the cut has been made and the survivors are set to start Moving Day at the 2021 American Express. Here’s what you need to know to watch the third round.

Previewing American Express Round 3

In Thursday’s opening round in California Tony Finau set himself up for success with a four-under 68. On Friday Finau positioned himself for a shot at the title. The long-hitting 31-year-old Tour pro fired a near-flawless round of six-under 66 in the second round on the Nicklaus Tournament Course leaving him just one shot off the lead heading into Round 3.

If Finau wants to take over the lead on Saturday one player he will need to get by is Sungjae Im. Im captured his first Tour win at the 2020 Honda Classic in what was a breakthrough year for the 2018-19 Rookie of the Year. Im is backing up that success this week shooting 68-65 to take a one-shot lead over Finau Nick Taylor Abraham Ancer Si Woo Kim and first-round leader Brandon Hagy all of whom find themselves at 10 under.

Another player to look out for on Saturday is Francesco Molinari. Molinari (nine under) is looking to get back to the form that won him the 2018 Open and led him to the top of the game.

Finau has made $20.8 million in his tour career. That ranks him 79th all time on tour. However only one golfer with just one PGA Tour win has earned more: Louis Oosthuizen who has $22.4 million in earnings on the PGA Tour with only the 2010 Open Championship victory.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvZmlyc3QtZXZlci0zNi1ob2xlLWN1dC1hbWVyaWNhbi1leHByZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which stars won't be playing this weekend at The American Express?,"LA QUINTA Calif. – As Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler exchanged pleasantries on the first tee Friday before their second round at the American Express they both looked at the big scoreboard which showed the cut line currently at -3.

They smiled at each other and talked about how they both had work to do to get to that mark.

It was an unusual conversation for the desert’s PGA Tour event. Not because they were talking about the cut but because they were doing it on a Friday.

This marked the first time in the event’s 62-year history that the cut happened on a Friday. While a 36-hole cut is normal at most PGA tournaments it’s a novelty at this event and it is happening this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The American Express: Leaderboard | Tee times TV | Photos

Normally this event is played at three courses. Every pro plays one of those courses on Thursday Friday and Saturday and then the cut is made after 54 holes. This year as a safety measure La Quinta Country Club was eliminated from the tournament.

For the record the cut actually came in at 4-under and Fowler who started the day at 1-over made the cut with a fine 66 on Friday to move to 5-under for the event. Mickelson wound up being one of the notable pros to miss the cut firing a remarkable round of 72 that featured 18 pars to stay at 2-over for the tournament.

Mickelson is not alone. Several big-name players did not survive to play the weekend:

Patrick Reed

At No. 11 in the Official World Golf Ranking Reed was the highest-rated player in the field to miss the cut. He shot a 4-under 68 on Thursday but started his round on Friday with back-to-back bogeys. He reached 4-under again with a couple of birdies but it all came crashing down with a triple bogey on the 17th hole at the Nicklaus Tournament Course. He finished at 1-under overall.

Brooks Koepka

The No. 12-ranked player in the world was playing this event for the first time and it looked like he was well on his way to making the cut after birdieing four of his first five holes Friday after an even-par opening round. But his round was derailed with a triple-bogey six on the par-3 13th hole at the Pete Dye Stadium Course. He finished the day and the tournament at 1-under.

Kevin Na

Won the Sony Open last week but couldn’t continue his momentum. He finished at even par for the tournament and will miss the weekend.

Others missing the cut include former champions Bill Haas (-3) Pat Perez (-3) Jason Dufner (-2) Brian Gay (-2) Hudson Swafford (+3) and Steve Jones (+9).

John Augenstein the talented college player who was making his PGA debut did not make it to the weekend. He shot a pair of even-par 72s to fall four strokes short.

The third playing partner in the Mickelson-Fowler group was the highest-ranked player in the field Patrick Cantlay who is currently No. 10 in the world ranking. He was one of the players who escaped the cut qualifying on the number with a 4-under.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZ2F0b3VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbGF0ZXN0LzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvaG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLTIwMjEtdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3Mtcm91bmQtMy1saXZlLXNjb3Jlcy1saXZlLXN0cmVhbS10ZWUtdGltZXMtdHYtdGltZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to watch The American Express Round 3: Tee times live scores live stream TV times - PGA TOUR,"Copyright © 2024 PGA TOUR Inc.

There wasn’t much sunshine in the desert Saturday but the birdies and eagles were still vividly on display.

By the end of Saturday's third round three players were tied for the lead at The American Express but they were just three of eight players who held at least a share of the lead at some point on a cool and gray day that saw the final groups finish play in a gentle rain.

Tony Finau Si Woo Kim and Max Homa all reached 15-under 201 and will share the final pairing Sunday on the Pete Dye Stadium Course at PGA West. But 19 players will begin Sunday’s round within four shots of the lead players ranging from non-winners like Cameron Davis to veterans like Rory Sabbatini to major championship winner Francesco Molinari to Patrick Cantlay the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 10.

Scoring on the day was so low that the top 12 players on the leader board Saturday averaged a 66.7 score on smooth greens and with no wind meaning no one could break away from the chaotic pack.

“I've been driving it great on a lot of the holes where you're going to have a wedge or short iron in. I've been playing the par-5s really well because of that too” Homa said after a 7-under 65 the best round of the three leaders. “I've just been able to kind of put myself in a position to have good looks for birdie and I've been putting great so it's just something about these greens it feels like home.”

Finau and Kim each managed 67 Saturday Kim playing without a bogey and Finau overcoming a bogey and a double bogey for his 67. Richy Werenski looking for his second tour win in five months made one bogey and one eagle in carding a 65 and is alone in fourth at 14-under par. Tied at 13-under are Russell Knox who tied for the best round of the week with a 64 Brian Harman and Emiliano Grillo.

Overnight leader struggles

Not every golfer found a bushel of birdies on the day. Sungjae Im the overnight leader birdied his first two holes but then struggled with his driver and hit two approach shots into water on the way to a 1-over 73 and a 10-under total five back of the leaders.

Homa the 2013 NCAA individual champion when he was playing at the University of California who owns one tour victory in 2019 was like many golfers in the third round who shot low despite being caught up at one point or another by the demanding Stadium Course. For Homa it was a tee shot into a lake on the par-4 seventh hole that led to a double bogey his only big mistake of the day.

“I got the big numbers out of the way” joked Homa known not only for his game but his popular Twitter feed where he critiques amateur golf swings with brutal honesty. “I guess I made one but I only had 1-over par hole today which is great around here. It's great anywhere really. Just hitting a lot of good shots. I was a little bit cleaner overall today which was nice. Something to build on going into tomorrow.”

Finau a past Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup member of the United States is looking for his first win since the 2016 Puerto Rico Open. Finau had to overcome a three-putt bogey on the opening hole and later suffered a double bogey after hitting his tee shot into a lake on the tough par-3 13th hole. But he rebounded with three consecutive birdies starting at the 14th with none of the birdie putts longer than four feet.

“I just knew what I did wrong as soon as I made contact (on the 13th) so I was able to well sometimes it's not a terrible thing to hit a bad shot as long as you know what you did” Finau said. “So it actually helped me on the holes coming in. I was able to hit a lot of quality shots really close and I was able to finish off a solid round.”

Kim owns two tour victories the last being The Players Championship in 2017. But after working with his coach Claude Harman III earlier this month in the desert he feels his game is in shape to win again. Kim had perhaps the best chance to grab sole possession of the lead in the closing holes but he missed a 10-foot eagle putt on the 16th hole and settled for a birdie. He then parred the final two holes to complete his 67.

“I thought that I played good and (that) the shot and everything feels okay” Kim said. “But last two days I was putting pretty good but shot was much better (Saturday) than the last two days.”

Like the leaders Harman had to overcome a double bogey his on the par-4 ninth which dropped him out of an early share of the lead.

“It's one of those things you can make a bunch of birdies here but if you get just a little off on a tee shot or a little off on a second shot you can get yourself in a really precarious spot” Harman said. “That's what I did off the tee there and it sucks to make a 6 but I was happy coming back and making a 3 and a 4 on 10 and 11.”

For Homa a chance to keep making birdies Sunday perhaps under sunny skies puts a smile on his face.

“It will be fun. It's always fun playing around the lead. I'm just going to keep doing what I've been doing. I've been playing like this since (Mayakoba Championship in November) which feels good. It feels comfortable.”

UNCTAD says uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic’s evolution and the global investment policy environment will continue to affect FDI flows in 2021. For developing countries the prospects for 2021 are a major concern.

Global foreign direct investment (FDI) collapsed in 2020 falling 42% from $1.5 trillion in 2019 to an estimated $859 billion according to an UNCTAD Investment Trends Monitor published on 24 January.

Such a low level was last seen in the 1990s and is more than 30% below the investment trough that followed the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.

Despite projections for the global economy to recover in 2021 – albeit hesitant and uneven – UNCTAD expects FDI flows to remain weak due to uncertainty over the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The organization had projected a 5-10% FDI slide in 2021 in last year’s World Investment Report.

“The effects of the pandemic on investment will linger” said James Zhan director of UNCTAD’s investment division. “Investors are likely to remain cautious in committing capital to new overseas productive assets.”

Developed countries hardest hit

According to the report the decline in FDI was concentrated in developed countries where flows plummeted by 69% to an estimated $229 billion.

Flows to North America declined by 46% to $166 billion with cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) dropping by 43%. Announced greenfield investment projects also fell by 29% and project finance deals tumbled by 2%.

The United States recorded a 49% drop in FDI falling to an estimated $134 billion. The decline took place in wholesale trade financial services and manufacturing. Cross-border M&A sales of US assets to foreign investors fell by 41% mostly in the primary sector.

On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean investment to Europe dried up. Flows fell by two-thirds to -$4 billion. In the United Kingdom FDI fell to zero and declines were recorded in other major recipients.

But Europe’s overall FDI performance masks a few regional bright spots. Sweden for example saw flows double from $12 billion to $29 billion. FDI to Spain also rose 52% thanks to several acquisitions such as private equities from the United States Cinven KKR and Providence acquiring 86% of Masmovil.

Among other developed economies flows to Australia fell (-46% to $22 billion) but increased for Israel (from $18 billion to $26 billion) and Japan (from $15 billion to $17 billion).

Developing economies account for record share of FDI

Although FDI flows to developing economies decreased by 12% to an estimated $616 billion they accounted for 72% of global FDI – the highest share on record.

The fall was highly uneven across developing regions: -37% in Latin America and the Caribbean -18% in Africa and -4% in developing countries in Asia. FDI to transition economies declined by 77% to $13 billion.

While developing countries in Asia weathered the storm well as a group attracting an estimated $476 billion in FDI in 2020 flows to members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) contracted by 31% to $107 billion due to a decline in investment to the largest recipients in the subregion.

In terms of individual nations China was the world’s largest FDI recipient with flows to the Asian giant rising by 4% to $163 billion. High-tech industries saw an increase of 11% in 2020 and cross-border M&As rose by 54% mostly in ICT and pharmaceutical industries.

“A return to positive GDP growth (+2.3%) and the government’s targeted investment facilitation programme helped stabilize investment after the early lockdown” the report says.

India another major emerging economy also recorded positive growth (13%) boosted by investments in the digital sector.

Weak outlook for 2021 except for technology and healthcare

The report says that data on an announcement basis – on M&As greenfield investments and project finance – provides a mixed picture on forward trends and confirms the weak outlook for 2021.

“Greenfield project announcements in 2020 35% lower than in 2019 do not bode well for new investment in industrial sectors in 2021” the report says.

The decline in announced international project finance deals important for investment in infrastructure was more contained at -2% but the uptick in the last part of the year was largely concentrated in developed countries.

“For developing countries the prospects for 2021 are a major concern” Mr. Zhan said. Although FDI flows in developing economies appear relatively resilient in 2020 greenfield announcements fell by 46% and international project finance by 7% according to the report.

“These investment types are crucial for productive capacity and infrastructure development and thus for sustainable recovery prospects” Mr. Zhan added.

The report warns that “the far more limited capacity of developing countries to roll out economic support packages to stimulate investment in infrastructure will result in an asymmetric recovery of project-finance-driven FDI.”

UNCTAD expects any increases in global FDI flows in 2021 to come not from new investment in productive assets but from cross-border M&As especially in technology and healthcare – two industries affected differently by the pandemic.

“Although their investment activity slowed down initially in 2020 they are now set to take advantage of low interest rates and increasing market values to acquire assets in overseas markets for expansion as well as rivals and smaller innovative companies affected by the crisis.”

European companies are set to attract more than 60% of the technology deals in value terms but several developing economies are also seeing an increase.

India and Turkey are attracting record numbers of deals in IT consulting and digital sectors including e-commerce platforms data processing services and digital payments.

Some 80% of the acquiring firms are based in developed economies primarily in Europe but a few multinational enterprises from developing countries are active buyers.

South African investors for example plan to acquire stakes in healthcare providers across Africa and Asia. And Indian IT companies have announced a 30% increase in acquisitions targeting European and other markets for information technology services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L3BhbmRlbWljLXNoaXBwaW5nLWVjb25vbXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the pandemic has driven global shipping costs to record highs,"One year after the coronavirus pandemic first disrupted global supply chains by closing Chinese factories fresh shipping headaches are delaying U.S. farm exports crimping domestic manufacturing and threatening higher prices for American consumers.

While corporate America notched real gains over the last four years including lower taxes and a looser regulatory environment President Donald J. Trump routinely upset major chief executives. The Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol and the refusal of Mr. Trump and many congressional Republicans to recognize the election result was the breaking point culminating in many large companies condemning Mr. Trump and cutting off support for his allies in Congress.

But just because big business is at odds with the Republican Party doesn’t mean it’s ready to embrace every aspect of the Democratic agenda. With President Biden seeking to undo much of Mr. Trump’s legacy including some initiatives championed by big business chief executives are approaching the new administration with a mix of optimism and apprehension.

At the most fundamental level many executives appear grateful to move on from the Trump administration which routinely surprised companies with abrupt changes to trade policy immigration rules and more."

It will open Feb. 1 on the ground floor of the 15-story centerpiece building Falls Tower at Camperdown officials with the bank confirmed Friday.

It replaces the bank's ""Plaza"" branch that shut down at 101 North Main former site of the Charlotte-based bank's Greenville headquarters.

Bank manager Chip Spangler said he was excited about the new location. Standing at the branch’s South Main Street door Friday morning he gestured toward the sidewalk and estimated a thousand people walk by a day.

“This is going to be a really nice building” Spangler said. “Right next to Falls Park and with all the festivals.”

The bank's Upstate executive offices Merrill Lynch investment offices and mortgage department will be on the building's seventh and eighth floors.

Stacy Brandon the bank's Upstate South Carolina market president said in a statement that Bank of America has operated in the region for more than 100 years.

According to FDIC records Bank of America's $1.7 billion in deposits in Greenville County currently rank it fourth among banking institutions operating in the county. The county's biggest bank is Wells Fargo ($2.3 billion) followed by Truist ($2.2 billion) and TD Bank ($2.0 billion). Still Bank of America can boast the biggest Main Street presence with its name gleaming atop Falls Towers' southern and western facades.

""Our goal is to deliver a seamless experience for clients across all channels and this new location will ensure everyone living and working downtown has even greater access to our financial services"" Brandon said.

Owners of nearly 250 homes that use Ward drinking water have had to replace some or all of their pipes and some neighbors not yet affected worry they may be next several residents said.

Real estate agent Daniel Sallinger began managing the online page that started in March 2019 after he experienced the now-typical pinhole leaks which led to over $40000 in repair and replacement costs he said.

Sallinger with the help of a few others who went door to door have kept track of the homes affected and the list continues to grow he said. The confirmed 220-house count has more than doubled since the 100 publicly reported a year ago according to Sallinger's map.

All the Ward Cabot and Austin houses affected are on the Ward Water and Sewer System which started receiving calls regarding water leaks in January 2019 according to a Copper Water Pipe Failures report by the city.

The system gets its supply through the Lonoke-White Public Water Authority from Greers Ferry Lake. Several other systems use this water source: Austin Beebe Furlow Grand Prairie/Bayou Two Jacksonville and Mid-Arkansas Utilities Vilonia Water as well as Ward are all represented on the Lonoke-White board.

Ward Mayor Charles Gastineau said that the problems have been discussed at board meetings but to his knowledge no other areas are affected.

""There's lots of theories but you can't replicate the theory to say 'This is the cause'. That's the headache and frustration for not only the homeowner but for my administration and other administrations also"" Gastineau said.

'UNTIL IT HAPPENED TO ME'

Many residents attended a May 2019 town-hall meeting in Ward about the pipe problems and directed questions to Gastineau and Cabot Mayor Ken Kincade who did not return calls and messages left with his office Wednesday and Friday.

""There were a lot of people throwing ideas out that really didn't make much sense"" Sallinger said.

Kirk Hendrix a resident in south Ward on Apricot Drive heard about the leaks but didn't worry about it when he moved in about two years ago.

""I'd seen on Facebook people crying about the leaks and blah blah. I'm just thinking they're complaining until it happened to me"" he said.

The Ward water system checked pressures collected samples reviewed 25-years of data and created a list of affected houses in February of 2019 finding nothing that stood out as abnormal according to the city's report.

In March the state Health Department took pH levels and sample pipes for analysis and increased the frequency of lead and copper testing for the Ward system and the Lonoke-White Public Water Authority. The department contacted ""one of the leading researchers in the nation concerning water corrosion control"" according to the report. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also got involved.

All samples came back within the normal limits and under EPA guidelines according to the report.

In April 2019 the Health Department pasted a Facebook notification and mailed a leaflet to all Ward water system customers offering free lead and copper testing. Residents said they don't remember getting anything from the city about the concerns.

Gastineau maintains that the problem could lie with the three large privately owned pipelines -- the newest of which was added about four years ago.

The loss of the cathodic protection in one of those pipelines could lead to electricity leaching out and causing copper pipes to turn green and show pitting. This is also why pipe failure can happen when it's placed too close to a train track or tram line according to case studies in Construction Materials' June 2016 volume.

The Ward system tested for stray voltage and found stray DC voltage in March 2019 according to the city's report. Ward contacted Magellan Pipeline and Enbridge owner of Texas Eastern Pipeline to ask it to test the pipelines. Everything appeared intact and normal according to the city's report. Because these are interstate lines any request for an independent inspection would have to be made at the federal level Gastineau said.

Sallinger disagrees that electricity leaching is the problem because only a few areas around the newer pipeline are currently affected according to research he and other volunteers have done. Some homes affected did not see problems until they switched from well water to Ward water he said.

According to the residents' reports to Sallinger the homes having a lot of problems are both east and west of the pipeline. On the west side no homes on the Cabot water system -- which are between some affected houses on the Ward system -- have reported pinhole leaks.

Some researchers engineers and plumbers have said the problem could be pH imbalance settlement or the chemical treatment of the water. But Gastineau said if that was the case the whole Lonoke-White system should be affected and the city does not add any chemicals.

Sallinger paid for his own study in April last year from Secat Inc. research laboratory. The corroded pipe samples he provided from several homes were a mix of copper sulfate and copper oxide with traces of chlorine according to the test results Sallinger provided the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

The presence of chlorides and sulfates at the corrosion sites with traces of phosphorus indicated that chlorine and sulfur in the water were probably the cause of the corrosion according to the results.

The city continues to do the routine lead and copper testing required by the Health Department. It has no plans to do any more testing Gastineau said.

The last laboratory analysis showed the water quality of the Ward system was within the allowable limits of the National Drinking Water Regulations for Lead and Copper at 0.015 mg/L for lead and 1.3 mg/L for copper and in the 90th percentile for both according to a Health Department letter to the Ward system dated Aug. 13.

""There is not a generalized corrosion problem in the Ward system. The lead and copper results are low. We have checked these parameters for folks who have made a request and we will continue to do so. This has not shown any notable lead or copper corrosion. I do not know why an area of the Ward system has had pinhole leaks"" said Danyelle McNeil Health Department spokeswoman.

""We have quite a bit of sample results from the past but they don't identify a cause of some folks having the pinhole leaks"" she added. ""The monitoring results do not show any increase in overall corrosion in the system.""

Other cities around the country have experienced what appears to be the same or similar problem Gastineau said

""This phenomenon happens all over the country; it's not just isolated to us"" he said. ""I would love to point and say 'This is the cause and if you do this it won't happen again'. If someone could figure that out they'd make a whole lot of money.""

The mayor specifically referred to a 2004 Pinhole Leaks in Copper Plumbing report from the state housing department in Maryland. A state task force could not find the problem.

""...It is widely believed that there is no one cause; and there is no one solution"" the Maryland report states.

WHO'S PAYING?

Some homeowners have had expenses as high as $80000 related to the leaky pipes often finding their insurance doesn't pay for pipe replacement. Others said they've had trouble getting home insurance when this is already a known problem.

Homes affected were built from 1979 to 2018 and include those with slab foundations and crawl spaces according to the Facebook page and Sallinger.

Some residents around Mark Lynn Circle on the Ward system and near downtown have just recently reported problems to Sallinger. Gastineau said the city has not been made aware of some of these recent concerns.

Hendrix's house flooded in mid-January. The kitchen is gutted and all floors are ripped up amounting to $20000 so far and about $4000 out of his pocket. He said he noticed his hot water tank is rusted. His house is 6-8 years old he said.

Mary Johnson has owned her house in southeast Cabot on Bradley Drive for about a year and has had five leaks in that time she said. She had new hot-water pipes when she moved in and has had all those on the cold-water line replaced. She's out about $2250 after insurance she said.

""We have not gone longer than three months without a leak. Insurance does not pay for pipe replacement. Only for damage done to the house by the water"" Johnson said. ""Ward assured me that they have tested the water and that the water is good but I bought a reverse osmosis water filtration system just in case because that's exactly what they told the people of Flint Mich.""

Jake Sisson a real estate agent and resident has replaced some of his pipes and anticipates having to replace the rest because of future leaks he said.

Sisson and Sallinger said some other residents they've talked to simply can't afford repairs or to replace all their pipes at once. They said they worry about how the pipe problem will affect home values mortgages and insurance premiums. Several people have had their insurance canceled after they filed a claim Sallinger said.

On top of the thousands Sallinger had to shell out to replace the copper pipes with cross-linked polyethylene -- known as PEX -- his new hardwood floors and other damage to his Cabot home on Cherry Drive he said his dog Rio also became sick.

Rio a fluffy Pomeranian lost half his body weight and could barely walk. When Sallinger switched to giving him bottled water Rio regained full weight within a few months and is running around again.

Sallinger installed an activated charcoal filter after the pipes were replaced which makes him feel comfortable enough to drink his tap water again he said.

Other residents have installed this type of filter some 20 years ago. The pipes after the filtration system appear to be normal he said. Any pipes in use before this filter is installed could already be damaged though he said.

""We're following closely a house that was identified as having a filtration system installed approximately 20 years ago"" he said. ""The residents stated the supply line from outside the house to the filter system had developed a leak however [the pipes] after the filter are normal and leak free.""

Mayor Gastineau said he hates what's happening on numerous levels from the cost involved to the anxiety of homeowners who fear their homes could be next.

""That's frustrating on everyone's part"" he said. ""I don't believe it's a Ward water issue... We're not at fault to make a payout. That's what some people want; I've had conversations with several customers who want us to at least pay their deductible. We're ... not to blame and therefore can't expend taxpayer money.""

Gastineau said anyone experiencing problems should contact the city.",,,

Samsung is scouting two locations in and around Phoenix two locations in and near Austin and a large industrial campus in western New York’s Genesee County according to one of the people.

An important factor in whether Samsung moves forward with the expansion will be the availability of U.S. federal government incentives to offset those offered by foreign countries and cheaper costs in other parts of the world according to a person familiar with the matter.

The proposal comes as the U.S. weighs allocating billions of dollars in funding to grow U.S. chip manufacturing and reduce its reliance on Taiwan China and South Korea. New chip-making incentives were included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed in January although the measures have yet to receive funding.

Samsung’s proposed plant would employ up to 1900 people and aims to be operational by October of 2022 according to correspondence viewed by The Wall Street Journal between Samsung and the city manager of Goodyear Ariz. one of the places the company is considering. As is customary with large industrial projects the local Goodyear authorities are offering a range of incentives including tax breaks and infrastructure upgrades to lure the factory according to the letter.

The U.S. has historically not offered federal aid for chip plants. But the coronavirus pandemic highlighted how disruptions in the global supply chain could interrupt the flow of key ingredients needed to make vital technologies ranging from 5G smartphones to jet fighters and sparked U.S. interest in becoming more self-sufficient.

With the rise of the chip industry in Asia over recent decades the U.S. share of chip manufacturing has fallen to around 12% according to a Boston Consulting Group report last year.

It said significant new financial help would be needed for the country to reverse the trend.

Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Samsung’s move would follow last year’s blockbuster chip-making investment decision by rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC said it would build a plant north of Phoenix and in December bought land for the $12 billion project.

TSMC is a contract chip manufacturer meaning it makes chips according to others’ designs. Samsung has a contract chip-making business that would be the focus of its new U.S. plant but it also has an array of its own consumer products that use chips coming from its factories.

Samsung has had chip-making facilities in Austin since the 1990s and has expanded there over the years. The company bought additional land near its existing facilities last year according to local land records. Next week it is asking local officials to relocate a roadway near those facilities according to a City Council agenda. Discussions about development incentives for the project have appeared on agendas of public entities in Austin and the nearby city of Taylor.

Officials in Texas Arizona and New York either declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Bloomberg earlier reported Samsung was considering investing $10 billion or more in a facility in Austin.

A wave of new U.S. chip-plant developments add to changes taking place across the semiconductor industry.

Intel Corp. the U.S.’s leading chip maker has fallen behind foreign rivals and plans to outsource production of more of its most advanced chips to factories in Asia. Intel’s embrace of more outsourcing comes as competitors are chipping away at its dominance aided by chips that rival or exceed Intel’s in performance and rising stock prices that are spurring a spree of acquisitions.

Graphics-chip giant Nvidia Corp. is proposing to buy the British chip-design company Arm Holdings for $40 billion in what would be the largest-ever deal in the industry. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Analog Devices Inc. are poised to gain heft through their own megadeals on the horizon.

Samsung has largely sat out the rapid consolidation. Its leadership is in fresh disarray after the company’s vice chairman and de facto leader Lee Jae-yong returned to prison Monday following a Seoul appeals court’s retrial in a long-running bribery case. Mr. Lee the third-generation heir has been responsible for ultimately approving all major business decisions.

Matt Heinz an industry-leading mergers and acquisitions (M&A) expert joined Lockton today as a Partner in its Transaction Liability practice. Heinz will co-lead the group with Partners Josh Halpern Eric Ziff and Gaurav Sud (opens a new window) who joined Lockton last year as the firm sought to significantly bolster its transaction liability capabilities.

“For the last decade Matt Heinz’s name has been synonymous with transaction liability insurance for M&A professionals across the country” said Ron Lockton Chairman. “His addition to the leadership group of our practice signals to clients and prospects Lockton’s commitment to being the ‘go-to’ advisor for the M&A insurance needs of dealmakers everywhere.”

Heinz most recently served as a Senior Managing Director and Co-Practice Leader of Aon’s North American transaction liability team where he previously partnered with Halpern Ziff and Sud in building out a practice that facilitated the widescale adoption of insurance products that augment M&A deals. He brings over a decade of transaction liability insurance experience serving as both an underwriter and broker during his time in the industry. Prior to his career in insurance Heinz was a corporate attorney at Proskauer Rose.

“There is incredible momentum at Lockton right now and you can feel it” said Peter Clune CEO. “The strength of this group directly benefits our clients. This team will help attract world-class talent and provide our private equity and corporate clients and their advisors with expertise that will deliver best-in-class execution.”

Heinz is a frequent speaker at M&A and private equity events commenting on trends in the transaction liability insurance market as well as M&A processes and negotiation more broadly. He has a B.A. from William and Mary and a law degree from St. John’s School of Law.

“I am excited to be part of a growing Transaction Liability business at Lockton” said Heinz. “Joining an advisory platform with a global footprint that is uncommonly independent provides a tremendous opportunity to build a practice that meets client needs and supports deals of any size and scope.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZvbGV5LWJhY2tlZC1zcGFjLW5lYXJzLTczLWJpbGxpb24tZGVhbC13aXRoLWJsYWNrc3RvbmVzLWFsaWdodC1zb3VyY2VzLTIwMjEtMDEtMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Foley-backed SPAC nears $7.3 billion deal with Blackstone's Alight -sources,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/foley-backed-spac-nears-73-billion-deal-with-blackstones-alight-sources-2021-01-24/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZvbGV5LWJhY2tlZC1zcGFjLW5lYXJzLTczLWJpbGxpb24tZGVhbC13aXRoLWJsYWNrc3RvbmVzLWFsaWdodC1zb3VyY2VzLTIwMjEtMDEtMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

It could be a scam,"CNN Business —

Most people who buy things online just have to worry about their deliveries being delayed or never arriving. But some people are dealing with a different problem altogether: getting weird stuff like hair clippers face creams and sunglasses they never even ordered at all.

The Federal Trade Commission and cyber experts have been warning consumers about these deliveries which can be part of something known as “brushing” scams.

Here’s how these scams work: Third-party sellers on Amazon eBay and other online marketplaces pay people to write fake positive reviews about their products or do it themselves. To be able to post the reviews these so-called “brushers” need to trick the site into making it appear that a legitimate transaction took place. So they’ll use a fake account to place gift orders and address them to a random person whose name and address they find online. Then instead of actually mailing the item for which they want to post a review the brushers will send a cheap often lightweight item that costs less to ship.

Sending an item (even the wrong one) creates a tracking number and when the package is delivered it enables brushers to write a verified review. If you’re on the receiving end you usually aren’t charged for the purchase and your real account isn’t hacked — but you are left in the dark as to who is repeatedly sending the mystery packages. In many cases there’s no return address. You don’t need to worry that anything bad has happened to you or will happen to you if you get a package that might be part of a brushing scam experts say. But we all need to be concerned about the scams affecting reviews we rely on when buying products.

Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” Jen Blinn

Brushing scams reportedly took off on e-commerce sites in China around five years ago. They resurfaced in headlines last summer when all 50 states issued warnings about mysterious unsolicited packages of seeds that people across the nation received in the mail.

But it’s not just seeds. Unsuspecting recipients have also found boxes with goods ranging from dog pooper-scoopers to power cords to soap dispensers on their doorsteps.

Jen Blinn of Thousand Oaks California told CNN Business she has been receiving random packages since June including most recently a briefcase a backpack a hair straightener and a coffee-cup warmer.

“Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” she said. Blinn notified Amazon of the issue but a customer service agent “didn’t really understand what I was saying. She obviously didn’t know about it” she said. The agent looked at Blinn’s account and found nothing wrong with it.

Jen Blinn holds up some of the unusual items she received in Amazon packages. She didn't order these goods and doesn't know who sent them to her. CNN

It’s not illegal to send customers unordered merchandise. But “the [Federal Trade Commission] has long gone after marketers that use fake reviews” said David Vladeck a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and a law professor at Georgetown University.

Amazon says its policy prohibits sellers sending unsolicited merchandise to customers and that sellers can be removed from the site for doing so.

“Third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and we take action on those who violate our policies including withholding payments suspending or removing selling privileges or working with law enforcement” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Amazon would not say how how many brushing scams have been found on the site or how many sellers have been removed due to these scams.

An eBay spokesperson said in an email that brushing schemes “do not appear to be highly prevalent” on the site. It violates eBay policy to send unsolicited merchandise to customers or falsify reviews and can result in eBay restricting sellers’ accounts or suspending them from the site.

Experts also say it’s difficult to quantify the frequency of such scams because it can be hard for companies to know whether reviews are fake and scams often go unreported by consumers.

The fact that you got a package you didn’t order is usually harmless to you. The harm is to people who rely on reviews when deciding on a purchase said Chris McCabe a former policy enforcement investigator at Amazon tasked with stopping scams and fraud. He is now a consultant to sellers on the site.

The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews” Chris McCabe consultant and former Amazon policy enforcement investigator

“The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews because they might see 100 positive reviews and then there may only be 60 or 70 of them that are legitimate” he said.

The likelihood that a consumer will buy a product that has five reviews is 270% higher than the likelihood they will buy a product with zero reviews according to a 2017 report by Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center.

Some fake reviews are also being driven by Facebook groups where sellers offer buyers money if they write positive product reviews said McCabe. Amazon and Facebook should work together to crack down on these groups he said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company analyzes more than 10 million reviews every week to try to keep fake ones from being published and that it provides details of its investigations to social media companies “so they can stop these bad actors from abusing their platforms.”

A Facebook spokesperson said in an email that when the company is told of groups that may encourage fake reviews it reviews them and removes them if they violate its policies.

Unwanted sheets and Shiatsu massagers

For consumers the unexpected deliveries can be jarring. The packages Ashanté Nicole never ordered started arriving at her home in Fort Lauderdale Florida in 2019.

iPhone and portable car chargers. An iPad case. A heated shiatsu massage. A nail cleaning brush and a blow dryer. Sheets. A mattress cover. A floppy fish toy.

They didn’t have return addresses so Nicole wasn’t sure who was sending the packages. She reached out to Amazon to try to stop them from coming but they still keep arriving at her doorstep.

“It was just kind of a little bit concerning because I don’t know who has my information” she said. “I don’t know what they’re going to send me. Like they could send something illegal and then I’m in trouble because I didn’t know whoever that person was or what they were sending me.”

If you get merchandise you didn’t order it could mean that scammers have created an account in your name or taken over your account an FTC spokesperson said in an email. Scammers may have even created new accounts in other names tied to your address allowing them to post lots of seemingly-real reviews.

“We recommend keeping an eye on your online shopping accounts. If you spot activity that isn’t yours report it to the site right away and think about changing your password for that site” the spokesperson said.

There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” Ashanté Nicole

Nicole feels she has done all she can by alerting Amazon each time unsolicited packages from the retailer arrive at her doorstep.

“There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” she said.

Amazon declined to comment directly on Nicole and Blinn’s accounts but said if a customer receives a package that was unsolicited they should contact Amazon’s customer service team.

Nicole said she hopes Amazon will do more to stop brushing and ban sellers who participate in the scams.

“I just think they need to be a little bit more concerned with shutting those stores down and making sure those sellers can’t use the platform.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2lta2luLWZvdW5kZXItc2F5cy1jb21wYW55LWJlaW5nLXRyZWF0ZWQtdW5mYWlybHktZ29vZ2xlLWJhbi0yMDIxLTHSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3dpbWtpbi1mb3VuZGVyLXNheXMtY29tcGFueS1iZWluZy10cmVhdGVkLXVuZmFpcmx5LWdvb2dsZS1iYW4tMjAyMS0xP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wimkin founder says app store bans by Google and Apple are unfair,"Wimkin said its users spiked about 20% after the Capitol riots before Google removed the app.

Alternative social media network Wimkin enjoyed a spike of around 20% in new users in the 12 days between the Capitol siege and Monday when Google removed it from its app store said its founder.

Jason Sheppard told Insider it gained about 55000 new users breaking the milestone of 300000 users.

Now after Google and Apple both removed the app new users will have to download Wimkin directly from the company's homepage. That will make it more difficult to add users accustomed to app stores. But the social network doesn't plan to call it quits.

This acronym is used by traders to refer to stocks of seven of the biggest tech companies in the world.

The combined market capitalization of these stocks is about $7.9 trillion which is roughly 25% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 companies. To put things in perspective the combined market cap of these seven stocks is more than the GDP of Japan Germany or India which are the third fourth and fifth largest economies of the world respectively.

The Constituents

The stocks in the FANGMAN group are:

Facebook Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB)

Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX)

Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)

Buoying S&P 500 Performance: 2020 was a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to economic contraction worldwide due to disruptions to businesses and other activities. The stock market given its forward-looking approach weathered the setback and ended the year with gains.

For instance the S&P 500 Index ended 2020 at a record high and in the process generated a return of 16.2% for the year. The FANGMAN stocks played a big role int that as they outperformed the broader gauge:

Facebook: 33%

Amazon: 76.3%

Netflix: 67.1%

Alphabet: 30.9%

Microsoft: 42.5%

Apple: 82.3%

Nvidia: 129.3%

FANGMAN A Predictor of Stock Market Moves? Given the outsized weighting in different indices it is logical to view FANGMAN stocks as a good predictor of which way the broader market is headed.

FANGMAN Invariably Outperforms Market: For those investors who are looking for above-market returns or ""high-alpha"" stocks FANGMAN could be the better bet. These stocks outperform the broader market thanks to their transformational business models high growth and financial might among other things.

FANGMAN In Bubble Territory? From the perspective of topline growth earnings potential and prospects it is evident that the lofty valuations are justified. Higher P/E multiples of some of these stocks imply investors are willing to pay a premium to partake in their growth.

Investors see them as compelling as they are most levered to the digital transformation that is picking up pace.

But the stretched valuations of these stocks could conjure up fears of a deep correction.

One of the biggest risks faced by these companies is regulatory scrutiny. Analysts see the changing of the guard at the White House as a slight negative for these high-flying names.

Story continues

""To be blunt it's a clear negative for Big Tech as ultimately with a Senate now likely controlled by Democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around FAANG names with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a Jan. 6 note.

That said the analyst remains bullish on tech stocks for 2021 but sees the tech rally will be more tame until the Street gets a better sense of the legislative agenda under President Joe Biden.

Condo Q&A

Dear Poliakoffs

We have a small homeowner’s association with 27 homes. Our deed restrictions have been renewed and are valid. They provide for the following:

No freestanding sheds or out-buildings that are unattached from the main residence. Structures must be approved by the association particularly the architectural board prior to commencement of construction. Structures should match the architectural style and materials of the main residence.

Last year one of the residents erected two plastic sheds against his main residence. No plan was submitted at the time and no approval was given (nor would likely be since they are inexpensive plastic sheds not matching the residence.) The sheds have been in place for 12-24 months. The board of directors has not met to discuss the issue due to COVID and in addition the owner of the residence is one of the board members. He has threatened legal action if the board takes action and he has intimidated some of the board members.

The situation is made more complex by the existence of two free-standing sheds in the association. These have been discussed by the homeowners in past meetings and the consensus has always been that since they pre-date the formation of the association they are therefore “grandfathered.” No other sheds have been approved with the exception of those attached to the primary residence and built of similar materials and appearance as is required by the documents.

We have a few questions:

Does the existence of the sheds predating the association make the rule unenforceable? Since the plastic sheds have been installed for approximately two years does this make the deed restrictions unenforceable? If the BOD fails to enforce the rule in the instance of the two plastic sheds now does this make the deed restrictions unenforceable?

Signed M.M.

Dear M.M.

Homeowners may have two common defenses to covenant enforcement actions—selective enforcement and waiver. Selective enforcement is when a community ignores some open and obvious violations of a covenant or rule while enforcing other violations of that covenant or rule. Waiver is when a community has ignored all open and obvious violations of a rule for an extended period of time (usually longer than the statute of limitations) effectively giving up its right to enforce that restriction in the future.

It is unusual that your community had lots and homes before the deed restrictions were recorded as every existing lot owner would have had to approve them—and that rarely happens. However restrictions cannot be applied retroactively. So if you are in fact correct that these two sheds actually pre-date the restrictions their existence would not affect the ability of the association to now enforce the later-enacted restrictions and their existence would create neither a selective enforcement nor waiver defense. It is not uncommon for communities to amend their governing documents to restrict behaviors that are at the time allowed. While the existing sheds would not be able to be replaced the association would also not have the power to force them to be removed. But that would not give other owners the right to then install their own sheds in violation of your covenants and other rules and architectural controls.

I do not think that the passage of one or two years would prevent your association from enforcing its covenants. Ordinarily the statute of limitations for bringing a covenant enforcement claim is five years so you have plenty of time to pursue this violation. One question would be whether these sheds fall within the express prohibition against freestanding sheds (in which event they could not be approved under any circumstances) or whether given that they are adjacent to the home they might be considered “attached” and potentially approvable. I tend to think that these sheds are freestanding structures no matter where they sit and that they would not be allowed under any circumstances. If however they simply fall within the board-made architectural controls the next question would be whether your controls are specific enough to be enforceable pursuant to Section 720.3035 Fla. Stat. which provides that the association’s authority to review and approve structures or improvements to a parcel is enforceable only to the extent that “the authority is specifically stated or reasonably inferred as to such location size type or appearance in the declaration of covenants or other published guidelines and standards authorized by the declaration of covenants.” I think what you have is probably enough based upon your description of the rules and the sheds in question but ultimately that is a question for a judge or jury.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) will prioritise production of auto chips if it is able to further increase capacity Taiwan's Economics Ministry told Reuters amid a global shortage that has hampered car production.

A ministry official said Minister Wang Mei-hua spoke to senior company executives on Sunday about the issue.

TSMC had told the ministry it will ""optimise"" the production process of chips to make it more efficient and prioritise auto chip production if it is able to further increase capacity the ministry said.

TSMC the world's largest contract chipmaker stated that current production capacity is full but had assured the ministry that ""if production can be increased by optimising production capacity it will cooperate with the government to regard automotive chips as a primary application"".

TSMC in a statement to Reuters referred to comments from its Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei on an earnings call this month.

""Other than continuously maximising utilisation of our existing capacity Dr. Wei also confirmed in our investors' conference that we are working with customers closely and moving some of their mature nodes to more advanced nodes where we have better capacity to support them"" the company said.

Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is hampering its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The request was made in a letter from German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to Wang.

The ministry said it would wait until it had received the letter before deciding on whether to contact TSMC again. Automakers around the world are shutting assembly lines due to problems in the delivery of semiconductors which in some cases have been exacerbated by the former Trump administration's actions against key Chinese chip factories.

MANY CARMAKERS AFFECTED

The shortage has affected Volkswagen Ford Motor Co Subaru Corp Toyota Motor Corp Nissan Motor Co Ltd Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers.

The ministry told Reuters that it had received requests from both the United States and the European Union through ""diplomatic channels"" late last year as well as from Germany and Japan this year.

It said that in the second quarter of last year auto companies cut orders to TSMC which in turn shifted capacity to other clients but in the second half of the year demand for auto chips returned.

Story continues

""The Americans did express the expectation late last year"" the ministry said.

""At the moment everyone is talking to each other through diplomatic channels including TSMC. Everyone's hands are tied with orders but from the government's perspective we will try to help as much as we can for our important allies.""

A European Commission spokesman said there had been ""no specific discussions"" with Taiwan but that they were monitoring the auto chip shortage situation closely.

A senior official at Japan's Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry told Reuters Japan's auto manufacturers' association and TSMC were already in touch and the ministry has also reached out to Japan's de facto embassy in Taipei to ask for their support in those talks.

The official added that it is mainly a private-sector exchange so the government is limited in what it can do.

In 2020 auto chips accounted only for 3% of TSMC's sales lagging smartphones' 48% and 33% for high performance chips.

In the fourth quarter sales for TSMC's auto chips jumped 27% from the previous quarter but still only accounted for 3% of overall sales in the quarter.

A senior Taiwan government official familiar with the issue told Reuters there was not much they could do.

""They dropped their orders due to various reasons when demand was low amid the pandemic. But now they want to boost their production.""

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

""Les risques de cas secondaires autour d'un cas importé sont très faibles et les risques de propagation du coronavirus sont très faibles."" Est-ce une faute ou une erreur? La phrase prononcée par Agnès Buzyn alors ministre de la Santé le 24 janvier 2020 au sortir du Conseil des ministres il y a un an jour pour jour ce dimanche a en tout cas fort mal vieilli.

Immédiatement avant ce jugement qui a depuis volé en éclats devant la réalité d'une épidémie qui infecte le monde depuis douze mois et entrave la vie sociale de chacun Agnès Buzyn avait déjà lancé: ""Le risque d’importation de cas depuis Wuhan est modéré il est maintenant pratiquement nul parce que la ville est isolée.""

À sa décharge elle avait complété: ""Cela peut évidemment évoluer dans les prochains jours s’il apparaissait que plus de villes sont concernées en Chine ou plus de pays notamment des pays de l’Union européenne.""

""Notre système de santé est bien préparé""

Elle ne pensait hélas pas si bien dire. Quelques heures après cette prise de parole toujours ce 24 janvier le ministère de la Santé avait officialisé la présence sur le territoire français de ce virus qu'on a communément appris à nommer le Covid-19. On comptait alors trois cas répartis entre le CHU de Bordeaux et l'hôpital Bichat à Paris. L'une de ces trois personnes revenue d'un séjour à Wuhan ville chinoise berceau de la maladie allait mourir le 14 février suivant devenant le premier mort français du virus.

Le 21 janvier 2020 Agnès Buzyn avait déjà déclaré:

""Le risque d'introduction en France est faible mais ne peut pas être exclu d’autant qu’il y a des lignes aériennes directes"". ""Notre système de santé est bien préparé les établissements de santé ont été informés et des recommandations de prise en charge ont été délivrées"" ajoutait-elle.

Une affirmation battue en brèche quelques semaines plus tard: au printemps les hôpitaux ont commencé à faire face aux pires difficultés sous le coup de l'engorgement de leurs services et de la saturation des unités de réanimation.

Un optimisme de façade

Pourtant Agnès Buzyn n'allait pas tarder à revenir elle-même sur ce trop grand optimisme ou plutôt à expliquer qu'elle n'en avait jamais rien cru. Après avoir laissé son ministère à Olivier Véran le 16 février pour prendre la tête de la campagne municipale de La République en marche (LaREM) à Paris poussée par le renoncement de Benjamin Griveaux après la parution d'une vidéo intime elle allait arriver en troisième position au premier tour (une position qui sera confirmée au second tour le 28 juin). A la suite de cette première échéance électorale elle avait accordé un entretien au Monde.

""Quand j’ai quitté le ministère je pleurais parce que je savais que la vague du tsunami était devant nous. Je suis partie en sachant que les élections n’auraient pas lieu"" pouvait-on alors lire dans cette interview publiée le 17 mars. Elle appuyait encore: ""Depuis le début je ne pensais qu’à une seule chose: au coronavirus. On aurait dû tout arrêter c'était une mascarade."" Et son inquiétude n'était pas née en février selon elle mais dès la mi-janvier soit une dizaine de jours avant ses déclarations des 21 et 24 janvier:

""Je pense que j’ai vu la première ce qui se passait en Chine: le 20 décembre un blog anglophone détaillait des pneumopathies étranges. J’ai alerté le directeur général de la santé. Le 11 janvier j’ai envoyé un message au président sur la situation. Le 30 janvier j’ai averti Edouard Philippe que les élections ne pourraient sans doute pas se tenir. Je rongeais mon frein.""

La ""contraction du temps""

Il faut noter que le 23 septembre Agnès Buzyn entendue par la commission d'enquête du Sénat sur la gestion du Covid-19 a voulu dire son mot sur ces fameuses déclarations mettant les parlementaires en garde contre une ""contraction du temps"" qui ""rend des déclarations ou des décisions prises incompréhensibles pour le grand public à l'aune de ce que nous savons neuf mois plus tard"".

Agnès Buzyn a depuis quitté le paysage politique hexagonal. Elle a été nommée membre du cabinet du directeur général de l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) le 4 janvier dernier se démettant de son mandat de conseillère municipale du 17e arrondissement.

L'une des phrases de l'hématologue de formation a toutefois bien résisté à l'épreuve du temps. Elle se trouvait elle aussi dans l'interview au Monde en date du 17 mars. ""Il va y avoir des milliers de morts."" Près d'un an plus tard d'une crise économique et sanitaire inédite plus de 70.000 personnes ont succombé au coronavirus. Un chiffre terrible qui n'a de cesse de s'accroître.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was her supporting role in Grease however that would make Buckner a familiar face to millions of Americans. She landed the part of Patty Simcox the effervescent cheerleader who shared the screen with Olivia Newton-John.

Her memorable cheer was a rallying cry for fictional Rydell High School: “Do the splits give a yell! Show a little spirit for Old Rydell! Way to go red and white! Go Rydell fight fight fight!”

Though she continued to act in the 1980s Grease would remain her career-defining role.

After appearing in shows like The Love Boat and The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries and films including Police Academy 6: City Under Siege Buckner put show business on the back burner to raise her two children.

Knezevic Henao a 40-year-old Colombia native and naturalized U.S. citizen was reported missing Feb. 2 in Madrid according to Spanish police.

Friends and family previously told NBC News that she had relocated to Madrid amid a difficult separation from her husband David Knezevich who is originally from Serbia. They said she shared significant financial assets with him from their shared businesses.

After months of unanswered questions during which missing person notices blanketed streets in Spain Spanish police announced Monday that David Knezevich was arrested Saturday at Miami International Airport in connection with her disappearance.

The investigation was carried out by the Belgrade Interior Attache Office FBI agents in Florida Police of Colombia and Spanish Police.

He has been charged with kidnapping by federal agents according to a complaint filed Friday in the Southern District of Florida. However the complaint did not detail what may have happened to Knezevic Henao.

Man believed to be David Knezevich spray painted camera at wife's Madrid apartment — and left with a suitcase

David Knezevich was considered a suspect in his wife's disappearance after a man who resembled him spray painted the security camera in her Madrid apartment building a car he rented in Serbia was tracked down to her street and after suspicious texts sent from her phone were tracked back to him.

According to a criminal complaint filed by the FBI Knezevic Henao had traveled from Miami to Madrid on Dec. 26 2023. Then on Feb. 2 her friends and family lost contact with her.

She was not formally named in the filing but described as the wife of David Knezevich. She was still married to him at the time but friends and family said they were separated and planning to divorce.

“The separation was contentious because Knezevich did not want to split the marital assets evenly with the victim” the complaint said. “The victim was very fearful of Knezevich and believed that he was surreptitiously monitoring her whereabouts.”

Knezevic Henao was last seen alive entering her apartment building in Madrid at 2:20 p.m. on Feb. 2 according to Spanish authorities citing security cameras.

That same day at 9:27 p.m. the building’s surveillance camera captured “a male wearing a helmet enter the building at the same time some individuals were exiting.” Once inside he was seen holding a can of spray paint and painted the lens of the camera. Despite the paint the lens was not totally obscured and the man was seen fastening duct tape to the lock of the building the complaint said.

The man looked at the camera and his physical characteristics resembled David Knezevich the complaint said.

The man was seen again at 10:30 p.m. this time leaving the elevator with what appeared to be a suitcase.

Missing items a Serbian car rental and stolen license plates

Two days later Spanish firefighters entered Knezevic Henao's apartment for a welfare check. A law enforcement search found that her cell phone laptop and chargers were missing.

Spanish police used the surveillance footage at the apartment to identify the brand of spray paint used to obscure the camera and found a store in Madrid that had sold that same brand on Feb. 2. Surveillance footage from the store showed a man “who appeared to be David Knezevich purchasing the spray paint can” as well as two rolls of duct tape on Feb. 2 around noon the complaint said.

A Peugeot 308 car that David Knezevich had rented in Belgrade Serbia was tracked to Knezevic Henao's street in Madrid.

He had rented the Peugeot from an agency for the time period of Jan. 29 through March 15. He had traveled out of Serbia by car on Jan. 30 and he returned to Belgrade by car on or about Feb. 5 the complaint said.

The owner of the rental car agency told law enforcement that when he returned the car the windows had been tinted the license plate frames changed and two stickers removed from the vehicle.

The car had also travelled 7677 kilometers while rented by Knezevich. The complaint noted that it's a 26-hour 2592 kilometer drive from Belgrade to Madrid.

Around his time a person in Spain had reported that both of his license plates were stolen off his vehicle. When authorities ran a search in their plate reader database they found it on Calle Francisco Sivela — the street where Knezevic Henao's apartment was located.

That stolen plate had passed through two toll booths in the middle of the night of Feb. 2 and into Feb. 3. Video footage from the booths showed the plates were attached to a Peugeot 308 with tinted windows — matching the description of David Knezevich's rented car. However due to the tint the driver was not visible.

A suspicious text and impersonating calls to cancel insurance

At the time of Knezevic Henao's disappearance she had reportedly sent a text to a friend on Feb. 3 claiming to have met a man. She said she was going to his home two hours away from Madrid warning that she'd have spotty cell service.

The FBI complaint revealed that a Colombian woman who met David Knezevich on a dating app told law enforcement that on Feb. 3 he asked her on WhatsApp to help translate messages into “perfect Colombian.” He claimed it was for a friend in Serbia who was writing a script about a Colombian character.

He asked her to translate the line: “I met someone wonderful. He has a summer house about 2h from Madrid. We are going there now and I will spend a few days there. There is barely any signal though. I’ll call you when I come back. Kisses” according to the complaint.

He then asked her to translate: “yesterday after therapy I needed a walk and he approached me on the street! Amazing connection. Like I never had before” according to the filing.

At some point in their connection the woman told her mother she met a Serbian man online. The mother searched up his surname on Google and learned that his wife was reported missing in Madrid. The woman then discovered a news article that contained a message purportedly sent by David Knezevich’s wife that matched the exact wording of the text she had helped translate.

The complaint also said other evidence came into play surrounding the couple's businesses.

NBC News previously found three corporations registered under the couple’s names in Florida — EOX Technology Solutions Inc. Registered Corporate Agents LLC and EOX Capital LLC — all of which provide technology and other types of support for South Florida businesses.

On March 4 a woman claiming to be Knezevic Henao contacted an insurance company to cancel three insurance policies held for her and her husband's business. During the call children were heard in the background though Knezevic Henao does not have any children. Later law enforcement learned the number was owned by David Knezevich’s company and he was listed as the contact for the phone number.

Then on April 24 an employee of David Knezevich told law enforcement that he instructed her to impersonate Knezevic Henao “in order to open a new bank account” and provided the employee with Knezevic Henao's social security number to use as proof. The next day the employee told David Knezevich she was uncomfortable impersonating Knezevic Henao because she was missing but he allegedly told her it was “not serious” and it needed to be done for employees to be paid. David Knezevich further allegedly stated “I cannot call with my voice because I sound like a guy.”

Online court records show David Knezevich made his initial court appearance Monday and was ordered to temporary pretrial detention. He's due back in court for a pretrial detention hearing on Friday.

NBC News has reached out to an attorney listed for Knezevich and FBI Miami for comment.

The investigation into Knezevic Henao's disappearance is ongoing.

Feature generation for time-series data can be time-consuming. However many of the techniques/features we want to generate for time-series data are well known and standardized. With tsfresh you can automatically calculate a large number of these known time series features effortlessly. It even has built-in methods to evaluate the feature importance of the generated features. The entire project is opensource and you can view the repo on GitHub.

Using tsfresh is fairly simple. The API is very clean you just describe the features you want from their exhaustive list of available features and ask tsfresh to extract them. However at the start of exploration it is very common to not know the kind of features you want. So tsfresh also ships feature extraction settings pre-built. I will describe a few of them below:

ComprehensiveFCParameters: For processing with all the time-series features available. Useful when you don’t know which features you need.

MinimalFCParameters: Contains a very small and basic set of time-series features (min max standard deviation and so on). Useful for setting up a quick test before kicking your pipeline off.

EfficientFCParameters: Contains all the features that are not of high computation time. Useful if you have a really large dataset and have no way to process the comprehensive set of features.

Below is a code snippet of how you would use one of these settings to extract time-series features on your dataframe.

import pandas as pd

from tsfresh.feature_extraction import extract_features

from tsfresh.feature_extraction import ComprehensiveFCParameters df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/file.csv')

settings = ComprehensiveFCParameters()

features_df = extract_features(df default_fc_parameters=settings)

Once you have processed enough data you can apply different techniques to understand the importance of the features. Once you know the features you want you can “hand-write” the settings you want to extract from your dataset. There is also a handy trick to go from column names to settings using the from_columns function. Below is a code snippet of how this would work.

from tsfresh.feature_extraction.settings import from_columns # fictions function to get top features from your dataset

top_features_column_names = features_df.get_top_features() # get the config for the selected columnsconfig = from_columns(top_features_column_names) # get selected features for another dataframe

selected_features_df = extract_features(another_df column_id = 'id' kind_to_fc_parameters = config)

In the case of this competition I first processed the training dataset with ComprehensiveFCParameters. Then I removed columns that are highly correlated and quasi constant and generated custom settings to process the test set. More details on this are given in the next section. Note that lightGBM will not accept the column names generated by tsfresh because they often have the minus sign (-). You have to write a small function to match the names between the two.

Data Processing Details

This competition provides ten minutes of seismic sensor readings and a time to erupt for each segment. In the training dataset we have 4231 segments and in the test dataset we have 4520 segments. We need to predict the time to erupt for each segment of test data. For each segment we have 60000 data-points (for 10 minutes); so we have good quality and high-frequency data.

As some features are very computation heavy for each segment I divided the data points into 6 batches (10000 data-points per batch). I could have also down-sampled the total number of data points and that would be more conventional but I wanted to go with the non-conventional.

Figure: Data Processing Flow (Image by Author)

At present we have 2854 features for our dataset. At first I processed all the possible features of the training dataset (ComprehensiveFCParameters). This generated almost 8000 features. Then I removed highly correlated columns and quasi-constant features. This brought our features down to 2854. I also applied a recursive feature elimination to take the top 501 features (500 seemed too goodie-to-shoe of a number). These columns are hard-coded in this notebook. The full dataset is also uploaded as a public dataset on Kaggle and you can view it from the following link:

Model Architecture

For predicting the time of an eruption I used a tree-based learning algorithm with the lightGBM (LGBM) framework. It has been a go-to framework for many people on Kaggle and this was also my starting point. At first I used a vanilla lightGBM model using the top features; and it yielded decent results. From here the most common method to improve my result could be creating more models with algorithms and averaging the results. However in a real-life production model a blend of multiple models is difficult to manage. So instead of mixing multiple models I decided to do something a little different.

For improving my results I created two layers of lightGBM models. I call this a generalized-specialized layering. At first a single model is used for making an initial prediction on the full dataset. Then on the second layer I trained multiple models. These models are more specialized as they are trained with data from a specific range of time to eruption. To deal with a greater degree of error from the first model I created overlaps between the ranges of the second models. One last bit of trivial detail I am also using a min-max scaling to scale our data before fitting it to get the best performance.

For predicting the test data the model from the first layer is used first to make an initial prediction. Based on this prediction we use a specific model of the second layer to make a more accurate prediction. As we have overlaps in the time to eruption ranges it can be that a single test segment is evaluated by two models. Finally we have six outputs or predictions for each segment in our test dataset. We then take the median of these outputs to get our final predicted time to erupt. I tried to visualize this process in the diagram below (to the best of my abilities).

Hyper Parameters Tuning

LightGBM has a seriously high number of hyperparameters to tune from. Like all tree-based algorithms lightGBM is also well-known for overfitting. One of the main reasons for overfitting is model complexity. I prevented lightGBM from building over-complex models by controlling the number of leaves (num_leaves) and maximum depth (max_depth) parameters. I also used a large number of estimators (n_estimators) and regularization (lambda_l1 and lambda_l2) to reduce overfitting. The total number of iterations (num_iterations) was also controlled and early stopping (early_stopping_round) was also introduced to prevent overfitting. Finally I also tried to introduce a lot of randomness by using extra trees feature fraction and bagging_fraction. Below is the hyperparameter configuration for the second layer of models.

params = {

'application':'regression'

'boosting ': 'dart'

'num_iterations':8000

'learning_rate':0.05

'num_leaves': 95

'extra_trees': True

'feature_fraction':0.8

'bagging_fraction':0.9

'lambda_l1':0.1

'lambda_l2':0.1

'min_split_gain':0.01

'early_stopping_round':100

'max_depth': 7

'min_child_weight':40

'n_estimators': 400

'metric':'mae'

}

You will also notice that the first layer is much less complex (higher number of leaves and depth). Experiments showed that keeping the first model less complex than the second produces good results. This also enables the first model to generalize and the second model to specialize.

Results

This competition uses a mean average score (MAE) and this solution had a private score of 4200311. This ranked 18th on the leaderboard and I am pretty happy that my simple solution ranked that high in the end. The bar chart below shows the mean average score for the different ranges of time to eruption values. The bar chart on the left is from the first model and the one on the right is from the second model.

As the second model can focus on a smaller range of time they tend to do much better. Also the overall score of the model improved. For both extreme ends (very quick or late time to erupt) I created one extra model. As the range between lowest and highest is really big even the specialized models tend to lean more towards the middle of the range. These extra models for both extremes helped better predict the extreme cases.

Final Thoughts

This was an interesting Kaggle competition and a big thanks to the organizers for organizing it. Like with any other competition I got to learn a lot from other Kaggler’s work while participating in this competition.

I wish I had the time to do a more systematic study and visualization of feature importance. I also think using multiple classifiers in the first layer instead of a single model might be a better approach. Oh well I will take this experience with me to do better in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9lbmhhbmNlLXlvdXIta2Vkcm8tZXhwZXJpZW5jZXMtd2l0aC10aGVzZS10aXBzLTMwMzZjM2I3NTY00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Enhance your kedro experiences with these tips | by Trung Nguyen,"Enhance your kedro experiences with these tips

It will open Feb. 1 on the ground floor of the 15-story centerpiece building Falls Tower at Camperdown officials with the bank confirmed Friday.

It replaces the bank's ""Plaza"" branch that shut down at 101 North Main former site of the Charlotte-based bank's Greenville headquarters.

Bank manager Chip Spangler said he was excited about the new location. Standing at the branch’s South Main Street door Friday morning he gestured toward the sidewalk and estimated a thousand people walk by a day.

“This is going to be a really nice building” Spangler said. “Right next to Falls Park and with all the festivals.”

The bank's Upstate executive offices Merrill Lynch investment offices and mortgage department will be on the building's seventh and eighth floors.

Stacy Brandon the bank's Upstate South Carolina market president said in a statement that Bank of America has operated in the region for more than 100 years.

According to FDIC records Bank of America's $1.7 billion in deposits in Greenville County currently rank it fourth among banking institutions operating in the county. The county's biggest bank is Wells Fargo ($2.3 billion) followed by Truist ($2.2 billion) and TD Bank ($2.0 billion). Still Bank of America can boast the biggest Main Street presence with its name gleaming atop Falls Towers' southern and western facades.

""Our goal is to deliver a seamless experience for clients across all channels and this new location will ensure everyone living and working downtown has even greater access to our financial services"" Brandon said.

The banking industry has been in flux in the Upstate in recent years with CertusBank shutting down in 2015 BB&T and SunTrust completing their ""Truist"" merger last year and the nation's largest bank — Chase — entering the Greenville market for the first time with multiple branches at the close of 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzLzctYmFua3MtcmVjZWl2ZS1vbmx5LW1pbm9yLWFudGl0cnVzdC1maW5lcy1pbi1tZXhpY28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Banks Receive Only Minor Antitrust Fines In Mexico,"Mexico’s antitrust watchdog has fined seven banks a total of US$1.5 million only 4% of potential penalties after finding evidence of price-rigging in the peso bond market early last decade according to Bloomberg News.

Deutsche Bank Barclays Bank of America Citigroup’s local unit Citibanamex Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Banco Santander Mexico and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were fined a combined 29.4 million pesos out of a potential 680 million (US$34.12 million) the document showed. Deutsche Bank and Barclays got the two biggest fines at 8.7 million pesos and 6.35 million pesos respectively (US$436606 and US$318673 respectively).

The ruling to be published as early as Monday January 25 follows a four-year investigation by antitrust commission COFECE that was aided by a whistle-blower who came forward in May 2015 the documents showed. Investigators said they found evidence in electronic chats from 2010 to 2013 of cartel behavior in the secondary market.

The fines are tiny compared to the billions of dollars Barclays and Deutsche paid back in 2015 to settle charges with US UK and European regulators. While COFECE can fine companies as much as 10% of their revenues when they engage in cartel-like behavior banks and traders were fined under a less-harsh statute that set maximums at 200000 times the country’s daily minimum wage.

While it offers a number of undeniable advantages it brings along the need for security especially cybersecurity. Consider the following:

An increasing number of devices are interconnected communicating via the Internet

Digitalization brings convenience but also collects data with the potential for misuse

Implications of interconnected devices for companies.

This brings along implications for companies. They must protect themselves from cyberattacks or else – for instance – hackers could take control of Internet-connected medical devices. This is but one example and the vulnerable lot includes financial services firms including those in the investment banking industry.

A good cybersecurity setup for this sector is difficult to determine.

Cybersecurity is hard to determine considering the constantly changing threat landscape plus the effect of shifting business priorities and exponential technology forces on how organizations approach cyber risk management.

There is no denying though that the cloud data and analytics and social media are top of the list of technology items requiring attention at large firms.

Look what large enterprise banking spend on cybersecurity

The criticality of cybersecurity is borne out by budgets for the same. The largest budgets of course belong to Fortune 500 companies. Within the Fortune 500 financial institutions appear to have the deepest pockets. JP Morgan Chase & Co as per a 2018 letter to its shareholders spends roughly USD 600 million annually on cybersecurity. They also employ around 3000 IT security people.

Media reports have suggested that Bank of America spends roughly the same amount on cybersecurity.

It is thus no surprise to see the number of financial institutions posting job ads for cybersecurity positions. Given how cybersecurity covers a broad range of issues and security breaches are quite common the pool of investment banking professionals must also include tech-savvy information security personnel to protect their online systems.

Why are banks a cybersecurity risk?

Why though is Wall Street at such risk? According to Moody’s the capital markets businesses of banks “are an appealing target for cybercriminals attempting large-scale theft or launching sophisticated attacks to create operational disruption.”

Companies in the investment banking industry also house other attractive “targets” such as payment and cash management systems and data of their high-net-worth clients and retail banking private clients. Cyberattacks have many purposes:

Stealing money

Extorting ransoms

Stealing or manipulating data

Creating significant operational disruption

Generating negative publicity

The attacks themselves can take many forms across a wide range of channels. A typical attack is perpetrated by a criminal in a remote safe location trying to get into the systems of a bank or of its clients. Other attacks include attempts to divert payments into the accounts of criminals.

Fraud is very closely linked with cybercrime and so are the methods employed by investment banking professionals to fight the two.

Investment Banking

Because of the nature of its work the investment banking industry offers a number of targets for attacks and fraud. These include the following:

Pending mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions: Business negotiations for M&A deals include some very valuable information attractive for attackers especially for industries such as pharmaceuticals biotechnology and medicine.

Mobile computing devices: Given how many activities of investment banks happen through such devices they are often targeted to get unauthorized access to client or management accounts.

Insider trading: The fact that people working at investment banks are privy to confidential information means they can also facilitate cybersecurity breaches. Interestingly some analysts also speculate there could be a correlation between such institutions hiring cybersecurity professionals and the increased instances of breaches and insider trading attacks a few months later.

What does a successful cyber attack do?

The impact of a successful cyberattack could be wide-ranging for the work of investment banking professionals with effects in financial regulatory and reputation terms. A challenge in this regard comes from the number of ‘false positives’ that could arise and unfortunately are not possible to eradicate completely.

The only way out is to keep working on rules to detect such instances and thereby reduce their occurrence. The rules need to become more accurate and efficient and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) could be of great help hereby for instance scanning for a change in client behavior or for suspicious IP addresses.

Compromised data can also affect the bottom line. Details of an ongoing deal could be manipulated or transferred thereby damaging share prices of involved companies involved.

New cybersecurity technology

The solution is for the investment banking industry to invest in new cybersecurity technologies. Investment banks must encourage proper procedures to remove human errors negligence or failure to follow security protocols. Some key aspects are as below:

Huge amounts of data: With larger amounts of data being collected processed and analyzed for decision-making every aspect of data collection and management must be secured.

Autonomous devices: Do not miss out on security for sensors and smart meters. Watch out for physical tampering unauthorized access and other attempts to affect data integrity.

Internet of Things (IoT) security: Data assurance programs must establish end-to-end security for IoT data.

Hire the right people: This implies hiring sufficient staff to implement and monitor security measures as well as ensuring they are trustworthy.

Keep clients and staff informed: These entities must be informed about the risks of phishing attacks social engineering and others.

The way ahead is clear. Security measures and awareness along with effective regulation are imperatives to mitigate the risks and effects of cyberattacks in an industry as critical as investment banking. Given the sensitivity of information here the monetary and reputation damages could otherwise be very serious for the business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAxLTI0L2NoaW5hLXMtZ3Jvd2luZy1wb3dlci1pcy1zY2FyaW5nLW9yZGluYXJ5LXNhdmVycy1vdXQtb2YtaG9uZy1rb25n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's Growing Power Is Scaring Ordinary Savers Out of Hong Kong,"Why did this happen?

The reversal by the Treasury came after an appeal by lobbyists with close ties to former President Donald J. Trump who were hired by Dan Gertler the Israeli billionaire including the lawyer Alan M. Dershowitz who helped represent Mr. Trump during his first impeachment and Louis J. Freeh a former F.B.I. director.

Mr. Gertler was accused in 2017 by the Trump-era Treasury Department of using his connections to the former Congolese president Joseph Kabila to arrange “opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals” that cost the citizens of Congo more than a billion dollars in lost revenue.

The reversal by the Treasury drew immediate condemnation by human rights advocates who said they hoped that the Biden administration would move to reverse the action.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXN0b2xwb3N0LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvY2hpbGRyZW4taW5qdXJlZC1kb3VibGUtZGVja2VyLWJ1cy05MjY5MTQz0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJpc3RvbHBvc3QuY28udWsvbmV3cy9jaGlsZHJlbi1pbmp1cmVkLWRvdWJsZS1kZWNrZXItYnVzLTkyNjkxNDMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Children injured as double-decker bus crashes in Bath,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Venture capitalist people wondered if they should be investing in Theranos while the labs of the world were saying ""Holy mama they're disrupting the market what do we do?""

Of course at that time Theranos was still making quite a few waves in the industry as it sought to bring finger-prick diagnostic testing to the masses. Even President Joe Biden (then Vice President) praised Theranos as the laboratory of the future. That was also right before the turning point in Theranos' story when it turned from fairytale to cautionary tale for all of medtech.

""I think we know the story; we know the things they did that none of us think were the right thing to do"" Stein told MD+DI. ""But what they did do is prove that people want to have their choice and that people desire the ability to get testing done in convenient locations tied to retail and they want their time to be respected.""

Stein began conversations with a colleague at Siemens Eric Olson about ways the company could bring a solution like that to the marketplace. They started working with BD (Becton Dickinson) on the sample collection end of the new venture and Siemens spun the project out. Olson left Siemens with a term sheet in hand and founded Babson Diagnostics. Siemens spun out licensing exclusivity and a cash investment into Babson and BD also signed exclusive agreements.

Today Stein is CEO at Austin TX-based Babson Diagnostics working alongside Olson the company's founder and chief operating officer. The company is focused on moving laboratory testing to the pharmacy counter. The company says it has developed a model for diagnostic blood testing that maintains a high standard of accuracy yet requires only one-tenth the sample size of traditional venipuncture methods. The company also uses a proprietary blood collection device to collect the sample right there at the pharmacy then the sample is processed back at Babson's labs.

""You get the best of both worlds of very easy accessibility at retail very easy for the retailer because they don't have regulatory barriers very easy for them to collect coupled with the economies of scale and quality and the menu breadth of a centralized processing lab.

Haven't we seen this movie before?

Given how badly Theranos imploded the biggest challenge Babson is likely to face is distinguishing itself in a market where investors and retail partners alike have been scorched by a similar business concept. So far though that doesn't seem to be a problem for Babson.

Last year Babson launched a COVID-19 serology test to detect IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the bloodtream through a select network of retail and clinical partners in Austin. Clinical performance evaluation for Babson's IgG assay resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Babson is developing a pipeline of fully automated COVID-19 serology assays including qualitative and quantitative measurement of the immune response across a number of sample types. Babson’s tests are high-throughput heterogeneous immunoassays analyzed at the company’s CLIA-certified CAP-accredited high-complexity clinical laboratory in Austin.

In September the company closed $13.7 million in cumulative series A funding led by Siemens Healthineers Prism Ventures Genesis Merchant Capital and Lago Consulting Group.

Study demonstrates effectiveness of Babson's technology

The startup also recently completed a pivotal clinical study called Dandelion Alpha which demonstrated the effectiveness of Babson's approach. The results are momentous because they indicate that Babson is the first company to test a full set of routine panels from a small capillary sample and produce accurate diagnostic-quality results.

The study included 81 people enrolled during a six-week period between September and October 2020 and was conducted in a retail pharmacy. Each study subject received testing from both sample types: traditional venous (collected with a conventional needle and tube from the arm by a professional phlebotomist and processed and analyzed using conventional laboratory equipment) and novel capillary (collected with BD’s fingertip collection device by a trained retail pharmacy worker processed with Babson’s sample preparation technology and analyzed with Babson’s miniaturized assays). Results demonstrate strong correlation between the two testing methods providing new evidence toward establishing clinical equivalence. The results were reviewed by Babson’s Scientific Advisory Board which is composed of renowned and award-winning diagnostic experts.

“COVID-19 has put the world’s focus on our healthcare systems directing us to reexamine how we access care. We believe that reimagining the current clinical diagnostic testing process is an important place to start as diagnostic blood testing is crucial for preventive care but can be made more accessible and convenient. Babson is the first company to create a clinical and practical platform that provides accurate diagnostic blood test results for the most ordered routine testing panels from a microsample collected from a finger in an accessible retail environment” Stein said. “Our team is gratified to see that the data from the Dandelion Alpha study supports our science-first approach and suggests that our sample collection sample handling and analysis technology produces the same results as the conventional diagnostic blood testing system without sacrificing menu breadth. It’s a major step toward democratizing diagnostic testing to improve customer access to care.”

Learning from Theranos' experience

One good thing about Theranos is that the disgraced blood-testing company does serve as a learning opportunity for companies like Babson. Stein said the primary lesson he took away from the Theranos story is that there really is a market need for choice and accessibility so that people can get their blood tested when they want and where they want.

""And maybe the most important thing is you have to take a scientific approach a science-first approach"" Stein said. ""We're dealing with people's lives. This is not a business for me it's something I'm passionate about because I will be a consumer of it sooner or later so I will only do something [if it's] where I want my kids treated or a loved one treated or I am treated"" Stein said. ""So from day one we took a scientific approach and we broke the problem down where you could not have a black box or a cheat — there are no cheat steps.""

That's also the reason Babson partnered with BD a world leader in blood collection to collect a very high-quality capillary sample and then the company architected its assays to need about 37% less blood than the traditional traditional venous method which is how Babson is able to do broad panels of testing from small volumes of blood.

""It's not that we're doing any kind of magic but we're being very smart"" he said. ""We're collecting a little bit larger volume of capillary blood very high quality we're making sure that we're not wasting the blood especially when it comes to the separation step for serum and then on the assay side we need less blood.""

Stein said that from just 350 microliters of blood Babson can do a comprehensive metabolic panel lipids vitamin D thyroid-stimulating hormone and other tests.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMzMyOTkzL3NhbWlyLW1hY2hvdXItdW5zdW5nLWhlcm8td2hvLWhlbHBlZC1tb3JvY2NvLXNlY3VyZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samir Machour: Unsung Hero Who Helped Morocco Secure COVID-19 Vaccines,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.,,,,,,,,,

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has made more than $7 billion on its BYD investment to date representing a roughly 3000% gain.

The famed investor's conglomerate spent $232 million to buy 225 million shares in the Chinese electric-vehicle company in 2008 paying about $1 per share.

BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares have skyrocketed 30-fold to the equivalent of $33 since then quintupling in value over the past year alone. Its market capitalization has mushroomed from less than $3 billion to more than $95 billion as a result.

The automaker's remarkable stock performance underlines the incredible hype around electric vehicles and manufacturers such as Tesla and Nio. BYD capitalized on investors' enthusiasm just this week raising $3.9 billion by selling 133 million new shares.

Here's a closer look at one of Berkshire's most unusual investments.

A visionary founder

Berkshire's vice-chairman Charlie Munger first brought BYD and its founder Wang Chuanfu to Buffett's attention.

""Charlie called me one day and says 'We've got to buy BYD this guy that runs it is better than Thomas Edison'"" Buffett told CNBC in 2018.

Munger made the same comparison in a Fortune cover story in 2009.

""This guy is a combination of Thomas Edison and Jack Welch – something like Edison in solving technical problems and something like Welch in getting done what he needs to do"" he said. ""I have never seen anything like it.""

Adequately impressed Buffett and his team struck up talks with BYD and initially offered to buy 25% of the business. Wang wanted the American billionaire's backing as he knew it would supercharge the automaker's public profile and help it make inroads into the US market. However he turned Buffett down because he didn't want to part with more than 10% of BYD's stock.

""This was a man who didn't want to sell his company"" Buffett told Fortune. ""That was a good sign.""

Berkshire eventually settled for a 9.9% stake purchased by its MidAmerican Energy subsidiary. The holding represented about 25% of BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares and 8.25% of its total outstanding shares.

'A damn miracle'

Munger defended the unusual bet on a Chinese technology startup at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2009.

""BYD is not some early-stage venture capital company"" he said. Munger pointed out that Wang had already taken the business from a standing start to becoming a leading global manufacturer of rechargeable lithium batteries and cell-phone components.

Wang was ""not satisfied with having worked a couple of miracles"" Munger said so the entrepreneur then set his sights on the automotive industry. BYD despite having limited capital and facing fierce competition quickly made the bestselling car model in China.

""This is not some unproven highly speculative activity"" he continued. ""What it is is a damn miracle.""

Munger also emphasized the importance of BYD's advances in clean-energy technology given its critical role in combating climate change.

""It may be a small company but its ambitions are large"" he said. ""I will be amazed if great things don't happen here.""

""I have never in my life felt more privileged to be associated with something than I feel about BYD"" he added.

Only the beginning

Munger returned to the subject at Berkshire's 2010 meeting arguing the wager showed he and Buffett were capable of adapting their investment approach.

""Berkshire would not have made an investment in BYD if the opportunity had come along five or 10 years earlier"" he said. ""And it shows that the old men are continuing to learn and that's absolutely essential.""

Buffett's longtime business partner also touted the Chinese company's track record once again.

""BYD had won its spurs in life by the time we found it"" Munger said. ""They had accomplished things that struck me as almost impossible to do and yet they'd done them.""

The automaker has grown stratospherically since Berkshire became a shareholder albeit with the help of government subsidies. Its revenue has skyrocketed from 26 million Chinese yuan in 2008 to 122 billion yuan ($19 billion) in 2019 boosting its net income from 1 million yuan to 1.6 billion yuan ($250 million) over the same period.

Buffett summed up Munger's fondness for BYD in a 2018 interview.

""Charlie's in love with the company and it's done very well"" he said. ""The fella that runs it has got big big ideas and he's very good at executing.""

It’s doubtful whether the famously low-key Warren Buffett has ever pondered such a matter but it remains an interesting question. Many of his financial peers especially Mark Zuckerberg take a decidedly normcore approach when it comes to presenting themselves to the world. Zuckerberg does not even bother with a watch. Presumably he’s never late for anything because time simply revolves around him. Jeff Bezos on the other hand has his preposterous $42 million 500ft tall “10000 Year Clock” housed inside a hollowed-out mountain in Texas that he owns. Well it’s one way to deal with a midlife crisis.

So what about the man they call the “Sage of Omaha” one of the world’s most successful investors of all time with a net worth of around $88.5 billion? Although he has a notoriously frugal lifestyle – the Berkshire Hathaway CEO lives in the same five-bedroom house that he bought in 1958 for $31500 (around $270000 in today’s money) eats McDonald's for breakfast and only very recently upgraded to an iPhone – he does seem to have somewhat finer taste in wrist candy. Specifically he favours a Rolex Day-Date.

First released in 1956 and famously beloved by US presidents (a tradition that started with Lyndon B Johnson hence the watch's nickname the “President”) it is a watch that telegraphs prestige and has only ever been made out of gold or platinum. Photos of Buffett reveal that he wears an older example most likely the ref 18038 or ref 18238 in classic yellow gold (today both cost around £11000 on the pre-owned market) which was probably purchased in the late 1980s or early 1990s when he was flush with success after his first big deals. And just as he does with his stocks he’s held onto it in the decades since. Buffett is nothing if not a player of the long game; his success can be attributed to generally only investing in companies whose goods and services he likes and uses and thinks are here to stay. At one point he even attempted to buy Rolex which is controlled by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation. The Foundation politely rebuffed his offer. Can you imagine if he had succeeded? Now that really would be an impressive flex.

This happened prior to his exit from the game via the NFL’s concussion protocol. He’s spent the entire week of practice listed with the toe injury on the team’s injury report but carried no game status heading into the AFC title game. He still might not be 100% though.

According to a report from NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport Mahomes has been diagnosed with “turf toe” which is a fairly common football injury involving the plantar plate and ligaments in the big toe. Mahomes is dealing with this issue in his left foot but it doesn’t appear to be as severe as it possibly could be. This can be a super painful injury and depending on the severity it can even sideline players or require surgery.

#Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes was diagnosed with turf toe sources say an injury that affected his preparation for the AFC Championship Game more than his time in the concussion protocol. My story: https://t.co/gbEI5RAFPf — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 24 2021

According to Rapoport the injury did “limit his effectiveness” during the practice week but he also took almost all of the first-team practice repetitions for Kansas City. The Chiefs’ practices this week were on the lighter side in general as they tend to be this time of year. Rapoport described them as a “slew of walkthroughs.”

Rapoport says that Mahomes will be reevaluated in the offseason for surgery but there isn’t a belief that the injury currently needs it. That’s a good sign but these injuries can also flare up and intensify at any time. It’ll be worth monitoring during the game.

“It’s feeling a lot better” Mahomes said of his toe on Friday. “I mean the next day it was very sore and then every single day since then it has gotten a lot better. It’s stuff you deal with being a football player you deal with injures and luckily enough for me this wasn’t as bad as it looked and felt the day of and the day after.”

Mahomes says the injury won’t be an issue and there’s a video from the practice week to support that theory.

Even if Mahomes is feeling the injury he’s been effective while dealing with injuries to his lower body in the past. Mahomes suffered an ankle sprain in Week 1 of the 2019 season. The following week he played through the injury and threw for over 400 yards and four touchdowns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vb2NuamRhaWx5LmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHktc2hvd3MtbG92ZS1mb29kLWRyaXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Community Shows Love With Food Drive,"By MADDY VITALE

Generosity of a community people lending support donating food to those who are struggling because they are out of work or can’t make ends meet is what Ocean City is about explained Gloria Votta chairwoman of Community Services for the Ocean City Board of Realtors.

“The people in the community are amazingly generous” Votta said in an interview Saturday. “There is one man who wishes to remain anonymous who gives us $800 for coats for kids each year. People are just really giving.”

The Ocean City Board of Realtors (OCBOR) kicked off its 2021 Community Service Projects Saturday with the “Food Is Love Share Some Love” winter food drive for those in need.

Non-perishable foods including canned items juice microwaveable meals and more are needed. Donations will be collected from now through Feb. 28 and can be dropped off at area real estate offices in Ocean City listed below.

The annual food drive is in partnership with the Ocean City Ecumenical Council an association of local churches that helps needy families. All of the items will be donated to the Ecumenical Council’s Food Cupboard at St. Peter’s United Methodist Church at Eighth Street and Central Avenue.

“Post holidays the cupboard needs to be replenished. This has been an especially hard year for the food cupboard due to COVID and lack of donations” Votta said. “We encourage our realtor family friends and neighbors to donate items for the Ecumenical Food Cupboard this winter for families in need.”

This year the Ecumenical Council members asked that people donate canned vegetables diced tomatoes peaches pears pineapples and hot cocoa packets among other items. Laundry and dish detergent shampoo deodorant toothpaste paper products and food store gift cards are also needed.

Votta said she hopes that the food drive is an overwhelming success because this year more families have fallen on difficult times because of job loss due to the pandemic.

“I feel bad for the people in the restaurant industry. There are waitresses and other service workers out there who haven’t worked for months” Votta said. “I feel so sorry for casino workers. I am sure that there are people who live in Ocean City who need a little help who normally never would have. Casino and service workers are having an unusually hard year and we want to be able to help. No one should ever go hungry.”

Votta along with members of the OCBOR and Ecumenical Council have worked hard on the food drive since about 2011.

She credited fellow realtors and members of the Ecumenical Council for working together to make the food drives successful year after year.

City Councilman Peter Madden is also a broker/owner of Goldcoast Sotheby’s at 34th Street.

Every year Madden joins the other realtors to help out in the food drive.

“It’s a great cause and helps a lot of people” Madden said. “It’s something we do every year but it is even more important this year with everything going on in the world.”

Votta said she appreciates Madden’s help and the assistance of her other colleagues along with the Ecumenical Council for making the food drive possible year after year.

“Pete is always awesome in packing up his SUV with donations to take to St. Pete’s for the food cupboard” she pointed out. “We always get a train of cars going to St. Pete’s all packed up with food donations.”

The multiple drop-off locations this year make it more convenient Votta noted for people dropping off food and toiletries.

Donations may be dropped off at the following real estate offices:

Berkshire Hathaway Fox & Roach 109 34th Street and 901 Simpson Ave.

Fox Real Estate 894 Brighton by the Beach

Goldcoast Sothebys International Realty 200 34th Street

If you’re in a hurry you can skip and click to read the 5 Best Aggressive Stocks to Buy Now.

An aggressive stock can be defined as high performing above average companies that experience rapid growth in terms of cash flow revenue and earnings. These companies are expected to outperform their competition.

Given the COVID-19 pandemic evaluating companies to invest in has become very challenging. However aggressive stocks have not only shown investors that they have the capability to survive the pandemic but they consistently thrived despite the economic downturn. These stocks increased revenue quicker than an average business in their sector or than the market itself hence the loyal consumer base and the stable financial statements.

Aggressive stocks either pay low dividends or zero dividends because these companies usually reinvest their earnings back into the company to boost revenue capacity within the business such as research and expansions. In an article we mentioned the Top 10 Earnings Growth Stocks with Dividends for 2021.

In investing in aggressive stocks you are only able to generate substantial returns through capital gains which is why those who invest in these stocks may be in it for the long-term. There are also a cohort of investors who chase momentum stocks to generate short-term gains. These investors are potentially subject to higher short-term capital gains taxes.

Is this still the right time to be aggressive? A couple of days ago I listened to GMO's Grantham telling us how we are in the middle of a huge bubble and investors should be moving to cash. Later in the interview Grantham revealed that he made hundreds of millions by investing in Quantumscape (QS) which went public by merging with a SPAC. He said his returns would have been much higher if the stock didn't fall from its high of $130 to $50. QS is a way too aggressive stock to be invested in and we find Grantham who has been a huge bear for a decade being invested in this stock a bit ironic. We pay more attention to Cathie Wood who puts her money where her mouth is (read Cathie Wood's recent comments on inflation interest rates bitcoin and her small-cap picks with huge upside potential). Value investors have been very good at underperforming the market over the last 5 years and most of them failed to capture the technology revolution that's driving large returns in aggressive stocks.

No of HFs: 65

Total Value of HF Holdings: $3.16 Billion

We start the list of the 10 best aggressive stocks to buy now with ADSK. The top hedge fund holder of this stock is Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital which had $676 million invested in the stock at the end of September. In an article we shared RiverPark Advisors' ADSK comments from their Q3 2020 investor letter:

“Autodesk: Autodesk was our final top detractor for the quarter. The company reported second quarter results that exceed expectations across all key metrics but slightly lowered its billings and revenue outlook (by 1%) anticipating a slow recovery in the U.S. and U.K. In the second quarter revenue was $913 million up 15% with subscription revenue (92% of total revenue) up 27% year over year and a 29% Non-GAAP operating margin up 500 basis points year over year (non-GAAP EPS of $0.98 increased 51% year over year). Autodesk has a near monopoly on software for designing building and managing buildings as well as software for infrastructure and manufacturing plants prototyping software for manufacturers of products (including autos machinery and consumer products) and document sharing. The company expects to grow revenue 15%-19% annually over the next several years (which they were exceeding pre-COVID) and as we have seen happen in similar SaaS conversions as revenue scales operating margins are expected to expand significantly from second quarter’s 29% to more than 40% in-line with peers. We believe that ADSK shares can compound along with its free cash flow growth (expected to be 20%+ per year) over the next several years.”

No of HFs: 67

Total Value of HF Holdings: $8.17 Billion

An insider purchased 1250 shares at around $767 in February 2020. The stock is up 550% since then. In an investor letter Baron Opportunity Fund shared the following positive expectations despite the global COVID-19 disruptions.

“Tesla Inc. designs manufactures and sells fully electric vehicles solar products and energy storage solutions. The company reported robust second quarter results solidly ahead of market expectations despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated macro-economic challenges. Indeed in the second quarter Tesla delivered almost 91000 total vehicles – with strong unit level economics of 25.4% GAAP automotive gross profit margins – and another quarter of GAAP profitability and solid free cash flow (above $400 million). Moreover Tesla recently announced a record of nearly 140000 total vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. Despite global COVID-19 disruptions our long-term expectations remain high due to Tesla’s differentiated products and healthy unit economics. Tesla has announced capacity expansions in Shanghai China; Berlin Germany; and Austin Texas to support its short-term path to 1 million vehicles and its long-term goal of 20 million. Just a couple of weeks ago Tesla held its Battery Day event and presented a grand vision around its battery innovation and expanding its competitive advantages including massively increasing internal battery production capacity (100 gigawatt-hours by 2022 and 3000 by 2030) improving battery range (about 50%) and significantly lowering battery costs (cost per kilowatt-hour to decline by over 50%). We remain confident that Tesla will leverage its brand technology leadership and the electric vehicle secular trend to achieve sustainable long-term growth.”

8. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

No of HFs: 71

Total Value of HF Holdings: $5.08 Billion

AMD ranks 8th in our list of the 10 best aggressive stocks to buy now. Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund mentioned AMD in their Q3 2020 Investor Letter:

“Advanced Micro Devices produces semiconductor products and devices. The stock outperformed due to healthy growth in the personal computer and data center server markets. The company also continues to gain share against its major competitor which is having significant issues in its next generation products. Furthermore investors have appreciated the margins and profitability the company has been posting in addition to the topline strength.”

No of HFs: 82

Total Value of HF Holdings: $5.94 Billion

NOW is an American software that develops cloud computing that enables users to manage digital workflow. During the third quarter of 2020 the company announced a subscription revenue of $1091 million representing 31% year-over-year growth. An insider recently purchased 3000 shares at around $278 in November 2019. The stock is up to 86% since then.

6. NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)

No of HFs: 82

Total Value of HF Holdings: $7.67 Billion

An insider purchased 100 shares at around $537 in December 2020. The stock is down 2% since then. In an article we talked about Vulcan Value Partners comments on NVDA in their Q3 2020 investor letter.

“NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019 its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.”

Not only is it seriously adorable it was took home top honors as our No.1 pick in our roundup of the best tea infusers thanks to its slick easy-to-clean interior and even steep. We also found that it held an impressively tight grip on the side of the our mug eliminating any would-be messes.

This eco-friendly reusable manatea is made from food-safe BPA-free silicone. The material is soft and tasteless leaving the flavor your tea leaves of choice to come through. All drinkers have to do is pop the head off the infuser drop in leaves with enough room for them to expand once submerged and then let the infuser hang in the water from the top of the cup. Once the leaves have finished steeping you can simply remove them from the infuser before rinsing it out with hot water or cleaning it in the dishwasher.

The manatea is one of many animal-themed infusers designed by Fred & Friends. The Rhode Island-based company also offers options for fans of llamas ($10.25) turtles ($10) sloths ($9.93) and many more.

Now that bitter winter weather is here to stay it couldn’t hurt to have this tea essential—or any of your choosing—on hand. Just make sure to nab it before this markdown ends!

Getting a hold of the next-gen PlayStation or Xbox is admittedly hard to do. But even if you have the opportunity you may want to reconsider.

Spending your money on the follow-up to your current console of choice seems like a no-brainer. But what do you actually want from a new console? I'd argue some of the best things about using a new console aren't actually present in the new PlayStation or Xbox.

Nintendo Switch: What I love

For example take the game library. The majority of games you can play on the PS5 and Series X are the same ones you can currently play on the PS4 and Xbox One. Furthermore the handful of platform exclusives may not be that inspiring to you. Meanwhile over on the Switch there are more than three years of releases to explore.

The variety of games available is a credit to Nintendo. Naturally your thoughts may gravitate toward Mario Animal Crossing Super Smash Bros Legend of Zelda and the like. These high-quality franchises are good reasons to buy a Nintendo console. However you'll also find a surprising number of big third-party games on the Switch. Highlights include Doom and The Witcher 3  as well as one of the best indie game libraries outside of the PC. All of the next-gen exclusives on PS5 and Xbox Series X are firmly big-budget affairs and many of them are either remakes or sequels. I wouldn't blame you if these lineups have left you cold.

While it's nice to chase higher frame rates and prettier graphics these don't guarantee you're going to have fun with a game.

In terms of hardware the Switch has some key advantages too. By all means compare TFLOPs and maximum resolution output and laugh at the meager GPU inside the Switch. But while it's nice to chase higher frame rates and prettier graphics these don't guarantee you're going to have fun with a game. And if graphics are your priority then you're probably better off looking at a gaming PC rather than a console.

Then there's the fact that the Switch's less powerful hardware allows it to be portable: easily its standout feature. I wouldn't have ever thought about this before I bought my own Switch but having access to a fully equipped console anywhere is a luxury that can't be overstated. Even if you're in lockdown right now to prevent the spread of you-know-what having the freedom to play games somewhere aside from my desk helps keep the mental divide between work and home life from crumbling.

You get the versatile Joy-Cons to try out too. These controllers have built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes while still working similarly to a traditional gamepad. You can still play games as normal but also try out less traditional motion control experiences. You won't need extra peripherals either such as a costly VR headset . I feel that the Joy-Cons are comfier to use than a normal gamepad since you can use both halves separated with your arms relaxed at your sides. Perhaps this isn't a common way to play but it's certainly how I like to use them.

Nintendo Switch: What I don't love

Let's be honest about where the Switch is irredeemably weak though. Multiplayer and online functionality are to put it bluntly a mess. Some games require Nintendo's Switch Online subscription service for online multiplayer but others let you play over the Internet for free. To activate voice chat you need to use an app on your smartphone — a device that already does enough without having to be a gaming peripheral as well. This doesn't bother me since I’m a solitary gamer most of the time. But going for a Switch probably is a bad idea if you're a dedicated player of Call of Duty Fortnite or the like.

In Nintendo's defense the Switch is probably the best console for local multiplayer considering that the Joy-Cons can be used as two separate gamepads. Up to eight Switches with four players apiece can also work together in the same space. Want a second controller for your Xbox or PS5? That'll be another $70. And good luck gathering enough displays and consoles in one space for a 32-person local PS5/Series X multiplayer session without hiring a community hall.

The Switch's internal storage is both smaller and slower than what you get with the Sony and Microsoft consoles. You get 825GB of SSD space on the PS5 and a 1TB SSD on the Xbox. The Switch has just 32GB of memory. However Switch games take up less space as a rule thanks to the lower graphical fidelity. And if you run out of space at least you can expand the Switch's memory easily with any microSD card. Compare and contrast to the expensive proprietary SSD drives you'll need to add more room to the Xbox or PS5.

I think even the most dedicated PlayStation or Xbox fan has a few good reasons to make the switch to a Switch even once the next major wave of PS5 and Series X stock arrives. Granted your decision depends on why you enjoy playing games. If you're into graphical fidelity robust multiplayer or are a dedicated fan of an exclusive franchise you may not want a Switch. But if different kinds of games — and access to them outside of your living room — appeal to you more maybe you should consider Nintendo's hybrid console instead of Microsoft and Sony's newest machines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9yYXplci1ibGFja3NoYXJrLXYyLXByb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Razer Blackshark V2 Pro review,"Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro is a solid headset boasting clear audio that gets loud without sacrificing sound quality. And although it possesses a sleek comfortable design with a good microphone and volume knob my experience with its USB connectivity has been less than perfect.

Whenever I leave my small room the headset beeps incessantly due to its low signal range. Additionally the audio quality suffers greatly if it’s not connected to a USB 3.0 port as it constantly pops crackles and beeps.

Razer Blackshark V2 Pro design

The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro possesses an all black exterior with high-quality materials that feel sturdy and are built to last. The bottom of the headband and ear cushions are made of Flowknit memory foam which formed quite comfortably against my head. The top of the headband is made of a very nice faux leather with a centered Razer logo.

Two metal wires connect the headband to the headphones themselves with a larger base attached to those wires to give it a sturdy feel. The outer parts of the headphones are smooth to the touch with the Razer logo placed in the middle on both sides. Although the colors aren’t particularly bold the all-black aesthetic looks cool.

The headset has a volume knob a microphone mute button a power button an audio-in jack and a microUSB charging port. I personally would have preferred the ability to turn the power on through a switch rather than a button because having to hold it down is less convenient. Additionally the lack of USB-C charging is a bit shocking for a 2021 headset.

The package comes with a 3.5mm connector a detachable microphone a Micro USB-to-USB Type-A cable and a black pouch to put these items in for travel.

Razer Blackshark V2 Pro comfort

The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro strikes the perfect balance of comfort tightly wrapping around your ears and skull so the headset never feels loose. I can shake my head freely without fearing that the headset will suddenly fall off and the Flowknit memory foam ear cushions and headband felt soft against my head.

Additionally the metal wires that connect the headband and headphones have never pressed against my head at any point which was a concern when I initially used the product. The headset feels sturdy but it doesn’t weigh a whole lot (11.3 ounces) although I wouldn’t say it’s lightweight either.

Razer Blackshark V2 Pro gaming performance

The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro uses 50mm Razer TriForce Titanium Drivers for heightened vocal quality. This design also allows the system to accurately replicate low mid and high frequencies for an all-encompassing audio feedback. As a result minute details were identifiable while the bass and treble remained satisfying and punchy.

While playing World of Warcraft  I was wowed by how clear the fantastical soundtrack and atmospheric sound design was. While patrolling Ardenweald the very minimal beats alternated between each headphone and the vibration felt as if someone was tapping inside my ears. And as I stepped through the forest’s groves I heard the crisp sounds of my character's boots chugging along the shallow moonlit water. And as I entered the Heart of the Forest the low hum of life ringing throughout this hollowed tree resonated throughout my ears as if it was surrounded by a room full of speakers.

(Image credit: Future)

And as soon as I hopped into Uncharted 2: Among Thieves the iconic drums and strings present in Drake’s Theme translated perfectly through the headset in clear and crisp audio. And when I hopped from cover-to-cover in Shambala I felt the vibration from the bullets shooting over my head. Although the game doesn’t support PS5’s Tempest Engine I still easily identified where enemies came from thanks to the surround sound and their hapless shouts.

Booting up Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and being greeted by its strangely epic menu music was a treat. I heard each string sting clearly and the operatic vocals weren’t drowned out by the overwhelming orchestra. As I hopped into a Zombies match each terrifying screech and groan coming from the undead came through loud and clear as I shot through them with my overpowered shotgun. Each sound effect was loud and none were drowned out by the consistent layering of various noises.

Razer Blackshark V2 Pro music performance

The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro has successfully placed vocals at the front of every track I’ve listened to without sacrificing the rest of the sound. The headset can even get so loud that I often remove it leave it on my desk and listen to music like it’s a speaker.

When listening to “2 + 2 = 5” by Radiohead I heard how the right and left sides of the headphones presented different sounds. And as soon as Thom Yorke began singing I heard his audio at the forefront as well as every guitar note that played in the background. When the song evolves into its more chaotic portions ripe with all sorts of drums guitars and layers of vocals I can still easily identify each individual element with the headset’s accurate sonics.

As I blasted “The Great Elsewhere” by Owen Pallett I heard each layer individually whether it was the light synth melodic drumming high strings or wind pipes they held their ground against the vocalist’s particularly unconventional voice. As the piece escalated in volume and intensity so did the bass and vibrations of the headphones. I felt the punchiness of the music making this song in particular even more immersive and satisfying.

Afterward I listened to “Fell In Love With a Girl” by The White Stripes. This is a more abrasive track but ultimately the Blackshark V2 Pro did equally as well to translate the harshness of the sound. All elements communicated with one another perfectly and the intentional static-like quality of the sound was preserved without becoming unpleasant.

Razer Blackshark V2 Pro microphone

The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro comes with a high quality detachable microphone. During testing I was impressed by how crisp and clear my voice sounded even with two fans running in the background. However I did notice occasional low static but it was so quiet that it wasn’t much of a problem for me. And even then most voice calling services have the ability to gate your audio to ensure certain levels of noise don’t activate the mic.

Using Razer Synapse you can edit your microphone settings. It has options for mic volume whether or not it inherently has a voice gate and enhancements like volume normalization vocal clarity and ambient noise reduction. Additionally in-depth mic equalization settings are available.

Razer Blackshark V2 Pro features

As the Blackshark V2 Pro is a Razer product it is compatible with Razer Synapse. Through this program you can edit mixer settings make enhancements to the sound and adjust mic quality. You can also turn on power saving options.

Through the mixer you can select which audio settings apply to each game you play. For example you can put one application on Game Mode and another on Music Mode. On the other you can create your own audio mixing setup and apply that to any games or applications you see fit. In the enhancement settings you can change how the sound is equalized or use modes specifically for bass boost sound normalization and voice clarity.

(Image credit: Future)

The Blackshark V2 Pro advertises up to 24 hours of battery life and through my constant usage that number seems pretty accurate. Additionally the low battery notification is thankfully far less frequent and distracting than it is on other headsets I’ve tested.

However I’ve had a decent bit of trouble with the Blackshark V2 Pro’s USB connector; the headset would randomly pop and crackle no matter what I was doing. Additionally it would frequently beep as if it were out of range even though I was right in front of my computer. After speaking to colleagues with the same headset I learned that I was alone in having this issue.

I then tested another Blackshark V2 Pro and the popping was no longer present. However the out-of-range beeps seemed to have stayed consistent. It appears that the headset will not do this if it is connected through a USB 3.0 port but even then the headset still suffers from having a relatively short range. If I step a few meters from it it’ll beep and have connection issues.

Bottom Line

The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro is a very solid headset that isn’t without its flaws. Although it boasts crisp audio that’s perfectly suited for gaming and listening to music I experienced pops and cracks for reasons I still cannot discern other than possessing a faulty unit.

Additionally be sure you have a spare USB 3.0 port handy otherwise you’ll have tons of connection issues that will make the headset unusable (it’s also unfortunate it uses a Micro USB for charging). Still the sound is crisp the volume can grow surprisingly loud and the memory foam ear cushions and headband made for a surprisingly snug fit on the largest of heads."

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

When BlackRock chief Larry Fink issued his annual corporate missive to chief executives last January he promised a huge shake-up at the world’s largest asset manager.

With global warming driving a “fundamental reshaping of finance” Mr Fink said it was time for BlackRock to put sustainability at the heart of how the $8.7tn fund house invests.

BlackRock would launch new products consider environmental social and governance issues in investment decisions sell some coal holdings and overhaul how it deals with companies.

His pronouncement came after years of criticism that BlackRock had been too slow to act on ESG issues particularly climate change.

The focus on sustainability was widely welcomed but also met with scepticism. “It is important to acknowledge that BlackRock saying that climate change is a big investment risk is a positive sign” says Diana Best of the BlackRock’s Big Problem campaign a network of climate activist groups. “There were great parts of Larry’s letter but we still had questions.”

With Mr Fink’s 2021 letter due this month we look back at BlackRock’s progress so far.

Stewardship

What BlackRock said it would do: Review its voting policies improve transparency around its stewardship activities and start to vote against board directors if companies were not making sufficient progress on sustainability issues.

BlackRock appear to be responding rather than leading from the front

What it has done: There has been a big shake-up in BlackRock’s stewardship activities which includes discussions with companies across the world and its voting at annual meetings. Sandy Boss was hired to lead the division last year.

The group has focused on increasing transparency around its voting and stewardship activities including publishing more so-called voting bulletins on controversial votes. It also reviewed its stewardship policies and in December committed to backing more shareholder resolutions on climate change after criticism in the past it had failed to support such proposals.

BlackRock has already started to vote against boards at annual meetings punishing 62 directors last year due to climate-related issues. It has ramped up its engagement with 440 carbon-intensive companies.

Catherine Howarth chief executive at ShareAction a responsible investment charity says the decision to vote against directors could have a big impact by forcing boards to more closely address investor concerns.

The stewardship improvements meant that BlackRock received a B grade for engagement up from C+ a year ago in an annual ranking of big asset managers from InfluenceMap a London-based think-tank. But it still lags behind many of its European peers.

“Our view is they have gone from being quite a long way behind the curve to just behind the curve. They have a lot to do to catch up with . . . some of their European competitors” says Dylan Tanner executive director at InfluenceMap.

Putting ESG at the heart of the investment process

What BlackRock said it would do: Integrate ESG in investment portfolios launch new exchange traded funds and other products focused on ESG and publish the sustainability of each fund including carbon footprint and controversial holdings.

What it has done: BlackRock says ESG has been integrated into all of its active and advisory strategies covering about $2.7tn of its assets under management. It has doubled the number of ESG index offerings as well as actively managed sustainable products.

It is also now possible for investors to check how sustainable BlackRock’s retail funds are across various metrics including carbon intensity and to check for exposure to controversial holdings such as companies behind civilian firearms.

Climate Capital Where climate change meets business markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here

Ms Best however says that even with these actions BlackRock has a “passive problem” — with billions of dollars of assets not subject to the same sustainability requirements as their active strategies.

“Without tackling the passive problem BlackRock will remain heavily exposed and the largest investor in coal oil and gas” she says.

“They are an absolute behemoth of a company” says Ms Best. “They absolutely need to get this right because they are a make or break for our climate.”

Coal restrictions

What BlackRock said it would do: Divest from fossil fuel companies that generate more than 25 per cent of their revenues from thermal coal by the middle of 2020 in its discretionary active investment portfolios.

What it has done: BlackRock says it has ditched coal as pledged. But campaigners say the asset manager has not gone far enough arguing its exclusion policy applies to only a small section of the coal industry and its assets under management.

“In order to effectively exclude the coal industry BlackRock should drop all companies that are planning to expand existing or build new coal infrastructure” says Katrin Ganswindt finance campaigner at Urgewald a non-profit. “At the very least companies with a coal share of revenue of 20 per cent and a coal share of power production of 20 per cent should be excluded from BlackRock’s portfolios.”

Without tackling the passive problem BlackRock will remain heavily exposed and the largest investor in coal oil and gas

A report this month by Reclaim Finance a non-profit and Urgewald said BlackRock remained highly exposed to the coal sector with holdings totalling $85bn.

BlackRock however has used its vote at annual meetings to punish companies over coal voting against directors at groups such as Fortum and supporting a shareholder proposal at AGL Energy.

Still many of their most vocal critics have been positive about BlackRock’s progress over the year even if they believe there is still work to be done. As Ms Howarth says: “BlackRock is capable of so much influence and impact. It is our job to keep challenging and keep the heat on them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vZWRtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1cm5pbmctbWFuLTIwMjEtdXBkYXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burning Man 2021 Still In Limbo Organizers Promise Official Update in February,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://edm.com/news/burning-man-2021-update on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vZWRtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1cm5pbmctbWFuLTIwMjEtdXBkYXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzRkMzhiMTAwLTA3ZGUtNDAwZS05NWI0LTMxOTk4MzdlYTA0NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M&A in 2021: asset management primed for consolidation,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The estates have been in existence for hundreds of years and it has the oldest clove pepper rubber coffee and tea plantations. These estates have no other employment opportunity except agriculture and horticulture. Notifying the area around the sanctuary as ESZ would affect the agricultural activities he said.Lalaji stated that the central government had issued a draft notification on February 20 2020 notifying 0-3km around the sanctuary as ESZ. In view of the lockdown announced due to Covid-19 pandemic no public hearing was conducted. He noted that the draft notification should be made available in the vernacular language for the people to raise objections however this notification on ESZ was only made available in English and Hindi.Though several people raised objections to declaring ESZ around the sanctuary in a meeting conducted in 2019 the central government had issued a finalized notification in the gazette on September 22 2020. Last year the HC Madurai bench had stayed the gazette notification on the ground that no public hearing was conducted.Hence the petitioner sought for a direction to quash the notification dated September 22 2020. tnn

Billionaire Ronald Lauder Blackstone bigwig John Finley and marketing guru Faith Popcorn are fighting to have their tony Hamptons hamlet secede from the town of East Hampton in a bid to save their beach from an underground power line connecting to Gov. Cuomo’s first off-shore wind farm.

The heavyweights signed a petition calling for a vote on the Wainscott incorporation the latest move by opponents of a plan to make Wainscott Beach the landing spot for the transmission cable from the ocean windmills a $2 billion venture. It would be buried 30 feet under the beach and travel four miles north to a substation.

The planned South Fork wind farm itself would be 35 miles off Montauk Point and provide power from 15 wind turbines to 70000 Long Island homes.

Opposition group Citizens for the Preservation of Wainscott which sprung up in 2018 is circulating the petition. They want the wind farm’s cable to skirt their bucolic residential neighborhoods and link to a mainland substation from a landing spot farther east in Amagansett.

Lauder’s family which owns numerous parcels near Wainscott Beach is reported to be among the “anchors” of the NIMBY group according to the Southampton Press. The founders include Alexander Edlich a senior partner at McKinsey & Co.; Henry Cornell founder of Cornell Capital; and Finley’s wife Carol. All have homes near the beach or along the transmission route.

Lauder the cosmetics heir and president of the World Jewish Congress did not return a request for comment.

The group amassed nearly $1 million in donations during its first year in operation and spent $307734 to hire high-powered Mercury Public Affairs in Manhattan to represent it according to its tax filing.

The group argues the power cable project will “forever alter… one of the most popular heavily used and photographed public beaches in the Hamptons.” It says having Wainscott become its own village will give residents more power over decision making with only a modest increase in property taxes — no more than $340 year for those in a median-value home.

But another group Wainscott United doesn’t buy it and is opposing the secession of the 350-year-old hamlet.

“It’s an an unnecessary layer of government incorporating a hamlet like Wainscott” said Doreen Niggles a group founder and lifelong resident.

On Thursday the East Hampton Town Board voted to allow the wind farm’s developers to use local roads to bury the transmission line. A different town body must give approval for the beach itself. East Hampton would get $29 million over 28 years from development partners Orsted a Danish energy giant and New England-based Eversource.

Town Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc said he understood the concerns about the inconvenience of road construction but “I think the long term impact of not doing everything we can to achieve renewable energy goals puts everybody at risk and will have much more devastating consequences.”

Citizens for the Preservation of Wainscott vowed to push forward calling the board’s vote “illegal and reckless” and a “grab for dollars.”

“They are taking short cuts because the supervisor is afraid of Wainscott incorporating. We have sought to avoid litigation but the Town Board has made this inevitable and we will initiate litigation against any governmental body that fails to adhere to the letter and spirit of laws designed to protect the citizens of Wainscott” said Michael McKeon the Mercury Public Affairs partner who is the group’s spokesman.

A public hearing on the incorporation petition is slated for Feb. 5.

A spokeswoman for Orsted and Eversource said “We are confident in our analysis of all possible routes and in the consensus that the (Wainscott) route will have the least impact on the environment and the community.”

Construction on the project which is still waiting approval from the state Public Service Commission is expected to begin next year and finish in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9zaG9ydGhhbmRlZC13YXlsYW5kLWJveXMtaG9vcHMtZ2V0cy1pdHMtcmV2ZW5nZS13aW4tb3Zlci1iZWRmb3JkLzY2ODY3NTUwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wayland boys basketball gets its revenge with win over Bedford,"Staff Reports

The big product reveal was a return to the adventures of Warhammer Quest! This time around things are getting a tad creepy with the Cursed City.

With the end of Blackstone Fortress Games Workshop was about due for another foray into the adventure board game space. Warhammer Quest is back with a new installment. This time you’re heading into the Cursed City to tackle a tyrannical bloodsucking menace. Travel to Ulfenkarn and prepare for the undead…

﻿

The Cursed City Awaits

We don’t have a ton of details about this game but from the video above WOW. That style is certainly thematic and speaks volumes of the tone of this one.

We also get a hint at who’s going to brave this new city as well with a few more heroes on deck:

It sure looks like we might have some unlikely allies on this adventure. Furthermore what little do know about the game is that rules have been revised and refined from the previous editions. Personally I’m very curious about the changes ahead for the Warhammer Quest franchise. Blackstone Fortress was a departure from the previous Warhammer Quest titles – but that was fitting as it was a 40k game vs an AoS game. Now GW is making this sound like yet another tweak and change to that formula – I’m looking forward to giving it a go!

More Models Ahead

Naturally GW also teased a pair of the models you can expect for this boxed set:

That’s no Old World Witch Hunter that’s a VAMPIRE hunter named Jelsen Darrock. You can tell because he traded in his torches for very large stakes. Totally different! I joke but I think this model is fantastic! I want one just to paint up it’s a characterful model for sure.

And next up we have Gorslav the Gravekeeper. Oh you didn’t the the Heroes were the only ones getting cool models did you? There will be (blood) more reveals over the coming weeks. But for now you can also check out the new Website for the game HERE.

There’s a fancy map and more…

In the dwindling weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency the Justice Department announced that it had reached a settlement with Boeing to resolve a years-long criminal investigation after two 737 Max jetliners crashed and killed 346 people. The headlines predictably focused on the top-line figure that the government had advertised — a $2.5 billion payment from the company — but this was about as accurate as a Trump University marketing flyer. In fact this may have been one of the most unusual and ill-conceived corporate criminal settlements in American history.

Until last year I worked in the Justice Department office that conducted the investigation the Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit and I know several people on the team (though I had no involvement in the investigation). DOJ under Trump was unprecedentedly lax in its efforts to fight financial fraud and white-collar crime — which have reached all-time highs while criminal prosecutions in the area have hit all-time lows and which have also included high-level meddling by political appointees in major corporate investigations. Trump’s Justice Department made a preelection push to persuade credulous observers that it was finally cracking down on corporate crime by hastily completing an antitrust case against Google announcing a settlement with Purdue Pharma over its marketing of the drug OxyContin and finalizing a deal with Goldman Sachs to resolve a lengthy foreign bribery investigation — but even that effort was decidedly less impressive than it appeared and it made the announcement of the Boeing deal just days before the end of the Trump administration even more conspicuous.

The Boeing settlement was based on conduct by two relatively low-level employees who according to the government’s recitation of the facts provided “incomplete and inaccurate” information about the 737 Max’s flight-control system to the Federal Aviation Administration. The government alleged — and Boeing admitted — that their purpose was to ensure that the company did not have to impose more intensive and costly training requirements on pilots but the agreement stops short of saying that the employees’ deception caused either crash — or even that the FAA would have done anything differently if the pilots had disclosed the information. (Those two Boeing employees have not been criminally charged.)

The government probably appreciated that the public would not take this well which may have been the impetus behind the $2.5 billion settlement. Nearly two-thirds of it (about $1.8 billion) is money that Boeing will pay to airlines for costs that they incurred as a result of the grounding of the planes but the company had set that money aside for them long ago so really the government is taking credit for something that was already going to happen. Another $500 million is for a victim-compensation fund. Boeing agreed that the fund would not “preclude” victims’ families from bringing legal claims — some have already settled while many have outstanding cases — but judges and juries also follow the news and it is hard to see them ignoring the fund as Boeing surely knows. In fact less than one-tenth of it ($243.6 million) is an actual fine.

In theory there is a complicated set of federal guidelines for setting fines but suffice to say that the Justice Department’s calculation which is contained in the agreement adopted virtually the most lenient interpretation of those guidelines possible. The $234.6 million fine according to the department represents “Boeing’s cost-savings” from the two employees’ misconduct. Essentially the government just required the company to give up its ill-gotten gains. A precise analogue is hard to come by but a useful comparison is the government’s 2012 settlement with BP following the Gulf Coast oil spill — a deal that required the company to pay the federal government $4 billion in criminal fines and penalties (followed later by a roughly $15 billion payment to settle civil claims).That means that Boeing’s payment of $243.6 million is essentially the only real “new” money that Boeing will pay.

This may still seem like a lot but the company got something extraordinary in return.

In addition to crediting the company for remedial measures following the crashes the agreement states that “the misconduct was neither pervasive across the organization nor undertaken by a large number of employees nor facilitated by senior mismanagement.” I cannot recall an affirmative exculpation like this in any other corporate criminal settlement — nor could Brandon Garrett a law professor at Duke University and one of the country’s foremost experts in the area who told me that he could “not recall ever seeing language of this sort.”

The typical failure to identify culpable executives in the course of a corporate criminal investigation is usually not for lack of trying. The government often will try to work its way up the managerial ladder when it identifies criminal misconduct at a company but its ability to do so is significantly hampered by limited resources. As a result what usually happens is that the government tries — and fails — to identify more senior involvement in the misconduct and then remains silent on the matter in public documents. One reason is that it is virtually impossible to prove a negative — that no one higher up in the organization was culpable — and every responsible prosecutor knows this. Another is that any kind of affirmative statement to benefit the corporation could have unfair spillover effects by making it harder for private litigants to pursue their own legal cases against the company. (The Justice Department generally does not publicly exonerate anyone.)

So not only is the Justice Department’s exculpation of senior Boeing management unusual it may prove very problematic for the ongoing lawsuits by victims’ families and shareholders of Boeing who have sued the company on the theory that senior executives did not adequately manage the development of the 737 Max or the resulting fallout from the crashes. It may be significantly harder for victims’ families to obtain punitive damages now and likewise the shareholders’ claims may be worth a lot less now too. When I asked some of the plaintiffs’ lawyers about this prospect they told me that the Justice Department’s conclusions do not bind them — and technically they do not — and that they hope to develop a fuller record than the Justice Department did through discovery using a more aggressive investigative posture. But there is palpable anxiety on this point and understandable frustration with the department whose deal for this reason and others has been widely panned by pretty much every knowledgeable observer particularly those familiar with the Senate Democrats’ scathing report on the company’s development of the plane and behavior after the crashes.

It is virtually inconceivable that the government investigated the company so thoroughly that it could fully exonerate “senior management” — a phrase that the agreement does not even bother to define. More likely the company lobbied for inclusion of this provision after providing reams of information to the government about its own internal investigation — an inherently conflicted arrangement that is now par for the course when large companies come under criminal investigation. John Coffee a professor at Columbia Law School recently published an excellent book on the long-term failure of corporate criminal enforcement describing this status quo in which the government delegates its investigation to a law firm chosen by the defendants as “probably the greatest failure of current institutional arrangements.” The companies review a lot of documents and conduct a bunch of employee interviews but Coffee argues that the “predictable” result is that the output “tends to implicate only lower-level executives.”

Virtually every big law firm in New York City and Washington D.C. now has a large group of lawyers including many former prosecutors whose work mainly consists of conducting these sorts of internal investigations for major companies while simultaneously defending those companies against far less well-resourced government investigations. In this case Boeing hired a team of lawyers led by Mark Filip a former senior Bush Justice Department official who had a significant hand in developing the department’s current guidelines on corporate settlements; members of that team declined to answer questions from me about their representation.

At best the Boeing deal makes no sense but when you cut through it all the gist of it seems to be that the company paid $234.6 million of shareholder money to secure an exculpation of its senior management which may be far more valuable to the company in the long run. Because this deal was completed under Trump officials it is hard to say how much of this reflects industry-friendly ideological predispositions or ineptitude. I do not hold the people who were running the place until recently in particularly high regard — a group that included a cadre of young white men whose ambition and job responsibilities often exceeded their skill sets — but my guess is that the basic problems with the deal were apparent even to them.

Of course the public has justifiably been unhappy about the Justice Department’s track record on corporate crime for decades. There are reasons for the long-term increase in financial fraud that transcend any particular administration and during the Obama presidency the public bristled at the dearth of criminal convictions for high-level corporate executives in the wake of the financial crisis.

Still several things seem clear to me: Boeing should have paid substantially more money to settle the investigation; the government should not have been party to an agreement that appears to have been designed to mislead the public into thinking that the company is paying far more money than it actually is; and the exculpation of senior management should never have been included. In isolation these items may seem unremarkable but as a package the deal is a triumph for Boeing and its executives without precedent.

The Boeing deal is perhaps the most glaring evidence from the Trump years that the department’s long-term approach to corporate crime is in desperate need of serious rethinking under Merrick Garland if he is confirmed as Joe Biden’s attorney general. A good start would be a massive increase in the resources that the government devotes to these cases. But commentators such as John Coffee and others have proposed more novel approaches such as creating a so-called “equity fine” that would require companies to issue new stock if they do not fully cooperate with government investigations. The theory is that the resulting dilution of the company’s stock would particularly affect senior managers (because much of their compensation consists of stock) and in turn incentivize innocent executives to turn on culpable executives. To date we have heard little from the new administration about any plans in this area but that will hopefully change in the weeks and months ahead. The country’s considerable difficulties with financial fraud corporate malfeasance and elite impunity have been decades in the making and they are not going to end because Trump is gone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy01NTc1MTE1MNIBLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy01NTc1MTE1MC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing 737 Max cleared to fly again 'too early',,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS83MzctNzAwLXZzLTkwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing 737-700 Vs 737-900 – What Are The Differences?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS83MzctNzAwLXZzLTkwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxL2JvZWluZ3MtNzM3LW1heC1hbmQtdGhlLWZlYXItb2YtZmx5aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing's 737 MAX and the fear of flying,"The Covid nightmare is largely over. You’ve got the vaxx and you and your family are feeling confident to book a flight again to one of your favorite sunny destinations.

It could be Jamaica it could be Havana it could be Honolulu or maybe Bali. It doesn’t really matter.

You’ve waited a long time for this and now the day has come to enjoy travel again to live your life the way you want to without government telling you what you can and can’t do.

And then you learn the aircraft is a Boeing 737 MAX – yes the same aircraft that was grounded and roundly demonized after killing hundreds in two crashes.

Now you must make a decision. Do you get on the plane with your family? Do you trust it now? Or do you switch planes just to be safe?

Both the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transport Canada have given the aircraft its blessings – albeit the two transportation safety agencies came up with different conclusions and demands.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) also announced that the MAX is safe to fly citing “no stone unturned” in its review of the aircraft.

Officially the planes are ready to go. But hey they’ve been sitting there for months … enough time for a few gremlins to invade and cause small issues.

This past week Canada’s vaunted Globe and Mail ran a full-page piece by a computer-science professor who claimed things still weren’t good with the MAX.

In fact said Brian A Barsky – who probably doesn’t have a single hour as pilot in command of a commercial jet – the MAX still has elephantine ill-positioned engines situated too far forward on the wings a design that causes unstable flight.

Barsky thinks the design was flawed from the get go and still is. Despite the software fixes touted by Boeing and the federal agencies the MAX remains a risky ride he says.

Since 2019 he has been teaching a course at the University of California at Berkeley on “Boeing 737 MAX: Money Machines and Morals in Conflict.”

First off let’s face the truth. This was definitely not Boeing’s finest hour.

Because of its negligence 346 people are dead in crashes that definitely could have been avoided and prevented.

But instead of rehashing their obvious culpability let’s move forward. Let’s hear what one of America’s greatest pilots has to say – someone who you might say has our backs.

Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger the famed “Miracle on the Hudson” pilot isn’t satisfied that the fixes for Boeing’s 737 MAX proposed by the FAA are enough.

In an exclusive interview last October the celebrated pilot said that even as the FAA ungrounds the jet additional modifications are needed to improve the plane’s crew alerting system and add a third check on the jet’s angle of attack data The Seattle Times reported.

“I’m not going to say ‘We’re done good enough move on’” said Sullenberger.

“People are going to fly on it and I will probably be one of them” he added. “The updated MAX will probably be as safe as the [previous model] 737 NG when they are done with it. But it’s not as good as it should be.”

At the time of that statement Dennis Tajer spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association (APA) the union representing American Airlines pilots said he was with Sullenberger.

Though the specific flight-control software – the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) – that brought down the jets in two fatal crashes is now fixed Tajer said the investigations into the crashes “have exposed other areas we can do better on that airplane” and also on the 737 NG.

“We cannot lose this opportunity to address something that needs to be enhanced” Tajer said.

It should be noted at this juncture that another Boeing 737 crashed this month in Indonesia in a very eery way – it crashed just minutes after taking off from Jakarta in a death spiral that is all too familiar.

However the 737 in question was a much older jet and not a MAX – this clearly had nothing to do with MCAS.

Back to Sullenberger.

He took his first flying lessons in 1967 at age 16 while still in high school in Texas the same year Boeing certified the original 737.

The troubled Boeing 737 MAX has been cleared to fly by aviation regulators in the US Canada and Europe but some questions remain. Photo: Boeing

He flew fighters in the US Air Force and was an active safety advocate in the pilot union during his 30-year airline career.

In 2009 when a flock of geese took out both engines of his US Airways jet soon after takeoff Sullenberger guided the Airbus A320 to an emergency landing in New York City’s Hudson River saving all 155 people on board.

The “Miracle on the Hudson” made Sullenberger an emblem of piloting skill and aviation safety.

With the ungrounding of the MAX looming he weighed in on what still needs to be done.

His first concern echoes that of the EASA and many of the public comments submitted on the FAA proposal: MCAS on the updated MAX will take input from the jet’s two angle-of-attack sensors but Sullenberger believes a third check is necessary.

If one of the two sensors is faulty the computers won’t know which is correct.

The likely solution is not a third angle-of-attack vane on the jet’s exterior but an indirect “synthetic” software calculation of the angle of attack based on parameters such as the aircraft’s weight speed inertial position and GPS signal.

Boeing’s newest jet the 787 has such a check on the reliability of its air data sensors called Synthetic Airspeed a system Boeing rejected for the MAX on cost grounds.

“It’s really important that a third angle-of-attack input or synthetic airspeed be available on this airplane” Sullenberger said. “I would hope for a rapid adoption of that technology and the sooner the better.”

The EASA has said Boeing has agreed to develop a third angle-of-attack input after the MAX returns to service and to retrofit it to the MAX by the time the largest member of the family the 737 MAX 10 is ready – likely one or two years away.

Sullenberger’s other main concern is that Boeing do something about the cacophony of false alerts that were triggered erroneously on the crash flights by one failed sensor.

In June 2019 at the invitation of Dave Calhoun now Boeing chief executive officer Sullenberger tried out both the original and the updated MCAS software in one of Boeing’s flight simulators in Miami replicating what happened on the crashed flights.

There he experienced “the multiple compounded alerts and the ambiguity of the events and the physical workload and the distraction.”

“It was clear to me how the accident crews could have run out of time and altitude” he said.

He contrasted his own experience in 2009 – when he saw the geese approach seconds before they hit and felt the shudder as they were drawn into the engines leaving little mystery about what was happening to his airplane – with that of the crew of Lion Air Flight JT610 in 2018.

On that flight one sensor failure set off “rapidly cascading effects through multiple systems that quickly became ambiguous and confusing” he said. “It’s likely the crew never fully comprehended what was killing them especially since they had never heard of MCAS.”

Sullenberger said there should be some way to shut off erroneous alerts especially the highly distracting “stick shaker” stall warning.

Fixing this is something Transport Canada has demanded and again Boeing has agreed to find a solution.

As for the much vaunted FAA Sullenberger pulled no punches.

While Boeing has acted to fix problems with the troubled 737 MAX some experts feel it hasn’t gone far enough. Photo: Handout

The veteran pilot said its status as the “gold standard” among aviation regulators is “shattered.”

Recently a scathing US Senate report accused the FAA of retaliating against whistleblowers possibly obstructing the Office of the Inspector General’s investigation into crashes failing to hold senior managers accountable and allowing Southwest Airlines to operate improperly certified planes.

And while FAA chief Steve Dickson has said his agency cannot share detailed technical data on the MAX fixes because it is proprietary to Boeing Sullenberger demanded more transparency.

“This was such a failure” he said. “Surely there is a way to protect proprietary data and still show they are taking this seriously … I want to see the hazard analysis and know what assumptions were made.”

Sullenberger certainly accepts that in the US aviation is safer now than it ever has been.

Although one passenger died in 2018 when shrapnel from an engine blowout pierced a window on a Southwest Airlines flight that’s the only fatality among US airlines in the past 11 years with zero fatal crashes.

“We have made huge strides” said Sullenberger. “We have made aviation ultrasafe.”

Still he believes the MAX crashes could have happened in the US and the flaws revealed have ripped away the prior sense of security.

“For most of Boeing’s history it had a stellar record for designing and building excellent airplanes” he said. “On the MAX the flight-control system design was flawed … They had inadvertently created a deathtrap.

“It was a matter of time until it claimed lives.”

So what are you going to do? Are you going to get on that plane? Do you feel safe and secure that you will get from point A to point B?

Some airlines do get it and are doing the right thing.

At Air Canada for example pilots must do 40 hours of sim training equivalent to 24 hours or six sessions in the MAX trainer and must also do six training flights sans passengers in the actual MAX before they are fully checked out.

Airline officials say they are fully confident in the aircraft and the MCAS monster has been slain. Air Canada is also the only airline flying the MAX that has added the HUD system for extra safety.

Personally though I would feel much better … much much better if Boeing’s top execs would have gotten the axe after this deadly debacle. According to one aviation expert none of that happened – most of the same top executives are still there.

As if nothing happened.

Explain that one to the families of the 346 victims who died needlessly.

“It’s cutting costs cutting costs cutting costs and I think that culture is really the root of what happened here and that goes straight to Chicago and the board of directors” aviation industry consultant Scott Hamilton told Seattle’s KIRO7TV.

“Half of the board of directors who were there at the creation of the MAX in 2009 they’re all still there” he said. “Why aren’t they gone?”

Hamilton said he’s concerned fines instead of firings could mean the cost-cutting culture continues – a potentially catastrophic scenario.

“Until they’re gone this continues to be a good old boys club and oh by the way the current CEO David Calhoun was there in 2009. He was named to the board in 2009. He should be gone.”

Every single one of those top-level types should have got their walking papers – it was an opportunity to clean house and they didn’t.

To add salt to the wound Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg earned a grotesque compensation of just under US$23.4 million for 2018 according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

And I don’t give a damn about stats that show the last decade has been the safest ever in commercial air travel.

Those stats didn’t help the victims who spiraled into terrain at 500-600km/h.

That leaves us with a stark conclusion – in essence we have an aircraft that was badly designed from the start a deadly software pilots were not aware of an aerospace giant that has only done the minimum when it comes to fixes and dragging its feet on future fixes and a cost-cutting culture unchanged … so let’s unground the planes and see what happens.

It’s a flying crap game and you don’t hold the dice.

To quote Sullenberger: “Eventually whatever can happen will happen.”

Boeing (BA) has announced it will begin to deliver commercial airplanes capable of flying on 100% biofuel or sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.

The aviation giant said that reducing environmental damage from fossil fuels was the “challenge of our lifetime.”

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) plans to cut carbon emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2050 meaning Boeing’s biofuel target is 2030 as jetliners typically are in service for around 20 years.

While the planemaker has about 10 years to reach its goal it is not the first time the company used biofuel. In 2018 Boeing successfully flew the world’s first commercial flight using 100% biofuel.

To deliver on its vow and power aircraft with biofuel or fuel derived from living matter Boeing will need to work with engine makers and change its aircraft systems. It also needs to receive safety certification from global regulators.

“It’s a tremendous challenge it’s the challenge of our lifetime” Boeing director of sustainability strategy Sean Newsum told Reuters. “Aviation is committed to doing its part to reduce its carbon footprint.”

According to the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) commercial flying currently accounts for about 2% of all carbon dioxide emissions and about 12% of transport emissions.

ATAG says around 80% of aviation emissions are emitted from flights of over 932 miles (1500 kilometers) and that have no practical alternative mode of transport.

Currently biofuels are mixed directly with conventional jet fuel up to a 50/50 blend which is the maximum allowed under current fuel specifications the company said.

The planemaker and its European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA) are also working on minimising carbon emissions through weight and drag reduction on new aircraft.

It comes as the world’s largest aerospace company is grappling with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the 20-month grounding of its 737 MAX planes following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.

City Council roundtable 5:30 p.m. Monday. Councillors looked at results from the latest resident survey Jan. 4 but wanted a deeper dive. The stark and growing differences in Cantabrigians’ wealth and perceptions of what it’s like to live here poked through the initial mostly positive findings which is why vice mayor Alanna Mallon asked for a breakdown of answers to survey questions “by neighborhood and income groups.” Cambridge Day’s Sue Reinert reported here on some issues underlying the survey results.

Safety policies for expanded in-person classes

School Committee Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee 5 to 7 p.m. Monday. Members plan to talk about safety policies around expanding in-person classes and an ongoing review of coronavirus health metrics. Watchable by Zoom video conferencing.

Setting guidelines for the education budget

School Committee budget workshop 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The agenda is simple: setting budget guidelines for the 2022 fiscal year. Televised and watchable by Zoom video conferencing.

Plans for MIT’s College of Computing

Planning Board 6:30 p.m. Tuesday. Developers for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bring forward plans for the building that will house the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing – an eight-story 120-foot structure of 174000 square feet coming to 51 Vassar St. Area II replacing the institute’s distinctive Cyclotron Building. Zoning calls for 98 off-street parking spaces but the institute instead wants to eliminate even the 22 already there and have visitors with cars use its central parking garages. The site includes active railroad lines a fire lane “conceived as a future second railway transit line” and a right of way for the future Grand Junction Multi-Use Path that will eventually connect the Boston University Bridge to Somerville. (Cambridge Day wrote about the project here.)

New locations for Tatte and Sweetgreen

License Commission 1 to 3 p.m. Wednesday. Will Gilson’s Café Beatrice just opened in October in Cambridge Crossing but is already getting competition from Tzurit Or’s Tatte empire which plans an outpost at 222 Jacobs St. – which is right across the street. The new 3500-square-foot bakery would be open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily with 93 seats inside and 21 outside. The Sweetgreen chain plans to expand too: It has a Harvard Square location and seeks a license for 145 Broadway Kendall Square a 3102-square-foot space with 32 seats inside and 28 on a patio. (Technically the chain’s already expanded to 80 Fawcett St. Cambridge Highlands but the location serves only tenants in the Atmark building.) Watchable by Zoom video conferencing.

Financial analysis of Kendall Square changes

Ordinance Committee 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Wednesday. This committee run by city councillors Dennis Carlone and Marc McGovern plans to scrutinize a financial analysis of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan which has been forced to change by the proposed addition of an Eversource electric substation on part of Boston Properties’ Blue Garage. Putting the substation underground between Binney Street and Broadway spares residential Fulkerson Street in East Cambridge but is an expensive enough project to apparently call for another 800000 square feet of development in compensation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now after a public health doctorate at Harvard and a simultaneous MFA at Boston University she is working on her next novel and teaching creative writing at the University of Pennsylvania and Barnard College.

I stumbled upon Wang’s work two years ago when a friend recommended to me her short story “Omakase.” Shortly after I read Chemistry in one sitting. The narrator is a grad student in synthetic organic chemistry at an unnamed Boston area university. She is ambivalent about her career and marriage to her boyfriend who has proposed (and has a faculty job offer); she grapples with her immigrant upbringing being a woman in a male-dominated field her parents’ expectations. “It is a chicken and egg argument” the narrator says. “Did I go into science because I liked it? Or because I was in the beginning very good at it and then began to like it?”

“Such progress he’s made in one generation that to progress beyond him I feel as if I must leave America and colonize the moon” the narrator says referring to her father.

Wang and I chat over Zoom about career changes creativity chemistry classes and leaving pre-med. This interview has been edited for clarity.

AMC: Over the past few months my senior friends and I have been having a lot of conversations about why we want to do what we want to do. What were your 20s like?

WW: My 20s — now I’m 31 so my 20s were not that far — were pretty rocky. After undergrad I was in clinical research and I did that for two years while I was applying to med school.

Then I had a change of heart with medicine because I realized I was never a bedside care kind of individual. I’m not sure if I was ever that interested in research I just don’t remember a summer where I wasn’t doing it or learning science.

Now that I’m teaching English I often hear my students say I want to study English because I’ve been reading my entire life and I guess I like to read. This was the kind of the same mentality when I went into epidemiology. I started a masters and then I felt the pressure to finish. So I was in a doctorate for most of my 20s. I considered doing a postdoc which I didn’t do — thank God.

The hardest thing about my 20s was the unknowing. And the intense pressure I felt to pick a path because in the community that I grew up in the path had to be straightforward a to b or c. And saying you want to write it’s almost like saying you want to go to the moon or become a cow.

There was a lot of figuring out what I really want to do in the trenches. I use that word because for some of my friends their calling is medicine. They really like being in the trenches of medicine and they enjoy the day-to-day grind. Some people enjoy the day-to-day grind of research. I enjoy the day-to-day grind of writing. Like writing rewriting a novel 50 times.

AMC: What do you like about the day-to-day grind of writing?

WW: The problem solving — piecing together a really big puzzle. There are many ways to do it but there’s usually one right way to do it and that’s pretty enjoyable to figure out.

AMC: What do you mean by the right way to do it?

WW: I’ve torn down projects that my editor felt were okay but after a while I just thought weren’t right. That’s something I was never willing to do in science. If I or the group needed to just get the paper out I didn’t really care about the narrative or the how which is what PIs care about — getting the science perfectly right or doing that perfect experiment. But with writing I do care. And I think caring about something is incredibly important.

You have to care above all else. Your editor your agent your PI your postdoc whoever — they shouldn’t care as much as you do and when you find a field in which you are the person that cares the most then that is your field.

AMC: When you were in grad school you also did an MFA. How did you feel about switching tasks like when you were doing two degrees at once?

WW: Two degrees at once was just school and school for me is very straightforward. It was like undergrad — when you do a lot of different classes and activities at once you end up compartmentalizing. I liken it to switching between Chinese and English. But what happens after school launching your own thing that’s actually the stressful part.

I can’t believe I’m going to quote my father but he has often said school is the easy part work is much harder.

And I totally see it. Now I have this writing career that I’m still trying to launch and also my teaching duties and also being an adult.

AMC: On the subject of school when you look back on your undergrad now what are your main takeaways?

WW: I worked way too much. I had a pretty intense childhood and high school experience and then college was also intense. I was pretty stubborn so I just kept doing it.

Overall I’m quite happy with my Harvard experience. Granted that it was akin to being in a pressure cooker for four long years. Inevitably you get tired or worn down. Some people are great at continuing that momentum but after a while someone with that kind of intensity becomes socially different removed in a way. As an undergrad that’s totally fine as an adult maybe not so much.

AMC: Do a lot of people you know have this type of intensity at 30?

WW: Yes most of my peers/friends went into PhDs MDs or MD/PhD programs some went into consulting/finance all 80-100 hour work weeks and they like that since if you’re not dying on the job then what are you doing it for (the Harvard mentality I guess). But operating at that high intensity after a while does change people. I’m not saying that I’m not an intense person — I do have a pretty intense writing schedule — but the intensity in STEM is slightly different. There’s no or sometimes no emotional core. Even though most STEM people are quite emotional they simply bury it. Still spending a long time in an intense environment can truncate your personality I’ve noticed in the same way that going to Harvard after a while can truncate your personality.

I keep saying this and that about Harvard but truly I’m grateful for the opportunities the school gave me. Steep learning curve opened my eyes etc. And if I didn’t go there I wouldn’t have taken the writing classes I took met the people I did or had the experiences. Harvard is one of those things where if I knew what I know now about the school I’d probably be too scared to go. But now that I’m on the other side I’m grateful to have survived it.

AMC: When you say that you worked a lot in undergrad what did you spend your time working on?

WW: Mostly classes. I had a few extracurriculars. I should have done more but it was mostly lab work. There was no work life balance.

AMC: Did you do organic research?

WW: Yeah I did organometallics. I did systems bio one summer and then organometallics the last three years. I’m not a big organic synthesis person I didn’t love synthesis so my research was mostly kinetics based reaction mechanics.

AMC: What else did you do?

WW: I wrote for the Indy. I was part of a mentorship program called China Care volunteering. And then I supported my friends in clubs like Taiwanese Student Association or Chinese Student Association and helped them out with posting posters and organizing events.

I know that if I hadn’t been premed I would have done stuff that I enjoyed more. But as a premed you need volunteering shadowing clinical research you need exposure. Being premed is insane the way you have to stack your resume to make yourself seem human which is the opposite of what being a human is supposed to mean.

AMC: When did you start seriously questioning going to med school?

WW: I worked for a mildly/totally unhinged cardiologist for two years at Beth Israel. Mostly hung out around cardiologists and their research scientists and during this period I got even more disillusioned than I already was.

Don’t get me wrong I can appreciate my entire journey through science having taken some years away from it. I love learning science. I love being able to go from basic principles to larger ones. What I really hated was all the other crap that came with it how it could get petty and non-collaborative yet wrapped under the ruse of objectivity and truth seeking.

I’m sure other people have good clinical research experiences so maybe I was unlucky with mine. I did have great mentors and post-docs in all my other basic science labs although most were also pretty stressed and unhappy. It kind of just turned me around. When choosing a forever path you need to have role models. When I decided against premed I had no role models in medicine. I do still have role models in science: My husband who is a chemist and some other friends who stuck it out with research. But when I was 23 24 I was too hard on myself and sort of naive. I was going through a slow falling out of love with the scientific work itself because there’s so much more than the work and again my care for the work was waning. I felt that shouldn’t be happening. I shouldn't be waning in my love for clinical research at 23.

AMC: I feel like it’s very easy to be caught up in the grind. And when you’re in the middle of the grind it’s hard to think about what’s outside of the grind.

WW: To be honest medicine if you get through the first 10 years can be an easy career.

If you want to be a writer or go into the arts you have to have a vision. You have to have material and something to say contribute. It’s the same thing with going into independent research and starting your own lab.

Advertisement

In medicine you don’t need to do any of that. Some of my friends are attendings or fellows now and while the hours are long especially with the pandemic they clock in and clock out on a schedule. In a regular work week once they’re out of the hospital they’re out. They don’t need to think about it on their days off. If you’re an ER doctor you take six shifts and then maybe you go to the Caribbeans. Unfortunately and inevitably I think about writing 24/7. Sometimes I wake up from nightmares of not being able to fix something on the page and that’s when I know the novel isn’t going well. It’s perpetual anxiety and angst. Did I make a mistake choosing this? Was everyone around me right that science is what you do for a living and writing is just a hobby? Unhelpful questions of course self fulfilling prophecies.

AMC: What do you think about the grind in terms of writing? Is it linear?

WW: No it’s the most inefficient system I’ve ever dealt with. It’s hard. But overall I think it’s worthwhile because there are a lot of things I believe in that I want to get down. I might not get it right on the page every time it might not be art every time but that’s the goal. And I’m not pressuring myself to write the next great Asian American novel but I would love to be able to write something that is reflective of my experience and of people who are important to me. My parents and I came here for opportunities that they didn’t have and truthfully writing is one of them even if I know they believe that medicine or science is way more secure. So I do believe I’m honoring them in that way.

AMC: When you describe writing as art what do you mean?

WW: Creating something with clarity and beauty. Taking a very small part of your experience and polishing in a way that’s beautiful and not cliche. Science as its best can be art. The best experiments are really beautiful and simple. One of the things I learned from synthetic organic chemistry like with mathematical proofs was how graceful something could be on one page. And that’s kind of what I want to achieve with writing.

AMC: Out of curiosity did you take Chem 30?

WW: Yeah Brian Liau was actually a TF for it then and he’s one of the people who makes chemistry look like one plus one. And I also took Chem 206.

AMC: Advanced organic synthesis.

WW: My entire lab pressured me to do it. They were like Weike you’re not going to be a chemist if you don’t take 206. Clearly I didn’t become a chemist but I still took 206.

AMC: I shopped that class. They call it something else now.

Advertisement

WW laughing: That class was why I was in lab so much. I was trying to get everyone to help me with my last synthetic project because I couldn’t figure out how to make my molecule.

AMC: What were your favorite and least favorite classes? Anything in particular that stood out to you?

WW: I didn’t like the big life sciences classes. I really loved the smaller biology classes that were seminar based and where they taught you how to dissect scientific papers.

I liked Chem 135: Experimental Synthetic Chemistry. We were there overnight a couple times because once the compound was in the column and it wouldn’t come out you just have to stand there and wait until it does. But it was really fun because I was with a small group of three other people and we all got along.

I loved my workshop classes. Two classes with Amy Hempel one with Darcy Frey (audited this class while I was doing my doctorate) outstanding workshop classes if you can get into one and where I learned so much of my craft. I took a seminar with Elaine Scarry about the Brontes; that class was phenomenal. I personally excelled in a class that was smaller because I’m naturally kind of shy. So if it’s a class of even 30 or 40 people I just didn’t say anything. But if it was a class of 10 or 12 I found myself more able to voice my opinion and ask for help.

On the humanities side there were so many great teachers. It was like a warm bath going into the Barker Center.

And then you go to Mallinckrodt and then you’re just like I just want to cry.

AMC: Pfizer lecture hall. I spent a lot of time there.

WW: Yeah.

AMC: The doors are right in the front. So when you walk in everyone sees you.

Advertisement

WW: Everyone sees you and if you’re late you know…

AMC: Yeah.

WW: So much time spent in Pfizer that place will always be burned in my memory.

They underwent successful stent procedures at affordable costs during a workshop on ‘Complex Stenting Procedures’ organised by the Department of Cardiology J N Medical College (JNMC) Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).

“Stents were given at low cost to these patients suffering from cardiovascular issues. These six people were candidates for open-heart bypass surgery” said Prof M U Rabbani Chairman Department of Cardiology.

He added that at least one of these patients went through the intricate rotablation technique procedure in which a special catheter with an acorn-shaped diamond-coated tip is guided to the point of the narrowing in the coronary artery. The tip spins at a high speed and grinds away the plaque on the artery walls.

According to Prof Rabbani “These patients suffered ‘Left Main Coronary Artery Disease’. They had totally blocked coronary arteries of long duration and coronary arteries with deposition of high calcium. Angioplasty (Stenting) in these patients has been possible with the use of advanced technologies such as coronary vessel imaging with Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) and a newer technique of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).”

Prof Rabbani pointed out that stent procedures are not only complex but they are also done on exorbitant charges at super-specialty hospitals in metropolitan cities.

“However with economical treatments on offer at JNMC patients from the lower-economic strata can breathe a sigh of relief” he asserted.

Prof Rabbani further said that JNMC has been one of the few medical institutes in the country which has been conducting medical procedures despite the Covid 19 restrictions.

“JNMC Cath lab remained fully functional after a surge in Covid cases and hundreds of patients benefitted from cardiology teleconsultation services on the helpline number 7599050505 during the lockdown period. A total of 900 cardiac procedures have been done in the Cath lab since March” he stated.

Dr Viveka Kumar (Director Interventional Cardiology Max Saket Hospital New Delhi) helped to conduct the workshop. Boston Scientific USA and Medtronics USA provided the technical support and logistics for the workshop.

Prof Asif Hasan Prof M M Azharuddin and Dr M Rafi Anwar delineated the purpose and procedure of stents. They explained how stents keep blocked arteries from closing."

Kuri implemented the principles and offerings of The Red Shoe Movement as a framework for guiding and structuring that work and saw participation in the D&I program grow from 25 to more than 150 people.

For Kuri the experience further stoked a passion to make a difference helping other women and minorities in their careers – and in their lives. After more than 14 years in Commercial roles she changed course and found a position at BMS that let her marry her passion for diversity and inclusion with the opportunity to improve health equity and ultimately enhance the development of medicines for all populations.



“I decided to connect my passion and my purpose and I pivoted my career” she said.



Clinical Trial Diversity and Bristol Myers Squibb



Kuri joined Bristol Myers Squibb as director Clinical Trial Diversity Strategy in the summer of 2019. Since then the importance of the role which is based in R&D’s Global Drug Development organization has only increased.

The global COVID-19 pandemic exposed persistent health disparities that leave under-resourced and minority communities at greater risk of poor outcomes. This health crisis came on the heels of renewed attention to the serious challenges facing the Black/African American community following the death of George Floyd.



“Bristol Myers Squibb started working on this very important topic before the pandemic. Today expanding the opportunity to help medically underserved populations is even more important” she said.



The company underscored its commitment to these issues at the end of 2020 when the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation and National Medical Fellowships launched a $100 million program to train and develop 250 new clinical investigators who are racially and ethnically diverse or who have a demonstrated commitment to increasing diversity in clinical trials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzI0LzMtdG9wLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc3RvY2tzLXRoYXQtY2FuLW1ha2UteW91LXJpY2hlci1pL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Top Healthcare Stocks That Can Make You Richer in 2021 (and Beyond),"The future is bright for these three companies and investors who buy today could win big.

Despite the prevalence of get-rich-quick schemes those looking to grow their capital need not reinvent the wheel. Investing in stocks remains one of the best ways to do that. But not all securities are created equal. With an unlimited number of investment options on the market picking the wrong ones could mean waving goodbye to your hard-earned money.

Investing in shares of great companies is the key to achieving your financial goals. With that in mind here are three excellent stocks that should make you richer over the long-run if you buy today: Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.32%) Veeva Systems (VEEV 1.07%) and Eli Lilly (LLY 1.45%). Here's why each of these companies deserves a place in your portfolio.

1. Bristol Myers Squibb

Pharma giant Bristol Myers has a strong lineup of medicines a rich pipeline and a juicy dividend all of which can help drive revenue and earnings higher while rewarding investors with dividend increases.

The company boasts at least eight blockbuster drugs including multiple myeloma treatment Revlimid which saw sales in the third quarter of 2020 jump by 10% year over year to $3 billion. Bristol Myers got its hands on Revlimid thanks to its 2019 acquisition of Celgene in a cash and stock transaction valued at $74 billion.The deal bolstered the company's lineup with other products like Pomalyst another multiple myeloma drug. During the third quarter sales of Pomalyst increased by 17% year over year to $777 million. Bristol Myers also markets anticoagulant Eliquis which brought in revenue during the third quarter of $2.1 billion a 9% increase from the year-ago period.

Turning to Bristol Myers' pipeline the company has more than four dozen clinical compounds in development and at least as many ongoing clinical trials including a raft of phase 3 studies. Newly approved products (or new indications for existing products) are likely to boost the drugmaker's financial results in the coming years.

Despite its stock underperforming the broader market of late Bristol Myers' prospects look enticing. The company's revenue and earnings are set to keep growing at a good clip. Three of its drugs Revlimid Eliquis and Opdivo will be among the five best-selling drugs in the world in 2024 according to research firm Evaluate Pharma.

Bristol Myers also closed its latest acquisition in November: a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company called MyoKardia in an all-cash transaction worth $13.1 billion. MyoKardia's leading pipeline candidate is mavacamten a potential treatment for a chronic heart disease called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Management believes ""mavacamten has multibillion-dollar potential"" and it could be yet another long-term growth driver.

Lastly with a dividend yield of 2.80% (compared to a 1.55% yield for the S&P 500) and a low cash payout ratio of 31.8% investors can count on Bristol Myers to continue increasing its dividends. All these factors make this pharma stock an excellent pick for 2021 and beyond.

2. Veeva Systems

Veeva Systems' mission is to help companies in different sectors including the life sciences industry bring their products to the market faster and more efficiently while ensuring regulatory compliance. The company works with many of the top players in the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors including AstraZeneca Merck and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Veeva's founder and CEO Peter Gassner is a former executive of the cloud-based software giant salesforce.com. Veeva Systems and Salesforce have a long-standing partnership that allows the former to utilize Salesforce's platform to run its cloud-based services.

Veeva's list of products includes Veeva Vault which helps drugmakers sail through the complex process of clinical trials. The company's largest segment by revenue is subscription services. During the first nine months of its fiscal year 2021 which ended on Oct. 31 Veeva Systems reported $1.07 billion in revenue representing a 34.8% year-over-year increase. The company's subscription services revenue accounted for about 80% of its total revenue.

Veeva has an excellent retention rate for its services. For its 2017 2018 and 2019 years its retention rate was 127% 121% and 122% respectively. On top of that the company is developing newer products to better assist its clientele. Veeva Systems has branched out beyond the life sciences industry and into other regulated ones namely consumer packaged goods (CPG) chemicals and cosmetics.

The company's vision for these sectors is the same as it is in the life sciences industry. During the first three quarters of its fiscal year 2021 Veeva Systems generated about $30 million in revenue from these spaces which represented nearly 8% of its total revenue.

It also has more than 60 customers from these three sectors and the company sees a growing opportunity especially given the changing environment of the CPG chemical and cosmetics industries brought about by the pandemic. Veeva Systems looks to be on a solid path to consistent revenue and earnings growth for the foreseeable future and its stock price should continue to climb too.

3. Eli Lilly

Eli Lilly is another pharma giant with a rich suite of drugs. Some of the company's top sellers include Trulicity a diabetes medicine that had sales of $3.6 billion for the first nine months of 2020 a 22% jump. Other top performers include insulin product Basaglar and oral diabetes drug Jardiance. For the first nine months of 2020 revenue from the former rose by 5% to $842.3 million while sales of Jardiance increased by 24% year over year to $840.3 million.

Lilly also has well over three dozen ongoing clinical trials. One of the company's pipeline candidates is a potential drug for Alzheimer's disease called donanemab. The company recently reported positive results from a phase 2 clinical trial for it.There are more than 5 million Alzheimer's patients in the U.S. and there are no approved drugs that can treat the cognitive declines associated with it. While there is still a long road ahead for donanemab investors would do well to monitor its progress.

It is worth noting that Biogen's aducanumab is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication. Both aducanumab and donanemab look to treat the disease by removing amyloid-beta plaques from patients' brains which some professionals believe could help those who suffer from Alzheimer's. But considering that an advisory panel of experts strongly recommended the FDA not approve the drug Biogen's prospects look unfavorable.

Eli Lilly recently beefed up its pipeline with its planned acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics a biotech that focuses on developing gene therapies in a cash transaction valued at around $880 million. Lilly already had a lot going for it and this move only made its long-term prospects even more appealing thanks to potential drugs that target Parkinson's disease and dementia conditions for which there are no standard treatments. In short adding shares of this pharma giant to your portfolio would be a great move for your money.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L2JyaWVmcy1sb2NhbC1idXNpbmVzc3Blb3BsZS1pbmNsdWRpbmctcnlhbi1tYXJjb3V4LWJldHRpbmEtZGF2aWRzLXRvbmktZHVwZWxsLWFuZC1rcmlzc3ktYW5kZXJzb24vNDIyMjI5ODAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Briefs on local businesspeople including Ryan Marcoux Bettina Davids Toni Dupell and Krissy Anderson.,"The Milford Daily News

Brown Dish on This Is Us Podcast (Exclusive),"Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are teaming up to launch a This Is Us rewatch podcast titled That Was Us.

PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the podcast's new trailer which teases what fans can expect when That Was Us officially makes its debut on Tuesday May 14.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMTIwMTIwLWJyYW5kb24tYWl5dWstdHJhZGUtcnVtb3JzLTQ5ZXJzLXdhbnRlZC1hai1icm93bi1oYXVsLWluLTFzdC1yb3VuZC1vZi1uZmwtZHJhZnTSAYwBaHR0cHM6Ly9zeW5kaWNhdGlvbi5ibGVhY2hlcnJlcG9ydC5jb20vYW1wLzEwMTIwMTIwLWJyYW5kb24tYWl5dWstdHJhZGUtcnVtb3JzLTQ5ZXJzLXdhbnRlZC1hai1icm93bi1oYXVsLWluLTFzdC1yb3VuZC1vZi1uZmwtZHJhZnQuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brandon Aiyuk Trade Rumors: 49ers Wanted 'A.J. Brown' Haul in 1st Round of NFL Draft,"Cooper Neill/Getty Images

San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk was a popular name floated in trade rumors leading up to the 2024 NFL draft but it sounds like the asking price for him was fairly steep.

ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported on Tuesday that ""much of the league was keeping a close eye on the 49ers' handling of the wide receiver position throughout the draft."" However many teams learned that San Francisco was seeking a similar haul to what the Tennesee Titans received when they traded star receiver A.J. Brown to the Philadelphia Eagles.

""Multiple teams told me they had interest in Brandon Aiyuk but they believed the 49ers wanted a first-round pick for him with one comparing the situation to that of A.J. Brown who went from Tennessee to Philadelphia in 2022 in exchange for the 18th pick"" Fowler explained. ""The Eagles then signed him to a four-year $100 million contract. Trading for Aiyuk would have required a new deal and a premium pick.""

Aiyuk is entering the final year of his contract and is set to make $14.1 million in the 2024 season. He has not been shy about his desire to receive a new contract but it doesn't appear that there has been much progress on that front.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3Z1c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvNS82L2Jsb2ctZm9vdGJhbGwtbm90ZWJvb2stYnJvd24taW4tZmF2b3Itb2YtbmNhYS1ydWxlLWNoYW5nZXMtZm9yLTIwMjQuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Football Notebook: Brown in Favor of NCAA Rule Changes for 2024 - West Virginia University Athletics,"MORGANTOWN W.Va. – West Virginia coachsaid late last month that he is in favor of college football having rules similar to professional football.""As a casual fan in terms of the game on Saturday or Sunday it should look very similar"" Brown said following the annual Gold-Blue Spring Game last month. ""There are way too many differences right now so it's somewhat confusing for the novice fan.""The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel adopted three significant rule changes for 2024 that have been in place in the NFL for many years.Beginning this fall teams will be able to use coach-to-player communications via radio transmitters in helmets to an offensive and defensive player on the field. Those players will be identified by having a green dot on the back midline of their helmet.Brown said they have been experimenting with the new communications system for a while now in practice in anticipation of the rule change.""(During the spring game) we were really vanilla with it"" he said. ""We used it in the bowl game and we've used it the last two springs so it's not necessarily new to us but we're using a different company now. I think it's going to help the game. It's going to help defenses as well. People are kind of underestimating that but it's really going to help the defenses.""West Virginia's middle linebackers have been using the helmet communications system but Brown indicated that it's still to be determined who will use it in the games this fall. Overall he believes helmet communications will alleviate some of the sloppiness that can take place on the sidelines.""If you feel like a team really has your signals it gives you some options on how you want to communicate"" he noted.NFL teams have been communicating with quarterbacks via helmets since 1994 and NFL defenders have been doing so since 2008.Tablets will also be permitted this year on the sidelines to view in-game video only. The video can include the game broadcast feed and camera angles from the sideline and the end zone.Up to 18 active tablets for use in the coaching booth sideline and locker room will be permitted. They cannot be connected to projection devices and cannot include analytics data or data accessing capabilities.Another rule synonymous with the NFL is the two-minute warning its origins dating back to the early days of the league when game time was kept by a member of the officiating crew on the field. Its function was to serve as a checkpoint to make sure both teams were aware of the time remaining in the game.When television became prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s the two-minute warning took on more significance as a means of building drama for the conclusion of the game.College football is adopted a two-minute warning as a method of synchronizing end-of-game timing rules according to secretary-rules editor Steve Shaw. It will also help avoid consecutive media time outs at the conclusions of each half.""I think it's great for the officials and clock operators because the rules change under two minutes so it's a good reminder for them"" Brown said. ""There is going to be some strategy involved from a coaching perspective. Do you take a timeout before the two-minute warning?""The two-minute warnings at the end of the second and fourth quarters will not be an additional timeout but rather serves as fixed stopping points when television will know it can take media breaks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L29iaXR1YXJ5aWRhLW1hcmllLWJyb3duLXdpbGxzLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: Ida Marie Brown Wills,"RUTHERFORDTON NC/RAYMOND ME – Ida Marie Brown Wills was born in Wood Pa. on April 8 1932 the daughter of Raymond and Julia Brongzeski.

This story was updated with statements by Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds

An op-ed published by Australian newspaper The Australian Financial Review on the Attack-class submarine program blames Naval Group for being over budget late on schedule and for failing in its commitment to spend 60 per cent of the contract value locally. According to Naval Group such reporting does not reflect facts. The program is actually about to achieve yet another milestone the System Functional Review (SFR) as planned and on schedule.

Cost increases explained

Following the Strategic Partnering Agreement signed in 2019 and which covers the 2019-2056 timeframe several specific contracts will be signed as the program progresses. An initial Submarine Design contract was signed for the 2019-2021 period while a follow-on Submarine Design contract was negotiated at the end of 2020 for the 2021-2023 period.

Negotiations took place from September to December 2020 and encompassed new customer requirements that had emerged in the earlier phases. “The budget for the next phase was defined for a particular perimeter. If you add in new demands obviously this comes at a cost.” a Naval Group source working on the Attack-class program explained.

Another factor which impacted the program cost estimate is that several suppliers submitted higher than expected quotations. “Our initial proposal was turned down and the Australian government asked Naval Group to submit a new proposal that would be more in line with their allocated budget. As a consequence Naval Group committed to work on a new improved offer which will be submitted at the end of February. Contrary to what media reports claimed our offer was nowhere near 50% above the Australian’s Defense Department budget. This percentage was not accurate at all” our source added. The allocated budget for this phase is reportedly comprised between AUD $2.5 billion and $3 billion.

Naval Group right on target with the program schedule

Naval Group will be achieving the SFR in the coming days in accordance with the program schedule. The next step will be the Basic Design which will start in February 2021 as planned and will be completed by the end of 2023. The detailed design will follow while the construction of the first-in-class ship is still planned to begin in 2023.

“I can confirm that at the end of January 2021 we will start the SFR as planned as scheduled as announced by Defense Minister Reynolds and Defense Minister Parly. This commitment will be met despite the ongoing health crisis despite the 15000 Km separating Australia and France despite the travel restrictions…The Attack-class program is right on target and not even a day late”.



Naval Group source working on the Attack-class program

French media inaccurately claimed that Naval Group’s CEO Pierre Eric Pommelet rushed to Australia in order to engage in some kind damage control operation following the report by the Australian newspaper. Again this is not accurate. Pommelet who declared the program as the main priority for the company when he took office back in March will be traveling to Australia in February. This trip was planned long ago to match with the successful SFR milestone and to celebrate the start of the Basic Design phase which is a major step for the program. “Our CEO doesn’t travel halfway around the world because of some alleged information leaked in the press…” a source familiar with the matter told Naval News.

What about local content ?

In the Strategic Partnering Agreement signed in February 2019 Naval Group signed a contractual commitment which objective is to maximize the Australian content in the program. However following an initial defamation campaign in the press in early 2020 Naval Group took upon itself the commitment for at least 60 per cent of the contract value to be spent in Australia. This was done in February 2020 in front of a Senate committee.

This commitment which covers the entire program (i.e. all twelve submarines and the entire duration of the program) has to be inked as part of a new contract in order to become binding and official. An initial contract was submitted by Naval Group in late 2020… but the government has yet to sign this contract.

Meanwhile the Submarine Construction Yard in Osborne South Australia is taking shape and the number of Australian companies involved in the program is growing steadily with a first AUD$900 million package for the local industry launched in November 2020.

“For the time being a lot of the design work is taking place in Cherbourg France but this was planned since the beginning and this is where Naval Group’s and France’ submarine design expertise come into play. This design phase will last 5 years which is very marginal compared to the lifetime of the program. As production starts obviously the share of Australian contract value will grow significantly” our source explained.

To streamline the exchange of information and help with the program defense ministers of both countries Florence Parly and Linda Reynolds started holding quarterly meetings. These meetings are still ongoing and the last one took place in December 2020. The French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) which belongs to the French Ministry of Armed Forces is committed to the Attack-class program as well. For example the DGA bring its technical expertise for the SFR and throughout the design phase of the program.

Update: Statement by Linda Reynolds on 01/25/2021

During a press conference held at Henderson Naval Base on 25 January 2021 Australia’s Defence Minister showed her full support to the Attack-class program:

JOURNALIST: Just on the submarines is Australia seriously considering ditching its Naval Group contract and replacing the Collins class with an updated version?

LINDA REYNOLDS: Look I’ve seen those reports and what I can confirm is that the Future Submarine Program is our nation’s largest and most complex project. We are acquiring the next generation our future submarines to replace the Collins class submarine which are still only halfway through their life so we’ll have the new fleet ready from the 2030s and beyond.

So we are absolutely committed – I’m absolutely committed. I work very carefully and closely with my French counterpart Minister Florence Parly and we are both committed to making this project work. And I note today there was a great article that Naval Group Australia is now heading towards 500 Australians working at their headquarters in Adelaide.

So yes it is a large and complex project but we are all committed to making this work so that after the Collins we have and we continue to have a regionally superior submarine. Contrary to rumours it is not over budget and it is not over time.

JOURNALIST: Are you and the Prime Minister frustrated with the cost of the project?

LINDA REYNOLDS: Well as I’ve just said it has not – from when we went into contract with Naval Group – it’s not one cent over budget and I’m working very hard as are the French the Government to make sure that this is delivered on time and on budget.

JOURNALIST: What about deadlines? Are there any failures in meeting early deadlines?

LINDA REYNOLDS: We did have five weeks’ slippage in the design phase early on. Even during COVID Naval Group have made up some of that time. But again when you consider this is a multi-decade project five weeks in the early design phase is you know acceptable. But we’re coming up to the next deadline which is due this month moving into the next design phase and we are working very hard as I know Naval Group is to ensure that they keep meeting their deadlines.

About Australia’s Attack-class Submarine

Source: Navy News the official newspaper of the Royal Australian Navy

Construction on the first ship-in-class (the future HMAS Attack) is set to start in 2023 and its delivery should take place in the early 2030ies. The next units will follow with a cadence of one submarine every two years.

For the record the Australian Government selected Naval Group (then known as DCNS) as its preferred international partner for the design of 12 Future submarines for the Royal Australian Navy on April 26 2016. In the SEA1000 project DCNS was competing with the Shortfin Barracuda design against Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) Type 216 and Japan’s Soryu-class designs. Based on the new Barracuda nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) of the French Navy (the first ship has already been delivered) Australia’s Attack-class submarine will be 97 meters in length and 8.8 meters in diameter.

The Attack-class design is based on a conventional version of the Barracuda SSN (Suffren-class) and has a sloped-front sail bow diving planes and a pump-jet propulsor (instead of a propeller) with an X-rudder. Lockheed Martin was announced as the Future Submarine Combat System Integrator in September 2016 and the Design Build and Integration Contract was signed 12 January 2018. The Attack-class sensors and processing systems are supposed to be superior in every way to the Collins-class and will possess the AN/BYG-1 combat system with the armament consisting of eight x 533 mm (21-inch) torpedo tubes with an inventory of 28 torpedoes being Mark 48 MOD 7 heavyweight torpedo Harpoon anti-ship missiles or Mk III Stonefish mines.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many people remember watching celebrities like Muhammad Ali or Elvis Presley on their living room TVs in the 1970s.

Lorenzo Doumani remembers watching them in his living room.

Growing up the son of a Las Vegas casino landlord Doumani recalls the heavyweight champ stopping by his house for dinner and hanging out backstage with the king of rock ’n’ roll.

Occasionally Doumani would be at the Tropicana with Ali and Presley while they practiced karate in a hotel room he said.

“I got to do karate drills with Elvis and Muhammad Ali” he said. “Probably not many people in the world can say they did that.”

Decades later Doumani a 58-year-old real estate developer reflected on growing up amid Las Vegas royalty as he prepared to erect what will be his mark on the city.

Doumani is the man behind Majestic Las Vegas a planned $850 million off-Strip hotel and nongaming entertainment complex.

The project will break ground later this year near the Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall expansion with a planned opening in 2024.

Doumani’s family is responsible for some other Las Vegas landmarks too.

His grandfather M.K. Doumani came to Las Vegas from California some 60 years ago and with Lorenzo’s uncle opened the old La Concha Motel which was across from the former Riviera in 1961.

A few years later they opened the El Morocco. Both attracted some of the most well-known celebrities of the time.

“Back then the La Concha and El Morocco were these state-of-the-art places that appealed to upscale clientele. People like Ali Liz Taylor Ronald Reagan Wayne Newton Elvis” he said. “I got to grow up meeting all those people which was quite a thrill.”

Though the La Concha has long since closed the motel’s eye-catching wavy façade — designed by famed architect Paul R. Williams — can still be seen today downtown as the reimagined lobby for the Neon Museum.

As a teen Doumani said he sometimes worked out with Ali and watched him perform card tricks.

Ali also frequented the coffee shop at the Tropicana where Doumani’s father Edward was landlord for a few years in the 1970s.

He recalled one spring day in 1975 before an Ali fight at the Las Vegas Convention Center as being particularly memorable.

“We were sitting there in the coffee shop” Doumani said. “All of a sudden Ali looks at his watch and says ‘Oh my gosh my fight is in two hours.’ We gave him a ride to the Convention Center and I remember sitting next to George Foreman while watching that fight which was against a boxer named Ron Lyle.”

Doumani still remembers how the fight ended — a technical knockout for Ali in the 11th round.

In the latter part of the 1970s Doumani spent time with Presley backstage before he performed at the Las Vegas Hilton.

“He would sing gospel songs backstage and quote scripture” Doumani said. “You couldn’t have met a nicer human being.”

He ate many meals at Peppermill Restaurant and Lounge on the Strip which his family has had some ownership in since the 1970s. He bought the majority of the property which is within walking distance of the proposed Majestic Las Vegas site in 2012.

Peggy Orth who manages the restaurant vividly remembers a young Doumani coming in to eat with his family. She was a waitress then.

“His dad and uncle were pretty prominent back then” Orth said. “He was a rich kid but always very respectful. Lorenzo isn’t snooty or demanding like some owners would be. You can approach him and I think he got that from his dad who probably got it from Lorenzo’s grandfather.”

Doumani still stops in “every week or two” at the Peppermill usually stopping by with his two young boys Dylan 13 and Tyler 10 (he also has an adult daughter Sophia who lives in Boise Idaho).

If Orth isn’t busy she’ll sit down to visit — often about what the kids are up to — as Doumani eats his usual egg white garden omelet. It’s just like when Doumani’s father took him to eat at the Peppermill when he was a child.

“Those days when Ed and Mrs. Doumani used to come in I miss those days” Orth said. ""They knew what this town was built on — personal relationships. A lot of things these days are more corporate.”

Family of Vegas pioneers

Doumani who has dabbled in the movie business in Los Angeles splits his time between Southern California where his two sons live and Las Vegas.

Whether it’s Presley Ali or Steve Wynn — Edward Doumani was an early business partner of the billionaire casino developer — Doumani is likely to have a personal story about the old legends of Las Vegas.

Growing up Doumani’s family lived near Our Lady of Las Vegas Catholic Church just northwest of the Strip.

Thinking back to those days Doumani can rattle off the names of some of the most prominent families in Las Vegas over the past several decades.

He was in the same class at Bishop Gorman High School as Frank Fertitta III the billionaire Station Casinos mogul though Doumani took advanced courses and ended up graduating early from Clark High School.

They would later attend the University of Southern California where Doumani said the pair were study partners.

“I met the Fertittas in the mid-1970s” Doumani said. “Frank’s father (Frank Fertitta Jr.) was a slots manager at the Tropicana in those days. There’s so many of these families that have been around forever. They’re all still around for the most part. I think there will always be a little bit of that history in Las Vegas.”

Doumani also palled around with Danny Tarkanian in high school the son of UNLV coaching great Jerry Tarkanian. He also remembers a pre-UFC Dana White as a personal trainer in the late 1990s who would make house calls.

Tarkanian said he remembers Doumani being “very sharp” from a young age.

“The Doumani family doesn’t get the credit they deserve for being the Las Vegas pioneers that they’ve been” Tarkanian said.

Doumani was also friends with the family of Jay Sarno who founded Caesars Palace and Circus Circus and was a mentor to Wynn.

“I remember Jay Sarno saying in the 1970s that we were going to see these megacasino-resorts with 4000 rooms” Doumani said. “That was visionary. Nobody was thinking that way back then.”

A niche on the north Strip

In Majestic Las Vegas Doumani envisions a place for convention visitors and other business-focused customers a place with an “old school” feel and small showrooms with live jazz acts.

Doumani is banking on a trend that has been in motion for several decades in Las Vegas — more visitor dollars in Las Vegas are spent on the overall experience not simply on gambling.

“When I was growing up gaming was 70-something percent of revenues” Doumani said. “You’d give away a show and do a $9.99 buffet to get people in casinos so they’d lose their money. That’s what used to fuel Vegas but that’s no longer the case. We’ve become more diverse.”

In 1984 according to UNLV’s Center for Gaming Research gaming win represented 59% of total revenues. By 2019 that figure had dropped to 35%.

Before the coronavirus pandemic taking in a show concert or sporting event or eating at a renowned restaurant were as important as ever to the Las Vegas experience.

Due to the pandemic Las Vegas visitation was down by about half in 2020 from the 2019 total of over 42 million tourists.

In the next decade Doumani expects gaming to make up less than 30% of resort revenues something that would have been unheard of when his father was in the casino business in the 1970s.

“Las Vegas has almost everything” Doumani said. “But what I think it should have is a different type of resort something that’s nongaming nonsmoking and goes after a different kind of corporate crowd.”

Doumani has high hopes for the north Strip though he admits the recovery from the pandemic will be “a long road.”

He already has a vested interest in the area. He is majority owner of the building that houses the Peppermill Restaurant and Lounge.

Once the convention industry in Las Vegas — all but non-existent during the last half of 2020 — returns trade shows like CES which brings over 170000 attendees to the city during a normal year are likely to be a boon for Doumani’s planned resort.

“This is a resilient city with resilient people” Doumani said. “The people here adapt. When something doesn’t work we change it. You’re only as good as the people who live here and we’ve got some great people.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9jYXRhd2JhLW5vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLWZpbmFsaXplLWdhbWluZy1jb21wYWN0LWZvci10d28ta2luZ3MtY2FzaW5vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Catawba North Carolina Finalize Gaming Compact for Two Kings Casino,"Catawba North Carolina Finalize Class III Gaming Compact for Two Kings Casino

Posted on: January 23 2021 03:01h.

Last updated on: January 24 2021 08:07h.

The Catawba Nation is another step closer to operating a tribal casino in North Carolina. Late Friday the tribe announced on its Facebook page it reached an agreement with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper regarding a Class III gaming compact.

Catawba Nation Chief Bill Harris testifies at a U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee Hearing in May 2019. Late Friday the sovereign tribal nation announced an agreement on a gaming compact with North Carolina that will allow the tribe to offer Class III gaming in the state. (Image: Catawba Nation/Facebook)

The document was not available for review. However a press release issued Saturday afternoon detailed some of the provisions that will allow the South Carolina-based tribe to build a $273 million casino resort in Kings Mountain 30 miles west of Charlotte.

With work on the compact completed we will advance the project from the site preparation phase to vertical construction of an introductory casino gaming facility to open this fall” Chief Bill Harris said in the release.

Tribal Administrator Elizabeth Harris told Casino.org on Saturday the compact will go to the US Department of Interior on Monday. The Interior Secretary will have 45 days from receipt to approve or reject it.

Terms Similar to EBCI Compact

The Catawba release said the terms of the compact resemble a similar agreement North Carolina has with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI).

In exchange for the right to offer table games Catawba will give the state a share of the proceeds from those games. Tribal and state leaders expect that to eventually generate between $5 million and $10 million for North Carolina.

The state will also receive $191000 to offset its cost to regulate sports betting.

The casino will also make payments “in lieu of taxes” to Cleveland County where the casino will be based.

In addition the casino will transfer funding to a foundation to serve the Catawba other tribes and the local community. Transfers will start at $1 million annually but when the casino resort is fully operational those yearly payments will reach $7.5 million.

Officials expect the Two Kings Casino Resort to generate $300 million in economic activity and create up to 4000 jobs.

“Kings Mountain will become a major economic engine in North Carolina” Kings Mountain Mayor Scott Neisler in the release. “We look forward to creating thousands of good jobs for our hardworking local people. We thank the Catawba Nation for extending their hand of partnership in making this dream a reality.”

Lawsuit Over Two Kings Project Ongoing

While the Catawba move forward with its casino plans EBCI continues its federal lawsuit seeking to stop the project.

The Cherokee tribe owns two Harrah’s casinos in the western part of the state. The closest to Two Kings is about 130 miles away.

In the suit EBCI claims the Catawbas are only entering North Carolina because they cannot get a similar agreement to operate a Class III casino in South Carolina. The Cherokees also claim an ancestral tie to the 17 acres where the casino is being built.

The Cherokees requested the case be expedited since casino operations are expected to start on site later this year.

Both the Interior Department and the Catawbas are seeking summary judgment to dismiss the case.

“EBCI’s argument has been rejected by several courts—and embraced by none” lawyers representing Catawba wrote in a Jan. 11 filing in the case.

EBCI expects a $100 million annual impact on their casino revenues as a result of Two Kings. While seeking to stop the project Cherokee officials have also moved forward with plans to expand into commercial gaming to mitigate the loss in tribal gaming revenue.

Last month EBCI entered into an agreement to buy Caesars Southern Indiana from Caesars Entertainment which operates the two Harrah’s casinos for the tribe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVhdHNoZWV0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L29uZS1vZi1kaW5lcnMtZHJpdmUtaW5zLWFuZC1kaXZlcy1tb3N0LXBvcHVsYXItYnVyZ2VyLWpvaW50cy1oYXMtYW4taW5jcmVkaWJseS10cmFnaWMtc3RvcnkuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One of 'Diners Drive-Ins and Dives' Most Popular Burger Joints Has an Incredibly Tragic Story,"'Diners Drive-Ins and Dives' host Guy Fieri has visited Hodad's in San Diego numerous times throughout the show's history. But despite its massive popularity the burger joint actually has an incredibly tragic story.

Diners Drive-Ins and Dives host Guy Fieri has visited Hodad’s in San Diego numerous times throughout the show’s history. The restaurant has also been part of other Food Network specials and it’s become a destination for fans.

The Ocean Beach staple is a classic American diner with walls covered in classic license plates and a menu that features a famous assortment of burgers. But despite its massive popularity the burger joint actually has an incredibly tragic story.

‘Diners Drive-Ins and Dives’ featured Hodad’s in seasons 2 and 17

Fieri first visited Hodad’s for Diners Drive-Ins and Dives in season 2 during an episode titled “Seaside Eats.” He returned in season 17 in the episode titled “All San Diego All the Time.”

The celebrity chef also returned to the restaurant in 2019 to shoot another Food Network program. And it was featured on the channel’s “Top 10 Burgers” and “With Bacon” specials.

According to 10 News San Diego the relationship between Hodad’s and Fieri inspired the restaurant’s Guido Burger. That is a pastrami-smothered burger topped with swiss cheese grilled onions pickles ketchup and spicy brown mustard.

When Fieri visits he always takes the opportunity to mingle with the crew and take selfies with fans. And on the Diners Drive-Ins and Dives website Fieri puts Hodad’s at the top of his recommendations list. Not only does he love their burgers but he also loves their motto of “no shirts no problem.”

Hodad’s owner was a local burger legend

In 1969 Mike Hardin moved to San Diego with his parents when they opened Hodad’s at Ocean Beach. Over the years Hardin’s cooking skills – and his affiliation with Fieri – made him a local burger legend. He took over the restaurant from his parents in the 1980s and he ended up opening two more Hodad’s locations. One in downtown San Diego and the other in Petco Park.

Hardin was a local celebrity and “favorite son” who had been dubbed “the unofficial mayor of Ocean Beach.” He was known for his kindness generosity and charming smile. As well as his mohawk and his tattooed knuckles that read “Boss Man!”

But in 2015 tragedy struck when Hardin was found dead in a Holiday Inn hotel room. According to The San Diego Tribune Hardin checked into the hotel off state Route 99 in Chowchilla California on a Wednesday night after visiting his daughter in Oregon. The next morning hotel staff found him dead. There was no evidence of foul play. But the coroner did perform an autopsy on the 54-year-old because the death was unexpected.

The coroner’s report obtained by San Diego NBC 7 News showed that Hardin had died from a heart attack. It was brought on by an enlarged heart and severe coronary artery disease. The coroner also found evidence of a previous heart attack plus lung and liver problems.

The host of ‘Diners Drive-Ins and Dives’ paid tribute to Mike Hardin

Hardin’s death was a massive blow to the Ocean Beach community as well as the city of San Diego. Thousands of his friends and family gathered at Petco Park to pay tribute to the owner of the city’s iconic burger joint. The celebration of life featured a tribute video and live music performances. Fieri also spoke at the event as he and Hardin had become close friends over the years.

“There’s so many other words that help explain Mike. I want you to think about these words for a second because they’ll touch each and every one of us in a different way” Fieri said.

Among the words he listed were respect love and appreciative. But Fieri said there was one word that mattered most of all.

“Friend is a deep word. Friend is all of those words coming together and Mike was that. And Mike was a friend in any capacity: if he just met you if he knew you or he was your dad…he was your friend” Fieri said as he hugged Hardin’s son Shane.

Fieri also shared his thoughts about Hardin on Twitter. He wrote “RIP Mike Hardin “boss man”. You helped the world in so many ways. We will miss you everyday.”

The reversal in course comes after Godiva has been hurt by a move away from mall shopping that was already underway before COVID-19 and related restrictions accelerated the trend.

Godiva has 116 locations in the United States according to the company’s website. They are in 31 states and Puerto Rico. In addition to its traditional boutique candy shops the new locations have included cafes.

The states with the most locations are California with 20 New York with eight and New Jersey with eight.

Amid the challenge for brick-and-mortar retailers is a trend observed by PYMNTS.com research: shoppers who are most likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine are among those most likely to continue shopping online more than they did pre-pandemic.

Godiva is expected to retain its locations in Europe the Middle East and China.

Godiva is owned by Yildiz Holding which is based in Istanbul Turkey.

In December Yildiz placed Nurtac Ziyal Afridi at the helm of Godiva long-term after she spent two months running the company on an interim basis.

Announcing the appointment of Alfridi Yildiz said in a prepared statement that she and her “leadership team developed a three-year strategy to seize new opportunities through Godiva’s dynamic omnichannel structure.”

“We will continue to extend our reach and leverage an omnichannel approach to deliver on our beloved brand maintaining a strong connection with our fans and ensuring our premium chocolates are more available and accessible to our global consumers” Afridi said in a prepared statement at the time.

Afridi replaced Annie Young-Scrivner a former PepsiCo and Starbucks executive in Godiva’s top job. Young-Scrivner had made a priority of spreading Godiva’s popularity to more mainstream consumer segments.

Yildiz bought Godiva from Campbell’s Soup Co. in 2007 for $850 million according to Bloomberg.

The only person perhaps more excited for Connor McMichael's NHL debut than McMichael himself was his mom Catherine.

With fans still unable to attend games in Capital One Arena she wasn't there to see her son realize one of his biggest dreams in person. But she's already had the pleasure of seeing him don the Caps uniform.

Before McMichael took the ice against the Buffalo Sabres she shared a photo on social media that captured perfectly what this day means to McMichael and his family throwing it back to one Halloween when he dressed up as a Capital.

Not just a costume today!Have fun son and enjoy every minute.We are so proud of you!❤️@Capitals @con91mcmichael https://t.co/H7rByOe2fQ pic.twitter.com/IBeeF7cqiV — Catherine McMichael (@catherinemcmich) January 24 2021

Unbeknownst to young Connor he simply went as his 20-year-old self that year wearing an Alex Ovechkin Capitals jersey for the holiday. Given the jersey had the captain's ""C"" on it the picture had to have been after 2010. That was the year Washington gave Ovechkin the captaincy.

If that seems improbable remember McMichael was born Jan. 15 2001. He didn't turn nine years old until 10 days after Ovechkin was named captain.

With Tom Wilson unavailable due to a lower-body injury head coach Peter Laviolette called on the 2019 first-round draft pick to fill in as the Caps looked to make it back-to-back victories over Buffalo.

Regardless of his performance it was a surreal day for the McMichael family and his mom is clearly doing her best to take it all in from their Ontario home.

She continued to share her pride via Twitter sharing the video of McMichael's pregame solo skate customary for NHL debutants.

Nerves might have been running high for McMichael ahead of the game but knowing how proud he's made his mom hopefully eased them just a bit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3N0YXRlLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvZGMtcmlvdC1hcnJlc3RzLW9oaW8ta2VudHVja3ktdXMtY2FwaXRvbC1icmVhY2gvNjY4MTk3ODAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jan. 6 riot arrests: Ohio connections to the U.S. Capitol attack,"USA TODAY Ohio Network

Carnival Cruise Line extends pause in US trips through April amid COVID: 'It's going to take a while longer'

Carnival Cruise Line is extending its pause in U.S. departures through April 30 and canceling Australian operations through May 19 the company announced Saturday.

The cruise line has also cancelled the European itineraries for Carnival Legend which were set to begin this May through Oct. 31.

The news comes as COVID-19 cases continue to rise around the world despite the distribution of the vaccines.

The cruise line has been operating at reduced capacity for nearly a year. Since March 14 all passenger-carrying vessels operating in U.S. waters have been subject to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's no sail order due to the pandemic.

Carnival Cruise Line guests are now being notified of the cancelations and each is being offered either a full refund or a ""generous future cruise credit and onboard credit package"" the company said in a statement.

""Our guests and travel agent partners continue to express their loyalty to Carnival and their desire to get back on our ships as soon as they can and we are heartened by the booking demand and activity we continue to see"" Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line said in the statement.

The company has also moved the start date for Mardi Gras from Port Canaveral. The first cruise is now set for May 29.

""We are certainly committed to welcoming them back as quickly as possible but unfortunately we have determined it's going to take a while longer and the situation in Europe will also impact Mardi Gras' departure to the U.S. and Carnival Legend's itineraries in Europe"" Duffy added.

In October of last year Carnival Cruise Line announced it was canceling sailings from all ports -- except its home ports of Miami and Port Canaveral Florida -- until the end of the year.

The news came as a shock since months prior in May the company had said it planned to use a ""phased-in approach"" to resume some North American sailings starting on Aug. 1.

As of Saturday at least 96.2 million people around the world have tested positive for COVID-19 and at least 2.06 million have died according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

But according to a recent complaint submitted to the country’s anti-racism watchdog the man heading the event in Aalst has made classical anti-Semitic remarks on Facebook the Het Laatste Nieuws daily of Antwerp reported Thursday.

The complaint to the UNIA watchdog about Aalst Carnival Association Chairman Sven de Smet follows a controversy that led to the Aalst Carnival renouncing its title as a world heritage event.

The 2019 edition of the annual event — a costume party known for its irreverent sphere and provocative costumes — featured several floats deemed anti-Semitic including ones of Jews depicted as insects. The previous event had a float about the cost of living with grinning Orthodox Jews holding bags of money and a rat on one of their shoulders.

The complaint by Rudi Roth a Jewish journalist from Aalst about de Smet concerned a comment that de Smet left on December 29 in a Facebook post featuring a picture of the 2018 display captioned “Hey Jew the rules apply to you too.” The caption referred to violations of COVID-19 emergency measures by ultra-Orthodox Jews.

“Nonsense! God’s chosen people” de Smet wrote. Another carnival enthusiast Filip Deshommes replied: “Have a heart. These people went through the Holocaust so they’re always allowed a little bit more than others.”

De Smet has declined to comment on the complaint against him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHluZXdzaHVuZ2FyeS5jb20vdGhlLXN0b3J5LWFuZC1hLXBlcmZlY3QtcmVjaXBlLWluLTEwLXN0ZXBzLWZvci1jYXJuaXZhbC1kb3VnbnV0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The story and perfect recipe of the carnival doughnuts,"As we approach the middle of the carnival season it is time to make the must-have carnival doughnut and refuel from it before the upcoming Lent. Here is a traditional recipe for the most popular dish of the carnival season that is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.

The carnival season from Twelfth Night to Ash Wednesday (January 6 to February 17 this year) was once also called the Feast of the Devil as everyone could party until dawn at carnivals and costume parties before the restrained forty days that followed until Easter. The indispensable and most popular dish of the carnival season is without doubt the carnival doughnut about which there are three legends writes funzine.hu.

According to one source Beatrix brought the recipe from her home Italy to the court of King Matthias and the dish was consumed in the royal court as part of the carnivals organised at the time. Another story is about Queen Marie Antoinette who loved to walk the streets in disguise and became acquainted with doughnuts on one of these outings. After the first taste she liked it so much that she immediately ordered the pastry chef to the palace where she shared the recipe with the Queen’s chef who then added the treat to his repertoire.

The third story is connected to Vienna: after the death of Krapfen a baker famous for his bread his widow took over the bakery where one day the bread was not made in time and the baker got so mad at the unsatisfied customers that she threw the bread dough in her hand at the raging customers. She missed the target and the dough flew into the sizzling oil but the accidentally made doughnut was a unanimous success among everyone.

According to tradition consuming carnival doughnuts like the New Year’s lentils brings good luck a bountiful harvest and a generous amount of money to the house but it can also help boost your love life: girls could signal their intention to get acquainted with someone with the help of doughnuts while the ribbon running around the edge of the doughnut symbolised the wedding ring for couples.

Everyone can decide for themselves which one is the most convincing argument in favour of eating a doughnut but one thing is for sure: consuming carnival doughnuts is a must during this period. Next we will show you the perfect recipe.

Ingredients for 35-40 doughnuts

500 grams of fine flour

160 grams of strudel flour

4 grams of salt

35 grams of yeast

35 grams of powdered sugar

2 packets of vanilla sugar

70 grams of butter

4 egg yolks

360 ml of milk

20 ml of rum (optional but ensures that the doughnuts do not absorb as much oil)

Preparation

First take the yeast. Crumble the room-temperature yeast and a teaspoon of granulated sugar into 150 ml of lukewarm milk mix it cover it with a lid and let it activate for about ten minutes. Meanwhile mix the two types of flour (after sifting) the salt the powdered sugar and the vanilla sugar then add the remaining milk the egg yolks then the yeast and start kneading. The easiest and fastest way to do this is with a machine (it takes about 7-8 minutes to knead) but you can also do it by hand (it takes 10-15 minutes). While kneading slowly add the melted lukewarm butter. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl cover it and leaven for one hour. Tip: you can also put it in a lukewarm oven so it leavens faster and nicer. When an hour has passed cover the pastry board with flour and stretch the dough with your hands until it is about as thick as one and a half fingers. If necessary use a rolling pin. Important: handle the dough carefully to keep it as airy as possible. The next step is making the pieces. Use a 6-centimetre cookie cutter. Be careful but firm to get the perfect shape. Cover the doughnuts and let them rise for another 25-30 minutes. Form a small crater in the doughnuts with your finger but do not pierce them completely. Preheat the oil (should be approximately three fingers high in your pan). Use a deeper frying pan or a thicker wider and flatter pot over low heat avoiding the doughnuts burning on the outside but remaining raw on the inside. Place the doughnuts in the oil the side with the small crater on it facing down. Fry maximum 5-6 pieces at the same time otherwise the oil temperature will change and you will not get the desired results. First fry them for a minute with a lid covering your pot then turn them over and fry without the lid for another 1-1.5 minutes. The goal is to get golden brown doughnuts. Place the doughnuts on a paper towel and cool them a bit then serve with vanilla powdered sugar and homemade apricot jam.

Enjoy!

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Saturday reportedly dispatched 13 warplanes including eight H-6K bombers to locations in the middle of the island of Taiwan and the Dongsha Islands in the South China Sea as the US aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt entered the South China Sea from the south of Taiwan on the same day for ""routine operations"" in a first since US President Joe Biden assumed office.While some analysts said the PLA bomber swarm aimed to deter the US carrier and used the warship as a simulated target in an exercise others said the PLA exercises were routine and not necessarily related to the US operations.The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group entered the South China Sea on Saturday to conduct routine operations reads a statement the US Indo-Pacific Command released on the same day.Citing commercial satellite imagery Beijing-based think tank the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative said the US carrier entered the region via the Bashi Channel to the south of the Taiwan island.This is the first time a US aircraft carrier has entered the South China Sea since Biden assumed office on Wednesday but Chinese analysts said that US military operations in the region have never stopped and are nothing new.Coincidentally the PLA sent a total of 13 warplanes including a Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft eight H-6K bombers and four J-16 fighter jets to Taiwan's self-proclaimed southwestern air defense identification zone also on Saturday Taiwan's defense authorities said on the day.The PLA has dispatched mainly Y-8 special mission aircraft for similar missions over the past few months and sending bombers and fighter jets could be a warning to the US and a simulated practice to boost the PLA's combat capability against US aircraft carriers analysts said.Escorted by J-16 fighter jets eight H-6K bombers capable of carrying a total of 48 anti-ship missiles can launch a round of saturation attack on a hostile carrier marking a strong deterrent against US provocations a Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Sunday on the condition of anonymity.Unlike in 2020 when US aircraft carriers provocatively entered the region the PLA aircraft carrier Shandong is now standing by in the South China Sea as a stabilizer for the regional situation analysts said.A PLA Navy flotilla consisting of guided missile destroyer Shenzhen Wuhan and guided missile frigate Hengyang also conducted a series of combat-oriented drills in the South China Sea recently China Central Television reported on Saturday.However another mainland military expert who asked for anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday that the PLA operations were not necessarily related to the US aircraft carrier's arrival to the South China Sea as the two sides were both conducting scheduled exercises.The US aircraft carrier's South China Sea operation shows the US is maintaining its previous policies and even if there were changes it would take a long time for the Pentagon to make new decisions and orders to the carrier the expert said noting that the PLA has been conducting routine exercises near Taiwan for months.The US State Department released a statement on Saturday claiming the Chinese mainland's military pressure against Taiwan ""threatens regional peace and stability.""Li Haidong a professor at the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing told the Global Times on Sunday that the statement is a key position clarification of the Biden administration on the Taiwan question which is the most important political foundation of China-US relations.It showed that the US is not giving up its continued interference in China's internal affairs over the Taiwan question but the statement also said the US ""maintains its longstanding commitments as outlined in the Three Communiqués the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances"" Li pointed out noting that this is different from the Trump administration and the Biden administration has returned to previous US policies on the Taiwan question.The new US administration seems willing to keep a certain ambiguity on the Taiwan question which provides the possibility for China and the US to form a level of tacit understanding Li said.But by hyping the ""China military threat theory"" the US statement twisted the truth and is attempting to cover the bullying essence of US diplomacy experts said.Moments after Wednesday noon in Washington DC as Joe Biden was being sworn in as 46th US president China's Foreign Ministry announced sanctions on 28 anti-China politicians under former president Donald Trump including former secretary of state Mike Pompeo.

Tecma Group acquires New Mexico carrier Omega Trucking

Expecting an increase in the volume of cross-border logistics across the U.S.-Mexico border the Tecma Group of Companies recently acquired flatbed operator Omega Trucking.

The acquisition of Santa Teresa New Mexico-based Omega took effect Jan. 1.

The Omega flatbed operations will be merged into Tecma’s Transportation Services Division.

Omega co-founder Miriam Baca Kotkowski will stay on as president of Tecma Transportation Services. No financial details of the transaction were released.

“Miriam’s experience and excellent leadership in the cross-border trucking industry is a driving reason for this merger” Tecma Group CEO Alan Russell said in a statement.

Kotkowski said Omega has worked with Tecma for years “moving their flatbed cargo ‘door to door’ into Ciudad Juarez.”





“We always admired their professionalism and ethics; their culture is very open and progressive” Kotkowski told FreightWaves. “We got to know each other better during the immigration crisis affecting our borders where our mutual interest to complement our needs (Tecma Transportation is mainly a dry van carrier) and similarities in our corporate culture became very evident this led to joining the Tecma family.”

The acquisition doubled the trucking capacity for Tecma Group as well as diversifying and increasing the company’s presence across the U.S.-Mexico border.

“This acquisition allows us to provide the much-needed door-to-door service for our clients in Mexico and the United States” Tecma’s vice president of global supply chain and logistics John Rippee told FreightWaves.

Omega Trucking was founded in 1998 and has 24 power units and 26 drivers according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The carrier specializes in hauling oversized loads in the U.S. and across the border into Mexico on its flatbed trailers. Omega Trucking also has a location in McAllen Texas.

The merger with Omega could allow Tecma to move up to 45000 cross-border shipments during 2021 according to Rippee.

“These will occur all along the border with Mexico and in conjunction with our in-house U.S. customs brokerage” Rippee said.

Founded in 1986 the Tecma Group of Companies is based in El Paso Texas and helps companies foreign to Mexico set up manufacturing operations in the country. Tecma currently operates about 65 maquiladoras (factories) including 33 plants just across the border in Juárez Mexico.

In 2010 the Tecma Group formed its transportation division specializing in cross-border van services supplying raw materials to its plants. Tecma Transportation based in Mexico has 53 employees with operations in El Paso and McAllen as well as Tijuana Mexico.





In the past Tecma transportation only handled Tecma plant operations and is expanding by offering trucking services to other companies on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.

“Tecma is a service company first and foremost. Vertical integration for us is expanding our role in the services our clients need” Rippee said.

Rippee said more trucking company acquisitions are being considered by Tecma.

“We need to integrate our current new team and then we will be assessing further acquisitions” Rippee said.

Rippee added that Tecma could be opening more factories in Mexico in the near future.

“We pace ourselves regionally at one opening per quarter per region” Rippee said. “We operate in three regions. So we have some capacity for a few more this year.”

Kotkowski said the U.S.-Mexico trucking market should remain strong during 2021.

“I see great growth Mexico is a top supplier to the U.S. the numbers keep increasing as consumers seek affordable pricing during a tight economy” Kotkowski.

Autotransportes Pilot achieves CTPAT certification

Mexican trucking company Autotransportes Pilot was recently granted Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) certification from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Autotransportes Pilot is now a partner in the CTPAT program a U.S. government-business program aimed at improving the international supply chain and U.S. border security.

As a CTPAT Partner Autotransportes and its clients could benefit from a reduced number of CBP border examinations and see a reduction in border wait times for entry into the U.S. resulting in faster delivery times.

The company which has more than 50 trucks is based in Guadalajara Mexico. Autotransportes Pilot has a sister company Blue Coral in San Diego according to Gerardo Jiménez Zavala general director.

“We operate as far as Los Angeles and in this type of operation we are encouraged by the CTPAT certification to have more opportunities in the ​​San Diego and Los Angeles areas” Jiménez Zavala said in news outlet T21 which first reported the news. “It also allows us to guarantee solutions for clients with national operations.”

Boyd Corp. opens factory in Juárez Mexico

Boyd Corp. part of the chemical manufacturing industry recently announced it is opening a factory in Juárez Mexico.

The 430556-square-foot factory will produce liquid cooling systems for technology used in electronics battery systems and data centers for customers across North America Boyd CEO Doug Britt said in a release.

“We’re expanding our footprint to enable greater capacity and higher volume production in support of the innovation coming from our technology roadmap customer localization and accelerating market demand” Britt said.

Pleasanton California-based Boyd Corp. has 33 manufacturing plants in 11 countries and more than 2600 employees.

Yet there’s still hope: before the money ran out Moscow had big plans for its navy and if were to somehow find funding a number of interesting projects could be pursued.

The most powerful navies in 2030 will be a reflection of the broader state of the world. Some countries are invested in preserving the current international order and see naval power as a means to maintain it. Other emerging countries are building navies commensurate with their newfound sense of status often with an eye towards challenging that order.

The eastward shift in naval power will continue in 2030 a product of both declining defense budgets in Europe and growing economies in Asia. While the most powerful navies of the Cold War were concentrated largely in Europe by 2030 both China and India will be on the list with Japan and South Korea as runners-up also fielding large modern naval forces.

Ship-wise there are two classes that will define the most powerful navies: aircraft carriers and ballistic missile submarines. Aircraft carriers reflect the need to maintain a global or even regional power-projection capability. Ballistic-missile submarines reflect a maturation and diversification of a country’s nuclear arsenal with an eye toward maintaining a second-strike capability in case of surprise attack. More than any other type those two will define naval power in the early-to-mid twenty-first century.

The United States

The United States the dominant naval power worldwide in 1945 will continue to dominate the seas eighty-five years later. By 2030 the Navy will be halfway through its thirty-year shipbuilding plan and have built three Gerald R. Ford–class aircraft carriers to begin replacing existing Nimitz-class carriers. Amphibious ship numbers should be slightly higher than current numbers and the first ship in class to replace the Ohio ballistic missile submarines should enter service in 2031.

In surface combatants all three Zumwalt-class cruisers will be in service—assuming the program remains fully funded—and the Navy will have built thirty-three more Arleigh Burke–class destroyers. A next-generation version of the Littoral Combat Ship will enter production in 2030.

Under current plans the U.S. Navy should reach its three-hundred-ship goal between 2019 and 2034 but after that period the number of surface combatants begins to drop. These plans also assume a higher than average shipbuilding budget while at the same time the service must compete with the budget demands of other services—particularly the Air Force—and domestic programs. While U.S. naval superiority isn’t ending any time soon the period after 2030 will be a critical one.

The United Kingdom

The Royal Navy of 2030 will be paradoxically the smallest and yet most powerful in the history of the United Kingdom. A combination of two new aircraft carriers restoring fixed-wing flight to navy after a forty-year hiatus and a fleet of ballistic-missile submarines will keep a numerically inferior Royal Navy in the top five.

The Royal Navy’s surface fleet currently at nineteen destroyers and frigates will shrink even further to six Type 45 guided-missile destroyers and eight Global Combat Ship frigates. The number of nuclear-powered attack submarines will remain constant at seven.

The Royal Navy is responsible for the UK’s nuclear deterrent and currently operates four Vanguard-class nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines each equipped with sixteen launch tubes for Trident D-5 missiles. The Vanguard class is expected to be replaced with the Successor class starting in 2028.

The UK’s sea-based power projection capability will be in the form of the Queen Elizabeth–class of aircraft carriers. The two conventionally powered ships Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales will each displace sixty-five thousand tons fully loaded and capable of carrying up to fifty aircraft. Aircraft will include the F-35B Lightning II fighter and Merlin Wildcat Chinook and Apache helicopters. The two carriers will optionally double as amphibious transports capable of carrying up to nine hundred Royal Marines or troops of the Army’s Sixteenth Air Assault Brigade.

China

The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) of 2030 will continue to build on the ground broken by the PLAN of 2016. Currently China has four major ship hulls it seems to be content with: the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Type 054A frigate Type 056 corvette and Type 071 amphibious transport. All four are mature designs in large-scale production that will form the bulk of the fleet in 2030.

By one prediction by 2030 the PLAN will have ninety-nine submarines four aircraft carriers 102 destroyers and frigates twenty-six corvettes seventy-three amphibious ships and 111 missile craft a whopping 415 ships in total to approximately 309 in the U.S. Navy of 2030. This would put China in a solid position as the world’s largest navy by number of ships—though not by total ship tonnage.

Could China really reach 415 ships? Such a total would probably require twice as many submarines to be produced annually a boost in destroyer production to achieve a net gain as older designs age out and a huge increase in amphibious ships. It would also require two more carriers than are currently in service or under construction. Reaching such a goal would require a substantial increase in the PLAN’s budget—at a time when the Chinese Communist Party is finally applying the brakes to defense-budget increases.

Other ships under construction will form China’s fleet in 2030 are the Type 055 destroyer and Type 001A aircraft carrier. A new ballistic-missile submarine to supplement and eventually replace the Type 094 Jin class is also likely. The 094 class is notoriously noisy underwater and not a particularly good place to put a fraction of China’s three hundred or so nuclear warheads.

India

The Indian Navy will be the second (or third if you count Russia) Asian navy on this list. India has recently begun pouring enormous resources into its naval service and as a result by 2030 could have one of the top five navies on the planet.

Barring unforeseen naval developments in other countries by 2030 India will have the second largest carrier fleet in the world with three flattops. If all goes according to plan India should have three aircraft carriers: Vikramaditya Vikrant and Vishal together fielding a total of about 110–120 aircraft.

India will also have at least nine destroyers including two guided missiles of the Kolkata class three of the Delhi class and four of the in-construction Visakhapatnam class. This is one less than what India has at present and the number of hulls will have to increase if India is serious about protecting three aircraft carriers. Roughly two-thirds of the Indian Navy’s frigate fleet is modern enough to make it to 2030 particularly the Shivalik and Talwar classes but India will have to increase the number of frigates overall—especially if Pakistan is serious about putting nuclear weapons on submarines.

India is in the process of standing up a sea-based leg of its nuclear triad with the first ballistic missile submarine Arihant expected to be operational soon. Three Arihant subs are planned and an overall “boomer” fleet of six submarines is expected.

Russia

The combination of a downturn oil prices and Western sanctions from its annexation of the Crimea will put a crimp in Russia’s economic stride for the near future. After economic growth of up to six percent annually the bear is in recession with no immediate end in sight. A plan to replace 90 percent of Russian military equipment including ships and naval equipment has stalled.

By 2030 Russia’s position on this list will be in large part due its ballistic missile submarine fleet. Eight Borei submarines each carrying twenty Bulava missiles will be in service forming the second-largest ballistic-missile submarine fleet in the world.

The rest of the Russian Navy is slouching toward oblivion with a dwindling number of large surface combatants submarines and a single decrepit aircraft carrier. Yet there’s still hope: before the money ran out Moscow had big plans for its navy and if were to somehow find funding a number of interesting projects could be pursued.

Project 23000E or Shtorm would be a nuclear-powered carrier 330 meters long and displacing one hundred thousand tons making it the closest competitor to a Ford-class carrier. Nuclear-powered the carrier will embark up to one hundred aircraft including a navalized version of the PAK-FA fifth-generation fighter.

There’s also the gigantic Lider-class nuclear-powered destroyer. At 17500 tons and two hundred meters long the Lider class is more akin to a cruiser than a destroyer. Armament will consist of sixty antiship cruise missiles 128 antiaircraft missiles and sixteen antiship guided missiles.

HOUSTON -- Residents of one Houston neighborhood are thanking an Amazon delivery driver for helping to find a baby that was abandoned after an apparent carjacking.

Police said they responded to a stolen car and kidnapping in the city's Sunnyside neighborhood on Monday.

Around the same time a home surveillance camera captured a man leave a baby in a newborn carrier on the side of the road less than a mile away.

Amazon driver Juan Carlos Flores said he spotted the baby in the carrier and realized something wasn't right.

""When I saw that baby I wanted to cry"" he said.

He went to the nearest neighbor to ask if the baby was left outside.

WATCH: Meet the hero Amazon delivery driver who rescued baby

You need to meet Juan Carlos Flores the delivery driver who spotted a newborn baby inside a carrier on the side of a north Houston street last week. The baby had been inside a vehicle that was stolen and the thief later abandoned the child.

The homeowner who asked to remain nameless told our sister station KTRK-TV that when he went outside he saw the baby on the ground. He immediately took the car seat indoors covered the baby and called police.

""How could someone have a heart to leave the child on the side of the road?"" Flores said.

Flores returned to his rounds then said he saw police who were searching for the baby nearby. He said he led officers back to the house where the neighbor was caring for the child.

Additional officers showed up on the scene nearly three minutes later and reunited the infant with the mother.

Police said the driver who dropped the baby off was believed to be the suspect of a carjacking."

IM Editorial Director Paul Moore spoke to Gainwell’s Dipankar Banerjee Chief Operating Officer Mining Business and Jayanta Bhattacharya Head of Manufacturing about this unique story.



Gainwell’s Dipankar Banerjee Chief Operating Officer Mining Business

Background to India’s highwall mining resurgence

At the end of 2016 Caterpillar had announced that it would stop making new room and pillar products including closing its Houston Pennsylvania factory saying that a major reason was the concentration of demand in the Appalachian Mountain region of the US which was a slowly declining market. The discontinued business included continuous miners coal utility vehicles feeder breakers roof bolters and haulage systems but also highwall miners. Banerjee told IM: “It was a correct decision by Caterpillar – as the US was 60% of their global room and pillar market and with the coal market in decline and no new underground coal mines planned equipment demand had dropped significantly. While Cat no longer made new machines they continued to support the existing equipment population in the field.”

He adds: “However in India coal is not a bad word – almost 70% of India’s energy comes from thermal coal and we continue to build new coal fired power plants and therefore continue to open up new coal mines. Our current coal production is around 730 Mt per year. The Indian Government and Ministry of Coal have taken lot of initiatives including major policy reforms to open up the coal sector to the private sector to increase the domestic coal production to 1 billion tonnes or more by 2023. There is also a strong demand for high quality coking coal in the country for steel production.”

The highwall miner is quite a unique product. Over 50 highwall mining machines are still working in the US but very few elsewhere – a handful in Australia and India and some locally made machines in China such as a machine similar to the ADDCAR design made by CCTEG which is working in the Ordos Basin coal mines in Inner Mongolia.

Banerjee comments: “Highwall mining improves the recovery at open cast coal mines by accessing seams from the pit highwall where access from surface is no longer possible for example due to proximity to settlements. In India there were two mines using highwall technology successfully and we always sensed there is good potential here due to the high population density and a lot of open pits with highwalls under which there remained large tonnage of coal reserves.”

Gainwell starts its highwall journey

In 2017 Gainwell approached Caterpillar saying that it had opportunities in India and would be interested in a technology licensing agreement given that new machine production had ended in the US. After a period of discussions this was signed in 2018 allowing the manufacture of highwall miners in India by Gainwell. The IP licensing included India and select overseas markets including China. Gainwell then invested in a new assembly shop in Asansol near Kolkata in West Bengal in the heart of India’s coal mining belt and made the first machine in 2019.

The two existing highwall miners in India had been supplied as follows: one by Bucyrus (SHM unit) in the early 2010s just before Bucyrus was bought by Cat in 2011 to SECL’s Sharda opencast mine (operated by contractor Cuprum Bagrodia Ltd or CBL) and the second in 2015/2016 to Tata Steel for its West Bokaro Division South Eastern Quarry. As that machine was supplied by Cat it was now known as an HWM300 and this too was operated by contractor CBL.

Cat HWM300 supplied to Tata Steel West Bokaro operation in 2016

Gainwell supplied its first highwall miner to SECL through CBL during February 2019 and the machine is working very well. The customer has in fact placed another order for second Gainwell Highwall Miner to be delivered in 2021. So the customer will now have four highwall miners one Bucryus one Cat and two new units from Gainwell. At the same time the other existing highwall miner user in India Tata Steel approached Gainwell wanting another machine which was duly delivered in October 2020. All the new Gainwell units have been given the name GHWM300. The Tata Steel unit has been successfully commissioned and went into coal production from end-November onwards. Gainwell has brought lot of improvements on this machine including online diagnostics complete operation through mobile application etc. and the machine has been performing very well.

Investment and evolution at Gainwell

As well investing in machining and other equipment Gainwell has invested in a core design and engineering team at Asansol led by Jayanta Bhattacharya as well as employing on a consultancy basis several former Bucyrus/Caterpillar engineers who had worked on the SHM machines in the US. Bhattacharya told IM: “This really eased the manufacturing journey for us. We are primarily a Cat dealer selling and servicing its equipment for the past 75 years. But we learned quickly and today we are quite self-sufficient. We buy the components and parts from Cat made by them and their network of third party suppliers which they are still making to support the installed population of highwall miners in the US.”

Jayanta Bhattacharya Head of Manufacturing at Gainwell

He adds: “Slowly we are trying to increase the indigenisation of the machine in India. In the first machine we had only about 7% Make-in-India content – by the second machine this has risen to 28% and will be higher again for the third machine. Local manufacturing has really got strengthened in India in recent years with the growth of the domestic automobile industry and there are very good vendor base getting developed. All the testing of the equipment is also done in-house. Cat really helped us in the early days in handholding us but we are now becoming a world class manufacturer in our own right. Of course there have been challenges like finding right people with the requisite skill sets such as in niche electronics engineering but we were able to attract the right people and get them trained.” Gainwell’s Banerjee adds: “It is important to remember that the GHWM300 is a 300 t complex machine costing up to $12 million including cutter module options so you can imagine the amount of engineering and componentry that goes into it.”

The new GHWM300 Highwall Miner delivered to Tata Steel in 2020

The company also pointed out that each highwall miner also has a high level of customisation depending on the options selected by the customer but also related to the seam thickness and geology it will be working with. Bhattacharya says: “As an example the first machine was able to cut 0.9 m to 1.7 m seams. The second machine had a high lift mode to deal with thicker seams – so it can handle seams of 0.9 to 2.5 m. Gainwell as a dealer and as a focused company is able to work with customers closely on their individual needs.”

Wider Asian demand – next stop China

For promotion in China Gainwell has already attended a trade show in the country in 2020 and says it would already have had a machine in the country in 2020 if it were not for the effect of COVID-19. The company is working together with North China and Eastern Central Cat dealer Lei Shing Hong (LSH) Machinery and expects the first Chinese order to now come through in 2021. Banerjee says: “LSH will promote the equipment as well as provide necessary service and parts support for the highwall miner. This is quite a unique arrangement between two major Cat dealers in two different countries with one acting as OEM and the other as a dealer. Gainwell is also in discussions with few other Cat dealers about similar arrangements to promote the Gainwell Highwall Miner in those respective markets.”

Gainwell says its Asansol site can make up to two highwall miners a year with the broad plan to supply one domestically and one for export on an annual basis. But if demand exceeds that the company says that with three instead of two shifts and cutting down on some of the cycle times etc it could up this to three machines if needed. The assembly is modular and there is room at the site to expand the plant footprint as well. The company also says it will invest in 2021 in new machining equipment.

The growth of this Highwall Miner business within India is a real testament to Gainwell’s vision and confidence as it involves manufacture of a high value complex mining machine domestically and it has the full support of the Indian Government as well as from Coal India.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wanN0YXIvbmFtZS9iZXR0eS10aGV0Zm9yZC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD05Mjk5Mjgx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Betty Thetford Obituary (1931 - 2021) - Metamora IL - Peoria Journal Star,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pjstar/name/betty-thetford-obituary?id=9299281 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wanN0YXIvbmFtZS9iZXR0eS10aGV0Zm9yZC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD05Mjk5Mjgx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L2NoZWNrLW91dC1jaGluYXMtbmV3LWFsbC10ZXJyYWluLWhpZ2gtYWx0aXR1ZGUtbG9naXN0aWNzLXN1cHBvcnQtdmVoaWNsZS0xNzY5NTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Check Out China's New All-Terrain High-Altitude Logistics Support Vehicle,"The new vehicle is intended to support missions at altitudes as high as 5000 feet places where roads or any kind of smooth terrain allowing vehicle access simply might not exist.

The Chinese military has built an armored tracked all-terrain vehicle designed to transport forces weapons and equipment to otherwise unreachable high-altitude mountainous locations a move reported to enable an ability for military attackers to maneuver in plateau regions.

“Designed with caterpillar tracks made of metalloid this new all-terrain vehicle can tread over slopes of 35 degrees the report said noting that it can deliver 1.5 tons of goods” the Chinese government-backed Global Times paper reports.

The new vehicle is intended to support missions at altitudes as high as 5000 feet places where roads or any kind of smooth terrain allowing vehicle access simply might not exist.

The vehicle looks lightly armored and somewhat box-like or square and its configuration raises the question as to its actual ability to climb through rigorous terrain. Even if as reported the new vehicle can travel up slopes of 35 degrees it does not appear as though it has the weight distribution needed to manage steep angles rocky terrain or uneven inclines while driving up a mountain.

Also it does not appear as though this vehicle would bring any kind of an advantage in terms of troop supplies or weapons transport that a helicopter would not. Furthermore high altitude mountainous regions likely contain sharp ridges uneven rocks and ledges and other kinds of impediments to any kind of vehicle travel. Simply put the vehicle does appear as though it could traverse rigorous or uneven terrain to a certain extent yet by no means actually climb a mountain.

The vehicle does look like it could travel across plateau areas however depending upon the altitude it would seem difficult to actually get a vehicle of this kind up to those locations unless of course it were transported by a large fixed-wing cargo aircraft. In this respect if the vehicle actually did arrive at a high-altitude plateau it certainly could bring some tactical utility in the sense that it could coordinate logistics between mountain outposts or forces on scout missions. It does not look heavily armored enough to offer any actual combat utility apart from simply safeguarding against small arms fire to a certain extent. Plateau regions have small ridges and uneven areas where a vehicle such as this could potentially bring some operational value should groups of forces need to be sustained with food water weapons and ammunition in austere high altitude locations.

While a lot of the vehicle’s specs such as weight speed engine efficiency suspension or armor composition might not be known photographic renderings of the platform show a tracked vehicle which could be airdropped or sling loaded beneath a large helicopter or possibly even drive off of a transport aircraft.

For CBRE Group Inc. (NYSE: CBRE) the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment firm a headquarters move from Los Angeles to Dallas just made sense company President and CEO Bob Sulentic told the Business Journal in October.

""Earlier this year we just decided that with so many people here and with our new CFO Leah Stearns being located here — our CFO hadn't been here previously — we just decided that it was time to declare Dallas as our headquarters"" Sulentic said. ""We're not moving people as a result of this out of California and into Texas but it will be our formal headquarters now. It's a really big and important market for us as is LA as is California but this is where most of our leaders are. It just made sense to declare Dallas as our headquarters. We know we're going to grow a ton here and we've already been growing here.""

Other companies made similar moves out of California and into North Texas in 2020. According to experts even more relocations could be on the way in 2021. Companies making this relocation have cited issues like high taxes burdensome business regulations and a high cost of living as just some of the reasons for making a move to Texas.

“My employees were constantly saying ‘Look my commute is horrible and my rent is astronomical for what I’m getting’” said Darrell Mervau president of FileTrail Inc. “And to be perfectly honest I also told them ‘I’m not going to pay you $400000 a year so you can buy a house in Silicon Valley.’""

""So we were really looking at improving their lives and moving somewhere where they could start accumulating assets.”

These reasons eventually drove Mervau to relocate his company from San Jose to Austin. Like North Texas Austin is considered a top market for corporate relocations due to its business climate comparatively low cost of living and large talent pool according to site selectors.

Texas has been a magnet for company relocations and expansions for some time. For eight straight years the state has ruled supreme in the Governor's Cup rankings produced by Site Selection magazine for total capital investment by the state. Now that trend appears to be accelerating because of cost concerns in coastal states as well as the sudden upheaval of the pandemic.

So as companies trade in California for Texas it begs the question: What’s the actual cost difference between the two states? On a narrower level what opportunities does Austin or North Texas provide over Silicon Valley?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3NhbnRhLWZlLXNwcmluZ3MtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1zZWxscy0xMi1taWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Santa Fe Springs Industrial Property Sells for $12 Million,"Zurich Alternative Asset Management has purchased a fully leased industrial building in Santa Fe Springs for $12.4 million.



ZAAM picked up the property at 10329 Painter Ave. which is near the 5 and 605 freeways from M. Parkinson & Co. Inc. Built in 2000 and spanning 41725 square feet the site holds 51 parking spaces and is leased to personal care product maker ACT Labs.



CBRE Group Inc.’s Gary Stache Anthony DeLorenzo Mark Shaffer Doug Mack Bryan Johnson Sean Ward and Chris Ehrlich represented the buyer and the seller in the transaction.



“The tenant recently signed a 10-year lease extension at this property in one of the hottest industrial investment markets in the country providing the new owner with a very desirable level of stability” Stache said in a statement.



“We are excited to have acquired this infill industrial asset for our national portfolio as we found the building’s location and connectivity to the greater Los Angeles market extremely attractive” ZAAM Director Chris Edgar said in a statement.



Sean Bannon managing director and head of U.S. real estate for ZAAM added in a statement that the company usually acquires properties in the $25 million to $100 million range but has “capital sources that execute exclusively in the $7 million to $20 million range. This builds diversification for smaller portfolios and gives sellers of these assets an institutional exit where the buyer pool is typically private. Painter Avenue is a perfect example of that.”



Industrial real estate has been in high demand in L.A.



Last year 61.7 million square feet of industrial space sold or leased in the county compared with 60 million square feet the year before according to data from Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. And asking rents for properties in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $0.97 a square foot on a triple net basis up 6 cents in a year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L3RoZS1zcGlyYWwtYXQtaHVkc29uLXlhcmRzLXNldC10by1yZWFjaC1hLW1pbGVzdG9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Spiral at Hudson Yards set to reach a milestone,"It’s topping-off day Tuesday for The Spiral Tishman Speyer’s $3.7 billion 66-story Hudson Yards District skyscraper beribboned with a band of cascading landscaped terraces and hanging gardens.

It’s a milestone for the 1041-foot-tall tower and for Tishman Speyer President/CEO Rob Speyer who steered the project from the outset. But a greater satisfaction might be that its first signed office tenant was Pfizer Inc. — the pharmaceutical giant that produced a COVID-19 vaccine in record time.

“Pfizer’s team are the true heroes of COVID” Speyer said. “We couldn’t be prouder.

“We were proud when we first signed the lease with them” he said. “Now we’re over the moon.” Ground was broken soon after the signing in the long-ago summer of 2018. Pfizer is moving from several old buildings in the East 40s.The Spiral or 66 Hudson Blvd. is designed by Bjarke Ingels Group architects. It takes up the whole block bounded by 10th Avenue and the Hudson Boulevard to the west and by West 34th and 35th streets.

The spiraling rings of greenery will both energize and soften the corporate curtain-wall façade. Once the terraces are planted in the spring of 2022 the tower will stand strikingly distinct from the harder-edge giants at Related Cos.’ Hudson Yards complex to the south.

After Pfizer signed on for 800000 square feet of The Spiral’s 2.85 million square feet two more large tenants came on board: Debevoise & Plimpton LLP and AllianceBernstein bringing the project to just over 50 percent leased.

That’s another way of saying it’s nearly 50 percent NOT yet leased — a challenge in the pandemic-ravaged market that several other ground-up developers face as well.

But Speyer was confident when he spoke to The Post last week.

“We’re over 50 percent leased and we have more than a year and a half to deliver” he pointed out. (The Spiral is to be finished in the third quarter of 2022; Pfizer’s expected to move in soon after). “We have several conversations going with companies that are broadly representative of the city’s commerce.”

Normally the first tenant to sign up for a new office building gets a better deal than those that follow. But the coronavirus upended that pattern as developers must work harder to lure tenants to fill their remaining space in a climate of corporate downsizing and fear.

Terms of Spiral’s first three tenants have not been disclosed. But will Tishman Speyer offer better terms to tire-kicking future tenants?

“We haven’t lowered our asking rent” Speyer said. But he seemed to leave wiggle room. “We will work with our customers to make it work for everyone. We’ll work with them to make a fair deal for everyone.”

Speyer predicted a big increase in leasing volume once the virus is hopefully brought under control by September. “Remember many companies have delayed [real-estate] decisions pending the resolution of the pandemic.” he said. “That naturally creates pent-up demand.”

Reboot for vintage tower

Like many midcentury office buildings 730 Third Ave. between East 45th and East 46th streets needed a 21st century overhaul. So Nuveen Real Estate and development adviser Taconic Partners 18 months ago launched a carefully targeted $120 million transformation of the 27-story 1957 vintage tower.

Except for a new lobby-entrance façade it looks much the same from the street. But it’s a different story inside. Tenants will find a 7000-square-foot amenities terrace on the 22nd floor an 8000-square-foot fitness and wellness center ViewGlass windows that adjust automatically to sunlight a sky lounge and a 9000 square-foot food hall on the second floor. The nondescript old lobby was replaced by a double-height space that boasts a glass-and-stone circular staircase to the second floor.

Rendering of 730 Third Ave. TMRW

Now that the job’s finished CBRE’s Paul Amrich and Neil King are ready to lure tenants to 226000 vacant square feet on floors 12 to 27 which range from 8500 to 30000 square feet.

The 667000-square-foot tower is 55 percent occupied its largest user being Nuveen itself and parent TIAA on the third through ninth floors. Nuveen office-sector head Chad Phillips called 730 Third Ave. “an important part of TIAA’s heritage back to the 1950s.” In addition accounting firm Marcum LLP signed a lease for more than 70000 square feet last February. Although the capital upgrades were set in motion before the pandemic the owners describe the repositioned tower as “a model post-COVID office environment” thanks to such features as touchless elevators and abundant outdoor space.

“Everything that was planned prepandemic works out perfectly in a weird way for postpandemic” Amrich said.

Asking rents range from the mid-$70s per square foot to the mid-$80s at the top. Although many buildings new and old have giant blocks of space to fill Amrich said 730 Third doesn’t pose the “big block” challenge of other addresses.

“We can lease floor by floor” he said.

Amrich is optimistic about leasing prospects thanks in part to the tower’s proximity to Grand Central Terminal. Like most brokers he’s also confident that employees will inevitably return to their desks.

“Work from home will once again be work from work” he quipped.",,,,,,

We may not have flying cars yet but there is technology out there that can create concrete aggregate out of thin air literally.

Chevron didn't say how much but announced it has made a Series C investment in Blue Planet a startup in California focused on reducing the carbon impact of industrial operations including building materials.

Don't believe it? Watch this video to learn more about Blue Planet and its work on concrete aggregate:

CO

Blue Planet uses Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies to concentrate and remove greenhouse gas carbon dioxide () from the air. The company then creates a chemical reaction to convert the COinto limestone which is a building block of concrete. Blue Planet then sells the aggregate to be used in concrete mixes which has been used on a number of projects including the San Francisco International Airport interim boarding area B.

Investing in Carbon Capture

Chevron's investment signals yet another major corporation taking a full step forward in committing to the reduction of carbon in the construction process.

“Carbon capture utilization and storage or CCUS is viewed to be essential to advancing progress toward the global net zero ambition of the Paris Agreement” says Barbara Burger vice president of innovation and president of Technology Ventures at Chevron. “This investment is made through our Future Energy Fund which focuses on startups with lower-carbon technologies that can scale commercially and we welcome Blue Planet to this portfolio.""

Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) is an arm of Chevron that pursues externally-developed technologies and new business solutions to ultimately reduce energy use and provide cleaner energy.

“Chevron is a leader in scouting and identifying innovative and game-changing approaches to lower-carbon intensity” says Brent Constantz founder CEO and chief scientist at Blue Planet. “The investment may also provide future opportunities to incorporate Blue Planet’s approach into Chevron’s projects.”

The Skinny on Blue Planet

Blue Planet creates carbonate-based building aggregate made from flue gas-captured CO 2 . Distinct from some other industrial carbon capture and utilization technologies Blue Planet’s process does not require CO 2 purification and enrichment prior to use which can reduce cost and unit energy consumed during capture. Founded in 2013 Blue Planet’s technology potentially enables permanent capture of CO 2 in building materials at scale converting CO 2 to a lower-carbon product for sale in the growing global market of aggregates.

Blue Planet's solution involves converting CO 2 into limestone to be used in concrete and replace the rock mined in open-pit quarries which is one of the greatest contributors to CO 2 in the atmosphere according to Brent Constantz Blue Planet's CEO.

In connection with its investment Chevron and Blue Planet also executed a letter of intent to collaborate on potential pilot projects and commercial development in key geographies with the goal of jointly advancing lower-carbon opportunities according to a press release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL25pc2hhbmRlZ25hcmFpbi8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L25ldy1pbWFnZXMtcmVsZWFzZWQtb2YtZW5naW5lLWRhbWFnZS1jYXVzZWQtYnktZXhwZXJpbWVudGFsLWxvdy1zdWxmdXItc2hpcC1mdWVsLXZsc2ZvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Images Released Of Engine Damage Caused By Experimental Low Sulfur Ship Fuel VLSFO,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishandegnarain/2021/01/24/new-images-released-of-engine-damage-caused-by-experimental-low-sulfur-ship-fuel-vlsfo/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL25pc2hhbmRlZ25hcmFpbi8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L25ldy1pbWFnZXMtcmVsZWFzZWQtb2YtZW5naW5lLWRhbWFnZS1jYXVzZWQtYnktZXhwZXJpbWVudGFsLWxvdy1zdWxmdXItc2hpcC1mdWVsLXZsc2ZvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWphbnVhcnktMjUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of January 25,"Leading stock indices continued the recent rally this week with S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average setting new records helped mainly by the tech sector.

The cheapest property sold at weekend auction was a $315000 Surfers Paradise apartment.

Having been grossing $46000 in holiday rental the two bedroom one bathroom apartment price reflects a 14 percent yield before costs.

The body corporate fee was advised as $159 per week the water bill as $420 per quarter and council rates at $3500 per annum.

The Chevron Renaissance apartment (pictured above) at 2167/23 Ferny Avenue had previously sold to Hoxton Park investors in 2002 at $330000 according to CoreLogic.

Prospective buyers were told ""the exceptionally motivated interstate sellers must urgently liquidate"" due to other commitments.

The fully furnished two bedroom apartment came with ocean river and hinterland views from its mid-floor of the Skyline North Tower.

""Chevron Renaissance is highly regarded as a premier holiday high rise centrally located in the heart of Surfers Paradise"" the Ray White lisiting agent Harry Ranchhod advised in the marketing.

His last sale in the much traded complex was in December when 1274/23 Ferny Avenue a two bedroom two bathroom unit fetched $455000 having sold in 2003 off the plan at $658000.",,,

Other companies that performed well during the pandemic and decided to air commercials during the big game for the first time include Fiverr International and Scott Miracle-Gro according to The Wall Street Journal.

Chipotle's resilience and ability to adapt throughout the pandemic has allowed the company's business to boom during a time when many restaurants and chains struggled to stay open. Shares of Chipotle have gained 65% and Wedbush analysts expect the stock to surge 14% in 2021.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jaHVyY2gtZGlzcnVwdGlvbnMtb24tdGhlLXJpc2UtdGhyb3VnaG91dC1waXR0c2J1cmdoLWFyZWEtaW4tcmVjZW50LXdlZWtzL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9waXR0c2J1cmdoL25ld3MvY2h1cmNoLWRpc3J1cHRpb25zLW9uLXRoZS1yaXNlLXRocm91Z2hvdXQtcGl0dHNidXJnaC1hcmVhLWluLXJlY2VudC13ZWVrcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church disruptions on the rise throughout Pittsburgh area in recent weeks,"Pennsylvania pastor ""blessed"" to be alive after man tries to shoot him during sermon

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

""It was an important sacramental day for our parish and the children and their families were affected by the two teenager's actions"" Father John Moineau. ""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

Sejak saat itu dia menyimpan rapat-rapat separuh hati di dalam peti yang dingin dan ditimpa debu-debu waktu. Dia tidak mengizinkan siapa pun mengetuk pintu separuh hatinya yang lain.

Dia melihat wanita serupa bidadari yang membangkitkan gelora dari dalam jiwanya yang beku. Api cinta yang lama padam kini berpijar kembali.

Saat mimpi itu berlalu bersama malam dia pun menyadari mengapa enggan membuka pintu hati selama ini. Alam bawah sadarnya belum bisa melupakan gadis pujaan hati sepenuhnya. Ya bidadari itu adalah gadis pujaan hatinya yang entah mengapa hadir kembali dalam mimpi.

Saat membuka pintu rumah dia kembali terkejut.

Sang gadis telah berdiri di situ dengan wajah lebam dan air mata yang belum kering. Lewat tatap dia meminta tanpa kata. Tangannya menengadah nelangsa. Entah dari mana di atas telapak tangannya telah terbaring kunci untuk membuka sebuah peti.

CSCO,Cisco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV3c3RhY2suaW8vdGhlLW9wZW4tc291cmNlLWxlc3Nvbi1vZi10aGUtbGlua3N5cy13cnQ1NGctcm91dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Open Source Lesson of the Linksys WRT54G Router,"The remarkable case history of Linksys is a success story with a twist. It was a company that one analyst said “invented” consumer home networking according to Inc. before it was acquired in 2003 by Cisco for half a billion dollars. But that triumphant moment also revealed what became one of history’s most famous violations of an open source license which ultimately forced Cisco to release the firmware for the WRT54G router.

Yet in the end this seems to have led the router to an even more enduring popularity — and a lot of fond memories. But is there also a lesson there about how much good can be generated by open sourcing your software (maybe even for Elasticsearch)?

A new wave of nostalgia was prompted by a recent article on Tedium.co a site promising its readers “the history of things that usually don’t have histories written about them.” It remembers the Linksys WRT54G router as “the blue-and-black icon of wireless access… the wireless router that showed the world what a wireless router could do.”

Linksys had started in 1988 with a product that connected PCs to printers with cables and a 2004 article in Inc. magazine describes how Linksys had eventually started to break through with its four-port broadband router. In 1994 just before the dawn of the internet age Linksys’ annual revenue was $6.5 million Inc. remembers — but by 1998 it had grown to $65.6 million.

Ars Technica once interviewed Linksys employee #41 Karen Sohl. Sohl had joined Linksys in 1999 with many roles (including public relations) that by 2016 had led her to become director of global communications for Belkin which had acquired Linksys in 2013. But she still remembered a fateful appearance at Comdex in 1999 when Linksys was proudly touting a product that they were calling the Integrated Internet Hub.

“We were at the show and Bill Gates came by our booth… and he said ‘why don’t you guys just call this a router?'”

Linksys ultimately re-branded it as the Broadband EtherFast Router – and the next four years were even more successful. Inc. magazine reports that by 2001 Linksys had revenue of $346.7 million and a 34.2% market share (rising to 49% by 2003). So while Linksys was founded in an Orange County garage it eventually spent seven years on the Inc. 500 list before being acquired for half a billion dollars by Cisco in 2003. Inc. calls the tale of the company’s formation “an immigrant story of hard work and calculated risks.”

A Surprise in the Firmware

But in her interview with Ars Technica Sohl still remembered the popularity of Linksys’ first WRT54G in 2002. “That product really is what made the company.”

“Aimed at home users the $129 device has been a smash hit selling 400000 units in the first quarter of this year alone” wrote a 2003 article in Forbes.

But shortly after Cisco’s acquisition software engineer Andrew Miklas (later the co-founder of Pager Duty and an entrepreneur/investor) contacted Linksys and made a fateful discovery. Linksys’ firmware seemed to be incorporating several products from the Free Software Foundation which had been released under a GPL license (which requires their source code to always be freely available). A 2005 column in Linux Insider pithily described Cisco’s predicament: “In the trade this is known as ‘buying a lawsuit'” — though they also acknowledged that it was a complicated stack of technologies. While Cisco now owned Linksys Linksys had been buying its chips from Broadcom “and Broadcom also presumably did not know because it in turn outsourced the development of the firmware for the chipset to an overseas developer.”

“To discover the problem Cisco would have had to do diligence through three levels of product integration which anyone in the mergers and acquisitions trade can tell you is just about impossible. This was not sloppiness or carelessness — it was opaqueness.”

A 2003 article in Linux Devices got an equally charitable response from Open Source Initiative co-founder and open source software licensing expert Bruce Perens. “This is not really Cisco’s fault” Perens explained. “The GPL violation did not originate at Cisco or Linksys. An off-shore subcontractor supplied Linux as part of the device.”

Perens noted later that “Subcontractors in general are not doing enough to inform clients about their obligations under the GPL” though he also seemed to have some sympathy for engineers at small companies forced to interpret GPL themselves without lawyers conversant in U.S. software law. “Contractors will think ‘this is embedded no one can change the source — so the GPL must not really apply to us.'” Perens even said he had contacted Cisco specifically to keep them from being frightened away from using Linux in the future.

After the acquisition Cisco planned to release the source code for the router — though there were still issues to be ironed out. In 2003 Forbes pointed out that FSF had the pro bono services of Columbia Law School professor Eben Moglen who’d said “his chats with Cisco have been friendly and he believes the matter will be settled without a court fight.” But he was wrong.

Nearly five years later in December of 2008 the Free Software Foundation had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit arguing that “In doing so Cisco has denied its users their right to share and modify the software.” Its announcement included comments from FSF founder and president Richard Stallman who’d said “Our licenses are designed to ensure that everyone who uses the software can change it. In order to exercise that right people need the source code and that’s why our licenses require distributors to provide it. We are enforcing our licenses to protect the rights that everyone should have with all software: to use it share it and modify it as they see fit.”

Brett Smith licensing compliance engineer at the FSF added “We began working with Cisco in 2003 to help them establish a process for complying with our software licenses and the initial changes were very promising.” But Smith complained that Cisco “never put in the effort that was necessary to finish the process and now five years later we have still not seen a plan for compliance. As a result we believe that legal action is the best way to restore the rights we grant to all users of our software.”

In the open source licensing world it was historic. The FSF’s executive director Peter Brown said it was the first time since the group’s founding 15 years earlier that it had actually gone to court. But within six months they’d reached a settlement. Cisco agreed to appoint a Free Software Director to oversee its compliance with licenses going forward who would report periodically to the Free Software Foundation. The company notified previous recipients of Linksys of their rights under the GPL. Most importantly the company would make the source code available and even make “a monetary contribution” to the FSF.

Unintended Consequences

But the Tedium post remembers that the 2003 open sourcing of the router’s firmware had led to its use in software and hardware hacking projects. “[T]his opened up a world of opportunity and third-party developers quickly added capabilities to the original hardware that was never intended. This was essentially a commodity router that could be “hacked” to spit out a more powerful wireless signal at direct odds with the Federal Communications Commission developed into an SSH server or VPN for your home network or more colorfully turned into the brains of a robot.” Specifically a 2008 Hackaday post details how a developer disassembled and modified the router into a miniature controller for a camera-equipped home robot — held together with rubber bands and zip ties.

Tedium believes the open source firmware “created a cult of sorts around the device by making it hackable and able to do more things than the box on its own might have suggested” which also buttressed its reputation in the broader consumer market. “The result of all this is that despite its extreme age and not-ready-for-the-living-room looks it sold well for years past its sell-by date—in large part because of its reliance on open-source drivers.”

Last week sys admin Evan Anderson shared his own fond memories on Hacker News of finding the routers for sale in thrift stores. “They were great for having a little Linux-box to do oddball utility stuff — ad-hoc OpenVPN endpoints caching DNS server captive Wi-Fi portal controller. They were eerily solid for their built-to-a-price-point nature.”

And another reader commented that “I’m still using one WRT54GL 1.0 in a rural area. Because it just works and refuses to die.”

And Ars Technica got a similar response from Linksys employee #41 Karen Sohl. “Though it was a black eye for the company Sohl said that ‘what could have been a really awful situation ended up being a positive because it enabled us to do a lot of learning and get closer to the community.'”

To this day the router is still available on Amazon and in 2016 Ars Technica noted that “Linksys continues to earn millions of dollars per year selling an 11-year-old product without ever changing its specs or design.” Linksys’ Global Product Manager Vince La Duca told the site “We’ll keep building it because people keep buying it.” He attributes its longevity to reliability name-brand recognition and yes its open source firmware.

Ars Technica notes numerous positive reviews left on Amazon citing them as proof that “availability of open source firmware can make old hardware attractive.”

Imagine controlling thousands of elements in your factory or on your corporate campus via your own high-speed wireless network securely and in milliseconds. This is the dream offered by private 5G networks but despite initial moves towards these specialized networks in 2020 and 2021 these networks won’t realistically become commonplace globally until about 2025 or even later.

The hype over the possibilities offered by 5G private networks is at a fever pitch. Vendors mobile operators and analysts are all highlighting the potential speed security and low-latency characteristics that will be available through private networks utilizing the new cellular standard.

Release 16 of the 3GPP 5G phase 2 specification which was frozen in July 2020 lays a foundation for private 5G networks to be established. Notably the spec adds support for unlicensed spectrum such as the 6GHz public band (and the 60GHz band in the future).

The release also enhanced existing Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) a set of features that support and accelerate mission-critical applications over 5G. The low-latency target for 5G is 1 millisecond or less. Some observers expect this update to help promote systems like remote surgery or robotic operations on the factory floor.

The thing to remember is that it will likely take about 2 years from when the 3GPP Release 16 is frozen until we see technical updates in commercial chips. So we won’t see a lot of these pivotal improvements to private network deployments until at least 2022.

The ongoing Covid-19 crisis has palpably slowed down 5G developments and deployments as well. We can’t fully predict how the virus will affect 5G rollouts but we can certainly expect that it will.

So what does an enterprise need to implement a private 5G network?

The main thing that any private cellular network needs to operate is access to radio spectrum. As the current $80.9 billion C-band (3.7GHz to 4.2GHz) auction that has just closed in the U.S. indicates sales of suitable 5G wireless spectrum can command eye-popping prices. This means that major spectrum auctions are entirely the realm of big wireless and cable rather than smaller enterprises and service providers that cannot cough up the coin.

Small cell technology such as remote radio heads and gNodeB base station equipment will form the mobile edge of the 5G private network. Currently almost all consumer non-standalone 5G uses an existing 4G core as a control plane but pure private 5G will need to be standalone and will require 5G core software to operate.

“There’s some early 5G private networks already but because Standalone 5G cores are still immature they’re fairly rare or used for trials” analyst Dean Bubley founder of Disruptive Analysis told EE Times.

The majority of private cellular networks are still deployed using 4G Bubley notes.

Initial tests however are taking place in Germany the UK and Japan. In September 2020 German telecoms regulator Bundesnetzagentur awarded 74 licenses for deploying campus private 5G networks to applicants using the 3.7GHz band. That’s probably the most concentrated group of licenses yet awarded to deploy private 5G networks. Germany will be a focal point of private 5G activity in 2021 with a continued emphasis on deployments in the 3.7GHz band.

Japan and the UK are expected to be in the thick of it with private 5G in 2021 as well. Users are also expected to pop up in South Korea Hong Kong and Malaysia

Despite a lot of talk about private networks in the States almost all will actually stick with the LTE standard for the present. “U.S. CBRS is mostly 4G for now” Bubley notes. “There’s a 5G spec but that’s mostly aimed at service providers” because it uses a 4G control plane (called non-standalone) to manage the 5G data sessions.

The case for private 5G networks



A little background might be helpful here.

The modern concept of private cellular 4G networks became popular just a few years ago. There were early exponents of the LTE private networks such as the mining operation Rio Tinto which started deploying its first underground 4G network in Australia on the 1800MHz band in 2013. Rio Tinto replaced 30 Wi-Fi access points with 4 LTE base stations run from a single network operations center (NOC). The company cited the ability of its then-new network to support full wireless coverage and prioritize critical communications while using much less hardware than a large Wi-Fi network.

In December 2020 the Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) reported that over 500 companies are investing in 4G and 5G private network trials and commercial launches. “This is likely to be a substantial underestimate of the overall global market” the supplier organization allows noting that the exact number of private network deployments is hard to gauge since companies don’t like to make those details public.

Nonetheless vendors such as Nokia Ericsson and Qualcomm are crowing about advanced private 4G in 2021. Private 4G and 5G will likely co-exist for years to come since many enterprises don’t need to support millions of devices in their workspace or require a network that supports the lower latency promised by 5G.

Indeed most companies do not even need the capabilities offered by private LTE. The great majority of enterprises will stick with Wi-Fi for corporate connectivity for the foreseeable future. 802.11 better known as Wi-Fi was first created in the late 1990s to wirelessly transmit data over the air between enabled devices and access points on the 5GHz and 2.4GHz public frequencies. Private enterprise Wi-Fi networks from Cisco and others came into being in the early 2000s.

Over the last 20 years much has happened to improve Wi-Fi device roaming handover and security. Nowadays one expects to be readily able to make and receive voice calls over WiFi but this wasn’t always the case.

Today Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is becoming increasingly popular for enterprise and home usage. Analysts at IDC find that in the second quarter of 2020 Wi-Fi 6 unit shipments were up 16.8% worldwide although Wi-Fi 5 shipments still make up the majority of shipments.

So 5G will likely be a blip on the private enterprise landscape for several years to come especially as we wait for Covid to pass the 3GPP Release 16 technical updates to reach the market 5G core software to mature and regulators to make more unlicensed radio spectrum available globally.

Still given time 5G private networks will become more prevalent than any other private network based on a cellular standard. This is because 5G is the first cellular standard designed with private enterprise built into the technology from the very start.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L2RpYW1vbmQtaGlsbC12ZWxhLWZvdW5kZXItcmljLWRpbGxvbnMtYmVzdC1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWFkdmljZS80MjI3MzM3MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diamond Hill VELA founder Ric Dillon's best investment advice,"Tim Feran

Retirement didn’t last long for Ric Dillon. The 64-year-old founder of Diamond Hill Capital Management left the publicly traded company in 2018 intending to enjoy a “new venture” with his wife Marina — being father to their newborn daughter.

But during a friendly phone call from the CEO of Diamond Hill in late 2019 Dillon learned his old company would be exiting a part of the investment management industry that he is most passionate about. In less than a minute Dillon decided his retirement was about to end no more than a year after it had begun.

Dillon and former colleagues who helped build Diamond Hill’s assets under management to $21.8 billion got back together and launched a new venture VELA Investment Management last year.

Dillon an Ohio State University graduate who grew up in Newark spoke with Columbus CEO about the investment philosophy he and his colleagues are using to make VELA a fast-rising business.

What advice would you give investors today?

Dillon: Long-term is always a good idea. I’m often asked “I’ve got some money what should I invest in?” My first response is: Do you have any debt credit card debt say? If you do pay it off before you invest in anything. A home mortgage is a little different. Then I ask: What do you plan to do with the money? If you can’t have the money in the market for at least five years then you should’t be in it. There are plenty of short-term periods where markets go down 10% or 20%. The succinct way of saying all this is you match your investment with your investment objective.

Do you then just pick a good company and invest in it?

Dillon: Good companies sometimes are not good investments. For example in March 2000 Cisco Systems — the country’s leading maker of routers and other internet equipment — had $600 billion in market capitalization and it had revenue at the time of less than $10 billion. Today Cisco has about $30 billion in revenue and a market value of $300 billion. So in 20 years business tripled and the stock is down 50%.

Some people say “Well the stock is going up and if I buy today I think I can sell to someone tomorrow at a higher price.” That's the ""greater fool"" theory and we don't do that. We look for good companies with good prospects. The unfortunate thing today is that market valuations are extremely high. So if you invest today most likely you'll be disappointed with returns in the next five years.

So how do you pick a company to invest in?

Dillon: There's a three-part formula that's very simple to calculate your return on investments. One part of the formula is: the income while you hold the investment — that is dividends. You can get a reasonable estimate of that. Another part of the formula is what price you will sell the stock. That is something we don’t know — you have no clue.

The No. 1 thing in the formula is the one thing you're certain of: the price you pay. That is the only thing you can be certain of.

Tesla at one point was worth all the car companies in the world combined. Now I’ll admit that Tesla cars are great. But that doesn't mean it's a great investment. It really depends on the future and the valuation today. That's the only thing you can control what you pay.

Does everyone at VELA buy into that long-term investment philosophy?

Dillon: Absolutely — and in a crazy time it's better actually. In my career there were three difficult times to invest — the mid- to late-1980s the mid- to late-1990s and the past five years. The reason is irrational exuberance. That happens. Human beings are emotional creatures.

The fever just started to break in the last couple of months. I think it will take most of the next year before it becomes a widely held view that boy the markets really were crazy. But today that is not the consensus. Conditions are eerily similar to 2000-2005 for somewhat the same reasons. I think it was Mark Twain who said history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes. It’s getting crazy again. You have peaks and troughs driven by emotion.

Do not read on unless you have watched season eight episodes seven and eight.

The laundromat murder

The unacceptable yet somehow adorable face of violent phone theft is back. Souleymane resurfacing means CID have their star witness back and – now that they know Gilou is working Cisco’s gang undercover – everything is a lot less confusing. With the thinking being that Titi killed Amin they resolve to follow him until he commits a crime so they can grab his DNA. The simpleton swiftly obliges by picking a fight at a pool hall – but as ever there is a catch. Gilou gets caught up in the fracas and is arrested. The gang are happy to falsify statements – even Beckriche agrees to keep him out of the line of fire – but it is all for naught once Lucie catches a whiff of the subterfuge. She is furious with Beckriche for misleading her and immediately issues a bench warrant for Gilou. This will take some explaining – and she doesn’t sound as if she is in a listening mood.

Also having a ’mare is Ali whose strategy of palling up with Bilal backfires when the Barbès phone shop king threatens his family. It sends Ali into a boozy tailspin that culminates in him ploughing into a parked car with his police vehicle. He calls Laure who goes straight into fixer mode. She takes the hit for him and the crew rallies round him just as they did for Gilou. With everything that is coming up it is exactly the kind of solidarity they need.

Laure

More than anything Laure needs to be needed. After her recent troubles with Ali and Gilou there is a powerful demonstration of exactly how vital she is. When she gets a sit-down and heart-to-heart with Gilou there is tenderness understanding and a chance to really help him out. Having looked out for him on the night of the robbery and at the pool hall bust-up it feels good to have his back once again. Then when Ali goes off the rails and into a stationary vehicle it is Laure to whom he turns. She waltzes on to the crime scene straightens things out with the Old Bill packages her boy up and gets him safely back to base. CID has really been through it this year but finally it feels as if Mum is back.

Joséphine

Sometimes even the great have to delegate. Joséphine’s decision to put Edelman on Lola’s case gets a thunderous vindication when he forces Bastien to confess on the stand. It is a show-stopping performance by Edelman – Joséphine couldn’t have done better herself. It feels like a bittersweet victory though when Lola makes it clear that she will be moving on from Joséphine. “Why do we always want what we can’t have?” Joséphine asks Edelman. He looks at her all “tell me about it”.

A distraction is needed. Maybe a mercy dash to Catalonia to smuggle Souleymane’s brother Youssef into the country could be the tonic? Yes it is a 1300-mile round trip with every chance of ending her career and dumping her back in jail but if it stops Souleymane battering another civilian Barbès residents will breathe a sigh of relief. She expertly negotiates Dickensian waifs sleazy truckers and nosy customs officers to successfully extract her quarry. She gets written up for contraband but it is only some moody cigarettes bought as a distraction. Her human cargo survives the inspection intact.

Souleymane is a big fan of staying with Joséphine. She lets you spend time off school smuggles tobacco engages in a little light people trafficking – she is the coolest aunt ever.

Gilou

Gilou once again proves himself an indispensable cog in Cisco’s crime machine. He impersonates a police officer (something at which he has had plenty of practice) to get the room next door to the Alsatian in his hotel securing priceless intel for the rip-and-run operation they are planning. He also finds and grooms the gun collector they later burgle. With 15kg of coke on the table for the drug deal Brémont is delighted at the prospect of a big collar for the crime squad. But just as Gilou is looking like a shoo-in for employee of the month that walking dumpster fire Titi gets them both arrested. Back in a prison cell facing cancellation of his probation Gilou once again contemplates his life choices his face a study in hangdog resignation.

Notes and observations

There has been tension between Tom and Ali recently but when he sees him hungover and ashamed Tom lets his bro know he is there for him along with the rest of the team. Yes they bicker but family comes first.

Speaking of which Bilal seems to be the son of the foster family Titi grew up with. This would explain their closeness and also why Cisco wasn’t around to pass on any of his criminal expertise.

There is nothing solid on Darmon’s murder but it sounds like the 11.43-calibre gun Ahmed mentioned could be linked to the killing. If Gilou pulls off the twofer of the drug theft and the murder I am calling it – he is getting his badge back.

Emma smooches with Gilou to convince Ahmed they are an item. It is unnecessary but not unwelcome. Maybe she is his happy ending?

Can Gilou pull off the sting? Should Joséphine just go ahead and adopt Souleymane? What are your predictions for the series finale? Have your say below."

Deutsche Bank Barclays Bank of America Citigroup’s local unit Citibanamex Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Banco Santander Mexico and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were fined a combined 29.4 million pesos out of a potential 680 million (US$34.12 million) the document showed. Deutsche Bank and Barclays got the two biggest fines at 8.7 million pesos and 6.35 million pesos respectively (US$436606 and US$318673 respectively).

The ruling to be published as early as Monday January 25 follows a four-year investigation by antitrust commission COFECE that was aided by a whistle-blower who came forward in May 2015 the documents showed. Investigators said they found evidence in electronic chats from 2010 to 2013 of cartel behavior in the secondary market.

The fines are tiny compared to the billions of dollars Barclays and Deutsche paid back in 2015 to settle charges with US UK and European regulators. While COFECE can fine companies as much as 10% of their revenues when they engage in cartel-like behavior banks and traders were fined under a less-harsh statute that set maximums at 200000 times the country’s daily minimum wage.

From FATCA and FBAR to IRAs and PFIC – all US expat jargon explained,"Are you an American citizen living outside of the US? If so you are going to need to familiarise yourself with a mind-boggling dictionary’s-worth of acronyms and jargon relating both to your citizenship status and to the plethora of US rules and requirements that you need to observe.

From tax and pensions to business shareholdings and bank accounts the US authorities require a range of information from Americans overseas – and failure to comply can result in penalties for both individuals and businesses.

What’s more the rules are constantly changing. The arrival of Donald Trump in the White House in 2016 for example saw a raft of changes in the way US expatriates are taxed – with many of the implications still far from clear more than two years into his presidency.

Schroders Wealth US Ltd is among a small number of global businesses which specialise in offering wealth management services to US citizens wherever they live around the world focusing on investors with a minimum £1 million or currency equivalent. We understand the unique difficulties facing this group.

What follows is a list of what we have found to be among the most commonly-used jargon and technical terminology relating to the American expatriate experience – with explanations in plain English.

“Accidental American”

An “accidental American” is a citizen of a country other than the US but who is also deemed by the American authorities – and in particular the US tax authorities – to be a US citizen or more technically a “US person”.

In many cases accidental Americans are unaware of their status as “US persons” or only discover it only when they are quizzed by their bank or other financial provider such as an investment manager.

Most accidental Americans – or “accidentals” as they are sometimes called – were born in the US but left almost immediately and grew up elsewhere. Some gained their citizenship through their American parents. There has also long been a mistaken assumption that where someone becomes a citizen of another country they automatically cease to be a US person. This is a potentially costly mistake. In the eyes of the US authorities such individuals’ US status and in particular their tax and other reporting obligations continue.

“Citizide”

A variation on the word “suicide” this is a relatively new and grim slang term used mainly on social media by frustrated American expats to describe the act of having to voluntarily renounce their US citizenship because they say it’s the only way to be free of the reporting and tax-related complications of being an American trying to lead a normal life outside the States. On Twitter one recent commentator wrote: “Should Americans be forced to commit #citizide because they can't get the bank accounts they need?”

“Covered individual” or “covered expatriate”

The word “covered” in reference to an American who lives outside of the US is a definition the Internal Revenue Service uses to determine how they would be handled if they were for example to seek to renounce their citizenship.

An expat individual is deemed to be a “covered” expatriate if they meet any of the following conditions: they have an average annual net income for the five preceding tax years ending before the date they ceased to live in the US which exceeds US$165000 (adjusted for inflation in 2018); they have a net worth globally of US$2 million or more as of the date they left the US to live abroad; and they have not complied with all their US federal tax obligations for the past five years.

CRS: Common Reporting Standard

The Common Reporting Standard known more formally as the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information is a new information reporting framework set up under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. It establishes a system for enabling the automatic exchange of financial information (AEOI) between constituent countries.

The CRS’s information-sharing concept is seen as borrowing heavily from the Americans’ Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) which came into force globally in 2014.

The US is not currently a signatory to the CRS which began to come into force in 2017 arguing that because of FATCA it has no need to be.

DTA: Double Tax Agreement

Double tax agreements exist between countries that seek to eliminate the risk of individuals and companies being taxed twice for the same thing. They may be bilateral or multi-lateral. They can be extremely important for American expats as they help to ensure such individuals aren’t taxed by both their current country of residence and the US on the same income.

FATCA: Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act was signed into law by President Obama in March 2010 as part of a piece of domestic jobs legislation known as the HIRE Act and changed forever the way Americans overseas were treated by financial institutions at home and abroad. It is seen as the main reason many American expats and dual citizens have renounced their citizenships over the last few years and continue to do so.

FATCA requires all non-US (“foreign”) financial institutions to report the assets and identities of any US account-holders they have on their books to the US IRS. This has resulted in many of these non-US financial institutions refusing to have Americans as clients making life difficult for Americans living outside of the US as they can struggle to get bank accounts mortgages or investment services.

FBAR: Foreign Bank Account Report

Alongside one’s tax return FBARs are one of the most important reporting requirements Americans living overseas face each year reflected in the severity of the penalties for those who fail to do so. FBARS had their origins in the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 which was aimed at cracking down on money laundering and other financial crimes.

In essence you are expected to file an FBAR – effectively reporting the value of your account balances - if the total value of all of your overseas bank accounts is more than $10000 on any day in the tax year even if it’s split between two or more accounts.

FDII: Foreign-derived Intangible Income

FDII is among a number of new acronyms created in December 2017 by Donald Trump’s tax reform legislation the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It refers to what some tax experts say is a new “deduction opportunity” potentially capable of reducing the effective tax rate on qualifying income to 13.125%.

FDII is a newly-designated category of income. Under the new tax law a fixed rate of return is assumed on a corporation’s tangible assets and any remaining income is then deemed to have been generated by intangible assets.

FFI: Foreign Financial Institution

The term “Foreign Financial Institution” was formally created by FATCA the 2010 Obama legislation that aimed to make it more difficult for Americans to hide financial assets outside of the US. FATCA effectively created a new category of non-US financial services institution – the “Foreign Financial Institution” – which to look after the assets of US citizens must register with the US IRS. The FFI must agree to report in the words of the IRS “certain information about their US accounts including accounts of certain foreign entities with substantial US owners”.

Under FATCA these FFIs are required to withhold 30% on certain payments to these American clients if these clients fail to comply with their tax reporting obligations.

Examples of the types of institutions considered to be FFIs by the US definition include banks and other depositary institutions mutual funds and other custodial entities and such investment structures as hedge funds or private equity funds.

Certain types of insurance companies offering services such as annuities may also be considered FFIs.

Unless otherwise exempt FFIs that do not both register and agree to report to the IRS on their American clients’ holdings face a 30% withholding tax on certain US-source payments made to them.

FY: America’s fiscal year

The fiscal year is a US government term which applies to the federal government’s traditional accounting period and it begins on October 1 and ends on September 30.

Fiscal year is also a term used to describe the tax year that some US taxpayers adhere to by choice or necessity. A “fiscal year” for tax reporting purposes according to the IRS can be any period of 12 consecutive months ending on the last day of any month except December (which would make it a calendar year). Scroll down for “tax year”.

HCTA: Host country tax authority

This term refers to the tax authority in the country in which an expatriate is resident. For example for an American living in the United Kingdom the HCTA would be HM Revenue & Customs.

IRA: Individual Retirement Account

The Individual Retirement Account is a type of tax-advantaged retirement plan that is standard in the US. It is provided by US financial institutions although Americans who move abroad sometimes find that the institutions which have long overseen their IRA accounts no longer wish to have them as clients because of the added reporting requirements and thus the costs involved.

JCT: Joint Committee on Taxation

The Joint Committee on Taxation is a non-partisan committee of the US Congress originally established under the Revenue Act of 1926. It is made up of members of both houses of Congress who work with input from economists attorneys accountants and others to draft the US’s tax laws. Recently the JCT has been involved in considering how the US tax regime might be changed to make it fairer for expatriate Americans.

OVDP: Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program

The Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program was a regime that enabled American expats who had not been filing tax returns - or paying taxes they may have owed to the US - to become compliant without facing the often-significant penalties they would otherwise likely incur.

The program closed on September 28 2018 after running for more than eight years in various forms. In March 2018 the IRS reported that more than 56000 taxpayers had come forward since the OVDP programs began paying a total of US$11.1bn in back taxes interest and penalties.

PFIC: Passive Foreign Investment Company

A Passive Foreign Investment Company is a US government term for a range of fairly conventional pooled investments – such as mutual funds hedge funds insurance products and non-US pension plans – that are registered outside of the United States.

A bank account might also be a PFIC if it's a money-market fund rather than simply a deposit account because money market accounts are essentially short-maturity fixed-income mutual funds.

The tax treatment of PFICs is extremely punitive compared to the tax treatment of similar investments that are incorporated in the US. There are also burdensome reporting rules to take into account.

PFIC rules can and often are applied as well to investments held inside foreign pension funds unless those pension plans are recognized by the U.S. as “qualified” under the terms of a double-tax treaty between the U.S. and the host country.

QDOT: Qualifying domestic trust

A qualifying domestic trust or QDOT is a type of trust that allows the spouses of US citizens who are not US citizens themselves to claim the marital deduction for estate-tax purposes. Without such a trust spouses without US citizenship are not eligible for the marital deduction.

Some people say it’s a better choice than having the spouse apply for US citizenship as it’s typically easier and faster but it needs to be established carefully.

QROPS: Qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme

QROPS are a type of overseas pension scheme in the United Kingdom that meets certain requirements set by HMRC and which thus may receive transfers of UK pensions without incurring a tax penalty (such as an unauthorised payment charge). They came into being after a change in the UK’s pension legislation in 2006 as part of a pan-European move to make it possible for financial services transactions to take place freely across EU borders.

Americans who are considering transferring their UK pensions into a QROPS (sometimes now referred to as simply a “ROPS”) should seek advice as there can be major US tax problems if they are structured incorrectly.

RMD: Required minimum distribution

Required minimum distribution is a term that relates to US individual retirement accounts (IRAs). The RMD is the amount that the US government requires those who have IRAs to withdraw annually from their traditional IRAs as well as from any employer-sponsored retirement plans they may have.

They are required to begin making such withdrawals from their IRAs no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which they reach the age of 70½ . (The rules for employer-sponsored retirement plans may vary slightly from this.)

In recent years Congress has enabled individuals who want to avoid having to pay tax on the RMD income to direct their RMD payments directly to a charity.

SCE: Same country exemption

The same country exemption is an idea first proposed by the American Citizens Abroad (ACA) in 2015 as a means of helping American citizens living overseas to maintain foreign bank accounts and otherwise live normally with respect to financial products such as loans mortgages and investments in spite of the FATCA regulations.

Under FATCA non-US banks and other foreign financial institutions are obliged to report on US account holders’ accounts which as the ACA has noted has resulted in these institutions “turning away American customers or asking existing American customers to find another” institution willing to look after them – a phenomenon the ACA calls “lock-out”. The same country exemption would enable those US taxpayers who “truly reside” in a foreign country to have their “normal” local banking accounts exempt from the FATCA reporting rules.

Thus far the SCE has yet to make much progress in Congress.

SICAV: société d’investissement à capital variable

The SICAV (or “société d’investissement à capital variable” in French) is an open-ended collective investment structure that is a mainstay of the European investment landscape. SICAVs are similar to America’s open-ended mutual funds. SICAVs are not generally recommended for Americans because of the way the US taxes such assets.

TCJA: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a package of major changes to the US tax code signed into law by US president Donald Trump on 20 December 2017. The law was adverse for American expatriates as it contained a number of provisions that affected them and their offshore holdings.

The act included a provision relating to certain foreign companies known as “controlled foreign corporations” or CFCs defined as non-US corporate entities that are controlled by US shareholders.

Under the TCJA such entities will be subject to new US taxes – a “deemed transition tax” and a new minimum tax on foreign earnings known as the “global intangible low-taxed income” tax or GILTI. Both have been the subject of significant protest in the expatriate community.

UCITS: Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities

UCITS (Pronounced “yoo-sits”) refers to a set of European Union directives stemming from the 1980s that enabled collective investment schemes to operate freely throughout the EU on the basis of a single authorisation from one member state. In practice however many EU member nations have imposed additional regulatory requirements.

The idea didn’t actually take off until the original legislation was tweaked in 2001 (UCITS II and UCITS III).

A measure of the success of the concept is the degree to which UCITS funds have been embraced by investors in such markets as Asia and Latin America. However UCITS funds are not recommended for American investors even if they live outside of the US owing to the way the US taxes such investments.

TY: Tax year

The tax year is a time frame used by tax authorities around the world to structure their tax regimes. In the US the Internal Revenue Service allows most businesses the choice of using a calendar year or the company’s own fiscal year as its tax year.

As for individual Americans’ tax year the US norm is a calendar year ending on December 31 with tax returns due on the 15th of April the following year.

Expatriates though have an extra two months to file (making their deadline June 15th).

This is one of the government’s priorities and there is no plan to make citizens pay for health services.

Dr Ahmed bin Mohammed al Saeedi Minister of Health assured this when he gave a detailed statement during the sixth and seventh regular sessions of the second annual sitting of the Majlis Ash’shura on Sunday.

Regarding health insurance the minister stated that the issue had been referred to the Council of Ministers while its implementation assigned to CMA.

Starting on a gradual basis with the private sector “Citizens will not be negatively affected by any financial burdens from health insurance.”

COVID-19

In his statement before the Majlis the minister praised everyone for their cooperation towards reducing the impacts of the pandemic.

“The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 has reached more than 99 million cases at the global level while the number of deaths has reached more than 2 million. A steady increase in cases has recently been observed in many countries coinciding with the onset of winter.

The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases from the beginning of the pandemic till date is more than 133044 in the Sultanate including 10685 cases which required hospitalisation 2650 cases in intensive care units and 1521 deaths’’ he said.

However the last updated data indicated a noticeable decline in the number of infections and deaths as well as in the rate of positive tests for Covid-19 since mid-October 2020.

“Yet in the light of the continuation of the pandemic at the global level the possibility of the rise in the number of infections locally is not ruled out’’ Dr Al Saeedi added. On the other hand he said the use of non-drug interventions (such as the closure of activities and borders) has become a major challenge for countries and governments. The solutions for the next stage are limited to strengthening societal and institutional preventive measures (such as physical distancing wearing masks and hand hygiene) to coexist safely with the pandemic until vaccination of target groups is completed in the Sultanate according to the set plan.

VACCINES

Talking about the vaccines the minister said: “To ensure the Sultanate obtains the required quantities with appropriate conditions in terms of the international quality of the vaccines the speed of supply and the economic feasibility study several consultative and negotiation channels have been opened through the Global Alliance for From Page 1

Vaccines (GAV) and direct negotiations with the vaccine manufacturers. On December 28 the national vaccination campaign against COVID-19 was launched where a total of 27004 people have been immunised till date with a coverage rate of 99 per cent of the target groups.”

In their successive annual reports international organisations praised the Sultanate’s health achievements and their effectiveness.

“This international praise is a source of pride for all of us as it reflects the success achieved by the Sultanate in the field of the health sector as part of comprehensive development as the participation of community members in maintaining their health is necessary to bring about healthy development. Health is one of the advanced priorities in the comprehensive development process” he added.

The minister also noted that the Sultanate is among the first 40 countries in the world to obtain a Pfizer vaccine from the country of origin confirming that “we will not import any medicine without ensuring its safety. The Sultanate goes by the health standards and requirements and the lives of its citizens are very important. The system for managing and classifying vaccinations in the Sultanate ranked first among 127 countries and this classification is international.”

OMANISATION

Regarding Omanisation rates in the health sector the minister said the total number of employees in the Ministry of Health by the end of 2019 reached 39413 with an Omanisation rate of 72 per cent compared to 69 per cent in 2016. The percentage of employees in the medical and paramedical personnel represents 79 per cent of the total in the ministry.

The total number of Omanis who were hired after replacing expatriate workers during the period from 2016 to the end of 2019 stood at 3050 Omanis of whom 215 were doctors 1671 were nurses 251 were pharmacists and 913 were other paramedical categories according to the statement of the minister.

Omanisation of dentists in primary healthcare institutions has reached 100 per cent while Omanisation in the pharmacy sector in government institutions has reached 95 per cent.

“As for the private pharmaceutical sector the number is still not satisfactory. However we will not dispense with attracting experienced expatriate doctors. We have started implementing work contracts with expatriate doctors since 2014” Dr Al Saeedi said.

During the session the minister also indicated that there are four pharmaceutical factories under construction one in the production stage and a plan to expand ambulance services among health institutions.

He stressed the importance of enhancing investments in the health sector and localising industries noting that the ministry seeks to encourage investment in the sector and provide technical support.

In terms of the existing projects the minister said “Al Suwaiq Hospital is under construction and the completion rate of the project has crossed 20 per cent.”

He said: “We are counting on it to relieve pressure on the health sector in the South Al Batinah Governorate.”

There is also the expansion of care unit in Jaalan Bani Bu Ali Hospital which will be operated if the capabilities are available. Besides Shaleem Hospital has been expanded and it provides maternity and emergency services. It is a fully integrated facility.",,,,,,

Jessica Korda owned the day.

A sizzling 28 on the back nine — 9-under par — at Four Seasons Golf and Sports Club Orlando lifted Korda to an 11-under 60 just one shot off the LPGA Tour scoring mark.

Kang was at 21-under 192 through three bogey-free rounds. Her total tied an LPGA mark for raw score through 54 holes (shared by three others) and shattered the tournament's 54-hole record (200). She will take a two-shot lead over Korda into Sunday in what sets up as a terrific shootout for the LPGA's season opener:

Kang leads Jessica Korda by two and Nelly Korda (67) by six. South Korea's In Gee Chun (67) sits fourth eight shots back.

WATCH | Danielle Kang holds a 2-shot lead at Tournament of Champions:

Danielle Kang leads Tournament of Champions after Round 3 Duration 0:33 Kang holds a two-shot lead going into Sunday and has yet to bogey a hole through three rounds.

Brooke Henderson of Smiths Falls Ont. carded a third-round 65 and enters the final round eight shots off the pace.

Jessica Korda 27 is the older of the LPGA's uber-talented sisters — younger sister Nelly 22 is No. 4 in the women's world ranking just ahead of Kang. She followed a ho-hum start with birdies on six of her first seven holes on the second nine. She then finished with a huge kick making an eagle on the 537-yard 17th hole which she reached in two with a 4-iron pouring in an 18-foot right-to-left putt.

Korda added a ninth birdie at the challenging water-guarded par-3 18th where she struck a soft 6-iron to 9 feet.

The slick downhill putt tumbled in on its last turn giving Korda the tour's first 60 since Paula Creamer in the 2008 Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic. Korda became the fifth LPGA player to ever shoot that number.

The back-nine birdies and eagles were arriving at such a pace that neither Korda nor those playing alongside could keep up with the dizzying math. The two celebrities in her group — NFL receiver Larry Fitzgerald and Fox television anchor Brett Baier —- knew something special was happening and just tried to stay out of her way.

'Days like today don't come often'

Korda's round was just one shot off the record of 59 by Annika Sorenstam nearly 20 years ago in Phoenix. Sorenstam is at Diamond Resorts this week competing in the 53-player celebrity division.

""I didn't process what exactly was happening until I made that putt on 17"" Korda said. ""I was like `Oh OK. That's nice.' Days like today don't come often so you really cherish them when they do. Everything has to come together to have a day like today.""

Fitzgerald who said he watches the LPGA more than he does the PGA Tour said of Korda ""It was mastery at its finest. She had complete command of her ball today.""

On a day conducive to low scoring —- overcast light wind and late morning rain that softened greens —- Kang a five-time LPGA champion made eight birdies against no bogeys and tied her career low. Her streak without a bogey was stretched to 70 holes dating to the final round of the CME Group Tour Championship in December.

The eight birdies were nice but Kang took particular pride in a hard-fought par at the 17th that kept her card clean. She chunked her 5-wood second shot into a pond fronting the green took a penalty drop hit wedge to 11 feet and made the par-saving putt. When it fell she gave a belt-high intense fist pump. She then birdied the last hole from 4 feet to push her lead to two shots.

""Overall I think my game is pretty solid"" Kang said. ""I think my mental game is pretty strong this week. Just kind of chugging along. That's what I'm doing is just focusing on what I need to hit and what I need to execute. That's pretty much it.""

LPGA players in the winners-only field have been grouped with celebrity players in each of the first three rounds but on Sunday Kang will be joined with the Korda sisters in the final threesome.

Jessica and Nelly are best friends and they downplay that any rivalry exists but both are highly competitive. Kang is the player to beat sure but finally the Kordas will play with something big on the line.

With a wry smile Jessica Korda said ""You guys finally get your wish.""

Trailing by three shots headed to the back nine at Four Seasons Golf and Sports Club Orlando on Sunday she first caught Danielle Kang with a late four-birdie burst to shoot 5-under 66 then won with a curling 30-footer for birdie on the first playoff hole.

Kang shot 68. The leader after each of the first three rounds she had a chance to extend the playoff but missed her 18-foot birdie putt on the low side at the 185-yard 18th.

It was the sixth LPGA victory for the 27-year-old Korda her last one coming nearly three years ago.

She and Kang finished at 24-under 260 to eclipse the previous tournament record by 10 shots. Korda ranked 23rd in the world also had to turn back her younger sister Nelly Korda 22 who at No. 4 in the world ranking was the top player in the elite winners-only field.

""I knew I was going to have to go low today"" said Jessica Korda. Half of her six victories have arrived at season-opening events. ""It was a crazy day ... A crazy two days. A crazy week!""

Nelly Korda started her round six shots back Sunday and shot a 64 -- which included a missed 3-footer for birdie at 16 -- that left her two shots out of the playoff.

Saturday Jessica Korda became the sixth player in LPGA history to shoot 60 or better with her sparkling 11-under 60. A day later she was slow to build any sort of momentum playing her first 12 holes in 1 under. At one point early in the opening nine Kang had a 7-foot putt to stretch her lead to five shots and she was threatening to leave the field way behind.

Jessica Korda had owned the back nine all week (she would play it in 21-under par despite her three closing bogeys Friday). Trailing by two shots while standing on the par-5 13th tee and relaxed as she chatted to three celebrity players on the tee she knew she needed to be more aggressive -- especially because Kang had yet to make a single bogey all week.

""When you're chasing you need to keep the pedal to the metal"" Korda said ""and I wasn't doing that.""

Kang went 68 holes in the tournament without a bogey (and 84 holes overall dating to December's CME Group Championship) her streak ending when she three-putted for bogey at the rugged 419-yard 15th.

She followed that with her loosest swing of the day a driver flared right into the trees and pine straw at the drivable par-4 16th. She did well to scramble for par. Jessica Korda meanwhile made an easy birdie after hitting a drive onto the front apron and with two holes to play the pair were tied at 23 under. Both birdied the par-5 17th.

Kang also seeking her sixth LPGA victory had spoken all week about not being able to prepare for the event as she normally would. That caught up to her down the stretch. Though she never tested positive for COVID-19 she twice was exposed and took six tests before getting on a plane from Las Vegas to Orlando landing late Monday night. Still she'd played flawlessly. But when she needed to make clutch shots down the stretch she discovered something was missing.

""'I'm not disappointed in that I didn't win"" Kang said. ""It's not about winning and losing for me. It's about being able to execute when I want to -- and having a feeling when I feel like I can't do something is something I don't like.""

In the Diamond Resorts' 53-player celebrity division tennis player Mardy Fish captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team finished on top with 158 points beating Chad Pfiefer an inspirational former military serviceman who competes with a prosthetic leg. With his victory Fish became the event's first three-time winner. He also won the American Century Championship in Lake Tahoe in July.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZmluZ2luZGlhbi5jb20vZGFuaWVsbGUta2FuZy1yZXRhaW5zLWNvbnRyb2wtaW4tdGhlLXRvdXJuYW1lbnQtb2YtY2hhbXBpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Danielle Kang retains control in the Tournament of Champions,"Danielle Kang - Sam Greenwood - Getty - LPGA

23 January 2021: Another day another bogey-free round for Danielle Kang. The four-time LPGA Tour winner shot a 6-under 65 in Friday’s second round and built a two-stroke lead over Nelly Korda at the 2021 Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions presented by Insurance Office of America. Kang who won twice in 2020 and led the Tour in scoring average birdied the opening par-4 first to set the tone for her second round. It was her second consecutive bogey-free round and she is the only player in the LPGA Tour field yet to card a bogey.

“Like yesterday I had a lot of fun out there today and made some good birdies” said Kang who played alongside MLB Hall of Famer John Smoltz and Grammy Award nominee Cole Swindell. “This golf course is kind of sneaky tough at the same time so I just can’t lose focus on certain shots. Three-putts are out there too which is scary. But I’m having a lot of fun.”

Korda returned to her old coach David Whelan following the 2020 CME Group Tour Championship and feels very “dialed in” with her ball striking. That hard work clearly showed in her stats with the 22-year-old Floridian missing just one fairway and one green in her second-round 5-under 66. Korda is looking for her first win since the 2019 Taiwan Swinging Skirts LPGA and her first victory on home soil.

“I was striking the ball really well today and I gave myself a lot of chances and I converted a couple here and there. I made one kind of stupid bogey a three-putt” said Korda who has won twice in Chinese Taipei and once in Australia. “Other than that I hit it really solid.”

Defending champion Gaby Lopez and two-time major champion In Gee Chun are tied for third at -9 with Korda’s older sister Jessica Korda rounding out the top five at -8.

In the celebrity competition former tennis player Mardy Fish leads the field at +78 followed by New York Yankees center fielder Aaron Hicks and retired Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee at +73. Two-time defending celebrity champion John Smoltz heads into the weekend in sixth at +68. The celebrity competition is played under a Modified Stableford scoring system.

DANIELLE KANG KEEPS THE LEAD AS SHE FOCUSES ON HER PUTTS

In her third #DiamondLPGA at Four Seasons Golf and Sports Club Orlando Rolex Ranking No. 5 Danielle Kang is sticking to her game plan of having fun but still finding time to grind. She’s still got to work on sinking more of those pesky putts.

“Short game is something that I’ve been really focusing on and iron game” said Kang winner of the 2020 Vare Trophy for having the season’s low scoring average. “This golf course you have to put it in specific spots. I’m just trying to play smart. I’ve been here for three years now. I think I know where to capitalize and don’t. I just got to stay extra focused.”

As any good athlete knows there is always something to improve. Lately Kang has been focusing on her putting – specifically how she feels over putts. With just 54 putts over the past two days Kang would love to keep that number as low as possible.

“Not quite there yet. Obviously a work in progress” said Kang of the state of her game. “This is the first step to what I want to accomplish. I’m just sticking to my routine and thought process. Like people say golf is a game between your ears and thoughts that go through my mind.”

With the field re-pairing after every round Kang always likes the surprise of seeing which celebrities she will get to play with the next day. One golf legend who Kang would be honored to play with is 72-time LPGA Tour winner Annika Sorenstam who mentioned texting with Kang about her game and preparing for this week’s event.

“It would be incredible to play with her. I would be really nervous if I played with her right now” said Kang who has five LPGA Tour victories under her belt. “It’s actually kind of my dream to play with her at least once. we do text back and forth. Her advice has gotten me pretty far. She’s helped me with putting chipping wedges. Coming from Annika it really helped.”",,,,,,

The chair of Marown Commissioners has backed calls to bring local authority legislation into the 21st century.

Alison Lynch says she would support updating the current laws as long as it didn’t have a negative impact on the services provided.

Her comments come after central government was urged to review current rules earlier this week.

Mrs Lynch believes broadcasting meetings online could boost engagement.

Dr Michelle Haywood the chair of Port St Mary Commissioners claims the current law prevents virtual meetings and needs changing in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Legislative Council member Rob Mercer also hinted he would be in favour of a permanent change however former Lib Van chairman Michael Josem was hesitant to offer his backing.

In a post on social media he said he would only support amendments “if there are good provisions for non-internet public access (eg people can phone in etc)”.

He added: “Some people aren’t able to join our online Liveral Vannin meetings because they don’t have good online access.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneWZtLm5ldC9jbXMvbmV3c19zdG9yeV82NjAyNTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Year Dip raises thousands for charity,"New Year Dip raises thousands for charity

KO,Coca-Cola Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdG9jay13YXJzLWNvY2EtY29sYS12cy0xMjQ4MDQyMTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock Wars: Coca-Cola Vs. Pepsi,"Comb through the annual reports of Coca-Cola and Pepsi and you will see the two rivals list one another as their main competition. White both are giants in the beverage field there is one key difference which could be the reason to pick one over the other.

About Coca-Cola: Sparkling soft drink brands for Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) include Coca-Cola Diet Coke Sprite and Fanta. The company also has a growing portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks that includes Powerade Vitaminwater Minute Maid Costa Coffee Fuse and Gold Peak.

Coca-Cola also owns a stake in energy drink maker Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and helps distribute the brand. The company owns a stake in growing sports drink company BodyArmor.

Sparkling soft drinks made up 69% of unit case volume for Coca-Cola in fiscal 2019. The company’s portfolio includes four of the top five non-alcoholic sparkling beverages with Coke Diet Coke Fanta and Sprite.

About Pepsi: Sparkling soft drink brands for PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: PEP) include Pepsi Diet Pepsi Mountain Dew and Mug Root Beer. The company’s portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks includes Gatorade bubbly Pure Leaf and Tropicana.

The Key Difference: The big difference between the two beverage giants is the huge portfolio of food brands owned by PepsiCo.

Under its Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats divisions Pepsi owns brands like Lay’s Doritos Quaker Oats Sabra Cheetos Fritos Tostitos Cap’N Crunch and Aunt Jemima.

Pepsi got 54% of its revenue from food in fiscal 2019 making its beverage division the smaller segment. The Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods North America segments made up 25% and 4% of overall fiscal 2019 revenue respectively.

Frito-Lay North America made up 45% of the operating profit for PepsiCo in fiscal 2019. This high margin segment has been a key to the financial success of the company over the years.

Financials: Coca-Cola has products in more than 200 countries. The company got 18% of its unit volume from the United States in fiscal 2019 with the rest coming from international markets.

Sales for Coca-Cola rose in fiscal 2019 but that came after three straight years of declining sales. Revenue was $37.3 billion in fiscal 2019. Net income for the company hit a five-year high of $8.9 billion in fiscal 2019.

Coca-Cola reported third-quarter revenue declined 9% year-over-year to $8.7 billion. Coca-Cola lost value share in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink segment.

Coca-Cola presently pays dividends of $1.60 per year equal to a 3.4% dividend yield. The company has raised its dividend 58 consecutive years.

Story continues

Pepsi got 58% of its revenue from the United States in fiscal 2019 and 42% from international territories. Revenue for PepsiCo was $67.2 billion in fiscal 2019 and was up year over year for the fourth consecutive year.

PepsiCo had revenue growth of 5.3% year over year in the third quarter to $18.09 billion.

The dividend yield for shares of Pepsi is 2.9%. Pepsi has raised its dividend 48 consecutive years.

Stock Action: Shares of Coca-Cola have fallen 14% over the last year. The stock is up 18% in the last five years and up 56% in the last 10 years.

Shares of Pepsi are down 2% over the last year. Shares are up 48% over the last five years and up 112% over the last 10 years.

What’s Next: Coca-Cola has made several acquisitions over the years to grow its non-sparkling soft drink segment. This could be a continued focus by the company.

Coca-Cola is also phasing out underperforming brands like Zico and Tab. A national launch of the company’s Topo Chico hard seltzer is happening in the first half of 2021 with distribution partner Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE: TAP).

Pepsi has been acquiring food brands to boost its more profitable business segment. Acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery will help strengthen the company in Africa and China respectively.

Benzinga's Take: Coca-Cola has a strong brand and international presence. The company has the higher dividend yield of the two beverage giants.

But the growing food portfolio of PepsiCo and the consecutive years of revenue growth could make the food and beverage giant the winner in this battle.

He halted construction on the border wall and re-established DACA protections. He rejoined the Paris Climate Accord and recommitted the United States to the World Health Organization. And according to broadcast journalist Tom Newton Dunn Biden removed Donald Trump's ""Diet Coke button"" which the former president used to request cold sodas on-demand.

""When @ShippersUnbound [Tim Shipman] and I interviewed Donald Trump in 2019 we became fascinated by what the little red button did"" Dunn tweeted. ""Eventually Trump pressed it and a butler swiftly brought in a Diet Coke on a silver platter. It's gone now.""

Throughout Trump's presidency his obsessive love of the beverage was well-documented. In 2017 the Washington Post published that he reportedly drank a dozen cans of Diet Coke per day and while the majority of Americans are just finding out about the Diet Coke button that same year Demetri Sevastopulo wrote for The Financial Times about how he noticed the red button on Trump's desk. He jokingly asked if it was the nuclear button to which Trump replied ""No no everyone thinks it is. Everyone does get a little nervous when I press that button.""

According to the Associated Press the button has been a fixture ""on the Resolute Desk that presidents have used for decades"" though not for summoning diet soda. The fact that Trump appropriated for it for such use is frankly unsurprising. Its existence is a reminder for some of the most laughable parts of Trump's personality (and its removal seems to have been an almost a necessary exorcism).

While assigning goodness or inherent value to a food item can turn into an uncomfortable pseudo-classist exercise (like when the New York Times hosted a quiz where readers could guess whether refrigerators belonged to Biden voters or Trump voters based on their contents) there's a certain ""Home Alone 2: Escape to New York"" childishness inherent to slapping a button 12 times a day as a way to demand a Diet Coke on a silver platter.

It's a warped idea of what fanciness or indulgence denotes which is both a perfect encapsulation of Trump's public persona and in part what led to Diet Coke's heyday in the '90s.

Consider the often-memed image of Trump and Melania standing wax figure-like in their $100 million New York penthouse. It's gaudy and gold-covered with columns chandeliers and frescos reminiscent of a Cheesecake Factory dining room. That photograph is the visual definition of the adage ""You can't buy taste.""

Trump's tastelessness was a glaring omnipresent facet of his presidency. A photograph that feels strikingly similar was taken in 2019 when Trump invited the Clemson Tigers that year's national college football champions for a White House dinner only to serve them a buffet of Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and slices of Domino's pizza a choice that many criticized as racist and classist. He stands beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln with his arms outstretched over a mahogany table stacked high with cardboard burger boxes and flimsy plastic packets of fast food sauces that were balanced inside pewter gravy boats.

""We went out and we ordered American fast food paid for by me"" he told reporters that night. ""Lots of hamburgers lots of pizza. Three hundred hamburgers. Many many French fries.""

It may seem odd that a well-documented fast food devotee (and former McDonald's and Pizza Hut spokesperson) like Trump would opt for Diet Coke instead of the real thing but it's important to consider what the beverage likely meant to him.

In his essay ""The Decline and Fall of Diet Coke and the Power Generation That Loved It"" Nathan Heller asserts that while the Coca-Cola company tried to endear the beverage to ""hip scrappy youths it became enduringly the beverage of the power generation that emerged across the Clinton years and cheered tie-less outside-the-box rule-bending thought in business and in life.""

""During the late eighties and nineties Diet Coke seemed less fussy less patrician less 'Frasier' than second-wave coffee"" Heller wrote.""It helped define a novel archetype of masculinity — the bootstraps kid who'd made it big who was cool and modern in a suit.""

This is despite the fact that diet soda was traditionally marketed to women as a way to control weight. Emily Contois the author of ""Diners Dudes and Diets: How Gender and Power Collide in Food Media and Culture"" wrote that while Coca-Cola went after male and female customers with Diet Coke unlike their previous diet product Tab they were largely unsuccessful.

""Men (and broader culture) seemed to deem the beverage derisively feminine in later decades"" Contois wrote. ""For example in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution an unidentified Coca-Cola executive declared that diet is a 'four-letter word' for men or at least those aged 16–24.""

When I emailed Contois to inquire as to why she thought President Trump a leader who was deeply preoccupied with a limited and pugilistic view of masculinity would drink Diet Coke her answer was succinct.

""Trump seemed to believe that rules of any sort don't apply to him"" she wrote via email. ""That guided his food and beverage choices — from a dozen Diet Cokes a day to well-done steak with ketchup to copious fast food — and much of his presidency.""

While it's impossible to know what exactly Diet Coke meant to Trump (though we know it was something he would request during tense conversations like when he cried out for one while discussing purchasing the rights to a story about an alleged affair he had with ex-Playboy model Karen Mcdougall) the bizarre optics surrounding the revelation of the Diet Coke button is a fitting epilogue to his presidency. It's a reminder of a man who could have just used an office mini-fridge to satiate his cravings but obviously liked the feeling of being able to summon a servant with a cold drink at the push of a button. While so many of his stump speeches were bolstered by ramblings about being a man of the people his actions consistently contradicted that — even down to how he took his dozen daily sodas.

But the Trump era has concluded and the Oval Office already looks different. Where a bust of Fred Trump used to preside over the office there is now a statue of labor organizer Cesar Chavez; Trump's beige rug has been swapped out for a royal blue replacement and a portrait of Andrew Jackson was taken down in favor of a painting of Benjamin Franklin. No word yet on whether the Resolute Desk button will be replaced — and if so what pushing it will summon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZWN0YXRvci5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL3doYXQtdGhlLXdlc3QtY2FuLWRvLWFib3V0LWNoaW5hcy11eWdodXItbGFib3VyLWNhbXBzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What the West can do about China's Uyghur labour camps,"Coca-Cola’s most controversial bottling plant is a huge factory located in an industrial zone just outside the city of Urumqi in western China. Logistically the factory is well situated: the international airport is a short drive away as is the high-speed train station close to the fashionable Wyndham hotel. But the problem for Coca-Cola — and other western companies such as Volkswagen and BASF which operate plants in the same region — is the existence of hundreds of facilities not mentioned on any official map. The Cofco Coca-Cola plant a joint venture with a Chinese state company is surrounded by prisons and re-education camps in which China suppresses local ethnic minorities according to human rights experts. Many of those minorities are forced to work for factories or farms making products also sold in the UK.

Xinjiang a huge area of remote deserts and rich mineral resources is the centre of what world religious leaders including five Church of England bishops have named as ‘one of the most egregious human tragedies since the Holocaust’. In the past three years China has put an estimated one million Uyghurs Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities — more than one-tenth of the adult population — in re-education camps. In the camps they are forced to renounce their religious belief and praise the Communist party and are subjected to brainwashing. Inmates often try to kill themselves.

Evidence shows that China is now shifting from mass internment to forced labour to control the local population. According to a study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute a think tank established by the Australian government more than 80000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in factories in other parts of China between 2017 and 2019 ‘under conditions that strongly suggest forced labour’. Some had been sent directly from detention camps to production lines. In the factories the Uyghurs are held under prison-like conditions with long working hours and daily indoctrination sessions according to online evidence and witness reports. The workers are not allowed to leave even if they work close to their homes.

‘After being released [from a camp] you need to work according to their policies’ Muhamet Qyzyrbek told the New York Times. His 31-year-old wife Amanzhol Qisa had spent a year in a re-education camp in Xinjiang and was then sent to work at a clothing factory for three months. She was paid less than half of minimum wage. Gulsira Auelchan was trained to use a sewing machine when she was held in a camp in 2017 and 2018. After her release she was pressured to sew gloves at a factory near the camp. ‘I don’t know how many hours per day I worked. There was no clock’ she told the German weekly Die Zeit. ‘We left the dormitory in the dark and came back in the dark.’

In the past two years these programmes have been significantly enlarged. According to China’s official statistics 2.6 million ‘surplus rural workers’ in Xinjiang were ‘relocated’ within one year — an increase of 46 per cent. Beijing strictly denies any forced labour and justifies its policy perversely as a ‘poverty elimination programme’. But experts and foreign governments are alarmed. ‘Evidence of forced Uyghur labour within Xinjiang and in other parts of China is credible it is growing and deeply troubling to the UK government’ Foreign Office Minister Nigel Adams told parliament last month. Last week Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced plans to outlaw Chinese imports with links to human rights abuse. The UK will introduce fines and possible sanctions against companies which are connected to slave labour. The US government has already imposed sanctions and restrictions against 48 Chinese companies suspected of using forced labour or providing technical assistance to the suppression system in Xinjiang. Among these companies are suppliers of well-known international brands such as Nike H&M and Apple.

In the factories the Uyghurs are held under prison-like conditions with daily indoctrination sessions

The Coca-Cola factory in Urumqi is in the middle of Xinjiang’s system of detention camps and re-education facilities described by the US Congress as the ‘largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world’. Within 30km of the plant there are 25 prisons and internment camps according to ASPI which used satellite technology and witness reports to identify these secret facilities. In the whole of Xinjiang there are at least 380 incarceration camps some of them huge structures with watchtowers barbed wire and thousands of inmates.

Coca-Cola opened its plant as part of a 210 million yuan (£23 million today) investment 12 years ago but the factory is run by the Chinese majority stakeholder Cofco. Can Coca-Cola’s managers be sure that — possibly without their knowledge — forced labour isn’t happening in their factory or among their suppliers? In a statement Coca-Cola says its company policies ‘strictly prohibit forced labour’ and that it uses third-party agencies to oversee compliance. But travel and administration restrictions in Xinjiang make it nearly impossible to monitor labour standards. As a result at least three major monitoring organisations have stopped doing human rights assessments in the region.

It is not just detention and labour camps that China uses to control Xinjiang’s estimated 14 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. The region’s party secretary Chen Quanguo is praised by state media as the inventor of ‘convenience police stations’ a grid system with thousands of hi-tech checkpoints. From the stations which are as little as 300 metres from each other all parts of daily life are digitally monitored from private internet usage to the commute to work. Cars have to be fitted with GPS sensors and drivers need a face scan to buy petrol so the authorities can always track their movement. Surveillance cameras monitor all streets and are sometimes even installed inside private houses. The result is a new form of technology-driven authoritarian rule that is unparalleled in the world. When I visited Xinjiang undercover in 2018 I spoke to people whose family members had been sent to camps for using WhatsApp for praying and even for buying too much petrol at the fuel station.

For Volkswagen which produces Santana sedans and Tharu SUVs in Urumqi its presence in Xinjiang is political. Economically the factory in Xinjiang hardly makes sense; parts have to be transported thousands of kilometres from the coastal regions and instead of the planned 50000 cars per year it produces fewer than 20000. The 2013 factory was a political present to China’s government which wanted to show its success in the region. Closing the factory today would risk Volkswagen’s entire China business which brings in billions in profits. Every second VW worldwide is sold in the People’s Republic. Stephan Wöllenstein the company’s China chief says that Volkswagen is ‘concerned’ about the situation in Xinjiang but adds: ‘I don’t think that to steal away from the region would solve the political problems.’

Even for companies that do not have factories in Xinjiang it is difficult not to get tangled in China’s Muslim clampdown. Apple has been criticised for doing business with a company named O-film a major supplier of technical parts for iPhones which is accused of using several hundred Uyghur workers transferred from Xinjiang in its factories. The US Department of Commerce put O-film on its sanction list for suspected human rights violations. The US food company Kraft Heinz has business relations with Cofco Tunhe China’s largest tomato processor which is also suspected of participating in Uyghur labour programmes. All mentioned companies denied any involvement or knowledge of forced labour.

The textile industry is under special scrutiny. Xinjiang is a major producer of cotton which is mainly being picked by hand. China has started to substitute Han-Chinese workers in the fields with Uyghurs and other minorities using propaganda campaigns and strong pressure according to researchers. Adrian Zenz senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and a leading expert on Xinjiang estimates that most of today’s cotton in Xinjiang is picked under forced labour conditions and with minimal payment. ‘More than half a million Uyghurs — probably whether they want to or not — are being sent by the state to the fields for three months’ he says.

For the fashion industry it is nearly impossible to avoid the issue. Brands including Hugo Boss Adidas Muji Uniqlo Costco Caterpillar Lacoste Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger have been named in reports tying them to Xinjiang factories or materials. One in five cotton products worldwide is made with Xinjiang cotton though Marks & Spencer last week signed a call to action regarding Xinjiang and pledged to stop using any cotton from the region.

But in the end it is us as consumers who will influence the fate of the millions of people in Xinjiang. For many in the West it has become normal to boycott products that violate animal rights or destroy our environment. It is time that we apply the same standards to slave labour and gross human rights violations when we are about to buy a product labelled ‘Made in China’.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L21hbnktc3VwZXItYm93bC1hZHZlcnRpc2Vycy13b250LWhhdmUtY29tbWVyY2lhbHMtdGhpcy15ZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Many Super Bowl advertisers won't have commercials this year,"The Super Bowl may be known for its commercials but even the advertising world isn’t expecting a lot of touchdowns this year.

A startling number of brands known for showcasing new commercials during the big football season finale are bowing out Super Bowl LV this year as advertisers struggle to hit the right note in a country plagued by the coronavirus pandemic social and political unrest and record unemployment. Those that stay in the game are largely expected to play it safe experts say.

“There is trepidation around Super Bowl advertising this year” said Bill Oberlander co-founder and executive creative of ad agency Oberland. “For the Super Bowl you generally go big or go home. I think brands are going home rather than spending tens of millions of dollars and not getting it right. They’re saying ‘Let’s wait until this s—storm clears.’”

The most recent brand to pass on Super Bowl LV is beverage giant Coca-Cola which has run an ad during the closely watched football game every year since 2006 — except in 2019 when it aired a pre-game ad instead.

“This difficult choice was made to ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times” Coca-Cola said.

Also out are Hyundai Olay Avocados From Mexico Little Caesars and Ford.

As protests and a pandemic grip the nation companies have grown wary of striking the wrong tone with their advertising and are choosing not to buy TV spots during Super Bowl LV. NY Post photo composite

In ending its six-year Super Bowl advertising streak Avocados From Mexico said it’s “reinventing” itself for its return to the game next year. Hyundai which has run ads in 12 of the past 13 Super Bowls also hinted the time-out is temporary saying it “will certainly be back.”

That’s not to say Super Bowl LV scheduled to air Feb. 7 on CBS will be ad-free. Big brands like M&M’s TurboTax Anheuser-Busch Toyota Pringles and Mountain Dew have all paid handsomely for the right to run commercials in front of what is usually the biggest television audience of the year.

And rates this year have held up at around $5.5 million for a 30-second slot down just slightly from last year’s rate of $5.6 million per 30 seconds.

But ad space as of early January hadn’t yet been sold out according to sources with knowledge of the situation. In 2019 by contrast Fox Sports sold out its inventory by Thanksgiving.

Meanwhile brands that take the plunge are expected to tread carefully given the divided political climate the pandemic and both the Black Lives Matter and MeToo movements.

“Every client conversation I’ve had these days is about who is going to be offended by this ad” said Rob Schwartz chief executive officer of ad agency TBWA\Chiat\Day. “There’s a lot of discussion about risk mitigation. What that tends to do is that it makes things very bland and not effective or it forces you to look at universal topics like hope or humor.”

Oberlander agreed. “The country is so divided and split right down the middle that I don’t think that there’s a commercial that will appease both sides.”

He pointed to Gillette’s 2019 Super Bowl spot which riffed on its longtime slogan “The Best a Man Can Get” by asking the question: “Is this the best a man can get?” The ad showed boys bullying each other and men touching women’s shoulders during a business meeting.

It was meant to address toxic masculinity and the MeToo movement but instead ruffled feathers. Pepsi also suffered backlash in its nod to the Black Lives Matter movement with a 2017 Super Bowl ad starring Kendall Jenner which was criticized as trivializing.

Both the Gillette and Pepsi ads may have had important messages about being better but they proved “polarizing” Oberlander said noting that the stakes this year are even higher.

Humor is expected to play a big role because there’s almost always an appetite for laughter during sporting events.

“If the Super Bowl was this week or next we might have some people wondering if humor is the right thing but I think next month there’s the perspective that people will want to have some levity” said Tiffany Rolfe global creative creative officer of marketing and ad firm R/GA. Deeper more purpose-driven ads will also play a role this year she said.

Cheetos has already hinted that it plans to take this route with a silly teaser Super Bowl commercial it’s released starring actor Ashton Kutcher. The 30-second pseudo-thriller shows Kutcher flipping through a manila envelope while mysterious music plays before pulling out an empty Crunch Pop Mix bag. “I knew it” he says.

Brands that get serious this year will want to send a unifying message like Chrysler’s 2012 commercial starring Clint Eastwood about the resilience of the auto industry at a time when the US was still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis experts said.

“It’s halftime” Eastwood says in his trademark gravelly voice. “Both teams are in their locker room discussing what they can do to win this game in the second half. It’s halftime in America too. People are out of work and they’re hurting. And they’re all wondering what they’re going to do to make a comeback. And we’re all scared because this isn’t a game.”

Eastwood closes the spot with a moving pep talk: “How do we come from behind? How do we come together? And how do we win? This country can’t be knocked out with one punch. We get right back up again and when we do the world is going to hear the roar of our engines. Yeah it’s halftime America. And our second half is about to begin.”

Schwartz said a successful ad could feature a similar pep talk from a universally loved figure like Tom Hanks. “Clint Eastwood may be too polarizing” he quipped.

Oberlander surmised that “leadership brands” like Nike Apple or Google would be better positioned to weigh in on the mood of the country. Referencing Nike’s 2019 ad celebrating the Women’s National Soccer Team victory as a moment to celebrate the team’s win as a victory for “everyone” Oberlander said the brand could pull something similar off to address race.

The exec said he could imagine a spot that shows athletes of different races playing sports together and helping each other win in order to show that we “have more in common than we are different.”

David Lubars chairman and chief creative officer at ad agency BBDO the agency behind this year’s M&M’s ad said the stakes are always high when it comes to the Super Bowl because it’s the only time “people tune in on purpose to see the ads.”

In that sense he said this year likely won’t be different from any other.

“The Super Bowl is going to be like it was for the last 30 years meaning for the 75 brands advertising it’s going to be a big waste of money and for 10 it is going to be a bargain.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VudGlhbGx5c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uYXNjYXItbmV3cy13aG8tYXJlLWFsbC10aGUtc3BvbnNvcnMtZm9yLXRoZS0yMDIxLW5hc2Nhci1zZWFzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Are All the Sponsors for the 2021 NASCAR Season?,"FORT WORTH TEXAS – JUNE 07: Todd Gilliland driver of the #4 Mobil 1 Toyota leads the field at the start of the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series SpeedyCash.com 400 at Texas Motor Speedway on June 07 2019 in Fort Worth Texas.

No sport can truly survive without the need for sponsors. Even NASCAR falls under this blanket and has attracted several major sponsors. This also includes all three classes Cup Xfinity and Truck.

The main partners are Busch Beer Coca-Cola GEICO and Xfinity. As the name suggests Busch beer is the official beer sponsor while Coca-Cola is the official beverage for the fans. GEICO is regarded as the official insurance partner and Xfinity is the cable service provider.

There are also series partners like Xfinity and Camping World. These two brands lend their names to the Xfinity and Truck Series respectively.

The DILG recently issued Memorandum No. 2021-007 tasking LGUs to come up with a local vaccination plan that contains the preparation of risk communication plans and conduct of early vaccine communication campaign to disseminate critical information on Covid-19 vaccination.

The plan must also include a master list of priority eligible vaccinee population; identification of possible vaccine centers available cold chain storages and other logistical requirements; and a master list of existing human resources and personnel needed in the vaccination program among others.

“The Department is fully cognizant of the urgency for LGUs to prepare their vaccination plans against Covid-19 that’s why the road clearing timeline is extended anew. This is however the last extension to be granted by the DILG” DILG Undersecretary and spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said.

“We need to give LGUs time to focus on their local vaccination plans so we are giving them more time to undertake their road-clearing operations” he added.

He said the DILG’s validation of LGUs’ compliance has also been moved from January 18 to February 16 to Mar. 2 2021.

""The deadline of the submission of all consolidated validation reports from the DILG regional offices will be one week after the end of the validation period or on March 9 2021. We will not allow any modification in the report after submission"" he said.

To ensure close coordination on the submission of reports Malaya said DILG regional offices must designate one road clearing focal person whose names should be submitted to the DILG Central Office by Feb. 2 2021.

DILG Regional Offices (ROs) are also given until February 9 to submit to the DILG Central Office a directory of the members of all their validation teams (VTs) for each province city and a municipality within their region.

VTs are composed of one representative each from the DILG the Philippine National Police (PNP) Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) civil society organization (CSO) and the media.

In a recent memorandum prescribing the guidelines on the validation of LGU compliance with the road clearing DILG Officer-in-Charge (OIC) Undersecretary Bernardo Florece Jr. stressed the need to “cross-post” VTs to ensure the impartiality of the validation process.

This means that during the validation activities VTs must not be assigned in their original LGU of assignment or residence.

VTs for component cities and municipalities may be cross-posted within their respective provinces. VTs for provinces highly urbanized cities (HUCs) and independent component cities (ICCs) may be cross-posted within the region.

For LGUs under general community quarantine (GCQ) with a required partial implementation of road clearing VTs will select three to 10 local roads within the LGU and assess whether road obstructions exist along or within the entirety of the selected roads. The schedule of the assessment will be determined solely by the VT. The LGUs' compliance with the ban of tricycles on national highways shall also be checked.

Meanwhile LGUs under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) or post-quarantine scenario will be validated according to their full implementation of road clearing operations. The seven components include the removal of road obstructions enactment of an enabling ordinance the conduct of an inventory of road obstructions crafting and implementation of a displacement plan rehabilitation of cleared roads creation of a grievance mechanism and compliance with the ban on tricycles along national roads. The LGUs' compliance with the ban of tricycles on national highways shall also be checked.

“Inaasahan po ng DILG ang full cooperation ng LGUs para sa maayos na (The DILG expects the full cooperation of LGUs to have an orderly) validation process. Within the validation period LGUs shall submit reports detailing their compliance to the components of road clearing to the Validation Team. Strictly no report no score” Malaya said.

The DILG also enjoins LGUs to submit to the VTs as attachments to the reports photographs videos presentations reports and other means of verifications (MOVs) that support their compliance. (PR)",,,,,,

According to the information received CH Nagender who works as a lawyer bought 150 grams of Coalgate Max Toothpaste at Reliance Fresh Retail Mall of Sangam for Rs 92 on April 7 2019. In addition 20 grams of Coalgate Max toothpaste was bought for Rs 10.

The paste prices purchased by the lawyer were calculated. He found that if the paste was purchased at 20 grams 150 grams of paste was worth Rs 75. However Nagender was suspected to have taken 150 grams of paste for Rs 92. That is 17 rupees is charged more. After this Colgate sent a notice to the company to respond to why he took over Rs 17.

But he did not receive a response from Colgate. As a result the lawyer filed a petition in the Consumer Forum. Consumer Forum Chairman P Kasturi and member D Sridevi after hearing the petition ordered the Coalgate Company to repay Rs 17 for the extra amount seized from Nagender.



The mentally tortured consumer was ordered to pay 10000 rupees and an additional 5000 rupees for expenses. Apart from this an additional 50 thousand were ordered for the Consumer Forum Fund. This amount was ordered to be paid within a month.

If you buy three 50 gram packs .. it will be only Rs.60. But why charge Rs 92 per 150 gram pack?” he questioned and sent notices to the company.

But the company retaliated by defending the petition saying that it has the freedom as a manufacturer to fix the price for its products. However Nagender felt unjustified and approached the Consumer Forum in Sangareddy. The forum which heard the case sued an amount Rs.10000 for causing mental distress to the customer Rs.5000 for litigation costs and Rs 10000 for causing mental distress to a 67-year-old pensioner from Sangareddy.

The Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission observed that it shouldn’t charge different prices for the same product which is unlawful.

Some consumers may want it anyway.

Cord-cutting -- meaning canceling cable TV plans in favor of streaming TV over the internet -- is becoming an epidemic in the U.S.

According to the latest statistics from Statista.com by the end of last year 31.2 million Americans had already ""cut the cord"" up 27% from 2019. That number is expected to grow another 14% this year 11% in 2022 9% in 2023 and 8% in 2024 growing but decelerating as cable customers run out of cords to cut and the nation transitions slowly but surely to an ""everything over the internet"" model for TV viewing.

Of course cable providers such as Comcast (CMCSA) Verizon (VZ -0.05%) and AT&T may take some comfort in the knowledge that they also sell internet access. Even if cable subscriptions dwindle at least internet subscriptions should rise.

But will they? Because according to the latest data from a poll conducted by Reviews.org cable monopolies may face an even bigger threat than cord-cutting: SpaceX Starlink.

The news

As we've previously discussed SpaceX's new ""Starlink"" satellite broadband internet project is up and running rolling out beta access in the U.S. in October for $99 per month expanding into Canada in November and then winning an $885 million subsidy -- and 642925 new customers -- from the FCC in December.

Those lucky 642925 could soon have company. After surveying 500 internet subscribers aged 18 and over Reviews.org estimates that 64% of Americans would consider ditching their current internet service providers (such as the aforementioned Comcast Verizon or AT&T) and switching to Starlink. More than that 51% of Americans plan to switch to Starlink as soon as the service becomes available to them.

And it will be available to more people soon: Access to Starlink service is expanding with each launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 ""Starlink"" mission to orbit. The most recent batch of 60 Starlink satellites departed on Wednesday pushing the number of Starlink satellites in orbit past 1000. By the end of 2021 Starlink says it will be able to offer broadband access all around the world -- the rest of the U.S. included.

Caveats and provisos

Assuming internet users follow through on what they say they would do hypothetically and actually sign up for Starlink this could be bad news for incumbent internet service providers (ISPs). At the same time that their cable TV revenues are dwindling their internet broadband businesses might encounter a ""giant sucking sound"" coming from the direction of Starlink.

This would however be very propitious for investors hoping to get in on an eventual Starlink IPO which SpaceX says it has planned. (No date has been set yet.) But before you get too excited a few facts need to be highlighted.

First sample error. Reviews.com estimates that because of the small size of its survey there's a sample error of plus or minus 4.5%. Still the organization says it has ""a 95% level of confidence"" the data are correct. Worst case even if Reviews.org overestimated consumer desire for Starlink by 5% that still suggests incumbent ISPs could lose as much as 46% of their business to Starlink.

Second price. One curious bit of data in Reviews.org's report is that ""44% of survey respondents say they'd pay the $99/month price tag for Starlink internet if they were given an option to make payments on the $499 equipment fee"" (emphasis added). This caveat suggests that the stated ""51%"" interest in switching to Starlink isn't without caveats. Consumers are at least a little bit concerned about Starlink's price -- as they should be.

Finally speed and reliability. After all in its beta state some Starlink customers are getting as little as 50 mbps in speed for their $99 per month -- and must endure ""brief periods of no connectivity at all."" In remote rural markets that's probably still superior to what current terrestrial ISPs are offering. But for urban customers well Comcast charges as little as $50 for 200 mbps in metro locales -- half the price for four times the speed of Starlink. No matter how much consumers may hate their local cable monopolies after weighing the pros and cons they may well decide to stick with ""the devil they know"" -- especially given Starlink's $499 upfront equipment cost.

Granted as it builds out its satellite constellation Starlink says internet speeds will increase. Ultimately SpaceX hopes its satellite internet service will provide 1-gigabit speeds to customers. At that speed Starlink's $99 monthly price would be much more competitive with the $85 that Comcast charges for gigabit service.

At that point the writing could be on the wall for terrestrial ISPs and success would be all but assured for a Starlink IPO.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbGlnaHRuaW5nLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvbmJjLXNwb3J0cy1uZXR3b3JrLXRvLXNodXQtZG93bi1ieS1lbmQtb2YtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBC Sports Network to shut down by end of 2021,"NBC will shut down its cable NBC Sports Network by the end of this year NBC Sports chairman Pete Bevacqua wrote to employees in a memo Friday. NBCSN broadcasts the NHL and soccer’s English Premier League among other live sports.

Key programming from NBCSN will be moved to USA another NBC-owned cable network and the company’s new streaming service Peacock the memo said.

“This will make USA Network an extraordinarily powerful platform in the media marketplace and gives our sports programming a significant audience boost” Bevacqua wrote. “We believe that the power of this offering is the best long-term strategy for our Sports Group our partners and our Company.”

The move will bolster the offerings on Peacock which NBC launched last year as its parent company Comcast seeks to drive subscribers to the new service. Peacock this year already has 175 Premier League games.

“You can have NHL nights on USA more hockey on NBC and a streaming exclusive night on Peacock now” Pat Crakes a former Fox Sports executive turned industry consultant told the Washington Post. “That’s part of the evolution of media to leverage broadcast streaming and pay TV together.”

Bevacqua said in the memo that NHL playoff games and NASCAR races would be moving to USA this year. USA which is available in 85.6 million homes has been airing early round NHL playoff games since 2012.

NBCSN is available in 80.1 million homes according to Nielsen’s latest estimate which is less than ESPN (83.1 million) and FS1 (80.2 million).

NBCSN also televises the Tour de France and the Olympics which will be divided up and distributed among NBC platforms. NBCSN will continue operations through the summer and will air the Tokyo Olympics if they take place.

The news of NBCSN shutting down also comes during a time when many of NBC Sports Group’s most valuable sports properties are coming up for renewal. This is the last season of a 10-year deal with the NHL and negotiations for the Premier League rights beginning with the 2022-23 season are ongoing.

Many have predicted that the next rights deal with the NHL will include multiple networks with former broadcast partners ESPN and Fox Sports expected to be in the mix. NBC’s current deal averages $200 million per season.

Premier League deals are usually for three years but NBC secured a six-year package in 2015 by paying nearly $1 billion.

NASCAR which has its races from July through November on NBC and NBCSN has a deal through 2024.

IndyCar’s contract which includes the Indianapolis 500 on NBC expires at the end of this year. The sanctioning body said in a statement that NBC “has always been a transparent partner and we were aware of this upcoming strategy shift.”

NBCSN was launched by Comcast in 1995 as the Outdoor Life Network and most of its programming was hunting and fishing. It was best known for carrying the Tour de France until it acquired the NHL in 2005. It changed its name to Versus in 2006 and then to NBC Sports Network six years later after Comcast bought NBC Universal in 2011.

Entitled This Sceptred Isle and produced by Fremantle Richard Brown’s Passenger and Michael Winterbottom’s Revolution Films the five-part drama has also been picked up by Comcast‘s European broadcast giant Sky to be labeled a Sky Original series.

This Sceptred Isle will tell the tale of some of the most devastating events to ever befall the United Kingdom and of a Prime Minister leading in these unprecedented times. The drama will trace the impact on Britain from this once-in-a-generation pandemic and the response of scientists nurses and doctors as they worked tirelessly and heroically to contain and overcome the virus.

It is based on the first-hand testimony of people from all walks of life; from Number 10 Downing Street the Department of Health The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and from hospitals and care homes across the country.

Michael Winterbottom has co-written the series with Kieron Quirke and will direct all five episodes. He will also executive produce alongside Brown (Passenger). Melissa Parmenter (Revolution Films) will produce alongside Josh Hyams and Anthony Wilcox. Tim Shipman political editor of The Sunday Times is acting as a consultant on the series.

This Sceptred Isle is the first project to emerge from a multi-year first look deal for scripted drama series struck by Fremantle and Passenger with Revolution Films.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubmouY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvc291dGhqZXJzZXl0aW1lcy9uYW1lL2p1bGlhLWxpbGx5LXByaWNlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTgwODA2MDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Julia Lilly Price Obituary (1943 - 2021) - Jersey City NJ - South Jersey Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.nj.com/us/obituaries/southjerseytimes/name/julia-lilly-price-obituary?id=8080602 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubmouY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvc291dGhqZXJzZXl0aW1lcy9uYW1lL2p1bGlhLWxpbGx5LXByaWNlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTgwODA2MDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtd2FnZS1idXNpbmVzcy10YXgtY29yb25hdmlydXMtcmVtb3RlLXdvcmstMjAyMTAxMjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coronavirus points to trouble for Philadelphia tax revenue if suburbanites keep working from home,"Fran Coady.

With coronavirus vaccines on the way Day & Zimmerman is deciding which workers to bring back to the office as early as this summer.

Fran Coady head of human resources for the construction manufacturing and government services company is exploring which jobs can be done well remotely who wants to stay home and whether the Philadelphia firm can cut costs by shrinking office space.

Many of Day & Zimmerman’s 41000 workers — who make munitions maintain power plants and protect U.S. embassies around the world — can’t work remotely. But the company’s 450 office workers at its headquarters on Spring Garden Street are another story. Many of them could work from home permanently either part- or full-time Coady said. No decisions have been made yet.

“What we’ve concluded is that it should not be a one-size-fits-all” she said. “It’s a job-by-job decision.”

Decisions like these could reshape Philadelphia offices. But they could also leave fewer workers coming into the city every day eating into a tax base that relies heavily on taxing wages and business revenues. Three-quarters of Day & Zimmerman’s Philadelphia office workers live outside the city Coady said.

The economic impact of widespread remote work — and its long-term effect on city finances — remains unclear until companies reveal their post-pandemic plans. Previous attempts to overhaul the city’s tax structure have failed. But some hope the crisis will spark new urgency to retool tax policies that have long been criticized as hindering job creation.

Such an effort would likely spark debate about whether tax reform should make the city more attractive to companies by reducing wage and business taxes or look to businesses to help fund schools and social programs in the nation’s poorest big city.

Either way it’s almost certain that fewer people will return to city offices than left last year reducing weekday crowds in Center City and further disrupting struggling restaurants and retailers.

Philadelphia has already lost hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue since the coronavirus swept the country. Wage tax collections in the current fiscal year will be about $200 million less than initially projected. A portion of that loss could become permanent if companies keep employees home indefinitely. The city also imposes a levy on real estate occupied by companies another revenue stream that could be hard-hit if stores downsize or leave.

“We are going to see a much thinner downtown in terms of the businesses” said Subodha Kumar a marketing and supply-chain management professor at Temple’s Fox School of Business. “And that will have a huge impact on city taxes.”

The highest-in-the-nation wage tax currently 3.87% for residents and 3.5% for nonresidents who work in the city has been a central pillar of Philadelphia’s fiscal policy for more than 80 years. The levy first propped up the city’s budget in 1939 when it was ravaged by the Depression. But critics say the wage tax along with the business income and receipts tax (BIRT) lingers on as a job killer steadily driving businesses and workers from the city. By some estimates the wage tax has cost thousands of jobs. The pandemic has underscored Philadelphia’s fiscal vulnerabilities.

“Is this the right time to [restructure the tax code]? Yes” said Paul Levy president and CEO of the Center City District and a longtime advocate for cutting wage and business taxes. “Will Philadelphia seize the opportunity? There’s a question mark after that.”

There’s no strong movement or proposal to change the city’s tax structure at the moment. State laws limiting Philadelphia’s taxing flexibility create a barrier that doesn’t exist in other big cities and officials say it’s too soon to plan for the post-pandemic economy.

A big impact on city finances

The pandemic has hastened the digitization of the workplace. Earlier in the outbreak last year some experts estimated as much as half of American workers were telecommuting. According to a December survey by the global freelancing platform Upwork Inc. some 36.2 million Americans will work remotely by 2025 more than double pre-pandemic numbers.

A July survey of human resources officers — a majority from the region — found that more than half of firms planned to have at least 1 out of 4 staff members telecommuting even after the pandemic.

“As I see organizations start to formulate their move-forward workforce plan it’s a combination of in-office and remote work” said John Touey a principal at the executive search firm Salveson Stetson which conducted the survey.

Those decisions have serious implications in downtown economies like Center City where foot traffic in December was less than half the levels during the same month in 2019 according to the Center City District. Fewer commuters means fewer customers for lunch spots and shops. Some of those businesses already pivoted to online delivery to survive. Others closed their doors. The number of small businesses open in the city fell 29% last year according to Opportunity Insights a Harvard-based research group.

HipCityVeg a casual lunch and dinner spot with three locations in the city has boosted online ordering expanded its delivery boundaries and increased its digital presence owner Nicole Marquis said. But it’s more costly to reach customers now compared with the hundreds who simply walked by her storefronts. Overall sales are still down 10% at Philadelphia locations Marquis said.

“We pay very high rents to be in very dense office worker locations” she said. “And now those workers are not there.”

The shifts could leave a lasting impact on city finances. The wage tax accounts for 45% of Philadelphia’s annual revenue and is expected to decline by about $78 million this fiscal year — despite an increase in the nonresident rate. While it’s difficult to determine how much of that loss is due to furloughs and layoffs as opposed to remote work the city typically collects 40% of its roughly $1.5 billion in annual wage taxes from nonresidents.

Commuters pay other taxes too including sales and parking taxes as well as the sweetened-beverage tax that funds pre-K and a liquor-by-the-drink tax that goes directly to city schools. Businesses also pay a use-and-occupancy tax based on the assessed value of their buildings. But many stores will downsize their downtown footprints or move out completely once companies make final remote work plans said Kumar the Temple professor.

Some of the city’s largest employers are still grappling with how many workers will return to the office. Thomas Jefferson University with about 7000 employees telecommuting expects some staff will work full-time in the office while others will remain fully remote. A third group could work in “hybrid models” in which employees split time between the office and telecommuting a company spokesperson said.

“There’s a good chunk of our workforce that will probably work remote permanently” Clayton Mitchell Jefferson’s senior vice president for real estate and facilities said during a Center City District meeting last month.

Some companies aren’t expecting major changes once it’s safe to work in the office. Comcast expects most of its staff at its company-owned Center City skyscrapers to return. Independence Blue Cross which also owns its office building expects employees who worked in the city to come back.

Industry experts and academics said firms are mulling over a long list of factors such as saving cash on real estate costs the health and productivity of their workforce and the impact of more telecommuters on company culture.

An ‘anti-commuter’ tax

Philadelphia was slow to revise its tax structure during an earlier seismic shift from an industrial-based economy in the 1950s to a service-based one by the 1990s. The wage tax for example was a better fit when it was hard for factories to move. But professional service firms can ditch the city with ease.

City Hall has reduced wage and business taxes over time. The wage tax was at its highest rate of 4.96% for residents in the 1970s and ’80s before Mayor Ed Rendell began incremental reductions in 1996.

Some critics however say the changes haven’t gone far enough. They say the wage and business taxes help push companies into the suburbs where those levies are lower or nonexistent. About 41% of Philadelphia residents now work outside the city according to a 2020 Center City District report.

Robert Inman a Wharton business economics and public policy professor estimates that Philadelphia has lost 172889 jobs between 1971 and 2001 because of wage tax increases.

“What we’re doing now is moving from face-to-face service production to distance service production” Inman said. “Our fiscal policy has to be responsive to that technology change. We don’t know how big of an effect it is gonna be but the direction of the effect is clearly anti-commuter [wage] tax.”

Some of the city’s biggest employers have stopped withholding the 3.5% commuter wage tax from workers who live outside the city and have stopped coming downtown during the workweek.

That exemption remains in place only if employees are required to work from home. If companies allow employees to telecommute after pandemic restrictions are lifted workers must pay the wage tax regardless of whether they work from home or not. But if companies close Philadelphia offices or downsize and require workers to rotate in on assigned days nonresidents will not pay the wage tax when working remotely. Philadelphia residents pay the tax no matter where they work.

Philadelphia relies more heavily on wage taxes than other cities and is also the only large city that taxes both business income and gross receipts. That tax known as the business income and receipts tax (BIRT) has been gradually reduced since the mid-1990s like the wage tax. After the 2008 recession the city exempted the first $100000 in gross receipts — essentially excusing small businesses from BIRT.

Philadelphia convened tax reform commissions in 2003 and 2009 that yielded little change. The 2009 recommendations which focused on the need for job growth included deeper cuts to the wage tax than the reductions already being made.

Levy who as recently as March of last year unsuccessfully presented Mayor Jim Kenney with yet another plan to reduce wage and business taxes uses jobs data showing that Philadelphia lags behind other U.S. cities to make his case.

Between 2009 and 2018 the 25 largest U.S. cities saw a 19% average increase in jobs earning between $35000 and $100000 according to the Center City District. Philadelphia had just a 6% increase in these jobs during the same time frame.

No ‘easy plan’

Many officials remain resistant to changing wage and business taxes. Councilmember Helen Gym said businesses are drawn to Philadelphia because it’s the economic engine of the region and the largest city in the state. Taxes alone wouldn’t keep businesses from coming she said. Commuters and companies also rely on the city’s infrastructure and services so the city’s expenses should not rest solely on residents she said.

“Businesses gravitate toward economies and cities that are healthy overall and… taxes have a role to play but they’re not the single determinant of whether a business can thrive” Gym said.

City Council has focused on reducing poverty and slowing the rapid pace of gentrification in recent tax legislation. Since December 2019 lawmakers have reduced the value of a controversial 10-year real estate tax abatement designed to incentivize businesses and developers and passed a new 1% tax on construction to fund an ambitious antipoverty program.

Those changes championed by Council President Darrell L. Clarke show that Council would not be easily swayed on tax changes that benefit the business community — and may not want to focus on wage or business taxes.

”If you are going to talk about tax reform but you only want to talk about one of many taxes that we deal with as a city that’s not really tax reform” said Gym a leader of the progressive wing that holds growing sway in City Hall.

City Finance Director Rob Dubow said the Kenney administration is committed to gradual wage and BIRT reductions. The wage tax is at its lowest rate in decades he said and changes in the BIRT have helped businesses.

An additional roadblock is the so-called uniformity clause in the Pennsylvania Constitution. It requires all taxes to be applied at the same rate blocking changes such as varying the wage tax rate based on income.

Levy and Gerard Sweeney president and CEO of Brandywine Realty Trust spent years working to exempt the city’s property taxes from the uniformity clause allowing a higher tax rate for commercial parcels in exchange for lowering the BIRT and the wage tax. They argued it was a good solution that avoided burdening homeowners with the cost of reducing those taxes. But the proposal failed to win approval from the Republican-controlled state legislature and died quietly in 2018.

In place of rewriting its tax code Philadelphia has created incentives that benefit businesses such as the 10-year tax abatement over the years and a job-creation tax credit.

Levy and Sweeney presented Kenney with their most recent plan to reduce the wage and business taxes in early March. They suggested the city could simply view wage and business tax reductions as an expenditure and “buy down” their rates especially after 11 straight years of job growth and tax-base expansion Levy said.

Days later the coronavirus shutdown brought an abrupt end to that idea.

“I don’t have any easy plan at this point” Levy said.

City budget officials who track potential economic shifts due to the coronavirus said they are open to reexamining the tax structure. But they aren’t eager to act immediately — in part because there are still too many unknowns.

“I almost view it as trying to jump double Dutch jump rope — when do you hop in?” said Budget Director Marisa Waxman. “Right now we don’t know what our economy is going to look like so it’s hard to figure out what the optimal tax-design structure would be.”

Thousands of Indian farmers have been demanding the government repeal the laws for more than two months.

""The Indian government is stubborn"" said caravan organizer Amandeep Jhajj of Canton. ""With this we want to tell the Indian government the power is the democracy and in the people so they have to listen to the Indian people and the Indian farmers.""

Supporters from throughout the Midwest including Indiana Ohio and Illinois came to Detroit to join the rally.

The caravan started at Comerica Park overfilling two parking lots and shut down traffic as police escorted the cars down Woodward and Jefferson then finally ending on Belle Isle.

Donations were collected to send to farmers and protesters in India who have occupied major highways that connect the capital New Delhi with the country's north for weeks.

Indian Americans have also held protests and rallies in Canton and Troy in recent months to express unity with the Indian farmers.

The Washington Post reported several dozen farmers in India have died of heart attacks and illnesses as the protests stretch on. Four farmers have reportedly died by suicide The Post reported.

""The farmers' leaders they have more than 11 meetings with the Indian government but no results. So all of this going back and forth puts the lives of our extended families in India at risk. Their lives their future their livelihood depends on farming"" said Jhajj.

Farmers fear the Indian government will stop buying grain at minimum guaranteed prices under three laws that were passed in September and that corporations will then push prices down. The government said it is willing to pledge that guaranteed prices will continue.

The farmers say the laws will lead to the cartelization and commercialization of agriculture and make farmers vulnerable to corporations.

The farmers have threatened to hold a rally on Tuesday when India celebrates Republic Day if their demands are not met.

""I'm a daughter of farmers. I come from a long line of farmers from India even though I was born here in the United States"" said Michigan resident Shelly Sahi. ""One of the things I don't like about what is happening in India is the undemocratic way of bringing upon these laws that are essentially hurting the people that feed its nation.""

The situation escalated in November when tens of thousands of protesters marched to New Delhi where they clashed with police.

The new regulations compound tensions there with farmers long complaining of being ignored by the government in their demands for better crop prices additional loan waivers and irrigation systems to guarantee water during dry spells.

With nearly 60% of the Indian population depending on agriculture for their livelihoods the growing farmer rebellion has rattled Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration and allies.

""As long as the protest continues they will have the power to fight the government. The second these protests these peaceful protests are stopped the government will no longer care to make the proper changes necessary to help the farmers in India"" Sahi said.

He was 90.

His death was announced Sunday by the Maple Leafs who said he died of heart complications citing his family.

Armstrong had 296 goals and 417 assists over 21 seasons for the Leafs including 12 seasons as team captain and remains the franchise's leader in games played variously listed at 1187 or 1888. The right wing had 26 goals and 34 assists in 110 playoff games.

Known as the “Chief” Armstrong was one of the first players of Indigenous descent to play professional hockey.

He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1975. Some 41 years later Armstrong was voted No. 12 on the franchise’s list of 100 greatest Maple Leafs in its centennial season.

“George is part of the very fabric of the Toronto Maple Leaf organization and will be deeply missed” Maple Leafs president Brendan Shanahan said in a statement.

“A proud yet humble man he loved being a Maple Leaf but never sought the spotlight even though no player played more games for Toronto or captained the team longer. Always one to celebrate his teammates rather than himself George couldn’t even bring himself to deliver his speech the day he was immortalized on Legends Row.”

Armstrong would become one of a few Leafs honored with a banner at Scotiabank Arena and his number was retired in October 2016 at the team’s centennial anniversary home opener.

In 2015 Armstrong was added to the Leafs’ Legends Row. The team released a statement Sunday with the words from Armstrong’s unread speech that night.

“Hockey is a great game and I love it. I am part of a fading generation that you will never have again. Every one of us is one of a kind that will never be repeated. To all of my friends and acquaintances thank you for your advice and direction that helped make me who I am today ... a very very happy person.”

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman paid tribute Sunday to the former Leafs captain.

“The National Hockey League family is saddened to learn of the passing of George Armstrong” Bettman said in a statement. “For 70 years he represented his beloved Maple Leafs and the entire NHL with class and distinction as a player coach executive and ambassador.

“A humble man and revered leader Armstrong captained the Leafs for 12 seasons — including to three straight Stanley Cups in 1962 1963 and 1964 and the stunning 1967 title — and scored the final goal of the Original Six Era in Game 6 of the ’67 Final.

“Our game will miss him dearly.""

After retiring in 1971 Armstrong coached the Toronto Marlboros to Memorial Cup victories in 1972-73 and 1974-75 before accepting a scouting position with the Quebec Nordiques in 1978.

He spent nine years with Quebec before returning to Toronto as assistant general manager and scout in 1988. Armstrong served as interim coach for the final 47 games of the 1988-89 season after John Brophy was fired following an 11-20-2 start.

The next year Armstrong returned to his role as a scout for the Leafs.

Armstrong scored 20 goals four times during his career but was better known for his leadership and work ethic helping restore the franchise’s winning touch. A smart player and talented backchecker he worked the angles to get the best shot at his opponent and formed a formidable penalty-killing tandem with Hall of Famer Dave Keon.

Born in Bowland’s Bay Ontario to an Irish father and an Iroquois mother Armstrong honed his hockey skills near the nickel mines where his father worked.

It was during the Allan Cup tournament in 1950 specifically a visit to the Stoney Indian Reserve in Alberta that he got his nickname. When the band heard of Armstrong’s ancestral background they made him an honorary member with the name “Chief Shoot-the-Puck” and presented him with a ceremonial headdress.

It was a different era and “The Chief” nickname stuck. Armstrong who was proud of his mother’s heritage would become the first player of Indigenous descent to score in the NHL.

He spent most of two seasons in Pittsburgh with the Leafs’ American Hockey League farm team before making the big league. He made his NHL debut in December 1949 and became a full-time member of the Leafs in time for the start of the 1952-53 season.

Toronto owner and GM Conn Smythe named Armstrong his captain before the 1957-58 season. Smythe would later call Armstrong “the best captain as a captain the Leafs have ever had.”

The Leafs won the Stanley Cup in 1962 the first of three straight championships.

Armstrong was 36 when the veteran Leafs won the franchise’s most recent championship in 1967. His insurance empty-net goal with 47 seconds remaining in the clinching 3-1 Game 6 win was the final goal of the Original Six era.

The 6-foot-1 204-pounder played a few more seasons but suffered a knee injury during the 1969-70 season that forced him to retire. Armstrong was persuaded to come back for the 1970-71 season before quitting for good at age 40.

There are some objects in space that we kinda sorta know what they are but the details are still fuzzy. For example CK Vulpeculae is very obviously a bipolar nebula made of gas and dust in an hourglass shape. We also know it formed in late 1670 when a star in the constellation Vulpecula (the fox) underwent a tremendous outburst of energy going from invisibility to easy naked-eye viewing.

But... what is it? That is what specifically caused the star to suddenly grow immensely in brightness and expel these huge winds of gas outward at high speed?

I wrote about this object in 2018 when astronomers posited that it may have formed when a brown dwarf — an object more massive than a planet but less so than a star — got too close to a compact white dwarf and was torn apart by the smaller object's immense gravity. Other ideas have been proposed too generally involving two stars colliding one way or another.

All these hypotheses were predicated on the idea that the nebula was about 2000 light years away based on various measurements made of it.

However a new series of observations indicate the nebula is a wee bit farther away than that: A team of astronomers have shown that CK Vulpeculae is actually a little over 10000 light years away five times farther than thought!

That changes everything. It means the 1670 event was far more energetic than previously thought the gas is moving far faster and that the ideas of what caused the actual event can be tossed out a window.

The new observations were made using the monster Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. They took spectra in the infrared dissecting the light into vary narrow color bins which allows the gas velocity to be accurately measured. Earlier observations had done this as well but looked more toward the inner part of the nebula near the star where the gas isn't moving very rapidly; this time they looked at the very tips of the lobes (the short red arcs in the image) under the assumption that gas that got that far out is moving the fastest.

What they found is that the gas at those locations is moving away from the center at the staggering speed of over 2100 kilometers per second fast enough to cross the continental US in under three seconds.

They also compared the observations to ones taken about a decade ago and can see that the gas has visibly moved in the time since. The amount can be measured and coupled with the measured speed they can use that to get the distance to the nebula: 10400 light years five times farther than thought.

But if it's farther away that means the energy blasted away in the 1670 event must have been higher to get as bright as it did from the greater distance… in fact about 25 times more energetic (the brightness of an object goes as the square of the distance so 5 times farther away means 5 x 5 = 25 times as much energy). That's a lot. At its peak it was shining at a luminosity 7 million times brighter the Sun!

That tosses most stellar merger scenarios into the trash; they can't make that much energy. And in fact this puts it in a weird place. It's not nearly as much energy as a supernova when a star explodes but it's over 15 times more energy than released in a classical nova when material on the surface of a white dwarf accumulates and detonates in a thermonuclear flash. For lack of a better term it's called an intermediate luminosity optical transient or ILOT.

And it's not at all clear what can power such an event. It's possible maybe that a massive star right before the end of its life undergoes what's called a late thermal pulse a gargantuan flash of energy generated in its core by unstable nuclear fusion. The energy is similar to an ILOT and it could blow off the outer layers of the star creating a rapidly expanding nebula. But the details of such an event aren't well understood. Other ideas the team listed include big asteroids slamming into a white dwarf a massive blue star undergoing some sort of violent outburst or maybe a classical nova but a really peculiar one.

But they're more or less spitballing with those. Given the new observations no one knows what powered CK Vulpeculae.

Yay! A mystery! It's either something we haven't thought of yet or a really weird set of circumstances superpowering (or hugely underpowering) a known kind of event. Either way cool.

I expect this will prompt new observations to get to the heart of the matter. If there's some new type of explodey thing out there in space you can bet astronomers will track it down and figure it out. We love this kind of stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The track is located in Midland North Carolina southeast of Concord.

View photos of the Concord Speedway construction below.

The facility features a 1/2-mile tri-oval as well as a 1/4-mile oval. Both are asphalt short tracks.

Furr previously operated a dirt track which was sold. So he constructed a new 4/10-mile dirt track.

In the beginning it was a dirt track. At the tie no walls surrounded the speedway. The concrete barriers wasn’t added until 1984.

In 1986 Furr decided to pave the speedway. However it wasn’t until 1991 when the track was reconfigured adding a dogleg and making the three corner oval.

David Laton

Ahead of the 1997 season David Laton purchased the track. Late models became the headline weekly class. The NASCAR Southeast Series made it’s debut in 1997.

In 1999 Laton repaved the track replaced the barriers and fencing.

ASA headlined two events at the track in 2001 and 2003. Those races were won by Johnny Cauter and Davin Scites.

In 2012 weekly racing was brought to a halt on the half-mile. However the 1/4-mile track welcomed Legends machines on a weekly basis.

In 2013 many pot holes began to appear on the race track and in the pit area. Track crews scraped off a top layer of asphalt then repaved just in the lower groove.

In 2015 the national late model scene returned to the 1/2-mile track with the PASS and CARS Tour divisions. Additionally the North-South Shootout event returned an event with once brought super late model drivers from all over the country.

The CARS Tour did not return following a race in 2017. In 2018 the Minimizer Bandit Big Rig Series was the headline of the season along with the North-South Shootout.

Over the years the Big 10 was also staple event for the facility.

In 2019 Darren Hacket moved his North-South Shootout event away from Concord due to uncertainty around the facility. Soon after the racing season was abruptly cut short at the facility and the track declared season champions in July.

Marketing director Jennifer Campbell stated in July 2019 “I just wanted to say a quick thank you to all the competitors teams fans and coworkers that I have had the pleasure to get to know during my past ten years while working at Concord Speedway. My family and I are truly blessed to have gotten to know so many wonderful people through the years.

The track appeared on loopnet listed for $1.95 million. Later that year it was announced that David Laton had sold the facility.

CoPart USA is now the owner of the track. The company is based out of Dallas Texas and provides online vehicle auction and remarketing services to automotive resellers such as insurance rental car fleet and finance companies.

Now equipment has moved into the facility. The fencing has been removed and they’re beating away at the asphalt. Concord Speedway is officially dead.

Rodney Childers crew chief of the No. 4 for Kevin Harvick commented “Saw this picture yesterday of them tearing down Concord Speedway. So many memories there.

One of the best things about reality television is that sometimes it draws attention to previously little-known crafts or skills. Netflix has a tendency to create some of the best craftsmanship shows in everything from baking (Nailed It anyone?) to glassblowing. Enter: Blown Away a competitive glassblowing series in its second season. As the season comes to a close fans of the show are wondering: Who was the winner of Season 2?

Season 2 of 'Blown Away' was full of surprises at every turn.

The premise of the show is relatively easy to understand but it's the craftsmanship that truly makes it addictive. Viewers get to watch 10 of the best glass artists in North America compete for $64000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. The show itself is filmed in Canada but many of the guest judges are from the United States.

Blown Away is hosted by Nick Uhas a former Big Brother U.S. contestant and science YouTuber. Katherine Gray an artist and professor at California State University San Bernardino is the head judge with a new guest evaluator every episode to keep contestants on their toes. Guest judges for Season 1 included restaurant designers the president of Sheridan College and the National Ballet of Canada's principal dancer!

Season 2 left viewers in suspense but the final round came down to a face-off between contestants Cat Burns and Elliot Walker. The two artists had to fill half a gallery space with original designs created and blown in just eight hours. Both designers were able to choose a theme for their work.

Nick Uhas told Cat and Elliot that they were looking for a “cohesive original and immersive experience that will truly blow us away.” This left plenty of room for interpretation and boy did the competitors deliver! The guest judge for the finale was Rob Cassetti who is the senior director of creative strategy at the Corning Museum of Glass.

And the winner is .... Elliot Walker! His final design was created based on the idea of inept tools. He created oversized screwdrivers and hammers which resembled balloons. Feeling daunted by the task at hand Elliot’s installation idea came from his own feelings of “not having the tools” to complete the task. Its title was “Bodge Job.”

Samsung launched the Galaxy S6 at their UNPACKED event at MWC in Barcelona and the world was able to check out one of the most anticipated Android Smartphone of 2015.

The Galaxy S6 is unlike previous Galaxy Sx models in the sense that it comes at one of the toughest periods for the South Korean based Tech Giant.

Samsung has already lost much of its market share to its competitors and the company is at a point where it needs not only impress but also intimidate its rivals.

A lot had already been said about why Samsung had to get it right with the Galaxy S6. With their flagship device now here with us it’s now up to the opinion makers as well as you as the consumer to decide if indeed Samsung got it right.

Here is a specification overview of just what the Samsung Galaxy S6 has to offer.

Samsung Galaxy S6 Technical Specifications

Display

Display Size: 5.1 inches

Display Type: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen

Screen Resolution: 1440 x 2560 pixels

Screen Resolution Density: 577 ppi

Screen Protection: Corning Gorilla Glass 4

An amazing 2K display is what you will get on the Samsung Galaxy S6. This is similar to what you find on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.

A 1440 x 2560 pixels resolution is pretty much the ceiling for high-end Smartphones this after the feature debuted on the LG G3. The display is a Super AMOLED one and thus you can expect some extreme color vibrancy as well as awesome outdoor visibility.

Other than that the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 which is the most recent version of the famous protection coats the display to keep scratches at bay.

Design

Frame Dimensions: 143.3 x 70.8 x 6.9 mm

Weight: 138 g

Samsung made it clear that the Galaxy S6 will be designed from scratch and it will be of premium quality. Well the company kept their word on that making the Galaxy S6 arguably the most beautiful handset the Android OEM has ever launched.

The plastic is now out and in its place is metal and glass. The Galaxy S6 now has a unibody design that is about 1.5mm thinner than that of its predecessor the Galaxy S5.

The price to pay for this exquisite design is that the Galaxy S6 is the first Samsung flagship handset to lack a removable battery and the phone lacks a Micro-SD slot due to its unibody chassis.

Performance

Operating System: Android OS v5.0 (Lollipop)

CPU: Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57

RAM: 3 GB

Internal Memory: 32/64/128 GB

Micro SD: None

Everything about the technical profile of the Samsung Galaxy S6 looks juicy.

The Galaxy S6 has one of the powerful CPUs on a Smartphone right now and it will run Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. The 3 GB RAM is also great and is an upgrade of the 2 GB RAM found on the Galaxy S5.

The Samsung Galaxy S6 will not have a 16 GB variant as the internal memory option now starts from 32 GB to 128 GB. The obvious reason for that the Samsung Galaxy S6 lacks a Micro SD slot and thus you have to do with just the internal memory.

32 GB is quite adequate for the average user but is simply just not enough for those into High Definition content. Such users will therefore have to go for the slightly expensive variants with a larger storage space.

The lack of an expansion slot of the Samsung Galaxy S6 could be a deal breaker for some but hey the iPhone has never had a Micro-SD slot but millions still purchase the device.

The lack of a Micro-SD can be attributed to two reasons. It is partly due to the Galaxy S6 unibody design that got rid of the removable rear cover. It however has more to do with the performance of the device.

External Memory has the nasty tendency to slow down the performance of a device and according to Samsung it just had to go.

Camera

Rear Camera: 16 MP

Secondary Camera: 5 MP

LED Flash: Yes

The Samsung Galaxy S6 has a 16 MP Rear Camera and a 5 MP selfie snapper. Previous Galaxy S6 leaks had pointed to a massive 20.1 MP primary camera but that just turned out to be hot air.

Nothing much can be said about this camera as the phone is yet to be ‘deployed’ in the real world.

Battery and Extras

Battery Capacity: 2550 mAh

The Samsung Galaxy S6 features a Li-Ion 2550 mAh battery. This is about a 300 mAh downgrade from the battery found on the Galaxy S5.

This is very much interesting considering that the battery now powers a 2K display while the bigger capacity battery powered just a 1080p display.

Smartphone designers often have to forgo a lot to achieve a svelte profile as the one of the Galaxy S6. A smaller battery capacity could be another price to pay for the fine design.

Verdict

The Galaxy S6 is one of the most important devices for Samsung at the moment. 2014 wasn’t the best year for Samsung as the company faced some stiff competition in most of its key markets that include China and India.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus performed extremely well so well that Apple currently has the best quarterly revenue ever posted by a company.

It is rather clear that Samsung’s grip on the premium smartphone market was gradually becoming weaker. The inclusion of a premium design concept is reason enough that Samsung was active on enticing more high-end buyers.

The revenue of a smartphone vendor is less influenced by its volume of sales but rather by the Average Selling Price of its devices. With an awesome design Samsung hopefully will able to finally demand a premium price for its flagship.

The 2014 Samsung flagship device has aroused interest that is characteristics of all past Samsung high end devices. The S5 comes with some of the most sophisticated features that you will find on a device.

Here is a quick specs tour of the Samsung Galaxy S5 and its price in Kenya.

Design

Dimensions: 142 x 72.5 x 8.1 mm

Weight: 145 g

The Samsung Galaxy S5 looks pretty much like the Samsung Galaxy S4. We are talking about the rounded corners and the physical key placements. The Galaxy S5 assumes the generic Smartphone handset design concept.

It’s an all plastic affair with the Galaxy S5. There were rumors of a metal and glass Samsung Galaxy S5 and they were exactly that rumors. Nevertheless the device has a solid construction and we have to acknowledge the attempt by Samsung to make the rear cover look and feel like leather.

Display

Screen Size: 5.1 inches

Screen Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels

Screen Resolution Density: 432 ppi



Screen Protection: Corning Gorilla Glass 3

The Galaxy S5 display is just 0.1 Inches larger than that of the Samsung Galaxy S4. Interestingly the Galaxy S5 has a resolution density that is about 9 units less than that of the Galaxy S4.

Related: The Samsung Galaxy S5 has the best Smartphone Display on the Planet

It isn’t much of a significant drop but I had expected the S5 to beat the 469 ppi found on the HTC One. A 1080p Full HD Display gives you an awesome viewing experience.

A 1080 x 1920 pixels screen resolution is more of a ceiling for most high end Smartphones. It will therefore be interesting to see which device will be the first to make the leap to a 4K resolution.

Hardware

CPU: Quad-core 2.5 GHz Krait 400

RAM: 2 GB

GPU: Adreno 330

Operating System: Android OS v4.4.2 (KitKat)

There is a slight increase in the clock speed of the Samsung Galaxy S5. You should therefore expect a slight bump in the performance of the Samsung Galaxy S5.

Memory

Internal Memory: 16/32 storage

Card Slot: Yes up to 128 GB

Unlike the Samsung Galaxy S4 the Galaxy S5 will only be available in 16 and 32 GB variants. You can however use a MicroSD of up to 128GB whilst the S4 can only handle a 32 GB MicroSD card.

Also something that is worthwhile to mention is the USB 3.0 port found on the Galaxy S5. The features first appeared on the Galaxy Note 3 but has now shifted to the S5. With a 3.0 Speed you can achieve some crazy speeds while transferring data from a USB 3.0 port.

Camera

Rear Camera: 16 MP

Front Facing Camera: 2 MP

LED: Yes

The Samsung Galaxy S5 snapper was one of the highlight features during its launch. The S5 camera now has some nifty features that deliver stunning image clarity. An awesome image clarity will get those sweet double taps on Instagram.

Battery Life

A Lousy battery life could ruin an otherwise stunning device. Samsung took this into consideration an included some extra battery saving feature. The Samsung Galaxy S5 can go to up 24 hours while on less than 10% battery juice remaining.

The latest case in point is The Standard in West Hollywood California which closed Friday after its operators said they were unable to absorb rising rent costs in the face of an unprecedented plunge in travel during the past year.

“Despite 22 years of unconditional love for our hotel our guests our team and our community the hotel was unable to prevent a significant increase to its lease which makes operating the property impossible"" said operators of what had come to be known as a major celebrity magnet at 8300 W. Sunset Blvd. on the iconic Sunset Strip in an Instagram post the day before the shutdown.

Representatives of New York-based operator Standard International Management and the hotel’s landlord Spain-based real estate investment firm Ferrado Group did not immediately respond to CoStar News’ requests for comment.

A Standard International representative told the Los Angeles Times that Ferrado Group exercised an option to raise the lease price on the West Hollywood location in 2019. Under current conditions the rent increase “rendered it unsustainable to operate the hotel” although the hotel operator did try to renegotiate the lease the Standard representative told the newspaper.

The Standard retains its other existing local property on Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles which remains temporarily closed during the pandemic. The West Hollywood location opened in 1999 was the first of what became six openings under the boutique Standard brand known for its trademark upside-down banner which expanded to other cities including New York City London and Miami.

The brand was started by prominent developer and hotelier Andre Balazs who sold his interests in The Standard operations in 2017.

The West Hollywood hotel was unable to stave off the impacts of the current travel economy despite a history that included frequent stops by young movie and music stars among other notables who filled its dining and entertainment spots such as Leonardo DiCaprio Jennifer Lopez Lenny Kravitz and Uma Thurman.

The 139-room hotel’s pre-closing Instagram post touted a place “alive with personality & personalities and the backdrop of countless legendary tales.” The setting included hip design elements live music performances at its Desert Nights nightclub and other on-site venues and its pool area lined with blue Astroturf.

Uncertain Future

The Standard is hardly the only high-end property in the Los Angeles area with Hollywood connections to undergo significant real estate-related transitions in the midst of the pandemic which has wreaked havoc on all types of hotels as both leisure and business travel have plummeted at historic rates.

Data from travel research firm STR a CoStar Group company shows that West Hollywood hotels in 2020 experienced a 48% drop in occupancy from the prior year falling to 41.2% as average room prices declined 14.4% and revenue per available room dropped 55.4%

A plunge in both business and leisure travel caused downtown Los Angeles hotels to experience a similar 48.6% drop in occupancy falling to 40.6% in 2020 as room rates declined nearly 22% and revenue per available room fell nearly 60%.

Partly in response to the pandemic market hotelier Balasz last summer announced plans to convert his nearly century-old Chateau Marmont another iconic celebrity haunt off the Sunset Strip into a “private members-owned hotel” that would be operated similar to a club with fee-paying members and potentially some with ownership stakes.

Numerous other owners nationwide are now mulling alternative business models as the coronavirus pandemic takes a serious financial toll on travel and tourism especially high-end vacations at luxury hotels.

Jan Freitag CoStar Group’s national director of hospitality market analytics noted that the second half of 2021 could look very different from the first half for U.S. hotels depending on factors including pending vaccinations and improving economic metrics that could put consumers back in the mood to travel again.

The second half could be something akin to a ""Roaring ’20s” effect if pent-up demand leads people to get back to places like high-end hotels with lively social venues. For now the only U.S. hotels doing relatively well include roadside limited-service properties serving travelers who are still keeping their social circles tight while avoiding air travel.

In general glitzy nightlife-focused places such as The Standard may need to wait their turn for something resembling full recovery.

“Those properties that depend on a lot of good-looking people gathering in close quarters could be struggling for a while” Freitag said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jYmouY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbG9jYWwtYnV5ZXItc2NvcmVzLXR1c3Rpbi1hcGFydG1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local Buyer Scores Tustin Apartments,"A local investment group headed by a former NFL player has acquired the 80-unit Woodside Garden Apartments in Tustin for $26 million.

Irvine-based Strattford Capital LLC paid $325000 per unit for the apartment project from another local investor: Newport Beach-based Yacoel Properties records indicate.

The apartment deal is the second largest by price to take place in Tustin over the past year trailing the $41 million sale of Terra at Tustin a 116-unit gated community that traded last March.

That deal works out to about $353000 per unit.

Strattford Capital

The Woodside Garden complex at 1071 Walnut Ave. was built in 1970. The 10-building property totaling 62640 square feet includes one- and two-bedroom units at 790 and 980 square feet. It’s near the intersection of Walnut and Newport Avenue.

The new owner is a small private real estate investor founded by Evan Moore in 2013.

Moore a grad of Brea Olinda High School and Stanford played in the NFL through 2013.

Strattford has a local portfolio of nearly 300 units according to CoStar Group Inc. records. Other local assets are in Costa Mesa Garden Grove Anaheim Brea and Huntington Beach.

Its newest buy in Tustin is also its largest reported local acquisition to date records show.

Top Deals

The recent sale adds to a string of large area apartment deals taking place near the end of 2020.

All but one of the county’s top apartment deals in 2020 took place within the last four months of the year.

The top multifamily deal in 2020 occurred in December when Trammel Crow’s 220-unit CTR City apartments in Anaheim sold to an affordable housing provider for $110 million; see next week’s print edition for more.

It’s just shy of the priciest 2019 multifamily deal: the $113.5 million sale of Costa Mesa’s Baker Block apartment complex.

The Anaheim complex is tops on a per-unit basis however trading at $500000 per unit. That’s higher than the $473000 per unit seen for Baker Block.",,,,,,,,,

The video which has garnered millions of views was posted by TikTok user @floridamomof3 and compares a new line of nuggets from the Just Bare brand with Chick-fil-A's version. It features a mother-daughter duo who can't believe their taste buds upon trying the Costco-purchased nuggets dipped in Chick-fil-A's original sauce (now sold at retail).6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Grocery Shortages To Expect in 2021 According to Experts

After warming the frozen nuggets in the oven the duo conducts an on-camera taste-test and the daughter exclaims ""You wouldn't even know the difference"" while her mother adds ""It tastes just like Chick-fil-A.""

Although ostensibly created as an innocent taste test the video does seem almost as a staged marketing ploy with the two regularly repeating the name ""Chick-fil-A"" while eating the copycat nuggets. In fact they mention Chick-fil-A a total of nine times during the brief video. They also mention the stores Publix and Costco by name and say the Just Bare brand name twice.

According to The Chickenwire Chick-fil-A's own publication the company's nuggets are among their most popular menu item rated the third most popular menu item in a survey from late 2018. It's not surprising then that any store-bought nugget brand would benefit from the association.

And this frozen option at Costco is a delicious yet cheaper way to enjoy fast-food nuggets at home. A bag of the Just Bare Lightly Breaded Chicken Breast Chunks packs 4 pounds of chicken and retails for $17.49 via Instacart. That means you are paying around 27 cents per ounce of chicken. On the other hand an eight-count order of Chick-fil-A nuggets weighs 4 ounces according to Fat Secret and costs $3.85 which is just over 48 cents per ounce.

(Hi sourdough bread!) Add in the cold weather Valentine’s Day quickly approaching and our favorite celebrity chefs dropping new recipes left and right (we’re still not over Martha Stewart’s 5-Ingredient Truffles) and we’re pretty much cooking up a storm. But we’ll be the first to admit that we’re not always in the mood to whip up something from scratch and when that mood hits we head to Costco’s bakery section which never disappoints. Lately the retailer has been dropping some incredible new goodies from decadent fudge brownies to strawberry-filled brioche and their latest addition is another one we can’t wait to try: Raspberry Lemon Muffins.

Whoa calling all muffin lovers! Costco fan account @costcohotfinds shared the find writing “🍋 Have you spotted the new Raspberry Lemon Muffins?!! They’re part of the Mix & Match Muffins! You pick two of the 6 packs for $7.99 🥰 Costco Bakery makes the best muffins!”

Costco’s muffins are always a fan-favorite and for good reason — they’re gigantic moist and the perfect easy but indulgent breakfast or snack. This new berry-citrus variety is now tops on our shopping list but thanks to a new deal the warehouse giant is having you can get two boxes of muffins for just $7.99 and you can mix-and-match flavors — which is good because we’re going to have a hard time choosing.

Not a Costco member? What are you waiting for?! We wouldn’t be surprised if they sell out quickly and with a deal as good as this — do you really want to wait to grab them?

(No? Good.) Toys games craft supplies and the like seem to magically multiply and spring from their homes overnight and the messy problem has only gotten worse with remote learning and kids spending the whole day cooped up in the house. Is that a Baby Yoda animatronic in the bathroom? A brand new Nintendo Switch stuffed in between the couch cushions? You’d think that there’d only be so many random places your kid would leave their toys — but you’d be wrong. While bins buckets and other organizers aren’t exactly the magical tool we’d like them to be they do make it easier to simply drop your kid’s toys in and go about your day. And Costco is selling some storage boxes that are perfect for toy organizing and will make the cutest addition to your little one’s room.

Costco fan account @costcodeals posted the adorable find in-store writing “How cute are these @3_sprouts 2 pack storage boxes?!! Only $17.99!” OK these are seriously sweet! The cloth storage bins each feature an adorable critter — raccoon fox hedgehog cat — and are great for being stuffed with books toys and so much more. Plus we love that these organizers are gender neutral cute without being too cutesy and an easy way to give any child’s room a dash of personality.

This two-pack of storage bins from 3 Sprouts is a great deal and (as most things from Costco are) it’s a less expensive option than you’re likely to find at other retailers. If you’re not a Costco member however you can also find similar 3 Sprouts bins on Amazon.

UPDATE: We’ve been told this will not happen Monday but no further information has been provided to Escambia County by CSX.

Railroad crossings on Quintette and South Chipper roads will be closed for several days next week.

So far Escambia County officials have not been told by CSX exactly which days the crossings will be closed during the week of January 25. NorthEscambia.com will let you know the details as soon as CSX passes along the information.

The South Chipper Road closure will impact just a few residents but the Quintette Road closure will impact a large number of people in both Escambia and Santa Road counties. The closest detour route is using Highway 90 across the Escambia River about 30 miles from one side of the crossing to the other. Detouring across the river on the Highway 4 bridge through Century is some 60 miles.

CSX is conducting a crosstie replacement and each crossing will be closed from two to three days.

During the week of February 1 the railroad crossings on Pauline Drive and Chemstrand Road will be closed along with three private crossings.

“I heard it doink and I saw the entire Oak Park sideline start celebrating so I thought I missed” the sophomore said.

But that wasn’t the end of the story.

“Then everyone else on our sideline was celebrating and I heard them say it was good” Cummins recalled. “It was a surreal moment.”

Cummins’ kick from 22 yards out hit the right upright and caromed to the left over the crossbar and between the uprights Saturday.

The officials at St. John Baptist De La Salle Field raised their arms to signal “Good” and De La Salle pulled into a 20-20 tie with 1:23 left in the fourth quarter of a state Division 2 semifinal game.

A few intense minutes later the Pilots scored a touchdown in overtime to defeat Oak Park 26-20 and everyone who saw the first varsity football game played at De La Salle’s new facility knew that without Cummins’ kick the Warren team would be looking ahead to 2021 rather than Friday’s state championship game at Ford Field.

“It’s what’s expected here” Cummins said after the Pilots secured the victory. “We had to get the job done.”

The field goal gave Cummins four points in the game. He kicked an extra point after the Pilots’ second touchdown on the cold afternoon giving the Catholic League team a 17-6 lead with 8:44 left in the third quarter.

It turned out that coach Dan Rohn’s team needed every point it could muster in four quarters.

Oak Park whose only victory during the regular season came via forfeit validated Rohn’s fears of the Knights’ big-play ability.

The Oakland Activities Association team scored on a punt return used a 40-yard pass to set up another TD and a 35-yard interception return to set up a third while rallying to a 20-17 lead with less than seven minutes left in the fourth quarter.

But the Pilots met the Knights’ challenge.

Brett Stanley ran 21 yards with the kickoff that ensued after Oak Park took the lead.

On third and eight from the 38 quarterback Brady Drogosh passed 20 yards to fellow sophomore Triston Nichols to keep the drive going and then Stanley carried on eight consecutive plays as the Pilots got to the Knights’ five to set up Cummins’ kick.

“Our kids did an amazing job of staying focused and grinding it out” Rohn said.

Cummins has shared kicking duties throughout the season but a teammate’s injury made the job all his against Oak Park.

“Cody did a great job” Rohn said. “He put the ball through the uprights.

“We wanted to get seven points there but we settled for the tie and played overtime.”

Cummins was asked if the field goal was the biggest kick of his career.

“Probably” he said “to this point.”

Cummins obviously knew the Pilots had an even bigger game in the future the contest at 1 p.m. Friday against defending state champion Muskegon Mona Shores.

“We’re not done” Cummins said.

Perhaps he isn’t either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvaXQtd291bGQtYmUtYS1ibGVzc2luZy1pZi1pLWV2ZXItb3Blbi1iYXR0aW5nLWluLXRlc3RzLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tc3VuZGFyLTcxNTk4NTAv0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pdC13b3VsZC1iZS1hLWJsZXNzaW5nLWlmLWktZXZlci1vcGVuLWJhdHRpbmctaW4tdGVzdHMtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1zdW5kYXItNzE1OTg1MC9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It would be a blessing if I ever open batting in Tests: Washington Sundar,"Coach Ravi Shastri’s dressing room stories of grit and determination work as a tonic for young Washington Sundar who is ready for any challenge even if it means opening the batting for India in Test matches.

The 21-year-old Washington was a specialist top-order batsman during his India U-19 days but then honed his off-spin to such an extent that he is now an automatic choice in India’s T20 team.

One of the heroes of India’s epic triumph in Brisbane which gave them the four-match Test series against Australia Washington spoke about the head coach’s influence on him.

“I think it will be a blessing for me if I ever get an opportunity to open the batting for India in Tests. I think I will accept the challenge just like our coach Ravi sir did during his playing days” Washington told PTI during an interaction from his Chennai residence.

He scored 62 in the first innings at Gabba to keep India in the match and then a quick 22 including a hooked six off Pat Cummins to play a part in the finishing act apart from a match-haul of four wickets.

“Ravi sir tells us very inspiring stories from his playing days. Like how he made his debut as a specialist spinner got four wickets and batted at number 10 against New Zealand on debut.

“And how from there he became a Test opener and played all those great fast bowlers. I would love to open batting in Tests like him” said Washington who enjoys a decent first-class batting average of 32 plus which can only improve from hereon as he gets to play more games for India.

For a youngster coming into the Test side he feels that there is no need to draw any inspiration from outside as there are so many role models in that India dressing room.

“As a youngster when I look up for inspiration and motivation I find so many role models in that dressing room. There is Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma Ajinkya Rahane R Ashwin who have been such great performers.

“You look up to these players and they are always ready to guide you” said the tall off-spinner.

Washington was asked to stay back in Australia after the white ball series as a net bowler in order to help the Test team prepare and it meant that he was bowing a lot at the nets with the red kookaburra.

“It certainly helped my overall game as I was asked to stay back for Test matches. But it was the planning by our coaches including bowling coach Bharath Arun sir that really helped” said the man who has also played two T20 Internationals and an ODI for India.

So what exactly was the planning that helped him?

“Since the Australian pitches have a lot more pace and bounce I had to impart a lot of overspin on my deliveries. In Australia you can’t be slow through the air and the main strategy was to bowl up and over. That gets you more pace off the wicket and that’s what I concentrated on.

“Obviously on the first day in Brisbane the pitch wasn’t doing a lot for spinners but it was like a dream come true to get Steve Smith as my first Test wicket” he said.

During the epic final day chase Washington said that once the equation came down to around 50 runs in 10 overs he was confident that he and Rishabh Pant could pull it off.

“I knew that with Pant on the other side the bowlers will be very much under pressure. If we could quickly get 25 or 30 then we can pull off the target. In the first innings Shardul batted really well during our partnership.”

A few days at home with family before entering the Chennai bio-bubble is helping Washington rejuvenate and also enjoy the delicious chicken biryani cooked by his mother.

His elder sister Shailaja is also a professional cricketer and the siblings do share and exchange notes even though that’s a rarity according to the soft-spoken man.

“If she (Shailaja) finds something that needs to be pointed out she does that. Her suggestions have always been valuable.

“But more often than not we don’t discuss cricket at home. We both are involved with the game so much that when we are back home there’s plenty of other subjects that we discuss and not really cricket” he signed off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpdGF2YWRhLmNvbS9FbmN5Yy8yMDIxLzEvMjMvU3R1ZGVudHMtb2YtQ3VtbWlucy1Db2xsZWdlLW9mLUVuZ2ctZm9yLVdvbWVuLWRldmVsb3AtYXBwcy1kdXJpbmctbG9ja2Rvd24uYW1wLmh0bWzSAX9odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaXRhdmFkYS5jb20vRW5jeWMvMjAyMS8xLzIzL1N0dWRlbnRzLW9mLUN1bW1pbnMtQ29sbGVnZS1vZi1FbmdnLWZvci1Xb21lbi1kZXZlbG9wLWFwcHMtZHVyaW5nLWxvY2tkb3duLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Students of Cummins College of Engg for Women develop apps during lockdown,"Students of Cummins College of Engg for Women develop apps during lockdown

He had a very good summer and had Australia won the Border-Gavaskar trophy his award for player of the series would most likely be warranted. Even if the series had been drawn he would have been a reasonable choice.

But Australia did not win the series.

Pat Cummins was the leader of the attack that failed to dismiss the Indian side twice in two Tests on day five pitches with big leads.

I’m not blaming Pat Cummins. But if he had been able to make just a couple more breakthroughs on one of those day five wickets and turn the match then that would have constituted a great individual series.

He showed he is capable of such feats on the morning of Day 3 in Adelaide when he almost single-handedly won the game for Australia. Cummins took 7-69 in that first match. In the remaining three games he took 14 wickets for 352 runs at 25.14.

Now 21 wickets in a four-Test series is nothing to sneeze at but someone has to collect the scalps and as the series wore on it became less and less likely that Mitchell Starc or Nathan Lyon would pick up wickets.

Cummins’ performance was brave in a beaten side but not series defining. What may have been series defining was the amount of overs he was asked to bowl 162 overs in a four-Test series played back to back to back to back. This workload seriously blunted his strike power. Cummins was a man of steel yes but man of the series no.

When a player from a losing side wins an award like man of the series or a Clive Churchill Medal or a Norm Smith Medal it usually leaves a sour taste for the majority of fans. It also feels quite empty to the recipient. It’s like an albatross around their neck and they often receive the award to a chorus of boos meant for the judges but felt by the recipient.

Yet too often the people who judge these awards are forced to choose the recipient well before the final and decisive act. Or maybe they just don’t get it. There should be an unwritten rule that the best player award should go to a member of the victorious squad and therefore not chosen until the conclusion of a contest.

After the exhilarating finish to the series when India come from the clouds to defeat Australia I tuned in to the presentation ceremony and pondered who would win the player of the series award.

A strong case could be made for Rishabh Pant with his tally of 274 runs at 68.5. His batting exploits helped save a match in Sydney and then win the series in Brisbane. Not to mention his ability to unsettle some Australian batsmen without even saying a word to them.

It could have gone to Shubman Gill for his stunning debut series as opener. After being selected to open in the second Test at the MCG he scored 259 runs at an average of 51.8 with a strike rate of 60.65 runs per hundred balls. He made important contributions of 45 35 not out 50 31 and a scored a vital 91 on the last day of the series to set the stage for India’s successful run chase. His consistency at the top of the order set a platform for India on all but one occasion preventing any further top order collapses after their capitulation in Adelaide.

You could even give it to the Wall Cheteshawar Pujara whose series-high 928 deliveries faced was possibly the most telling factor in blunting the vaunted Australian attack.

The old school Test match grinding innings should never be underestimated. Of course he couldn’t win the award with an average of only 33.87 but his concentration and commitment to his team’s cause may well have had the greatest influence of any player in this series.

I guess you would be hard pressed to make a case for any of the Indian bowlers. None of them lasted the full series and the wickets were shared among them.

Ravendra Jadeja topped their averages with seven wickets at 15 in two matches. Second Test debutant and fourth Test hero Mohammed Siraj topped their tally with 13 wickets at 29.53 in three matches.

Ravichandran Ashwin took 12 Jasprit Bumrah took 11 Umesh Yadav took four and three of their net bowlers – Navdeep Saini Washington Sundar and T Natarajan – chipped in together for another 11 vital wickets. Hats off to the Indian bowling unit for manufacturing so many wickets under such difficult circumstances.

The player of the series award should have gone to Rishabh Pant. His fourth innings scores of 97 and 89 not out in Sydney and Brisbane defined those matches and decided the series.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2lwbC0yMDIxLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLXNldC10by1lYXJuLW1vcmUtc2FsYXJ5LXRoYW4tbXMtZGhvbmktcm9oaXQtc2hhcm1hLWFzLWtrci1wYWNlci1nZXRzLXJldGFpbmVkLWFoZWFkLW9mLWlwbC0xNC1taW5pLWF1Y3Rpb24tNDM1Mjk2OS_SAakBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWEuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9pcGwtMjAyMS1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1zZXQtdG8tZWFybi1tb3JlLXNhbGFyeS10aGFuLW1zLWRob25pLXJvaGl0LXNoYXJtYS1hcy1ra3ItcGFjZXItZ2V0cy1yZXRhaW5lZC1haGVhZC1vZi1pcGwtMTQtbWluaS1hdWN0aW9uLTQzNTI5NjkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IPL 2021: Pat Cummins Set to Earn More Money Than MS Dhoni Rohit Sharma as KKR Pacer Gets Retained Ahead of,"Home

Given his form last season where he took 12 wickets in 14 games it was highly unlikely that Australian pacer Pat Cummins would be retained by Kolkata Knight Riders – but the franchise has shown faith. Cummins was bought by KKR for a whopping Rs 15.5 cr as the side was looking for a senior fast bowler. The staggering amount saw him become the second-highest-paid player in 2020.

Trending Now

Now that he is set to represent KKR again – he pips Rohit Sharma MS Dhoni in terms of his IPL income – which certainly is a massive feat. The Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings skippers fetch Rs 15 cr from their franchisees since 2018. It was ahead of the 2018 auction that BCCI had fixed the Rs 15 cr amount for the first-choice retention. And the two respective IPL captains were the first-choice retention of their teams.

Meanwhile Cummins has been in top form for Australia with the ball in Test cricket. He picked up 21 wickets in the recently-concluded four-match Test series. KKR would hope he comes up with the goods this year and plays a vital role in helping the side succeed.

The Knight Riders franchise could not make it to the playoffs last season in UAE and they would like to turn things around in 2021. Cummins would be a key member of the squad and it would be interesting to see how the Australian is used during the 14th season.

The mini-auction is scheduled to take place in February after the second Test against England in Chennai. Teams will look to fill up gaps and prepare a side for the upcoming season.

CVS,CVS Health,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvamFuLzI0L3BoYXJtYWN5LWNoYWlucy1nZWFyaW5nLXVwLWZvci12YWNjaW5hdGlvbnMtcHVzaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pharmacy chains gearing up for vaccinations push | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Among the complaints of Arkansans trying to set up their covid-19 vaccination appointments is: ""My Walgreens [or CVS or Walmart] isn't giving those shots.""

That may be changing however. Executives and spokesmen are talking about the big pharmacy chains' plans to widely offer coronavirus immunizations.

CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. are on the verge of offering the shots to the public according to company reports.

And Walmart Inc. which is expanding its inoculations into seven states outside Arkansas indicated on a company blog that it eventually plans to offer covid-19 vaccinations throughout the chain.

The Bentonville-based retailer now offers the inoculations to eligible Arkansans only at its pharmacies in Arkadelphia Ashdown West Memphis and El Dorado according to the Arkansas Department of Health.

[CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]

Walgreens and CVS contracted with the federal Department of Health and Human Services in October to first vaccinate residents of long-term-care facilities nationwide. Those inoculations began Dec. 28 and the companies say they'll wrap up in late January.

Once that initiative is completed their agreements with Health and Human Service allows both chains to offer the vaccine at all of their pharmacy locations.

WALMART BLOG

A new blog post Friday by Dr. Cheryl Pegus Walmart's new executive vice president of health and wellness talked about how the company expects to be able to deliver up to 13 million doses a month ""when supply and allocations allow"" and is training pharmacists and staff members so they can be ready.

""As we look to a future when supply can meet demand and more people are eligible to receive the vaccine we plan to offer the vaccine seven days a week at our pharmacies through planned vaccination clinics and through large community events"" she said.

The company can help the nation in a couple of key ways she wrote especially in rural and medically underserved areas where health care is scarce.

WALGREENS' REACH

Walgreens plans to eventually offer the vaccine at all of its more than 9000 stores once doses are available for mass distribution and in accordance with state and local guidance according to the company's website.

When the chain starts vaccinating the public it will reach out to underserved and rural areas using methods such as mobile and off-site clinics the company said.

The drugstore chain's spokespeople were unable to comment ""due to the high volume of media inquiries"" they're receiving according to an automated email reply.

CVS ROLLOUT

CVS pharmacy vaccinations for the public are currently available only at a small number of the chain's stores in Indiana New York and Massachusetts CVS Health spokeswoman Monica Prinzing said. But the company is talking about a ""broader rollout.""

""The company remains in discussions with additional states to make a limited number of doses available in the coming weeks in advance of the broader rollout"" she said.

Vaccines in retail settings will be given by appointment only Prinzing said. Appointments can be made on the company's website or through its app.

Prinzing said CVS has the capacity to administer up to 25 million shots per month. The company has nearly 10000 pharmacies across the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSGVhbHRoL21haW5lLXNoaWZ0cy12YWNjaW5lLWRvc2VzLWN2cy13YWxncmVlbnMvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9NzU0MDE4NjXSAVxodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9IZWFsdGgvbWFpbmUtc2hpZnRzLXZhY2NpbmUtZG9zZXMtY3ZzLXdhbGdyZWVucy9zdG9yeT9pZD03NTQwMTg2NQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maine shifts some vaccine doses away from CVS and Walgreens,"Independent pharmacists said they want to help with COVID-19 vaccinations.

As frustration mounts over slow COVID-19 vaccine rollouts at CVS and Walgreens around the country Maine has been shifting supplies away from chain pharmacies to independent ones.

This week the state transferred 975 doses from Walgreens to an independent pharmacy and next week it plans to transfer 500 doses away from CVS according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The decision was driven by the principles of velocity and equity which are foundations of Maine's vaccination plan"" Robert Long a Maine CDC spokesperson told ABC News in a statement. ""The doses had not been committed to scheduled clinics so the Maine Immunization Program redirected them to vaccination sites that had ready and immediate needs.""

This week Maine didn't send any of the doses it received from the federal government to CVS or Walgreens.

But according to Long the decision to pause the retail pharmacy program isn't a policy shift. Instead he said it reflects the fact that CVS and Walgreens already had enough doses to fulfill their commitments for the week.

""This is not an issue of pace"" a CVS spokesperson told ABC News. ""The 500 doses noted are being moved because the operator of 14 long-term care facilities -- Shalom House in Portland -- wanted to move to Bedard Pharmacy with whom they have an existing relationship.""

""There are several factors that may leave us with more doses than initially planned"" a Walgreens spokesperson told ABC News. ""For example the patient population at a long-term care facility has shifted patients or staff elect not to get the vaccine or a facility overestimated doses needed.""

""We are not messing around with this"" Dr. Nirav Shah director of the Maine CDC said during a news conference last week. ""We've got doses waiting to be administered and people waiting to receive them. If we see a mismatch there we are going to continue moving things around in that fashion.""

It remains to be seen if Maine will follow in the footsteps of West Virginia which was lauded for a successful vaccine rollout that relied on partnering with independent pharmacies instead of chains.

As of Jan. 21 West Virginia had vaccinated 9349 out of every 100000 residents among the best per capita rates in the country according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By comparison Maine's per capita vaccination rate was 5989 vaccines administered for every 100000 people.

And while the Maine CDC said that West Virginia's success with independent pharmacies had no influence on Maine's decision to reallocate doses the two states do have some key similarities.

While slightly more than half of pharmacies in Maine are chains compared to 41% of pharmacies in West Virginia both states have a dearth of chains in rural neighborhoods according to an ABC News analysis of SafeGraph data. In Maine there are only six chain pharmacies per 100000 people in rural areas. Rural neighborhoods in West Virginia have roughly eight chain pharmacies per 100000 people.

John Beckner senior director of strategic initiatives at the National Community Pharmacists Association which represents independent pharmacies said that independent pharmacies had wanted to be involved in the initial vaccine distribution effort.

""We had numerous meetings and calls with CDC and HHS. We lobbied"" he said. ""By and large states have elected to use CVS and Walgreens. In some cases that worked OK. In other cases there were a lot of bumps in the road.""

And despite the perception that independent pharmacies aren't as well equipped as the big chains to handle vaccinations Beckner a pharmacist by training stressed that independent pharmacists often have decades of experience immunizing patients. There's also the relationship factor: In addition to existing partnerships with nursing homes in rural communities without a doctor local pharmacist sometimes double as primary care.

While tricky requirements for storing the Pfizer vaccine make the Moderna a more realistic option for pharmacies ""the main challenge for our members has been access to the vaccine"" Beckner said.

More states are reaching out to independent pharmacies according to Beckner and with the prospect of additional vaccines like Johnson & Johnson's in the pipeline Beckner is hopeful that independents will have a bigger role to play when vaccinations of the general public start.

""What we've seen in West Virginia is best practice quite frankly"" he said. ""Other states have really taken notice.""

BROWN/AFP via Getty Mega Millions ticket

One ticket holder in Michigan just became a whole lot richer after being the lucky winner of the $1.05 billion Mega Millions jackpot.

The second-largest jackpot in Mega Millions history was claimed on Friday night after a single ticket matched all six numbers in the night's draw the lottery announced in a news release.

The winning ticket which was purchased at grocery store Kroger in Novi matched the white balls 4 26 42 50 and 60 plus the gold Mega Ball 24.

This is the 18th Mega Millions jackpot won in Michigan over the years the last one was a prize shared with Rhode Island in October 2017. According to the release Michigan is one of the original founding members of Mega Millions.

The winner who has not yet come forward has two options to receive their payout.

The player can choose to get an escalated annuity that offers an initial payment then annual payments for 29 years or the winner can select a one-time cash payment of about $739 million which will total to about $530 million after taxes.

The massive jackpot is still not as big as the current Mega Millions record which stands at $1.537 billion according to the lottery. That prize was won by someone in South Carolina in 2018 and remains the world's largest lotto prize ever awarded on a single ticket.

Utah has been allocated fewer doses per capita than all other states an analysis by The Salt Lake Tribune showed

Note to readers: Utah officials on Sunday afternoon released additional vaccine data and requested the CDC confirm the state is getting its “fair share.” Read more here.

It’s unclear why thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses delivered to Utah haven’t been given to eligible residents even as the state reported dozens of deaths in the past week hundreds of coronavirus patients were hospitalized and the rate of positive tests continued to hover around 1 in 5.

Utah has been allocated fewer doses per capita than all other states an analysis by The Salt Lake Tribune has found.And under an earlier federal policy our unused vaccine could have slowed the state’s already meager supply.

In a statement Sunday Utah Department of Health executive director Rich Saunders said the government has “assured states this proposal is no longer under consideration.”

Still the limited doses entering the state mean many vulnerable Utahns will face a long wait even if they are considered a high priority.

Gov. Spencer Cox has vowed to speed up distribution declaring any doses unused more than a week after delivery will be collected by the state and redistributed. State officials have said they are tracking the vaccine’s arrival in order to enforce Cox’s order.

But they still are not disclosing how many doses arrive in the state each day or where they have been delivered or whether they have been reclaimed by the state thwarting public scrutiny of the rollout.

While at least 31000 unused first doses have been in the state for more than a week as of information that was available to The Tribune on Thursday there is a dispute over who has much of that vaccine.

It’s known that a portion — 5400 doses as of Thursday — was delivered to hospitals local health departments and other distributors more than a week ago but it’s not clear whether those doses have been collected for redistribution.

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted multiple questions to Cox’s Unified Command which is overseeing Utah’s distribution of vaccine. Here’s what we know — and don’t know — about the pace of inoculations and where vaccine is going as eligible residents clamor for their shots.

How much vaccine is Utah getting?

The federal government announces each state’s allocation every Tuesday. States then submit their orders designating where those doses should be delivered. The orders are shipped the following Monday and can take up to a week to arrive.

Utah has been allocated 524000 doses through Jan. 25 — about 160 doses per 1000 residents. That’s the least of any state and well below the 190 doses that have been allocated per 1000 people nationally.

Even excluding Utah’s disproportionately large population of children who are ineligible for the vaccine under federal authorizations Utah’s allocation so far amounts to the lowest of any state per capita though to a lesser degree.

[Read more: Are you a vulnerable Utahn waiting for COVID-19 vaccine? Here’s what we know.]

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to inquiries about Utah’s allocation.

It’s also unclear why the number of doses the state reports as shipped to Utah — 368050 as of Thursday — is so far below the doses listed in the federal allocation: more than 454000 as of the beginning of last week.

Joe Dougherty spokesman for the state’s coronavirus response team said the “allocation” includes doses that haven’t been ordered or shipped but rather is advance notice of “what we’re allowed to draw from.”

However the Jan. 25 allocation already has been announced and it’s unclear why the state would not yet have ordered doses that were allocated on Jan. 18; even the total allocation a week before that on Jan. 10 was 384150 — many thousand more than the state reports have been shipped.

Where are Utah’s doses?

Let’s start with Utah’s second doses.

Of the 368050 doses shipped to Utah 141025 have been designated as second doses that complete a COVID-19 inoculation. Those can’t be administered state officials note until three or four weeks after each patient receives their first dose.

As of Friday 23469 of those second doses had been distributed. That would leave a little over 120000.

Cox said Thursday that state leaders have decided any second doses left unclaimed by patients for longer than seven days will be released as first doses.

The bigger question involves the state’s supply of first doses. As for those — Utah has been shipped 227025 and 175980 have been given to patients.

That leaves about 51000 first doses that have shipped but have not gotten into patients’ arms.

State officials as of Thursday had not accounted for about 20000 of those doses; they may have been in transit or may have arrived in recent days.

But at least 31000 of those unused first doses arrived in Utah more than a week ago and still have not been used state officials reported Thursday.

Where are those 31000 unused doses?

Cox said this week that about 26000 of those doses arrived more than a week ago and are waiting unused at CVS and Walgreens facilities in Utah which have federal contracts to vaccinate residents and staff at nursing homes.

“Unfortunately the federal partners are lagging behind in administering their first doses” states a blog post on Utah’s coronavirus website. “This means vaccinations are sitting on shelves instead of getting those shots in arms.”

However representatives for Walgreens and CVS have challenged Cox’s account in statements to The Tribune.

Federal officials control the terms of the contract with the chains but the pharmacies take those doses out of the state’s share of the vaccine Dougherty said.

According to state data posted Thursday the two pharmacies have used only about a quarter of the roughly 78000 total doses they have received for Utah nursing homes. They have given out fewer than half of their 46000 first doses the state said.

In Thursday’s online post Utah officials wrote that they want to “renegotiate the plan” for the pharmacies with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

And Cox speaking Thursday said federal officials have “given them more vaccine than they need” not just in Utah but in other states too.

Utah is working with the pharmacies now “to get those extra doses back — we believe there are thousands of them maybe tens of thousands of them — and redistribute those to our local health departments so we can get those in the arms of those 70 years old or older” he said. “That’s a big change and something that will make a huge difference.”

On Chris Cuomo’s CNN show Cuomo Prime Time on Saturday Cox said of the pharmacies: “We estimate they have 15 to 16000 extra doses that they don’t need and can’t use right now. So we’re taking that back and we’re giving it to our local health departments and it will be gone next week.”

Cuomo interjected: “So they’re agreeing to give you the stuff?” Cox responded “Yes yes they are.”

But spokespeople for Walgreens and CVS say they do not have thousands of unused doses sitting on shelves.

As of Thursday CVS had only enough doses left to complete the nursing home clinics it had scheduled in Utah for the following seven days said spokeswoman Monica Prinzing. It is possible she said that the state is calculating an excess based on a federal allocation estimate which is different from the amount the pharmacies actually order and receive.

“Vaccine allocations for CVS Pharmacy are based on an estimate held in queue not the actual amount of vaccine that will be ordered and used for a clinic at a facility” she wrote.

Both CVS and Walgreens say they will complete all of the facilities’ first doses by Monday.

And both say that state officials directly approve the number of doses the pharmacies receive each week — in contrast to state officials’ statements that federal authorities decide how many to remove from Utah’s allocation for them.

If the pharmacies do not have the 26000 doses that the state asserts have been delivered to them that leaves unresolved the question of who has had that vaccine for over a week.

What about the unused doses delivered to other distributors?

The state reported as of Thursday that more than 5400 doses have not been used in hospitals local health departments and other places despite arriving more than a week ago. But it’s not clear whether those doses have been collected for redistribution.

And because the state is only reporting how many doses each local health department has administered — but not how many they have received — it’s impossible for Utahs to know whether their county or regional health department is taking longer than others to use its supplies.

What is the impact of unused vaccine on Utah’s supply going forward?

In remarks this month former Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar warned that starting this week each state’s allocation of vaccine would be based in part on how quickly its previous doses were being administered.

Doses previously were apportioned by population.

“This new system gives states a strong incentive to ensure that all vaccinations are being promptly reported which they’re currently not and it gives states a strong incentive to ensure doses are going to work protecting people rather than sitting on shelves or in freezers” Azar said.

Emails sent shortly after the presidential inauguration were not returned nor is there any public announcement from the CDC or the White House. Saunders said Sunday that the federal government has reversed the policy.

Will Utah’s younger seniors get their turn soon?

Probably not. New doses for 30000 to 35000 people are arriving in the state each week; long-term care residents teachers and others are still being vaccinated but most doses are going to local health departments to give to residents ages 70 and older a group that includes close to 240000 Utahns.

All vaccination appointments for seniors filled up within hours of opening in some areas — and that was after throngs of prospective patients crashed websites and phone systems.

State Senate President Stuart Adams has said he wants Utah to lower its eligibility age for vaccination to 65 adding that he believes that would allow the economy to reopen more quickly. That’s in line with CDC recommendations to extend eligibility down to age 65.

But with Utah’s supply already spoken for through at least the next month the state has little power to conjure the doses that the 124000 Utahns ages 65 to 70 would need.

“It really doesn’t make sense to tell the public more people are eligible if there aren’t vaccines for them. So we will open up eligibility when it’s logical to do so” Dougherty said.

That could happen as early as March he said.

What about other vulnerable groups?

Although the state previously anticipated giving priority to some younger groups such as patients with certain high-risk medical conditions their outlook is also uncertain.

“Keep in mind that something like half of adults have at least one of the three most common conditions that lead to severe effects of COVID-19: diabetes obesity or heart disease” Dougherty said.

“If we were to just open up to people with those conditions” he said “we would cause way too much frustration because we wouldn’t have adequate vaccines for them.”

Phillips Equipment Corporation is a locally owned John Deere dealership that has been serving Rustburg and surrounding communities with products since 1971.

The company was founded in January 1971 by J.B. Phillips Jr. and his wife Barbara.

The original business was located near the Lynchburg Regional Airport from 1971 until 1976 said Brad Phillips son of J.B. Phillips and now co-owner of the business.

Land was purchased in 1975 further down U.S. 29 South to build a more modern facility and to have a bigger lot for more inventory and room for future expansion.

“We have grown since then with three major expansions to the current facility” Brad Phillips said.

J.B. Phillips saw the first expansion start in 2001 but died in May 2001 before it was complete. His wife died in 2002.

Today the company is owned and managed by Brad and his brother Keith. The two have been in ownership together for over 30 years.

There is now a third generation in their kids following in the John Deere tradition that looks forward to offering the same service that customers have come to expect.

“We are very fortunate our business has remained family owned and has not been bought out or merged with another larger John Deere dealer organization or group” Brad Phillips said.

The business has grown in sales and service and has 22 employees today who are very loyal and are a big part of the company’s success the brothers said.

“Our customers and the community have supported us and made the business with their loyal support over the years” Brad Phillips said. “We appreciate our customers and community support and give back in different ways anytime we can by making donations to local schools fire departments sheriff’s office and many other charitable organizations.”

Keith Phillips said the business has always sold farm equipment and lawn and garden products as they are located in a rural farming community with many farms in the surrounding counties. They offer farm tractors hay equipment compact tractors lawn mowers and Gator utility vehicles.

He said the Stihl handheld power equipment line helped to grow business and encouraged expansion of the showroom and warehouse in 2013 to offer another full line of products and service.

Brad Phillips said what sets the business apart from other dealers is their parts and service department.

“We have the knowledge and experience to take care of our customers and the wide variety equipment they own” he said. “Customer service is our focus. We have many personal relationships with our customers. They are not only customers but they are friends and like family.”

Jim Saunders an owner of Saunders Brothers Farm Market in Piney River said he has known the Phillips family his entire life and his business heavily relies on them for parts for farm equipment.

He said his family farm has done business with them since the very beginning at their first location near the airport.

“I remember going there when I was riding there with someone else. I didn’t even have my driver’s license. That was when I was in middle school” he said. “I’d go with my dad and look at parts and tractors.”

Saunders Brothers purchase tractors tractor equipment and parts from the business.

“Their parts department is really good” he said. “That’s huge because we can call them for a specific part and they look it up and order the part and two days later we go pick it up. When you’ve got your special tractor that’s down in the middle of harvesting it’s critical in our business to get that part because everything is so time sensitive.”

The farming industry has changed over the years with fewer full-time farmers and more part-time producers who work a job during the day and farm at night and weekends Brad Phillips said.

“There are more customers who now have a smaller lot and need a lawn mower or a compact tractor to maintain their property” he said.

Keith Phillips said there are opportunities out there and more room to grow.

“We have to keep changing” he said. “As the farming and homeowner industry change we also have to adapt.”

Brad Phillips said the company will continue to grow and adapt as new technology develops in the future.

“That’s all we can do — just keep selling and continuing to take care of our customers” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvam9obi1raWRkLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc1NDc2NznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Kidd Obituary (1932 - 2021) - Waterloo IA - Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/wcfcourier/name/john-kidd-obituary?id=7547679 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvam9obi1raWRkLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc1NDc2NznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ3aS5jby51ay9tYWNoaW5lcnkvdHJhY3RvcnMvZGV1dHotYW5kLWpvaG4tZGVlcmUtYW5ub3VuY2UtZW5naW5lLWJ1aWxkaW5nLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deutz and John Deere announce engine building partnership,"Two of the world’s biggest agricultural engine makers have revealed plans to jointly develop and source components for a new range that will run to 170hp.

A video of Nicholas Allain riding a mini-Zamboni on his backyard rink has been shared by the NHL on its Instagram page.

In the video Nicholas is driving a battery-operated John Deere tractor made for kids that was modified to clean the backyard rink his dad Marty built for him.

It was Marty's first time making a backyard rink.

A Zamboni? He had no idea it was going to be such a hit right out of the gate.

""It was pretty cool"" Marty said adding that the NHL Instagram account contacted him in advance to ask permission to share his video.

The NHL's official account has 4.5-million followers.

""A lot of my friends and even people that I didn't talk to in a while reached out and thought it was pretty cool"" he said.

Marty originally posted the video online in a Facebook page for people who make outdoor rinks. Things just snowballed from there before catching the attention of the NHL.

He said his son may not realize how much the video has been shared because he's so young but he said Nicholas was pretty excited to look at the post the NHL made showing him driving the Zamboni with the caption ""FRESH SHEET ALERT.""

""He watches hockey a little bit"" said Marty. He said his son's favorite team is the Vegas Golden Knights because Lukas Cormier who plays for the team is also from Sainte-Marie-de-Kent.

Marty said he decided to make the rink this year because he was concerned that minor hockey and access to the local arena would be interrupted due to COVID-19 which turned out to be true.

He started planning in the fall and started building the pieces in the garage.

""It was a lot of time"" he laughed. ""I didn't count my hours but a lot of Friday nights in the garage with a few cold pops.""

The project turned out to be quite elaborate with rounded corners and boards painted to look like a professional rink topped off with bright flood lights for practices at night. He's already planning to make the rink bigger next year.

""I wanted to do something special for my son"" he said. ""I wanted to do something where he could really practise his shot.""

It didn't take Marty long to realize that he had the perfect opportunity to make a small Zamboni for his son to help care for the ice surface.

Marty rigged the machine with studded tires a bucket hose and a sheet of cloth to groom the ice.

""He can actually manoeuvre around and get it all done if he wants to — if a five-year-old wants to"" Marty laughed.

Marty said Nicholas would rather skate on the rink than clean it even with his Zamboni.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9xY29ubGluZS9uYW1lL2pvaG4tYW5nZWwtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9ODI0ODQ0N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Angel Obituary (1956 - 2021) - East Moline IA - The Rock Island Dispatch Argus,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/qconline/name/john-angel-obituary?id=8248447 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9xY29ubGluZS9uYW1lL2pvaG4tYW5nZWwtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9ODI0ODQ0N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

After all you can't use loyalty benefits when you're not in the air. That's why we've seen every major airline extend perks through the entirety of the 2021 status year with some carriers even reducing elite qualification requirements for 2022.

However slower travel also becomes the perfect opportunity for airlines to poach customers -- and get them into a loyalty ecosystem for the years ahead. Delta did exactly that with its targeted status match opportunity in the fall of 2020.

And I took the bait. As a years-long American Airlines Executive Platinum member I wanted to get a better sense of the competition. So I matched my American status to Delta becoming a newly-minted Diamond Medallion through (at least) March 31 2021.

With two nearly equivalent statuses in-hand I took several flights on both American and Delta for work trips and an outdoor getaway. Here were five things that I learned while flying these two airlines during the pandemic.

Delta takes COVID-19 precautions way more seriously

The pandemic has changed the way people look at travel especially when it comes to flying. While price and schedule remain important factors for choosing an airline cleanliness and safety have taken on a new importance for obvious reasons.

I've been impressed with Delta's commitment to COVID-19 precautions and while not inherently a benefit of elite status it did convince me to book a flight with Delta instead of the competition. Elite status combined with safety measures made it an easy choice.

Both Delta and American have COVID-19 sanitation standards in place with similar messaging about how they care for passengers during every step of the journey. However on paper Delta already does two things better. First Delta has blocked middle seats through at least March 30 2021 which limits capacity on flights. Second it boards aircraft from back to front limiting crowding on the plane's aisles.

In practice I noticed these to be tangible benefits to the flying experience. My flights on Delta not only felt more comfortable but I observed Delta employees enforce mask-wearing and distancing during boarding and deplaning. Sanitizer was provided on Delta flights but not on American.

The biggest surprise here was that American didn't nearly have this same level of exacting attention from flight attendants and gate agents. The difference was night and day.

Upgrades are plentiful for both airlines

Business travelers often make up the bulk of the first and business class cabin. With fewer passengers flying for work upgrades were readily available on both Delta and American. In fact that meant an upgrade on every single one of my Delta and American flights including on the premium transcontinental route between New York (JFK) and Los Angeles (LAX).

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chris Dong (@thechrisflyer)

I was particularly surprised to see these upgrades clear in advance on Delta for two reasons.

First with Delta's blocked seating policy there are fewer seats available in the first-class cabin for upgrades. In fact for any narrowbody plane your odds of an upgrade are reduced by half with only two seats occupied per row (instead of four). Second I was even upgraded to the highly-coveted Delta One cabin between JFK and LAX -- and those upgrades only clear on the day of departure.

These upgrades as both a Delta Diamond and an American Executive Platinum show just how few elite passengers were flying in 2020 and how empty planes have been.

Delta has a more polished experience

While it was a small sample size of just a few flights I was surprised to see how much more polished the Delta experience has been during the pandemic. These may seem minor but in the grand scheme of things make a significant difference in the flying experience -- especially if you take to the skies often.

(Photo by Chris Dong/The Points Guy)

For instance Delta emails passengers about 48 hours prior to their flight to notify them of COVID-19 safety procedures. The airline also texts passengers immediately upon landing (and before arriving at the gate) with a simple yet effective message. This is the text that I received from Delta upon landing in Los Angeles.

Welcome to LAX! To help your flight crew provide a safe experience for everyone please allow some extra space between you and your fellow passengers when exiting the plane.

Additionally Delta gate agents crew and Sky Club staff consistently recognized my status and thanked me for my loyalty. This was notably lacking for all of my flights with American in 2020.

American has much faster more reliable Wi-Fi

As a frequent American flyer I had never purchased Wi-Fi with Delta before last year. American has streamlined its Wi-Fi offerings with almost all flights having a high-speed gate-to-gate option (at least for narrowbody aircraft).

This is an element of the American experience that I had taken for granted. After being onboard several Delta flights with Gogo 2ku service I found the Wi-Fi experience to be consistently slower and less reliable than comparable American flights.

However Delta recognizes this as its Achilles' heel and plans to lay the groundwork for better (and eventually free) Wi-Fi by partnering with ViaSat.

American has a significantly better premium transcon product

Earlier this fall I flew back to back on both American and Delta between New York and Los Angeles a long-time premium route but one that has also seen significant schedule and service cuts during the pandemic.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chris Dong (@thechrisflyer)

American excelled on this flight with hot meals full service and an experience that rivaled that of before the pandemic. Delta meanwhile retains a reduced onboard experience in Delta One -- even on its most premium domestic route -- with snack boxes beer wine and water served only.

While an upgrade is appreciated to a lie-flat bed American clearly came out ahead. I'm surprised to see Delta remain staunchly against the return of meal service and full catering onboard.

Bottom line

Overall as a new Delta elite member -- and infrequent Delta flyer -- I've been impressed with the Atlanta-based airline. However one sore point remains: Delta SkyMiles. In short I just don't find I get as much value out of each mile with SkyMiles when redeeming for the type of reward flights I take when compared to other airlines.

While the flying experience during the pandemic (except for catering and Wi-Fi) was in Delta's favor I much prefer earning and redeeming American AAdvantage miles. What does this mean for the future of my loyalty to a specific airline?

Well with travel remaining in flux in 2021 I have yet to decide which airline to throw my money at. For now Delta and American are neck-in-neck for a share of my wallet. Stay tuned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbnVtYmVyLW9mLXBlb3BsZS1iYW5uZWQtYnktdXMtYWlybGluZXMtbm90LXdlYXJpbmctbWFzay0yMDIxLTHSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL251bWJlci1vZi1wZW9wbGUtYmFubmVkLWJ5LXVzLWFpcmxpbmVzLW5vdC13ZWFyaW5nLW1hc2stMjAyMS0xP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How many people have been banned by US airlines for not wearing masks,"More than 2500 passengers have been banned from US airlines for non-compliance with mask policies.

Newly inaugurated President Joe Biden just signed an executive order to mandate masks when flying travelers but it's clear that airlines haven't been waiting on the government for guidance.

New data from the country's largest airlines reveal that more than 2500 passengers have been banned since the spring for violating onboard mask policies and the list grows larger every day.

Airlines have been turning to mask enforcement as a way to regain confidence in air travel by eliminating fears of the onboard spread of COVID-19. A handful of banned passengers in their eyes outweighs the loss of thousands of travelers due to an in-flight outbreak especially as daily passenger numbers are still more than 50% less than 2019's according to the Transportation Security Administration.

Passengers banned by these airlines will typically be welcomed back once the pandemic ends and masks are no longer required. Until then the thousands of passengers banned by a particular airline will have to find a new one to frequent.

Here's how US airlines are stacking up when it comes to enforcing mask policies.

Allegiant Air

Allegiant Air was the last major US airline to require its passengers to wear masks while flying and while the ultra-low-cost carrier finally relented a spokesperson told Insider that only ""approximately 15"" flyers have been banned for non-compliance and ""egregious violations"" as of January 14 2021.

Masks are available upon request at Allegiant airport counters or onboard the aircraft a policy that the airline says helps minimize the number of banned passengers.

""We have found this approach to be quite effective generally and that the great majority of passengers support and comply with the policy"" a spokesperson told Insider. ""For the most part those few who may need a reminder in flight also comply with the policy.""

Hawaiian Airlines

A soccer-style yellow card system was implemented at the airline to help discretely notify passengers that they're running afoul of mask rules.

Spirit Airlines

Spirit Airlines has banned ""about 400"" passengers for mask non-compliance a spokesperson told Insider.

Despite its status as America's most loved-to-hate airline Insider found on an August Spirit Airlines flight that the airline was being proactive in aiding social distancing when possible. Flight attendants were moving passengers to empty rows and while middle seats weren't formally blocked an effort was made to limit passengers to two per row.

Masks are required at every step in the Delta travel experience starting at check-in as Insider found on a tour of Delta's operation at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

The airline saw additional incidents in the days leading up to and after the Capitol riots. A flight from Salt Lake City to Washington saw six passengers that were harassing Senator Mitt Romney banned for mask non-compliance.

Expect narrowbody equipment between Los Angeles and Atlanta and a 767-300 (which Live and Let’s Fly has reviewed here and here) between Atlanta and Santiago.

You can search and book via Google Flights here.

I’ll be passing on this deal attractive as it is. Chile is a wonderful country to visit and Americans are allowed to visit with a negative COVID-19 PCR test. However a 10-day quarantine is required which defeats the purpose of going unless you are mileage running.

Do note you do not have to stay 10 days. However you must quarantine while you are there. The fare nets 2950 SkyMiles 19920 MQMs and $590 MQDs if you do not have status. A few of these runs coupled with a Delta co-branded credit card could get you SkyMiles status fairly easily.

CONCLUSION

We’ve seen some incredible fares to Latin America lately. While United and LATAM are not offering fares quite as cheap United is only charging about $1300 round-trip another great deal to consider if you prefer Star Alliance.

Will you take advantage of this Delta Business Class deal to Chile?

Emily Bernstein is an ASU Cronkite School of Journalism student assigned to cover Tempe Preparatory for AZPreps365.com

The napkins silverware and plates were set on the table for grandma’s homemade meal to be shared with the family. In John Shroll’s grandmother’s house not only is the family well-fed but grandma never fails to make sure the refrigerator is always stocked up with juice for the two of them to share.

“Whenever he is up here I always ask if he has checked his carbohydrates after I baked something for the whole family” his grandma Shirley Haberlack said.

At four years old Shroll was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at Phoenix Children’s Hospital. He is now a senior tight end and defensive end at Tempe Preparatory Academy but when he was younger he was losing weight rapidly. His parents were concerned.

“(They) never thought it was going to be diabetes” Shroll said.

He spent five nights in the hospital after his diagnosis. It was a shock for not just Shroll but his family as well. Now in his senior year of high school Shroll lives his life by participating in his favorite activities physically while monitoring what his body needs in his 24-hour job living with Type 1 Diabetes.

“It was a hard struggle at first for my parents and I. I started off with syringes to take insulin and cried every time... I soon got used to it and the pain went away” Shroll said. “I feel completely normal in society today because it is something I have lived with for as long as I can remember.”

Eventually Shroll switched to a more advanced insulin pump which allows him to maintain his blood sugar easier during the day. He uses a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) that keeps track of his blood sugar throughout the day and night. Whenever Shroll explains diabetes to people who are uninformed they usually ask the same question: “So did you just eat too much candy when you were a kid?” Shroll said.

“There being two types of diabetes it is easy to mix up the two"" he continued. ""Most people seem to know what diabetes is but when I explain it to people who don’t know they have a hard time understanding.”

Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children teens and young adults but at the age of 60 Shroll’s grandmother had a rare diagnosis of Type 1 at her age.

“Usually it is people after 40-years old. It is usually Type 2 (diabetes) and they can control it with a diet exercise and pills. (However) Type 1 is more dangerous (due to the lack of the) hormone insulin and you have to test several times a day and do insulin injections” Haberlack said.

Not alone in his battle

Shroll was diagnosed before his grandmother. Once she found out being able to share that connection with her made him feel like he is not in this battle alone. It was a shock when his grandmother found out however the knowledge that the Shroll’s family had gained from the Phoenix Children's Hospital was shared between the two of them.

“Whenever we were around John we tried to make it a joyful time” Haberlack said. Even though it is a disease we did not want him to feel isolated.”

Both Shroll and his grandmother have developed a relationship by working together by always checking in on each other.

“My grandma taught me that no matter what I can always have (a positive) attitude toward my diabetes” Shroll said.

Haberlack described Type 1 diabetes as a 24-hour job. From the minute Shroll wakes up each morning he is aware of what his body needs when it comes to constantly checking his glucose number and gives himself the right amount of insulin before he eats. He enjoys his dinner at a certain time at night to make sure his glucose numbers do not rise or drop but ends up having to wake up at least three or four nights every week to correct his numbers by eating the right carbohydrates.

“John has never spent the night away from us. Either my husband or myself has had to be in the same place with him” Shroll’s mother Tifni Shroll said. “John’s alarms will go off while he sleeps if he goes too low or high but he doesn’t hear it and will not wake up. We hear it and can help him.”

Shroll now has a new insulin pump that has an auto-mode feature to help keep him in a better glucose range for the purpose of preventing lows and highs from happening.

“I am hopeful that this is how he will make it without us in the future” Tifni said.

On top of that Shroll is a student-athlete and is always on-the-go when it comes to biking with his dad or participating in various activities outside of sports.

“I think that John’s diagnosis is a motivator for him” his girlfriend Tori Cord said. “It is a chance for him to show others that although he has to do twice as much to get to where they are that extra work is giving him a much more advanced mindset than others our age.”

Shroll has to listen to his body on a microscopic level compared to other athletes.

“This gives him an advantage when training and practicing. He knows what fuels him and what drags him down” Cord said. “This ability will be extremely helpful to him in all aspects of his life and I am excited to watch it unfold.”

Shroll does not let his diagnosis defeat him. He knows that he has to be in charge of what his body is telling him; he is aware of it but does not broadcast about it to other people as an issue.

“I can show normal people that I can do anything they do because I can control my diabetes rather than it controlling me” Shroll said.

A learning moment

When John and his girlfriend first became friends she told him about her exchange trip she had taken that summer to Germany and how he should do something like that.

“He then showed me his insulin pump and said ‘I can’t do something like that.’ It made me realize how lucky I was to be healthy and not have to worry about something so meticulous on a daily level” Cord said.

Within the year of their relationship Cord has learned so much about the world of diabetes.

“One step of helping him was downloading an app that showed me his glucose levels” Cord said.

Technology has advanced in a way that when she goes on the phone app Dexcom she can watch Shroll’s blood sugar levels.

“When it comes to football you can always see me and his mom with our apps open looking at John’s number while he is playing. Being able to help John be the best athlete he is capable of (being) makes me very happy” Cord said. “I love being able to watch John succeed on the field and help him get there.”

During football games Shroll saw every snap on defense. Meanwhile on offense he was on and off the field depending on the personnel. “I have to do my best to check my blood sugar. Sometimes football can be unpredictable so I might not have a chance to check it” Shroll said.

Shroll likes to play with his levels around 150 mg/dL so he is at his best throughout all four quarters of the game.

“When my blood sugar reaches 250 mg/dL and over I am unable to play because of athletic trainer regulations” Shroll said. “During a game I need to have insulin to keep my blood sugar down because they will start to rise as soon as I take off my pump.”

Shroll is able to live his life and participate in his favorite activities from the outside but on the inside he is always monitoring what his body needs.

“John did a wonderful job showing the team that you can overcome any diagnosis like diabetes and play at a high level on Friday nights” head coach Larry Cain said. “From the moment John stepped on the practice field he was instantly deemed a leader because of his ability to play between the whistles and over anything thrown his way.”

This was Cain’s first season coaching Shroll for his senior year of Tempe Preparatory Academy Football.

“I consider myself a very proactive coach when it comes to my player’s health” Cain said.

Throughout the season Cain wrote a note at the top of his practice schedule everyday “to ensure I did not forget to ask John how he feels and if he needed to step aside and check his insulin level” Cain explained.

“At times during our first two weeks of practice I could tell John was becoming irritated by me asking him how he was doing” Cain said. “But by the end of the season John realized I asked because I cared so much about his health.”

Cain has spent so much time watching Shroll and his mannerisms that even after the completion of a drill or play Cain formed a nonverbal communication that has helped him in his coaching for Shroll’s needs.

“I could tell by his body language how he was doing and energy level during the play a drill” Cain said.

Cain spent this season teaching his team eight-man football while Shroll taught him how Type 1 diabetes can affect a person and the way they play.

“I wanted to ensure John’s safety and he would play the game like everyone else” Cain said. “I did a ton of research on his condition so I could be as helpful and knowledgeable about what he was dealing with.”

Raising awareness

Shroll’s day to day life illustrates that living with Type 1 diabetes cannot stop him from accomplishing anything he sets his mind to.

Shroll’s relationships with the people that he has in his life and his Nana who lives with the same diagnosis have all first learned about Type 1 diabetes differently. However they overlap in how each of them has been open to learning and understanding more through Shroll’s diagnosis and that has changed the way they view living with Type 1 diabetes.

“Being open to learning and understanding the highs and lows creates better experiences for athletes with Type 1 (diabetes). For example John’s coach always made sure that there was juice for him at practice and (it) could be seen often during games (of the coach) checking in with him and the athletic trainer to see how John’s glucose number was” Cord said.

“All it takes is simple education to help make a difference.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The planned 11000 square-foot Popshelf will be situated in the Conyers Commons shopping center at 2195 GA-20. The addition of Popshelf and recent leases with Bealls Outlet and Citi Trends — replacing the former Sports Authority — makes the center 100 percent leased.

“We are excited for Conyers Commons to be one of a select few shopping centers in the country to house this exciting new concept from Dollar General” Bob Dake chief operating officer at ShopOne said in a prepared statement. “The selection of Conyers Commons speaks to the quality of its tenant mix and the value we create for our tenants and customers as proven operators. We look forward to opening Popshelf in summer 2021.”

Launched in October 2020 Popshelf retails seasonal and home décor health and beauty products home cleaning supplies party goods entertaining needs and more with approximately 95 percent of items priced at $5 or less. Popshelf also carries a “highly curated” crossover assortment of Dollar General’s private brands many of which have been recently rebranded.

Kevin Schaeuble the office manager at Plendl Feed Service an agricultural firm in Kingsley told the Journal on Saturday that Plendl will be taking over Chet's Foods the last remaining grocer in the Plymouth County community of roughly 1400 people effective Feb. 1.

Plendl plans to rename the store the Hometown Pantry. The store will be closed three or four weeks ""to do a store reset"" -- establishing relationships with vendors obtaining licenses and refreshing the paint in the store a smallish brick structure built in 1910. They're also thinking of bringing in some new meat coolers.

The purchase is expected to be completed by next week.

This is Plendl's second acquisition of a Kingsley retailer the first being Clark's Hardware which they purchased over a decade ago. Schaeuble said in a phone call Saturday afternoon that profit was not the motive in the purchase of Clark's or Chet's -- it was several years after the purchase of Clark's before they realized profits from that venture.

""It'll be rough"" Schaeuble predicted of the grocery store acquisition.

Rather Schaeuble said that Plendl is acquiring Chet's because a community suffers in the absence of a grocer. ""It's not all about (revenues) it's just -- keeping the town going"" he said.

Chet's Foods 128 Main St. has been in the control of Chet and Linda Davis since 1978 when they bought out Cole's Market another grocer that had been in that spot since at least the early 1940s.

In the 1970s Kingsley had three grocers all within one block along its modest Main Street. The others subsequently went out of business but Chet's clung on despite competition from larger grocers in Sioux City a little over a half-hour away.

Within the last decade however Chet's and many of its compatriots in other small towns faced intense competition from Dollar General a national discount chain which has positioned its outposts in more and more small communities. There are well over 100 Dollar Generals within a 100-mile radius of Sioux City.

Dollar General does not for the most part stock fresh produce or meat but its stores cut deeply into small grocers' sales of nonperishables -- paper products soap and detergents and some canned goods.

The Davises once had a second location in nearby Moville but closed the store soon after a Dollar General opened there in 2016.

Chet Davis had fought against Dollar General's plan to build a Kingsley store going so far as to participate in a petition drive against it but those efforts failed and Dollar General opened a store there last February.

Chet's announced it would close the store at the end of this month.

Davis had warned that the loss of a community's grocery store would contribute to a gradual unravelling of its quality of life and Schaeuble echoed that sentiment in a written statement announcing the purchase.

""Once you lose your grocery store in town it's going to hurt the whole community"" Davis told the Journal in the summer of 2019. ""We believe you cannot lose a business in a small town because of the domino effect on the others"" Schaeuble wrote.

Schaeuble floated a few ideas to keep the store fresh relevant and ideally humming with business -- including grocery deliveries and a possible phone app. Grocers increasingly turned to delivery and curbside pickup services this past year as some shoppers were uneasy going inside a store during the pandemic while some others were left isolated at home after they contracted the coronavirus.

""This way our senior customers and others can get out of the house and go for a drive without the worry of having to go in store. We also realize Kingsley has seniors that are home bound and plan to delivery groceries to them. Deliveries will be twice a week"" Schaeuble said in the written statement.

Kingsley Mayor Rick Bohle predicted earlier this month that someone would step in to purchase the store and he struck an optimistic tone Saturday at the new ownership.

""It looks like we're going to have a store"" Bohle said in a phone call Saturday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dGhyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvaW1wZC1tYXJrcy0xMHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLWxpbmUtb2YtZHV0eS1kZWF0aC1vZi1vZmZpY2VyLWRhdmlkLW1vb3JlLzUzMS00MjViY2EzNS0zZDMwLTQ3YTktYjg2MC05ODMzYjFkNDYyOGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IMPD marks 10th anniversary of line of duty death of Officer Moore,"Officer David Moore was shot the morning of Jan. 23 2011 and died three days later.

INDIANAPOLIS — IMPD is marking the 10th anniversary of the shooting that killed Indianapolis police officer David Moore.

The department released a video Tuesday in remembrance of Officer Moore and his sacrifice.

On the morning of Jan. 23 2011 Moore stopped a stolen vehicle in the 3400 block of North Temple Avenue.

As the driver later identified as Thomas Hardy and Moore were outside their vehicles Moore was shot multiple times.

Officer Moore was wearing a bullet-resistant vest but was shot in the chest the left thigh and twice in his face. He was taken to the hospital and remained in a coma until his organs were donated on Jan. 26 2011. Seven people received Moore's organs including his heart liver lungs corneas and kidneys.

Hardy a 60-year-old parolee was arrested later that evening and held for the robbery of a Dollar General store committed 50 minutes after the shooting.

He's now serving a life sentence for Moore's murder.

Officer Moore was 29 years old when he died and in his seventh year serving with the IMPD and was working in the North District."

While most of Wall Street focuses on large-cap and mega-cap stocks as they provide a degree of safety and liquidity many investors are limited in the number of shares they can buy. Many of the biggest public companies especially the technology giants trade in the hundreds all the way up to over $1000 per share or more. At those steep prices it is pretty hard to get any decent share count leverage.

Many investors especially more aggressive traders look at lower-priced stocks as a way to not only make some good money but to get a higher share count. That can really help the decision-making process especially when you are on to a winner as you can always sell half and keep half.

Each week we screen our 24/7 Wall St. research database looking for stocks rated Buy at major firms and priced under the $10 level. This week we found five new stocks that could provide investors with some solid upside potential.

While more suited for aggressive investors and with the number of new traders skyrocketing over the past year and making good ideas to trade even harder to find these could prove exciting additions for traders looking for solid alpha potential. It is important to remember that no single analyst report should be used as a sole basis for any buying or selling decision.



Charah Solutions

This stock had a parabolic move higher and looks poised for a continued run. Charah Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ: CHRA) is the largest coal ash management company in the United States with nearly 11% of the market. The company provides a complete line of services to the coal-fired electric utility industry including landfill construction fly ash processing and marketing and ash pond management. Charah mainly assists the coal-fired power gen industry although it is starting to provide routine maintenance and modification services for nuclear-powered utilities.

The shares recently had a big move after it secured a Dominion Energy contract from 2021 through 2032 to transport up to 8.1 million tons of coal ash at its Chesterfield Power Station to cement kiln feed markets.

The environmental services company said it will install processing and transportation infrastructure in 2021 to facilitate rail transportation of the ash to cement kiln feed markets in the eastern United States for more than 10 years and also to help supply the growing demand for concrete in the construction industry.

Stifel has a $7 price target on the shares. That compares with a $6.00 Wall Street consensus target. The stock has leveled off just above $4.



Costamare

This off-the-radar idea has been on a solid roll and could hop into double digits soon. Costamare Inc. (NYSE: CMRE) is one of the world’s leading owners and providers of containerships for charter.

The company has 46 years of history in the international shipping industry and a fleet of 72 containerships with a total capacity of approximately 529000 twenty-foot equivalent units including two newbuild container ships currently under construction. Ten of the company’s containerships have been acquired pursuant to the Framework Deed with York Capital Management by vessel-owning joint venture entities in which Costamere holds a minority equity interest.

Uganda’s oil exploration area Block 4 B has been sold to a second buyer in less than six months with government not raising any queries about the manner the transaction was carried out in the new oil industry.

This comes just a week after the government said Dominion Petroleum Company [Uganda] Limited was initially awarded the licence should not leave the industry until its contract expires in 2013. The 510-square kilometres area is located around Lakes Edward and George Basin and was licensed to Dominion Petroleum Limited on July 27 2007.

In May the Daily Monitor reported that the Block had changed ownership to Ophir Energy after the company paid Dominion Petroleum about $186 million to acquire its entire exploration rights over 5 Blocks in Uganda DR Congo Kenya and Tanzania all measuring 23812 square kilometres.

However information available now shows that just five months after the acquisition Ophir Energy has also sold off the Block to another oil company identified as Octant Energy Corporation.

A statement by Mr Ron Blakely the director of Ophir Energy says the company has already taken steps to close its office in Uganda and surrender Block 4B adding that an application to relinquish the Block has been made to the Uganda government.

Despite this development the government has insisted that it does not recognise the two buyers: Ophir Energy and now Octant Energy Corporation. In a statement Mr Ernest Rubondo the commissioner for Petroleum Exploration and Production Department said Dominion signed a production sharing agreement with the government on July 27 2007 granting it exclusive rights to explore petroleum until 2013 and that government does not recognise Ophir.

Mr Honey Malinga the assistant commissioner at PEPD told Saturday Monitor that government was yet to approve the transactions of Dominion Petroleum (Uganda) Ltd. Clauses 84 and 86 of the newly enacted Petroleum Exploration Development and Production Act says the transfer and surrender of a licence cannot be effected without the written consent of a minister. It is also unclear how Ophir Energy could have gained ownership of the rights over Exploration Block 4B without the consent of the minister.

The quick purchase and sale of the Block by Ophir Energy appears to have been triggered by a financial loss due to increased administrative and operational costs associated with the assets it acquired from Dominion Petroleum Limited. Mr Blakely said in an August 28 statement that the total liabilities of the company increased from $28m in December 2011 to $139m by June 30 2012.

Mr Blakely explained that the increase was due to the addition of a deferred tax liability of about $57m (Shs143b) recognised following the acquisition of Dominion. In an apparent bid to trim the loss the company said it had completed the sale of Block V that it also acquired from Dominion Petroleum in the DR Congo.



Implication

The Uganda government could lose millions of shillings in capital gain tax if the confusion that has marred Dominion acquisition continues.

However the full implication of Dominion Petroleum Ltd pull-out and acquisition by Ophir Energy and now Octant Energy Corporation will be determine after studying what its agreement says on termination. However given that it has never hit oil in Uganda the pull-out will mean that Uganda will not have to refund any money the oil company spent during its search for oil.

While appearing before the parliamentary ad hoc committee investigating the oil sector last month Dominion Petroleum General Manager Antony Knaggs said the government never asked the oil company for capital gains tax when it was bought off by the UK-based Oil Company Ophir Energy.

MPs have already accused the company of failing to pay taxes and yet claiming recoverable cost. The MPs claimed last month that the UK based company had submitted a recoverable cost bill worth $24m (Shs58b) to the Ministry of Energy.

Uganda presently has six licensed exploration areas also called Blocks. They comprise Pakwach Basin Paara Buliisa Kaiso-Tonya Kingfisher and the Lakes Edward and George Basin. Unlike Lakes Edward and George Basin whose ownership has gained controversy the rest are jointly owned by CNOOC Tullow Oil and Total E & P.

It is not yet clear how much money Octant Energy Corporation has paid for the Block but the company announced in March that it intended to raise up to $65m (Shs163b) to among other things pay for geological exploration and drilling costs for Block 4B.

Mr Bukenya Matovu the communications officer for the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development said they do not care about what the respective firms were saying but government still had a contract with Dominion Petroleum. He said every company selling their rights through transfer of licence would have to pay due taxes to government.",,,,,,

Genesis have rescheduled their The Last Domino? tour for September and October 2021 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The Last Domino? marks Genesis’ first tour in 14 years and will see Tony Banks Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford take to the stage to perform their hits and more.

The tour had been rescheduled to go ahead this April but due to further restrictions and the ongoing pandemic it has been moved again to September and October – with all existing tickets purchased remaining valid. Beyond the “huge amount of uncertainties and unanswered questions that make a tour in April difficult for everyone” the band said in a statement that the decision was also taken as “those planning on attending the shows may not feel comfortable doing so so by moving the tour we can alleviate some of those concerns and in turn that will allow the band and the crew to prepare with less unpredictability and create a show that both the band and fans alike will treasure and enjoy.”

Tony Phil and Mike also said “Well let’s just forget about that last year and focus on 2021 shall we! We can’t wait to finally get this show on the road but we feel the decision to move the tour is the best one for those planning on attending and for us as a band and crew. We hope now we can all relax a little more and focus on the music and having a good night.”

The tour is now scheduled to start in Dublin on the 15th September before moving to Belfast Birmingham Manchester Leeds Newcastle Liverpool Glasgow and wrapping up at London’s O2 venue on the 13th October.

Genesis are one of the world’s biggest selling and most successful bands of all time. They have sold an estimated 100 million albums and have played to sold-out stadiums and arenas all over the world for decades.

Tony Phil and Mike reunited again as a band in 2007 after almost 10 years for the Turn It On Again Tour which went on to be one of the biggest grossing tours on the year playing sold-out stadiums around the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbm9ydGhlcm5saWZlbWFnYXppbmUuY28udWsvdGhlLWxhc3QtbGFzdC1kb21pbm8tdG91ci1kYXRlcy1nZW5lc2lzLXJlc2NoZWR1bGUtZm9yLTIwMjEtdG91ci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Last 'Last Domino?' Tour Dates? Genesis Reschedule For 2021 Tour • Northern Life,"Genesis are hoping it will be third time lucky as they again reschedule their dates for The Last Domino? tour. Phil Collins Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks had originally planned the tour for late last year but as with everyone else’s plans the pandemic intervened. Hopeful of an early resolution they rescheduled for this spring but they have now announced revised dates for September and October 2021 with shows across the North.

The announcement came on 22 January through social media with the message:

“We’re ready but the world isn’t… yet! Genesis are rescheduling their April UK and Irish tour dates for autumn 2021 in light of the ongoing pandemic.”

Existing tickets remain valid and ticket holders will be contacted by their ticket agent. Tickets for all new dates are available by visiting http://www.genesis-music.com/

The tour is set to be Collins Banks and Rutherford’s first live outing together since the globe-trotting sell-out Turn It On Again: The Tour in 2007. Nerve damage has restricted Collins’ ability to play drums although he suggested last year that he is hoping he may be able to spend a limited time behind his kit on the forthcoming tour. “I’m going to do my best to play some bits on the tour” he said. “I’ve got to start thinking seriously but I’ve already worked out what I’m going to do and what songs to play on.”

Genesis will be joined on tour by the band’s long-time guitar and bass player Daryl Stuermer and Collins’ son Nic who turns 20 this year on drums. It seems that Rutherford and Banks were initially reluctant to replace their other long-time ally Chester Thompson with Collins Jnr but agreed after they saw Nic perform with his father at The Royal Albert Hall in 2017.

With fans hoping for a reunion ever since the 2007 tour Mike Rutherford spoke last year about the timing of the forthcoming tour. “I think it’s a natural moment” he said. “Phil’s been out on tour for the last two-and-a-half years and his son Nic has been drumming so it seemed like the natural moment to have a conversation about it. We’re all still good friends we’re all above grass and here we are!”

Genesis are among the biggest selling recording artists of all time and one of Britain’s most internationally renowned bands. They have sold an estimated 100 million albums and have played to sold-out stadiums and arenas all over the world for decades.

The evolution of Genesis is unique their sound developed and progressed throughout their career and the current line-up of Tony Banks Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford remained after the departures of Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett.

Tony Banks Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford

And Then There Were Three (1978) was the first album the band released with the current line-up and included the single Follow You Follow Me which was their first UK top ten and US top 30 single. It proved to be the start of huge commercial global success. The albums Duke (1980) Abacab (1981) Genesis (1983) Invisible Touch (1986) and We Can’t Dance (1991) followed for the trio alongside almost constant global stadium tours cementing the band as one of the most successful of all time.

Banks Collins ans Rutherford reunited again in 2007 after almost 10 years for the Turn It On Again Tour which went on to be one of the biggest grossing tours on the year playing sold-out stadiums around the world.

Genesis have released a short video from their rehearsals as a taster for the upcoming tour.

When the 2020 tour dates were first announced they sold out within 10 minutes and additional dates were quickly added. More dates have been added to the latest 2021 schedule.

This fee may be why,"New York CNN Business —

Late last year some DoorDash customers started getting hit with a puzzling new fee on their order total just before checkout.

The extra roughly $1 to $2 charge was labeled by city. Some people got a “Denver” fee others a “Chicago” one.

Across the country people who ordered delivery through the service were charged more seemingly just for living in those places.

The actual reason for the new fees? In those cities local governments have passed temporary caps that limit how much third-party delivery platforms can charge restaurants to help struggling business. To try to recoup those losses DoorDash has put in new customer fees in cities that have enacted caps including Chicago Cleveland Denver Oakland Philadelphia Portland Seattle St. Louis and a handful of others. (Customers can find the explanation when they click on the fee line before placing their orders).

DoorDash isn’t alone in adding fees. Uber Eats has had a similar customer fee in place since the summer in Portland where the cap is 10% per order.

And over the next few weeks Uber Eats plans to add fees in over a dozen markets including Chicago Minneapolis Boston Washington and Oregon. The fees are $2 on average.

As restaurants struggle to make it through the pandemic they’re fighting back against high commissions charged by delivery platforms — either by looking for alternatives or with the help of legislation. But someone has to pay those fees. Increasingly it’s the consumer.

Reckoning with high commission fees

Before the pandemic many restaurants shied away from third-party delivery services like DoorDash Uber Eats or Grubhub. Those platforms can charge commission fees as high as 30% per order which can leave restaurants in the red.

But now with dining rooms completely closed or open with limited capacity many restaurant operators feel they have to offer delivery or go out of business. With less money coming in the pain of those high commission fees is even greater.

In an effort to help restaurants a number of municipalities enacted commission fee caps. The temporary limits usually around 15% will expire eventually — in some cases after indoor dining has been fully reinstated for two or three months in other cases on a specific date. Some cities that enacted temporary fee caps have already extended them.

Delivery services have taken varying approaches to the caps

DoorDash argues that the fees it gets from restaurants cover its own costs. If they can’t get them from restaurants they have to charge customers instead according to the company.

Uber Eats added a fee to Portland orders in the summer. Shutterstock

“Operating our platform paying and insuring Dashers and ensuring high-quality service can be expensive which is why in many markets where local governments have passed pricing regulations we have begun charging customers a small additional fee” a DoorDash spokesperson told CNN Business in an emailed statement.

Uber echoed a similar sentiment.

“In order to maintain a reliable delivery marketplace we are instituting several temporary local fees in certain US markets” an Uber Eats spokesperson said. “Fees collected by Uber Eats from both merchants and consumers on transactions are what fund our services including maintenance of the app consumer support safety and — most importantly — pay for delivery people.”

Unlike its competitors Grubhub which merged with Seamless in 2013 is not adding explicit fees in cities that have put commission caps in place according to a company spokesperson. Instead it’s using its rivals’ actions to try to lure people to its monthly subscription service Grubhub+ which costs $9.99 per month. In December it said it would offer three months free to people who join the service in Chicago and New York City.

The cost of higher fees

Some restaurant advocates are afraid that the higher fees will drive customers away. “We oppose any additional fees that could potentially dissuade diners from ordering in” said Sam Toia president and CEO of the Illinois Restaurant Association.

There’s good reason to be afraid.

“Consumers are really hesitant to incur any additional fees and costs” on delivery said Jill Failla senior foodservice analyst at Mintel. “Third-party companies need to be really aware of this barrier around consumer fees and need to be really careful about what they’re trying to pass on to the consumer.”

That doesn’t mean that they won’t end up charging more for delivery she said.

Though the pandemic has given them a boost with online ordering surging many of these companies have struggled with profitability.

For now some restaurant operators are saying they haven’t seen any slowdown in orders because of the new fees.

“I haven’t seen a meaningful change in our third-party percentage sale” said Ruth Jones chief financial officer at Maria Empanada a small Colorado-based empanada chain.

The commission caps have been helpful Jones said. But once they go away restaurants will once again face those higher commission fees. When that happens they might have to start charging customer fees themselves. “You’re seeing a lot of restaurants add delivery fees for using the third parties” she said. “We have to continue to try to make money as a business so we have to make choices that make the third party make sense.”

That’s especially the case in an environment where restaurants are struggling to survive.

“Restaurants recovery is going to require above average revenue and margin growth for some time and unfortunately that will mean some higher prices for consumers” said David Henkes senior principal at Technomic. “Ordering delivery has and will continue to get more expensive.”

""We knew fresh tortillas was something missing in Pensacola"" Alden Garcia said. ""Our LLC name is literally 'One Taco At A Time' so we're trying to keep one taco on the menu at all times. And we'll have a breakfast taco on it daily too.""

Alden Garcia said some of his recipes are fusion-style while others are so off-the-wall that he can't even really categorize them.

""I mean I'll put chorizo on a burger that's one of them. We're doing a 'Huevo Roll' which is our take on an egg roll"" Garcia went on. ""It's chorizo cabbage and peppers stuffed into one of our fresh tortillas and made with our homemade duck sauce. We pretty much make everything from scratch.""

Any MI SU meal that doesn't revolve around the mobile truck's own tortillas is otherwise anchored by the buns and bread from Craft Gourmet Bakery.

MI SU plans to spend a lot of time building its brand in Pensacola as a food truck but Garcia said the long-term plan is to eventually open a brick-and-mortar restaurant in the city.

""We want to build ourselves up ride out the pandemic and introduce ourselves to the community first"" Garcia said. ""So (a restaurant) will be way down the line.""

The new truck is located directly behind Salon San Carlos which is just next door to Kalbi Ichiban.

Also in the news are announcements related to an upcoming homebuilding project a new role for a longtime leader in one Gainesville business and accolades for local attorneys.

Here’s a look at this week’s business news:

The Hammocks unveils new apartment renovations

The Hammocks a group of four apartment properties in Gainesville unveiled new renovations to The Hammocks on 20th at a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday.

The Hammocks on 20th 3751 SW 20th Ave. are one of four properties purchased in January 2020 by American Commercial Realty Corp. which has offices in Palm Beach County.

Three other Hammocks properties are located at 3600 Windmeadows Blvd. near Butler Plaza; 3316 SW 41st Place in the Phoenix neighborhood; and 321 NW 21st Lane near Ward’s Supermarket.

Orlando-based Atrium Management has been involved with the properties since last summer.

Upgrades to community amenities furniture and appliances are some of the updates new tenants will notice. The one-story buildings were originally built in the 1970s. Rent for studio and one-bedroom one-bath apartments at The Hammocks on 20th starts at $749.

Rick Baer president of American Commercial Realty said the four Gainesville properties purchased had “good bones” and made for a good investment in the area without the need for entirely new development.

“I believe strongly in the economics of Gainesville” Baer said. “Even with a pandemic and other national recessions that will take place UF and Shands are absolute fixtures that will anchor the community.”

Former Infinite Energy leader in new role

Like everyone working in the NHS I am steeled for a home-grown catastrophe. For no matter how many patients lie on trolleys in corridors how many ambulances sit trapped on hospital forecourts how many photos go viral of toddlers slumped on their parents’ coats receiving oxygen on the floor of a beleaguered A&E nothing ever truly changes. These days the annual NHS “winter crisis” is both dreaded and reliable as clockwork.

The numbers are so large and repeated so frequently they have long been leached of their force: 17000 hospital beds lost since 2010; only 2.5 beds per 1000 people in the UK compared with three times that number in Germany; unfilled vacancies for more than 10000 doctors and 40000 nurses.

NHS staff dread winter because nothing quite curdles the soul like pouring your all into a system at breaking point. Up close the failures of care are the furthest thing from an abstraction. They assail you in the cries and whimpers of elderly patients with dementia abandoned on trolleys in the sourness and sweat of the crumpled sheets in which a patient has just died alone and unnoticed. They come in the form of verbal abuse from relatives at breaking point who turn on the doctors and nurses because we are there the human face of all the underfunded dysfunction. They can make you want to cry or quit. You brush yourself down and carry on.

“How do you think it’s going to be this time round?” a colleague asks me.

“Well we don’t seem to have been on black alert as much as usual” I answer cautiously. “Maybe flu hasn’t hit as badly as people feared?”

For safety reasons – in order to manage surges in demand – hospital bed occupancy should sit below 85%. Yet year round in today’s NHS occupancy is nearer 100%. There is absolutely no spare capacity. The severity of a particular year’s strain of seasonal influenza may thus spell the difference between keeping heads above water or full service implosion. A virus so tiny it requires an electron microscope to be seen can in short bring the NHS behemoth to its knees.

There always has to be a first time. And though intubation is the emblematic procedure of the pandemic this moment this patient this pair of wide and roving eyes is the hospital’s first time. Four people loom around his bed in the semi-darkness swathed in blue plastic masked and gowned disguised behind thick Perspex visors. Normally in an ICU it is the patient who becomes dehumanised punctured and crisscrossed by a cat’s cradle of wires and tubes.

Tonight though it is the doctors and nurses who appear less than human. Veiled behind their protective equipment they hover like ghosts at the bedside preparing nervously to act.

Even in normal times intubation is a serious business. In order to connect a patient via a tube to a ventilator they must first be anaesthetised and then paralysed with drugs. Once the patient is unconscious and limp the intensivist can set about the delicate business of depressing the tongue with a metal blade and steering the tube downwards past the vocal cords and into the trachea. Few procedures in medicine have higher stakes. Losing an airway – failing to access the lungs – leaves a patient entirely helpless immobilised on the edge of suffocation. Most doctors cannot cope with the intensity of managing airways. The pressure is too great the requisite skills too daunting. Those that can – intensive care doctors anaesthetists and emergency medics – earn their colleagues’ utmost respect for possessing nerves of steel.

Even when her blade triggers a spasm of coughing the intensivist maintains her poise. Aerosols of Covid plaster her visor

It’s Sally an intensive care nurse who tells the patient. She takes his hand and leans in close hating the necessity of raising her voice above the layers behind which she is barricaded. “We’re going to put you on a ventilator” she says. “We can give you much more oxygen that way. It’s going to help your breathing.”

His eyes above his mask start to skitter wildly as if searching for something or someone to help him. The machinery bleeps as his blood pressure surges. Sally keeps holding his hand. Over and over the same words to soothe a litany she hopes may offer comfort. “It’s going to be all right. We’re here for you. It’s going to be all right.” But his face is white and bathed in sweat. She’s convinced he can sense the uncertainty somehow intuiting how out of their depth they are the small team that is meant to be saving him.

A hush descends as the intensive care doctor moves into position for the intubation. They are huddled like supplicants around the bed these four staff peering down on one patient. It is intimate to the point of claustrophobia. Even the air they share belongs to them and them alone. For the five are sealed inside a room specially designed to sequester infections its negative pressure drawing in air from outside while clinging to its own contaminated vapours. That air of course reeks of invisible danger. Every surface and every one of the gowns and masks they wear will be thickly coated in particles of coronavirus. As they work each team member is managing the fear that the person whose life they are trying to save may yet be the death of them.

You cannot get much closer than this. The doctor leans over directly above her patient’s now slack and gaping mouth decisively angling her blade downwards. An inch or two more and they could almost be kissing. Normally she would have spent several minutes clutching a mask to her patient’s face to fill their lungs with pure oxygen. It buys time. By elevating blood oxygen levels to nearly 100% it gives a margin of error – five minutes to play with – should something calamitous go wrong. But this time the patient is already on pure oxygen. There is nowhere higher to go. Even worse the moment she takes off his mask to commence the intubation his oxygen saturations will plummet. She knows she has to act lightning-fast.

At her signal the mask is removed. A cacophony. Every alarm shrieking in unison. The patient’s blood oxygen levels are dropping second by second. The monitor reads 80% then 75% then 70% and still the decimals flicker downwards. Even when her blade triggers a spasm of involuntary coughing the intensivist maintains her poise. Aerosols of Covid now plaster her visor. No time to consider that now.

Sally is still gripping her patient’s slack palm. Get it in get the bloody thing in. Sats at 60% now. Dangerously low. This is critical. In a few moments the patient’s heart will stop beating. 55%. It’s looking disastrous. And then those grimly exultant two words – “I’m in!” – and even as the tube is hooked up to the ventilator the patient’s sats are soaring upwards. The whole team collectively exhales.

I am at the hospital after pleading with bosses of the Katharine House Hospice where I work to let me join the hospital team. I cannot bear any longer this feeling of impotence while the country careers into crisis. The only way I know of managing my fears is through action trying to help focusing on one patient and then another and then the one after that. It has been agreed that I can split my role partly working with Covid patients on the wards of the hospital partly caring for our hospice inpatients.

Today in the emergency department (ED) some new recruits have been assembled and I’ve been asked to assist with their hastily arranged induction. The 25 freshest members of the ED team are so young and inexperienced they have yet to qualify as doctors. In the scramble to build capacity for the expected surge in patients Oxford’s medical school has asked its students whether they would like to help. The response has been an overwhelming yes.

I commence an online teaching session from within the ED about death and dying in pandemic times. I try to convey what it looks and sounds like to be dying of Covid. How quickly and remorselessly a patient can be overwhelmed. Which drugs we use to help ease their fear and hunger for air. How hard it is to convey warmth and humanity when trussed up behind a visor and mask. All the while I watch the students’ faces as I try to steer a path between alarming them and supporting them.

One of the students Emma Flint a 24-year-old in her final year finds herself posted on the front doors to the ED. In pairs the students direct patients and paramedics to the appropriate part of the department trying to sift the infected from the benign. Swiftly this sieving and dispatching of patients becomes straightforward. Infinitely harder is the task of vetting the loved ones who accompany the patients here deciding who is permitted to enter and who to send away.

The visitor restrictions are a particular cruelty of Covid. Emma recalls meeting a young woman who arrived at the hospital in the act of having a miscarriage doubled over on the forecourt as her partner endeavoured to keep her upright. Both their faces were white as bone. “I had to explain to them that he couldn’t stay” Emma says.

Once a man appeared at the front doors after being called by the hospital to say that his mother rushed in by ambulance a few hours earlier was now dying from coronavirus inside. His words tumbled out a torrent of beseeching: “I know it’s probably not possible but could you just ask if I might be allowed to see her? Just for a moment. So I can tell her I love her? I just need her to hear that.” Emma disappeared into the Respiratory ED promising to do what she could. She re-emerged forgetting that a smile can’t be seen behind a mask and beamed as she offered to take him to his mother’s bed. He never stopped talking as she helped him into his PPE. “Thank you so much. I can’t tell you it means the world to me that I can be here at the end for my mum.”

Emma took him through the double doors past the beeping monitors and hissing pipes the urgent conversations the bobbing masks. There behind a curtain her hair white and wild lay his mother in a dishevelled hospital gown. Emma found a chair and quietly set it down at the head of the bed. Just before she turned away she saw two eyelids flicker open above the oxygen mask; two hands in blue gloves enclose a gnarled set of fingers moisture glints on the face of a grieving son.

At home I unlock the front door and reach for the hand sanitiser. Before I have even rushed upstairs to the shower – this is Mum’s new routine every night she’s home from work now – Dave appears in the hallway looking stern. “We need to talk” he says.

My mind leaps compulsively to death and disaster. Dave’s parents my mum? Has someone succumbed and been rushed into hospital? “No no” says Dave. “It’s Abbey. We just need to talk.”

As quickly as possible I try to scrub every speck of infection from my skin beneath the shower. I know that on one level I am trying to erase what I have seen and heard and sought to palliate today – yet understand that these experiences whether I like it or not are indelible. Still damp hair dripping I find Dave and he explains what has happened.

“Abbey started to cry Rach” he tells me. “She doesn’t want you to do anything at work that could end up killing you.”

My head slumps into my palms. Finn was two years old when I became a doctor. Abbey was born during my second year of practice. In all that time over and over my children have suffered as the hospital has consumed too many hours just too much of their mother. The anodyne phrase “work-life balance” doesn’t come close to capturing the forcefulness with which medicine clashes with parenthood.

“I’ll talk to her” I mutter to Dave too ashamed to meet his eye. “What I’m doing really isn’t high-risk. ICU is much more dangerous.”

The government gives us a stock of masks for two days. You might as well push a passenger out of a plane with a handkerchief for a parachute

Abbey and I sit on her bed behind closed doors. “Hey” I say gently as she picks at the duvet. “Dad said you got upset today?” Her voice is harsh and hostile completely out of character. “Why do you have to be the one who sees all the coronavirus patients in the hospital? Why can’t it be someone else who doesn’t have children so if they die it isn’t as bad?”

I hesitate. How can I possibly tell her I have volunteered that I want to be the one helping these patients? Yet equally how can I lie to her? I take a deep breath and grope for the right words. I try to articulate the nature of duty in terms a nine-year-old can understand this irresistible tug to use my training to help in a crisis. “Well what about your duty to me? And to Finn?” she asks defiantly.

We reach an uneasy truce when I swear to be as careful as possible avoiding high-risk areas if I can. As a mother I’m not sure I have ever felt shabbier.

Back in the hospice we are preparing to admit our first patients with Covid when Charlie the medical director asks me into his office for a quiet word. “We have a problem” he tells me. “We don’t have anything like enough PPE.”

Under a new government directive any non-hospital clinical setting – be that a care home a general practice or a hospice – has been issued with the same standard PPE pack. It contains a roll of plastic aprons some gloves and a box of 300 paper face masks some of which have a best-before date of 2016. To put the inadequacy of these supplies into sharp relief at the hospice we are estimating a daily requirement of at least 150 masks. The government has provided us with a stock of masks that will last at most for two days. You might as well push a passenger out of a plane with a handkerchief in lieu of a parachute.

“What about the emergency PPE line?” I ask Charlie in confusion. “Haven’t they been able to sort it?”

“We’ve been calling and emailing the Supply Chain all week” Charlie tells me. “Multiple times. You leave messages no one calls you back it’s a disaster.”

I’m so angry I can scarcely breathe. Tears sting at the corners of my eyes.

I send a message to a friend and colleague Dominic Pimenta a London-based doctor who has set up a charity called Heroes aimed at protecting and supporting health and care workers. In a matter of weeks Dom’s charity has raised more than £1m.

My message is distraught:

Dear Dom I’m sorry to bother you when you are probably 1000% too busy but I am desperate…

Dom’s reply is terse: “I’ll see what we can do.”

I try not to feel too crestfallen. I am absolutely certain he will help if he can. That evening though I am distracted. “You keep looking at your phone more than us” complains an indignant Abbey.

When my phone rings I lunge for it. Dom has indeed – you absolute legend – been quietly at work behind the scenes.

“I’ve sorted it. We will deliver 1000 masks to your hospice tomorrow morning.”

I literally burst into tears on the phone.

At the hospice soon afterwards I meet Susan Price who at the age of 53 received the news that her breast cancer had recurred and reacted with characteristic defiance. “Right. Come on then let’s get the bastard” she said to her oncologist in late 2019.

Chemotherapy was duly planned for the start of February 2020. “At least that was the plan” she tells me wryly. “But then very softly to begin with Covid began rearing its head.”

‘You think the NHS will always be there for you but then the coronavirus comes along and it all falls apart like dust' Hospice patient

Susan quickly intuited precisely where she stood in the pandemic’s patient hierarchy. “Here I was a middle-aged woman dying from metastatic cancer. I wasn’t the cute child or the vibrant 20-year-old who would have everything thrown at them. I was very low down the list. I was the lowest priority.”

As I listen to Susan I find myself wincing. No doctor wants to be part of a system that does its utmost for some patients yet casts others aside. But Covid has overturned everything.

Despite her best efforts at shielding she develops a persistent cough and has difficulty breathing. Increasingly she finds herself fighting for air. Terrified that she has caught Covid she dials 999. For a moment when they arrive in full PPE the paramedics appear on the brink of taking her to hospital. Then she mentions she is on palliative chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. Suddenly everything changes. “In normal circumstances we’d take you in” the paramedics tell her. “But there’s Covid in there. It would be much better for someone like you to stay at home.”

Someone like you. “I believed I was effectively being told not to waste NHS resources. I felt as though someone had opened a bin and just chucked me in it” Susan says.

Further conversations with her oncologist lead her to make the sombre decision to abandon chemotherapy which is doing little to arrest the growth of her tumours while causing ever more debilitating symptoms. Now there is nothing standing between Susan and dying. Cut off at home in isolation with her family she starts to feel overwhelmed with pain and fear. “I was terrified.”

Eventually Susan’s family call the paramedics again and this time she is admitted to hospital. In her distraught dehydrated and desperate state it feels she says “like being dropped into Hades”. Blood leaks from the numerous puncture marks on her arms where a doctor has attempted and failed to cannulate her. Anonymous staff in PPE rush past. Screams and moans split the air. This is where I’m going to die she thinks to herself.

When I meet her for the first time it is several days after her transfer from the hospital to the hospice. She still appears wan and haunted by fear but both her mood and symptoms have begun to improve. Through tiny acts of thoughtfulness – fresh jugs of iced water little servings of ice-cream – the staff are managing to repair her shattered trust. I find it hard to hear Susan’s reflections on how Covid has transformed her experience of healthcare. “You think the NHS will always be there for you. You think it is this whole incredible edifice but then coronavirus comes along and it all falls apart like dust.”

A part of me longs not to share those words here. I am so intensely proud of everything that NHS and care staff have managed at such risk to themselves to achieve for their patients. Highlighting any mid-pandemic shortcomings feels almost like an act of betrayal. But when I look in Susan’s eyes at their intelligence and clarity I know I do not have a choice.

When I happen to pull into our drive at eight o’clock in the evening of the last Thursday in March I’m bewildered to find Dave Finn and Abbey lining up on the doorstep. The idea of an impromptu ovation to express thanks to key workers has largely passed me by. But then as I open the car door applause begins to ripple and rise from my neighbours’ doorsteps. Dave stares straight at me grinning and clapping. Finn is belting his hockey stick against the wall. Abbey smashes a spoon on a saucepan. The entire village it seems is whooping and cheering yelling “N – H – S!” and letting rip this most thunderous of thank yous to the nurses the bus drivers the cleaners the porters the shelf-stackers the doctors the delivery drivers the checkout staff the police officers the paramedics the teachers the carers and all of the other key workers who are out there amid the virus braving Covid for the sake of others playing their part to keep their neighbours safe and well.

And honestly I could fall to my knees at the sound. Its kindness and sweetness and community spirit overwhelm me with raw gratitude of my own. I stand on the asphalt open-mouthed tears streaming. All these people this passion this trenchant solidarity. It is the loveliest cacophony in the world.",,,

DUK,Duke Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNTkzMDYyNi9kdWtlLWVuZXJneS1seW5uLWdvb2QtYmlkZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Energy CEO on Working With Joe Biden on Climate Change,"(Miss this week’s Leadership Brief? This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning Jan. 24; to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

We might finally get infrastructure week. The election of Joe Biden and the subsequent twin Senate election victories in Georgia which gave Democrats a narrow majority in both houses of Congress have raised hopes that the next four years will see substantial investment in renewable energy storage technology and electric-vehicle infrastructure. Tactically Biden’s approach is to link green investment to job creation and economic recovery: Earn union-level wages making solar panels! And independent of federal policy there is both growing consumer demand and private-sector investment in more sustainable products as evidenced by Tesla’s $800 billion market cap.

For more than a decade Duke Energy one of the nation’s largest power generators has been working to wean itself off coal in favor of cleaner sources of energy. Since 2005 Duke has reduced its carbon emissions by 39% retiring 51 coal-fired power plants in the process and becoming a major operator of solar farms in eastern North Carolina and elsewhere. It recently completed installing 530 charging stations in Florida part of a plan to establish a corridor of stations throughout the region it serves. Still the company says it will face significant challenges in ramping up to produce enough green energy to power the homes and industries in its six-state operating area (Florida the Carolinas Ohio Kentucky Indiana). The company says it will require getting nearly 30% of its power from technologies that are yet to be invented to meet its target of becoming a net-zero producer of carbon by 2050. The remaining power will be generated by renewables (40%) and nuclear (30%). Developing such breakthrough technologies will require a national effort to “supercharge R&D investment” says Duke CEO Lynn Good.

For all its focus on greener forms of power Duke Energy is still dealing with its legacy as a big coal consumer. In fact Duke has up-close experience with Biden’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency Michael S. Regan who has been serving as the head of North Carolina’s department of environmental quality. In January 2020 Regan reached a settlement with Duke for the cleanup of nearly 80 million tons of coal ash at six Duke facilities in North Carolina. Coal ash which is created when coal is burned to create electricity contains mercury cadmium and arsenic and without proper management these contaminants can pollute waterways groundwater drinking water and the air. It was the largest coal-ash cleanup in the nation’s history. At the time Regan said “We are holding Duke accountable and will continue to hold them accountable for their actions as we protect public health the environment and our natural resources.” Good said the settlement “is a reasonable commonsense approach that protects people and the environment while keeping costs in check as much as possible to benefit our customers.”

Good recently joined TIME for a video conversation to discuss the new Administration the challenges of energy storage and what it’s like when protesters build a fracking tower on your front lawn.

(This interview with Duke Energy CEO Lynn Good has been condensed and edited for clarity.)

How has the recent election changed the timetable of your goals?

As I look at the Biden Administration climate is their top priority. It’s important to them. It’s important to us. We’re well-positioned and we’ll be looking for ways to work with the Administration and the new Congress to accelerate and advance our plans in the interest of our customers.

Are there specific areas where you think you know the timetable can really accelerate?

Renewable deployment is going to be a part of the story. We are spending a lot of time talking about the need for investment in new technologies whether it’s longer-duration storage or hydrogen advanced nuclear carbon capture. Because as we look at the next three decades we need some new technologies in order to get to net-zero.

Are we at a tipping point?

Movement around carbon reduction and incentivizing investment is not just a federal matter it’s a state matter. States are moving. Customers are demanding it. There’s momentum from a number of different places.

I was surprised to learn that North Carolina is the No. 2 solar producer in the country. Is that because the sun always shines in North Carolina or is this policy?

It has been primarily driven by policy tax incentives. A lot of federal incentives really spurred that development.

And there’s a lot of days of sunshine in the state?

The challenges in North Carolina are not around sunshine; there’s plenty of it. It’s the way electricity is used in the state. We are a winter-peaking utility which means the highest demand for electricity is on winter mornings—January February 7 a.m. There is no solar then. So we have some things we’re working through on how to match the renewable resource with the time that people actually use the power. We still use resources that we can turn on when we need them which is natural gas and other things. An example of this would be if it’s sunny on a Sunday afternoon in January and I know that it’s gonna be 15° on Monday morning I may not be able to store enough power in order to meet that need on Monday morning. And I further have to think about is it gonna be sunny enough on Monday to recharge the batteries? And so I’m making decisions on whether or not I need to ramp up some other form of generation to get me through Monday prepare me for Tuesday prepare me for Wednesday because our customers don’t want intermittent power.

Let’s talk about storage the holy grail for the energy industry. Someone in solar said it’s one of the few modern industries that can’t store the product it makes. What improvements do you anticipate in the future?

We have a lot of planned investment in storage about $500 million [over 15 years] in various storage resources. We are still looking though for something that can move energy and store energy longer than hours. We need some more science and R&D and research and technologies for it to truly be the holy grail. Because I don’t think the holy grail is moving it from 2 in the afternoon to 5. It might be to move it from you know a sunny day on Jan. 5 to Jan. 20 when we have an extended period where it’s cloudy. So that longer-duration storage is really where we’re focused from a 2030s and 2040s standpoint.

So there’s sort of incremental improvements under way but the storage game changer is still to be invented?

To be developed.

How reliant are you on technologies that don’t currently exist today to meet your carbon-reduction goals?

We have a clear line of sight on how to get to 2030 with existing technology. When you get in the 2030s and 2040s that’s where it becomes a little bit more complex because I don’t know if I’m gonna be choosing nuclear or carbon capture or long-duration storage or … and so making that prediction of what it’s going to look like in 2050 will depend a lot on what technologies develop. We are not prepared to say it’s going to be a future of 100% renewables. Because as the person who has to make it work we don’t know how to make that work today.

Our customers don’t want intermittent power. - Array

So about half of your energy currently comes from nuclear plants?

Right. We are strong advocates for nuclear power. If you look at the Carolinas in particular we have six nuclear power plants that provide 50% of the power for this region. It’s carbon-free it runs all the time. So you turn a nuclear plant on many of them run for two years without interruption. You refuel them every two years. We’re also working with TerraPower on advanced nuclear that has storage capabilities as part of their design.

I read a letter to the editor in your local paper that was headlined “I protested in Lynn Good’s driveway and here’s why.” That sounds like quite a day.

I completely respect different voices in the conversation and the fact that not everyone’s going to agree with everything we do. We are very active engaging with stakeholders from the environmental community from various customer groups because we want to hear what they have to say. When it comes to my home though I probably like it a little bit less. They had built a structure—it was a fracking tower—and actually brought it in on kind of a trailer-type thing.

In the end your company ended up canceling the pipeline that was under consideration that was being protested. So part of the objection was it went over a portion of the Appalachian Trail is that correct?

It didn’t go over it it went under—700 ft. under entering on private land under the trail exiting on private land. There are 56 pipelines that run under the Appalachian Trail.

How has your residential vs. commercial/industrial mix been affected by work from home and the economic slowdown related to COVID shutdowns?

Workers are at home. Our residential load has been up 4% to 5%. The decline in commercial/industrial has been much greater than the increase in residential so we project to be down 3% overall in 2020.

We are not prepared to say it’s going to be a future of 100% renewables. - Array

Describe your investments to help develop the electric-vehicle industry.

To take away that concern about how am I going to charge my car we have been active in trying to put charging infrastructure in place in our states to really spur adoption. So we put in 530 [charging stations] in our service territory in Florida. We just have approval for a pilot in South Carolina. We just got approval for doing so in North Carolina. We’re trying to create corridors of charging infrastructure. Transportation is a larger carbon emitter than electricity. And so if we can get cars off the road that are combustion engines and put them into the electric category then our carbon reductions will further the carbon reductions in the transportation sector.

New topic. In September the Wall Street Journal reported that NextEra made an unsolicited takeover proposal for your company in a deal valued at $60 billion. Are there any ongoing talks?

So no comment Eben on market rumors. That has been our long-standing practice.

What’s the most vexing problem that you’re wrestling with right now?

I’m excited about a future where we have a clear vision of where we’re trying to go. But anyone who has a clear vision also has obstacles along the way. Those obstacles might look like there’s a simple way to do it when you know there isn’t a simple way. I want to get to net-zero by 2050; there are a lot of choices you have to make.

And so I have some stakeholders who want me to close everything tomorrow and build renewables. They don’t care much about the price because they’re strongly motivated by the environmental benefit. And then I’ve got customers who are on fixed income who will say to me “I cannot afford one more dollar. Not one more dollar.” And so I have to find a way to get those opposing points of view different points of view put together to develop a plan I can execute.

I can’t keep letting price go up forever. But I also can’t stand on the sidelines and not improve the environmental footprint. So that’s where the complexity comes and executing the clear vision trying to find the right pace the right timing the right trade-offs building support for the decisions you have to make. Because the execution is very hard.

I love hearing from readers. Please write me at leadership@time.com. Question: In terms of reducing your carbon footprint what changes have you made in the pandemic that you think will be enduring? For instance do you think you will fly more or less after things “return to normal”?

This past week a Choice Maintenance employee came to my home to trim and clean up landscaping. He apologized for being 20 minutes late. I told him it was fine. He went on to say that he was late because he found a women’s cell phone and wallet at the entry gate of our village. Apparently she had the items on her lap and when she opened her car door to press the button they dropped outside on to the ground. He spent time tracking her down and returned her items. The woman had just been to the bank and had over $800 in her wallet.

Many of us know that the people who work around our homes are not well paid. This man did the right thing. The woman wanted to give him a reward but he refused. I was quite taken by his honesty and asked him his name. His name is Frank Mazzacane.

I told him it was good to hear this story particularly with all we are dealing with right now. He said it was good to show that some people will do the right thing. In the future I plan to talk to people who work at our home and at least know their name. I just want to thank Frank for his good deed and for his honesty.

Here the two companies with their combined know-how have displayed why flexo as a print process is a technology to reckon with.



This Sunday Column finds out how the calendar production was well put together

Flexo a process long considered second to offset and gravure has made strident progress. DuPont a formidable force in the flexo plate and platemaking technologies has upped the ante. It has a long history of continuous innovation for flexo plates and platemaking systems to deliver high quality and high precision.

DuPont’s drive to push the flexo print process further made the company to explore printing its annual calendar using the technology it was far too familiar with. Two years ago it collaborated with two of its long-term partners Bengaluru-based companies – iTek Packz and Veepee Graphic Solutions to produce calendars using flexography.

The collaborators

When ITW Signode decided to sell the folding carton business about 20% of the Wintek business along with 60 employees engaged in the business the second generation of the Wintek owners who were also employees of ITW Signode after the acquisition decided to buy it. In 2013 a partial team exited ITW and formed iTek Packz.

iTek started with a six-colour sheetfed press doing folding cartons. Gopi Ballarwad who looks after the commercial part of the folding carton business says Gassali one of the partners who was sound with the flexo technology wondered why iTek could not produce folding cartons on flexo. “In 2016 we visited a folding carton specialist in Manchester United Kingdom. The company printed short-run job orders of 500 and 1000 cartons on its Edale flexo press. We were impressed with the business model and decided to invest in the press.”

iTek’s flexo journey began with the installation of Edale FL5 flexo press in February 2017. It was a 10-colour flexo press with inline cold foiling lamination and die-cutting units capable of running at a maximum speed of 200 m/min and print on substrates as thin as a 12-micron shrink sleeve film to 650-micron paperboard. “While doing the trials we found we could produce quality cartons quickly and we could do the embellishments all in one go.” In September 2019 the company installed a second Edale FL3 flexo press a nine-colour configuration to boost its label printing capability.

Veepee Graphic Solutions the other DuPont collaborator in the calendar project is among the top three flexo platemaking trade shops in India. Veepee is a process-oriented pre-press house. Everything has a standard operating procedure (SOP) which you usually don’t find in trade shops – be it flexo offset or gravure.

The flexo pre-press specialist has been a DuPont customer since 1998. “We have been DuPont loyalists for over two decades” says P Jaichandra managing director at Veepee which recently installed DuPont’s Cyrel Fast 2000TD solvent-less processor the only trade shop using the device and also rolled out DuPont’s new Cyrel Easy EFXR plates.

Going a level higher

The first two editions of the DuPont calendar were well received by the industry.

This time the theme was “Dances of the world”. Dance being an expression of the soul has multiple emotions it is a combination of art culture and joy. Images were chosen based on printability and global appeal.

This was not like a regular job for us says Jaichandra. The design planned had quite a few embellishments. “With a normal four-colour print anyone can make the calendar look different or I’d even say outstanding. But here we focused on complementing the images through embellishments.”

The design and prepress took a good one month from the day Veepee received the images from DuPont till the first final print. Each and every single image was individually worked upon. Jaichandra says “We were given an open hand to decide what exactly we wanted for the images.”

Jaichandra adds “We began with profiling the press for this particular substrate [ITC’s virgin board]. We had done the profiling of the press and the substrate for the past two calendars but then DuPont wanted to print 2021 calendars with the soon to be launched Cyrel Easy EFXR plates. Hence we created a new profile.”

From the design files to working on Adobe Photoshop the separations were accurately generated including a complex white colour. “We produced the plate with a screening of 150 lpi to create the finest image reproduction. We have played around with varnishes overcoating and also with foil” explains Jaichandra.

The EFXR plates were processed on the Fast 2000TD solvent-less processor. “When we did the fingerprint using the substrate we found the ink lay with the EFXR plate was better than the solvent processed DuPont plates which we usually consume. This was a pleasant surprise because with the solvent plates we have to get into the nitty-gritty of improving the ink lay. This was the first time we didn’t have to do it” remarks Jaichandra.

Cut to printing

iTek Packz printed calendars on the Edale FL5 which Ballarwad says has enabled his company to win numerous international awards owing to its print quality notably among them is the Flexographic Technical Association (FTA) New York USA.

The 16-page calendar was printed on ITC’s virgin board. Barring the two-colour month and date which was sheetfed printed seven-colour flexo printing – CMYK plus orange green violet (OGV) and white. Each of the calendar pages were decorated with different embellishments like cast and cure texture gloss and matte varnish foil and drip off.

Ballarwad says “Every other page is treated with a different set of embellishments depending on how the design has to be accentuated. For example the first month January 2021 has Bharatanatyam as the theme. It has a silver foil CMYK OGV plus white drip-off and gloss varnish. The white here is used uniquely. It is printed such that it gives the image additional opacity where required in the design.”

iTek used CMYK UV OGV UV and varnish inks from various ink manufacturers. For iTek it was also the first time it was printing a job using the new EFXR plates.“Printing halftones with the new plates was a new experience. We could produce high-density print with very fine dots” says Ballarwad giving the DuPont EFXR plates his stamp of approval.

iTek has been constantly pushing the boundaries of flexo print process. Ballarwad explains “While the cartons we have sent for awards did have embellishments it’s our ability to produce halftone and dot quality that has earned us the recognition at FTA Awards for three consecutive years.”

Both Veepee and iTek have a common strategy – invest in the right equipment and technology harness it and get the best out of it.

The two Bengaluru companies and their supplier DuPont have been working together to take flexo print process a notch higher each time. The flexo printed DuPont calendars are a result of such efforts showcasing flexo technology to be capable of competing in mono carton or board printing which can open new avenues for the industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2RheS5jby50dC8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L3N0ZWZvbi1kdS1wb250LWJyaW5ncy1oaWdoLWVuZC1tZW5zd2Vhci10by10dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stefon Du Pont brings high-end menswear to TT,"Stefon Du Pont brings high-end menswear to TT

Stefon Du Pont founder of The Gentleman's Place TT. -

From a young age Stefon Du Pont has had a love of fashion. But over the years he was continually disappointed in the local selection of menswear.

As a result the 28-year-old created his own menswear company – Andre Bernard’s The Gentleman’s Place TT – which sells international formal and casual high-end menswear from Turkey Italy and the US. Andre Bernard is his pseudonym for the fashion house.

There he provides two- and three-piece suits tuxedos blazers polo shirts jeans shoes and men’s accessories including brands such as Kenneth Cole Reactions Calvin Klein Perry Ellis Brooks Brothers and Ralph Lauren.

“Attaining high-end clothing in the Caribbean has been a problem for most men. If it is of good quality then the prices are exorbitant and if we want reasonably priced suits we always have to compromise quality. That’s why a lot of persons don’t enjoy their overall shopping experience. We are here to change that system.”

The company was officially started in June 2020 on the social media platform Instagram. Clients would contact the company on social media through direct message or email. They would indicate the colours they were looking for and Du Pont would send them pictures of different options. The clients would then choose one and let him know their size. If the item was not in stock he would order it and when it arrived the client would meet one of his tailors for a fitting.

However on January 8 Du Pont launched a physical space – a consultation office – at 59 Eastern Main Road Arouca. He staged his first fashion show virtually a week later on January 16.

“Because there was such a great demand and a lot more clients are flooding in we created a consultation office. I think in TT we associate legitimacy with a physical space and we wanted to reassure customers that we are here to provide a proper legitimate service.”

He said The Gentleman’s Place was not a walk-in store but a clothing experience. Clients could make an appointment for a consultation at his office where they would discuss colour the right type of suit for the occasion design material and size.

Designs include solid plaid windowpane slim fit classic modern fit single or double breasted while the materials include wool velvet linen techno-stretch and more. Also sizes start from small to XXL.

The suit is then ordered and a fitting is arranged with a professional tailor when the suit arrives so as to make alterations to give a perfect fit.

The Gentleman’s Place also gives grooming and dressing advice including styling tips on how to use a pocket square the type of tie that matches the body size and the best shoes for a particular suit. It also encourages colour blocking and the use of patterns while maintaining a classic look.

Du Pont told Sunday Newsday as a pre-teen his parents regularly took him to events where formal wear was mandatory. That developed into a love for formal wear and an interest in designs patterns quality material and proper fit.

When he started shopping for himself the suits he bought never lasted very long because of the inferior quality material. For example the colours faded quickly the material tore easily and buttons popped off.

However he did his best with what was available and eventually people started calling him “dapper” or “GQ.”

At that point he did not want to wear what everyone else had. It would annoy him when he went to an event and two or three other people would have on the same shirt since there were certain brands most people bought due to the lack of variety available locally.

He started doing his own research and when he travelled he purchased suits for himself. Soon friends began asking him to shop for them.

“When I came home and wore the suits a lot of people would ask ‘Where did you get that suit tie shirt? It made me realise we really do have a problem locally and it wasn’t just an issue for me. That propelled me to find suits to provide the variety that the European and American brands offer.”

His friends always appreciated his choices and that gave him the confidence to expand to providing men’s wear to the general public. So he founded Andre Bernard’s The Gentleman’s Place TT.

“2020 was a year of uncertainty but we took this step during the pandemic to really make our mark in the clothing industry. The amazing thing is it was propelled a lot faster than we thought with micro-weddings and engagements happening and the general public going back out to work slowly. People were using it as an opportunity to update their wardrobes so when everybody is able to go back out to work in full force they would have new and fresh clothes to head out with.”

From the beginning the majority of his clients were grooms and groomsmen. He therefore reached out to a luxury event planner and designer company – The Luxury Umbrella Agency – for a partnership where The Gentlemen’s Place would be their preferred recommendation for its grooms and he would recommend the agency to his grooms.

Du Pont works full time and was nervous about starting his own business. However he had conversations with friends family and social media influencers who all encouraged him to do it. He did and was surprised and delighted by the response.

“The only way to attempt a business is just to do it. We could procrastinate as long as we want but to see the outcome and get the benefits you need to start. I wish I did it earlier. I would recommend that people not be afraid and just go for your dreams.”",,,

Gone are the bewildering days of the Coronavirus Pandemic when executives’ salaries and bonuses felt the shocking tinge of the ensuing economic downtown. Now a number of American companies including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase acknowledge that stressed-out executives cannot reinstate the business to its pre-Pandemic glory days for partial pay.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman’s pay in 2020 was $33 million for steering the Wall Street firm without axing jobs despite the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Gorman’s salary is a phenomenal 22% raise for a year in which the investment bank generated record revenue announced two megabillion dollar acquisitions and successfully avoided one of the worst pandemic-led recession.

James Gorman gets 22% salary raise in 2020

Here’s how much James Gorman made in total compensation during fiscal year 2020 according to a securities filing on Friday. James Gorman’s salary ($33 million) is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a deferred equity award of $7.875 million; a cash bonus of $7.845 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $15.75 million.

Two-thirds of Gorman’s stock award is tied to how well he steers through the pandemic-recession over the next few years.

The Morgan Stanley executive was paid $27 million for his work in 2019.

Morgan Stanley’s directors based Gorman’s pay raise on the investment firm’s record financial performance in 2020 and Gorman’s progress in implementing the bank’s long-term strategy it said.

Bank’s profit crushes pandemic gloom

Under his leadership Morgan Stanley produced full-year net revenue of $48.2 billion compared with $41.4 billion a year ago. It largely benefited from the market’s swift recovery from the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

“The firm produced a very strong quarter and record full-year results with excellent performance across all three businesses and geographies” CEO James Gorman said in a statement adding that the bank’s long-term strategy with the acquisitions of E*Trade and Eaton Vance “serve us well.

Unlike other American banks Morgan Stanley was an active name in M&A activity throughout the year. Gorman negotiated two back-to-back deals to acquire E*Trade Financial Corp. and Eaton Vance Corp. strengthening the firm’s presence in retail stock trading and investment management respectively.

Early in 2020 the bank announced it would buy E*Trade for $13 billion launching Morgan Stanley into the low-cost brokerage space and adding 5 million new customers. This was the largest acquisition deal made by a bank since the financial crisis.

In October Gorman announced a $7 billion acquisition of Eaton Vance making Morgan Stanley one of the world’s biggest asset managers almost doubling its assets under management to an astounding $1.2 trillion.

Shares of Morgan Stanley rose by 34% in 2020 and are up another 8% so far in 2021 outpacing the S&P 500 Index on both counts.

James Gorman’s salary in 2020 was $1.5 million more than that of rival JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon who has been the highest-paid bank executive for past several years.

A Nepalese restaurant and takeaway in Long Eaton has been forced to close temporarily after staff tested positive for coronavirus.

Mount Gurkha Spice on Tamworth Road took to their Facebook page with the news saying that they will be ""quarantining for ten days"" and the business wont be able to open ""until further notice"".

The eatery apologised to customers and said it will reopen after the isolation period and once their test result comes back negative.

The post reads: ""Dear customers as of today we need to go to quarantine for 10 days so we wont we able to open until further notice.

""We will reopen once we pass the quarantine period and our test result comes negative.

""We are very sorry for the inconvenience it may have caused and wish you all to take care and stay safe.""

The restaurant has turned solely to takeaways during lockdown and as comments on their online posts would suggest they will be missed by customers during their closure.

Mount Gurkha Spice is rated excellent by TripAdvisor and also has a five star food hygiene rating.

Derbyshire Live has attempted to contact the restaurant for further comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlcmJ5dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvZGVyYnktbmV3cy9zdGFsa2Vycy1kcnVnLXRha2Vycy10aGlldmVzLXdoby00ODk3NTM40gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVyYnl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY28udWsvbmV3cy9kZXJieS1uZXdzL3N0YWxrZXJzLWRydWctdGFrZXJzLXRoaWV2ZXMtd2hvLTQ4OTc1MzguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stalkers drug takers and thieves who have been in the courts,"Something went wrong please try again later.

It could be a scam

Agriculture officials in California and other states issued warnings about unsolicited shipments of foreign seeds and advised people not to plant them.

Agriculture officials in California and other states issued warnings about unsolicited shipments of foreign seeds and advised people not to plant them.

NEW YORK -- Most people who buy things online just have to worry about their deliveries being delayed or never arriving. But some people are dealing with a different problem altogether: getting weird stuff like hair clippers face creams and sunglasses they never even ordered at all.

The Federal Trade Commission and cyber experts have been warning consumers about these deliveries which can be part of something known as ""brushing"" scams.

Here's how these scams work: Third-party sellers on Amazon eBay and other online marketplaces pay people to write fake positive reviews about their products or do it themselves. To be able to post the reviews these so-called ""brushers"" need to trick the site into making it appear that a legitimate transaction took place. So they'll use a fake account to place gift orders and address them to a random person whose name and address they find online. Then instead of actually mailing the item for which they want to post a review the brushers will send a cheap often lightweight item that costs less to ship.

Sending an item (even the wrong one) creates a tracking number and when the package is delivered it enables brushers to write a verified review. If you're on the receiving end you usually aren't charged for the purchase and your real account isn't hacked - but you are left in the dark as to who is repeatedly sending the mystery packages. In many cases there's no return address. You don't need to worry that anything bad has happened to you or will happen to you if you get a package that might be part of a brushing scam experts say. But we all need to be concerned about the scams affecting reviews we rely on when buying products.

Brushing scams reportedly took off on e-commerce sites in China around five years ago. They resurfaced in headlines last summer when all 50 states issued warnings about mysterious unsolicited packages of seeds that people across the nation received in the mail.

But it's not just seeds. Unsuspecting recipients have also found boxes with goods ranging from dog pooper-scoopers to power cords to soap dispensers on their doorsteps.

Jen Blinn of Thousand Oaks California told CNN Business she has been receiving random packages since June including most recently a briefcase a backpack a hair straightener and a coffee-cup warmer.

""Every two weeks...I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered"" she said. Blinn notified Amazon of the issue but a customer service agent ""didn't really understand what I was saying. She obviously didn't know about it"" she said. The agent looked at Blinn's account and found nothing wrong with it.

It's not illegal to send customers unordered merchandise. But ""the [ Federal Trade Commission ] has long gone after marketers that use fake reviews"" said David Vladeck a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection and a law professor at Georgetown University.

Amazon says its policy prohibits sellers sending unsolicited merchandise to customers and that sellers can be removed from the site for doing so.

""Third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and we take action on those who violate our policies including withholding payments suspending or removing selling privileges or working with law enforcement"" an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Amazon would not say how how many brushing scams have been found on the site or how many sellers have been removed due to these scams.

An eBay spokesperson said in an email that brushing schemes ""do not appear to be highly prevalent"" on the site. It violates eBay policy to send unsolicited merchandise to customers or falsify reviews and can result in eBay restricting sellers' accounts or suspending them from the site.

Experts also say it's difficult to quantify the frequency of such scams because it can be hard for companies to know whether reviews are fake and scams often go unreported by consumers.

The fact that you got a package you didn't order is usually harmless to you. The harm is to people who rely on reviews when deciding on a purchase said Chris McCabe a former policy enforcement investigator at Amazon tasked with stopping scams and fraud. He is now a consultant to sellers on the site.

""The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews because they might see 100 positive reviews and then there may only be 60 or 70 of them that are legitimate"" he said.

The likelihood that a consumer will buy a product that has five reviews is 270% higher than the likelihood they will buy a product with zero reviews according to a 2017 report by Northwestern University's Spiegel Research Center.

Some fake reviews are also being driven by Facebook groups where sellers offer buyers money if they write positive product reviews said McCabe. Amazon and Facebook should work together to crack down on these groups he said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company analyzes more than 10 million reviews every week to try to keep fake ones from being published and that it provides details of its investigations to social media companies ""so they can stop these bad actors from abusing their platforms.""

A Facebook spokesperson said in an email that when the company is told of groups that may encourage fake reviews it reviews them and removes them if they violate its policies.

Unwanted sheets and Shiatsu massagers

For consumers the unexpected deliveries can be jarring. The packages Ashanté Nicole never ordered started arriving at her home in Fort Lauderdale Florida in 2019.

iPhone and portable car chargers. An iPad case. A heated shiatsu massage. A nail cleaning brush and a blow dryer. Sheets. A mattress cover. A floppy fish toy.

They didn't have return addresses so Nicole wasn't sure who was sending the packages. She reached out to Amazon to try to stop them from coming but they still keep arriving at her doorstep.

""It was just kind of a little bit concerning because I don't know who has my information"" she said. ""I don't know what they're going to send me. Like they could send something illegal and then I'm in trouble because I didn't know whoever that person was or what they were sending me.""

If you get merchandise you didn't order it could mean that scammers have created an account in your name or taken over your account an FTC spokesperson said in an email. Scammers may have even created new accounts in other names tied to your address allowing them to post lots of seemingly-real reviews.

""We recommend keeping an eye on your online shopping accounts. If you spot activity that isn't yours report it to the site right away and think about changing your password for that site"" the spokesperson said.

Nicole feels she has done all she can by alerting Amazon each time unsolicited packages from the retailer arrive at her doorstep.

""There's literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn't really done much"" she said.

Amazon declined to comment directly on Nicole and Blinn's accounts but said if a customer receives a package that was unsolicited they should contact Amazon's customer service team.

Nicole said she hopes Amazon will do more to stop brushing and ban sellers who participate in the scams.

""I just think they need to be a little bit more concerned with shutting those stores down and making sure those sellers can't use the platform.""

This Panther Pink muscle car is looking for a new owner.

It’s no secret that Dodge was at its prime when it came to color options in the 1960s. You’ve got your classic Plum Crazy Purple and Sassy Grass but there is one lesser-known color that pops out like a shark on dry land. The color I am referring to of course is Panther Pink - that's right one of Dodge's most outstanding colors is one you would never expect.

This infamous car is known by many to be one of the most insane and powerful muscle cars of its time and is still one of the most coveted pieces of any collector's dream. How could it not be? This particular beast is sporting the infamous magnum V8 pushing some serious power numbers and with such an interesting color scheme this car appears to jump right out of the screen.

The chrome trim contrasting off of that Panther Pink paint job creates a contrast like no other. Just watching the way that the light seems to bend around the wrap-around bumper sends chills down the spine of any on-lookers lucky enough to find themselves in the presence of this wild child. The car originally came in that Sassy Green mentioned previously however the panther pink seemed a better match for this particular speed demon. At that point the car was only missing one thing that classic 60s muscle car prerequisite a vinyl top of course.

eBay has revealed the average prices that some common items can sell for on its website

The places you might normally look to to get rid of your used goods - auction rooms second-hand shops and car boot sales to name a few - are closed due to the pandemic.

However there are still plenty of ways to make cash from your old clutter by selling it online.

Selling on eBay

The well-known auction site has just revealed the average prices that some common items command helping sellers to get an idea of what is worth listing.

Fitness equipment was one of the categories that could net sellers the most money.

Bikes sold for an average of £194.88 while weights sold for £42.03 and tennis rackets £43.01.

Selling used furniture could also bring in hundreds of pounds. An old sofa sold for £151.44 on average while a dining table brought in £123.14. Smaller items such as photo frames and candlesticks sold for more than £10 each.

Old pieces of technology also proved lucrative items to list.

Laptops sold for £215.65 on average while mobile phones sell for £107.93 and games consoles for £107.56.

Ebay's head of pre-loved Emma Grant said: 'With much of the UK plunged into another lockdown we anticipate more people looking to declutter for a fresh start and as an opportunity to make some extra cash.

'There is a big appetite for pre-loved items. As Brits looked to bag a bargain three secondhand purchases were made every second in 2020 with over 7 million used items sold on eBay UK during the month of January alone.'

To start selling on eBay create a free account and make a listing. You pay a fee to eBay when you sell your item which is usually 10 per cent of the final transaction value.

EBAY'S TIPS FOR A TOP LISTING 1. Key words are key - Use things that people would search for such as brand and product names 2. Choose the right category - For example if you are selling children's clothes sell in the children's fashion category rather than just fashion 3. Pictures are important - Take them in natural light with a neutral backdrop 4. Be as detailed as possible - Note any wear and tear and describe things that can't be seen in the image such as the feel or fit of clothes 5. Be realistic with pricing - Search for similar items to make sure you're going for the right price and ask yourself 'Would I pay this price for this item?' 6. Selling Sundays - The busiest time for buyers is Sunday evenings so schedule listings to end then. Choose 10-day auctions to get maximum bids 7. Donate to charity - Consider donating a percentage of the sale to a cause of your choice

There are also fees for optional extras such as larger pictures or scheduling the listing to go live in the future.

To make things more Covid-safe eBay has discounted its Packlink delivery service - which enables sellers to have items collected from their doorstep - during lockdown. It now starts at £2.89.

Or get someone to do it for you...

If you don't have the time or inclination to list things on eBay yourself you can pay for an expert seller to do it on your behalf.

The website Stuff U Sell offers a service where you can send them the item you want to get rid of and one of their sellers will do the rest.

If your item sells they keep one third of the sale price as a commission plus transaction fees. Because of the high commission this works better for higher-value items.

Items such as sports equipment clothes and games consoles can also make money on eBay

Get your antiques valued and sold by post

If you've always wondered whether there might be cash in your attic now could be the time to find out.

The website Vintage Cash Cow offers a Covid-safe way of making money from your potential hidden gems.

Items bought by Vintage Cash Cow include silverware memorabilia and costume jewellery

You can order a free selling pack from its website which includes a guide to what you can and can't sell and pre-paid postage labels. You then pack your items securely into a box and post it to the company which is based in Leeds.

It specialises in antique items but they don't need to be in mint condition as it will still accept them if they are broken or have parts missing.

POPULAR ITEMS SOLD IN 2020 Old coins - 20 tonnes Silver plate and other non-precious metals - 11 tonnes Costume jewellery - 4 tonnes Vintage cameras - 4000 Watches and pocket watches - 30000

After it receives your box Vintage Cash Cow will give you a cash offer which you are free to accept or decline. If you decline your belongings are returned for free and if you accept the company will transfer the money by bank transfer or cheque.

David Weaver co-founder of Vintage Cash Cow said: 'The biggest shock people get is when they send us odd bits of old damaged and tangled-up jewellery.

'Pieces like this add a significant amount to the no-obligation cash offer we make so we encourage people to pop them in if they have no use for them.

'Some choose to leave all these things to the kids and grandkids. If items hold real sentimental value or if their descendants have been eyeing them up then they should keep them. For everything else there's Vintage Cash Cow.'

Accepts: Silver gold brass and pewter items medals jewellery watches pocket watches old toys old currency cameras musical instruments smoking paraphernalia vintage advertising signs vintage homeware vintage boxing gloves vintage luggage and handbags collectables.

Doesn't accept: Furniture modern electrical or battery-powered items modern toys books vinyl records CDs VHS tapes DVDs mobile phones comic books and annuals clothing.

The company sorts all of the items it receives by post in a vast warehouse in Leeds

How much can I make?

Vintage Cash Cow told us the most anyone has made from a single box is £3480 although one customer made just under £10000 by sending in eight boxes at once. The average box nets the owner just over £80.

The amount you make depends on what you have and if there is anything you think might be especially valuable you might want to hold on to it until you can get a full valuation - or try to sell it yourself on an online marketplace where it might benefit from competitive bidding.

The service is also designed for bulk sales so if you just have one or two items it may be better to sell these elsewhere.

Go to a virtual car boot sale

Online car boot sales are another way to cash in on your unwanted items.

The biggest one in the UK is Online Car Booty. It runs in a similar way to the real-world version with sales launching at 3pm every Sunday. However instead of a few hours your item will be listed for a week.

Instead of an actual car boot sellers get a virtual one which buyers can click on to view everything they have for sale. You can even choose your own model of car.

Sellers on Online Car Booty can choose a virtual car and sell up to 10 items for free

You can list up to ten items for free or pay for a bigger 'boot'. The fees are £3 for up to 35 items £5 for up to 65 items or £7 for up to 100 items or you can buy unlimited listings for life for £19.99.

Buyers can also send you messages so you won't miss out on that traditional car boot sales patter.

You can post the items to the buyers or arrange for them to come and collect them.

Payments are made online via PayPal or with cash on collection. As you pay for your stall there are no final value fees like there are on other selling sites.

Selling items online could help you make money if you are clearing out your home

This is Money reader Jessica Farmery who runs the money-saving Instagram account @the_fru_gals is a regular user of online car boot sales.

She said: 'If you love the ease of selling at car boot sales but hate standing around in the cold with the kids making a fuss a virtual car boot sale is a great option.

'On sites like Online Car Booty you can upload photos of 10 items to your 'car boot' for free and other people can browse and buy. The sale runs 24/7 but all new stalls launch at 3pm on Sundays when the sale is busiest.

'If you make a sale you post the goods out just like eBay but without the seller fees. It's a completely Covid-proof way to make money from your unwanted things.'

Other places to sell your unwanted things

Facebook Marketplace - Facebook's in-house selling platform can be accessed by logging in to your account and clicking on the Marketplace icon (it looks like a shop front) at the top of the page.

It is free to list and sell items but Facebook does not have its own payment system - so you will need to arrange a secure online transfer with the buyer using a service such as PayPal or ask them to pay you in cash.

Gumtree - Gumtree is a buy-and-sell website which has millions of monthly users. Listing is free but there are optional paid extras to make your listing stand out more.

Like Facebook Marketplace you must arrange payment yourself outside of the platform. Buyers are generally local and will often want to inspect the item in person before paying you.

Amazon - It might be more associated with business selling but individuals can list items on Amazon too. If you plan to sell less than 35 items per month Amazon will charge you £0.75 for each item that you sell on its platform. Other fees may apply depending on the type of item you are selling.

Depop - Depop is an app for reselling clothes with a particular focus on vintage goods and designer brands. There is no listing fee but when you sell an item Depop will charge you a 10 per cent fee on the sale including shipping.

Ziffit - Ziffit is an app designed for trading in books CDs DVDs and games and has bought more than 20 million items. You can get started by scanning the barcode on your items via the app which will then give you a price. Then you send them to Ziffit via a free courier service and receive your payment.

There are plenty of apps and websites you can use to sell second-hand things

Preloved - This is another general selling website. If you're a private seller listing is free although you can choose to upgrade to an annual membership to access extras such as unlimited images.

Shpock - Shpock is a classifieds platform. It says the most active areas for listings are London Brighton Birmingham Bristol Manchester Leicester and Liverpool. Listings are free unless you opt for additional promotion of your items and there is no final value fee. However when a transaction is completed via Paypal the seller will pay a commission to Shpock and an additional fee to PayPal.

Freecycle - Freecycle is a non-profit website where people advertise things to give away. If you just need to get rid of something rather than wanting to make money post an advert and with any luck someone in your neighbourhood will come and take it off your hands.

Recycling centres are allowed to stay open during lockdown but at the discretion of councils

Recycling centre - Recycling centres are run by the local council and take all kinds of items from furniture to garden waste and electrical items. They are allowed to stay open during lockdown but councils can close them at their discretion so check before you go.

Finished your clear-out? Now you could sell your empty space...

The money-making doesn't have to end when you have cleared out all of your old stuff.

Storemates is a website which pairs up people who have a bit of extra space in their home with those who need storage.

It recommends that you charge 50 per cent of the going rate for a commercial self- storage unit in your area.

Listing your space is free but Storemates automatically deducts 16.5 per cent from any payments you receive plus an extra 20p."

That’s according to multiple sources including credited Star Wars insider Bespin Bulletin which states in a recent podcast that a new instalment in the fan-favourite RPG series is indeed in development at an unnamed game developer.

It’s been reported before that a new KOTOR game is in the works but this is the first suggestion that it might be in development outside of its original creator BioWare and EA which until recently was the only major company making Star Wars games.

Lucasfilm announced this month that it would be licensing Star Wars games to other companies – including Ubisoft – as part of its new games label. According to Bespin Bulletin and others KoTOR is seemingly one of the titles that has been handed to a developer outside of EA.

As well as citing its own sources the insider also references recent comments by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier suggesting that a project related to KoTOR was in development somewhere unexpected.

“Amongst my digging I heard there is a Knights of the Old Republic project in development somewhere” Bespin Bulletin said. “I talked to a couple of people and I also found out that Jason Schreier said that it’s not with EA and we’ll ‘never guess’ who the studio is that’s making this game.”

On broader plans for Star Wars game the insider said he’d heard that “a bounty hunter game” was being developed somewhere and that EA was working on a “smaller” Star Wars game.

“I don’t know if the bounty hunter game is with them or if it’s with Ubisoft. But yeah EA is working on stuff and there’s another unannounced [Star Wars] game at EA which I have no idea what it is. I don’t think it’s Battlefront 3.”

Another person who occasionally shares information on unannounced games Nate Najda of Wushu Studios corroborated the claims that a new KoTOR is in development.

On KoTOR’s new developer Najda wrote: “It’s not as mysterious as you think. It’s just not a household name most people are aware of.”

Released in 2003 the fan-favourite RPG from BioWare tells a Jedi versus Sith story set some 4000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire featured in 1977’s Star Wars film.

Obsidian created a sequel The Sith Lords in 2004 and there hasn’t been a mainline Knights of the Old Republic game in the near-17-years since (unless you count EA’s 2011 MMO The Old Republic).

Last year entertainment publication Cinelinx cited two sources as having claimed that a KoTOR “remake” or “sequel of sorts” had been greenlit – presumed to be at Electronic Arts – after an earlier attempt at reviving the series had been shelved by EA.

Although the original Knights of the Old Republic games have been officially wiped from Star Wars canon following Disney’s acquisition of the franchise there have been signs it’s looking to reintroduce story elements from the games.

In 2017 some KoTOR plot elements were referenced in the Star Wars Rebels animated series such as the Mandalorian Wars and the ancient Sith planet Malachor. A deleted scene from The Clone Wars was also reportedly set to include Darth Revan from KoTOR.

Later an art book for movie Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker contained reference to a Sith Legion named after Revan.

In 2019 Lucasfilm also announced it would launch a range of media exploring the “High Republic Era” which officially takes place several hundred years before the Star Wars movies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2Jlc3QtaGFycnktcG90dGVyLXZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLXJhbmtlZC1tZXRhY3JpdGljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Harry Potter Games,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2Jlc3QtaGFycnktcG90dGVyLXZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLXJhbmtlZC1tZXRhY3JpdGljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

Despite the prevalence of get-rich-quick schemes those looking to grow their capital need not reinvent the wheel. Investing in stocks remains one of the best ways to do that. But not all securities are created equal. With an unlimited number of investment options on the market picking the wrong ones could mean waving goodbye to your hard-earned money.

Investing in shares of great companies is the key to achieving your financial goals. With that in mind here are three excellent stocks that should make you richer over the long-run if you buy today: Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.32%) Veeva Systems (VEEV 1.07%) and Eli Lilly (LLY 1.45%). Here's why each of these companies deserves a place in your portfolio.

1. Bristol Myers Squibb

Pharma giant Bristol Myers has a strong lineup of medicines a rich pipeline and a juicy dividend all of which can help drive revenue and earnings higher while rewarding investors with dividend increases.

The company boasts at least eight blockbuster drugs including multiple myeloma treatment Revlimid which saw sales in the third quarter of 2020 jump by 10% year over year to $3 billion. Bristol Myers got its hands on Revlimid thanks to its 2019 acquisition of Celgene in a cash and stock transaction valued at $74 billion.The deal bolstered the company's lineup with other products like Pomalyst another multiple myeloma drug. During the third quarter sales of Pomalyst increased by 17% year over year to $777 million. Bristol Myers also markets anticoagulant Eliquis which brought in revenue during the third quarter of $2.1 billion a 9% increase from the year-ago period.

Turning to Bristol Myers' pipeline the company has more than four dozen clinical compounds in development and at least as many ongoing clinical trials including a raft of phase 3 studies. Newly approved products (or new indications for existing products) are likely to boost the drugmaker's financial results in the coming years.

Despite its stock underperforming the broader market of late Bristol Myers' prospects look enticing. The company's revenue and earnings are set to keep growing at a good clip. Three of its drugs Revlimid Eliquis and Opdivo will be among the five best-selling drugs in the world in 2024 according to research firm Evaluate Pharma.

Bristol Myers also closed its latest acquisition in November: a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company called MyoKardia in an all-cash transaction worth $13.1 billion. MyoKardia's leading pipeline candidate is mavacamten a potential treatment for a chronic heart disease called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Management believes ""mavacamten has multibillion-dollar potential"" and it could be yet another long-term growth driver.

Lastly with a dividend yield of 2.80% (compared to a 1.55% yield for the S&P 500) and a low cash payout ratio of 31.8% investors can count on Bristol Myers to continue increasing its dividends. All these factors make this pharma stock an excellent pick for 2021 and beyond.

2. Veeva Systems

Veeva Systems' mission is to help companies in different sectors including the life sciences industry bring their products to the market faster and more efficiently while ensuring regulatory compliance. The company works with many of the top players in the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors including AstraZeneca Merck and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Veeva's founder and CEO Peter Gassner is a former executive of the cloud-based software giant salesforce.com. Veeva Systems and Salesforce have a long-standing partnership that allows the former to utilize Salesforce's platform to run its cloud-based services.

Veeva's list of products includes Veeva Vault which helps drugmakers sail through the complex process of clinical trials. The company's largest segment by revenue is subscription services. During the first nine months of its fiscal year 2021 which ended on Oct. 31 Veeva Systems reported $1.07 billion in revenue representing a 34.8% year-over-year increase. The company's subscription services revenue accounted for about 80% of its total revenue.

Veeva has an excellent retention rate for its services. For its 2017 2018 and 2019 years its retention rate was 127% 121% and 122% respectively. On top of that the company is developing newer products to better assist its clientele. Veeva Systems has branched out beyond the life sciences industry and into other regulated ones namely consumer packaged goods (CPG) chemicals and cosmetics.

The company's vision for these sectors is the same as it is in the life sciences industry. During the first three quarters of its fiscal year 2021 Veeva Systems generated about $30 million in revenue from these spaces which represented nearly 8% of its total revenue.

It also has more than 60 customers from these three sectors and the company sees a growing opportunity especially given the changing environment of the CPG chemical and cosmetics industries brought about by the pandemic. Veeva Systems looks to be on a solid path to consistent revenue and earnings growth for the foreseeable future and its stock price should continue to climb too.

3. Eli Lilly

Eli Lilly is another pharma giant with a rich suite of drugs. Some of the company's top sellers include Trulicity a diabetes medicine that had sales of $3.6 billion for the first nine months of 2020 a 22% jump. Other top performers include insulin product Basaglar and oral diabetes drug Jardiance. For the first nine months of 2020 revenue from the former rose by 5% to $842.3 million while sales of Jardiance increased by 24% year over year to $840.3 million.

Lilly also has well over three dozen ongoing clinical trials. One of the company's pipeline candidates is a potential drug for Alzheimer's disease called donanemab. The company recently reported positive results from a phase 2 clinical trial for it.There are more than 5 million Alzheimer's patients in the U.S. and there are no approved drugs that can treat the cognitive declines associated with it. While there is still a long road ahead for donanemab investors would do well to monitor its progress.

It is worth noting that Biogen's aducanumab is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication. Both aducanumab and donanemab look to treat the disease by removing amyloid-beta plaques from patients' brains which some professionals believe could help those who suffer from Alzheimer's. But considering that an advisory panel of experts strongly recommended the FDA not approve the drug Biogen's prospects look unfavorable.

Eli Lilly recently beefed up its pipeline with its planned acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics a biotech that focuses on developing gene therapies in a cash transaction valued at around $880 million. Lilly already had a lot going for it and this move only made its long-term prospects even more appealing thanks to potential drugs that target Parkinson's disease and dementia conditions for which there are no standard treatments. In short adding shares of this pharma giant to your portfolio would be a great move for your money.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzIzL3ZhbHVlLWNyZWF0aW5nLWFjdGl2aXN0LWdldHRpbmctaW52b2x2ZWQtd2l0aC1hLXB1cmUtcGxheS1pbi10aGUtZ3Jvd2luZy1hbmltYWwtaGVhbHRoLW1hcmtldC5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAxLzIzL3ZhbHVlLWNyZWF0aW5nLWFjdGl2aXN0LWdldHRpbmctaW52b2x2ZWQtd2l0aC1hLXB1cmUtcGxheS1pbi10aGUtZ3Jvd2luZy1hbmltYWwtaGVhbHRoLW1hcmtldC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Value-creating activist gets involved with a pure play in the growing animal health market,"In this article ELAN

Activist: Sachem Head Capital

Percentage Ownership: 5.9% Average Cost: $28.33 Activist Commentary: Sachem Head was founded in 2013 by Scott Ferguson the first investment professional hired at Pershing Square where he worked for nine years. While Sachem Head has a history of solid value investing their activism in their early years was short term and underwhelming at best. In their first campaign at Helen of Troy they advocated for a sale of the company and share buybacks in a February 2014 letter and sold their entire position into the buyback a month later something experienced activists never do. Their first 13D filing was on CDK Corp. only a month after the company went public through a spinoff – hardly giving management time to do anything. Since then they have grown through campaigns at companies like Zoetis and Autodesk partnering with more experienced investors like Pershing Square and Eminence. And recently Ferguson has created value as a director of Olin his first public company board seat in a portfolio company he did not invest in as part of a group. This investment in Elanco is his second of what we expect to be many in the future. Taking board seats signifies both commitment and contribution; and since their launch in 2013 Sachem Head has evolved from a value investor that used activism as a short-term stunt to a value investor that genuinely engages with companies to create value for shareholders.

On December 13 2020 Sachem Head and the company entered into a cooperation agreement pursuant to which the company appointed the following three individuals to the board as directors (i) William Doyle executive chairman of Novocure Ltd. a publicly traded global oncology company commercializing a novel platform technology to treat solid tumors and former director of Zoetis (ii) Scott Ferguson the founder and managing partner of Sachem Head Capital Management and (iii) Paul Herendeen EVP and CFO of Bausch Health and former EVP and CFO of Zoetis Inc. Sachem Head agreed to abide by customary voting and standstill provisions until the later of (x) five days after the date on which neither Ferguson nor any officer director consultant partner or employee of Sachem Head continues to serve on the Board and (y) forty-five days before the closing of the non-proxy access shareholder director nomination window for the 2023 annual meeting.

Behind the Scenes:

Sachem Head took this position at a time when the company has been criticized for several missteps including a poorly timed acquisition of Bayer AG's animal-health assets for $6.9 billion that did not close until after the onset of the COVID pandemic. The company has also exhibited supply chain issues and low operating margins. Their EBITDA margin of about 18% is well below the 44% margin at Zoetis. Elanco has already announced a restructuring plan to create $100 million in annual savings and improve its margins but there is clearly a lot more that can be done. Prior to the pandemic Elanco had been targeting a 31% EBITDA margin in 2022.

Also the overall sentiment got a boost after new president Joe Biden took office.

The resurgence of coronavirus cases and the deepening economic uncertainty continue to take a toll on the US labor market. Last week jobless claims stayed elevated around 900000 but it was slightly below economists’ prediction. The dismal employment scenario and continuing lay-offs show that the new president has a tough task at hand.

On the M&A front tech firms Lumentum Holdings and Coherent Inc. agreed for a merger last week. The $5.7-billion deal is expected to create one of the largest photonics and laser companies in the world. Elsewhere Boston Scientific signed a pact to acquire privately-held mobile health solutions company Preventive Solutions. In another tech buyout Cognizant agreed to acquire software company Magnetic Solutions to strengthen its digital engineering capabilities.

By Casey Sizemore

CORRIGAN – During its regular scheduled meeting Tuesday the Corrigan City Council approved beginning the procurement procedures to accept the Texas Department of Agriculture Community Development block grant for 2021-22.

City Manager Darrian Hudman said the $375000 grant which is more than previous years could be applied toward water and sewer projects. The council did not discuss what projects the grant would be applied to.

Mayor Johnna Lowe Gibson said the city is in talks with Corrigan OSB “to see if they can help” with some of the water or sewer projects.

The council also approved three appointments to a committee to seek who is most qualified to complete some of the jobs. Mayor Gibson described the committee as a “formality.”

The council also approved a declination toward “Entergy’s backup generation product.” Hudman said Entergy intends to install a generator for the city to use during power outages. He said Energy requested the council decline the initial submission so they could resubmit under a multi-city or municipality project.

The board also approved the general city election for May 1 2021.

After a lengthy discussion the council tabled a motion to reduce the speed limit from 30 mph to 20 mph on Martin Luther King Jr. Street until the council members have an opportunity to hear pros and cons from the citizens.

Chief Gerald Gibson requested the council take up the matter out of concern for children playing in the area.

“My only concern is the children that’s all I care about” he said.

Chief Gibson said children walk along the street play basketball in and near the street and play in the park so he is concerned an accident is going to occur.

Hudman recommended the council consider an ordinance stating all residential streets in the city limits be reduced to 20 mph. He also recommended the city mail out information to citizens and make callouts.

During the council forum portion of the meeting the council members discussed a recent article in the Enterprise concerning Georgia Pacific donating funds toward constructing a new fire department building for the Corrigan Volunteer Fire Department.

“The Corrigan Volunteer Fire Department could use donations for that building” Mayor Gibson said.

Chief Gibson said CFVD is also in need of volunteer firefighters.

According to a series of 2016 life-expectancy maps created over a 20-year-period by Virginia Commonwealth University babies born in ZIP codes only five miles apart face up to a 20-year difference. Residents in North Philadelphia’s majority-Black Glenwood Strawberry Mansion and Allegheny West neighborhoods had an average life expectancy of 68 years compared to the 88-year life expectancy in Old City where the majority of residents are white.

Environmental conditions in which people are born live learn work play worship and age can affect a wide range of health functioning and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. Access to quality public education safe and affordable housing good health care residential segregation and exposure to environmental toxins are all factors that contribute to some of the largest gaps in health and health outcomes within the city.

In addition to mounting health disparities that disproportionately impact communities of color local Black and brown-led local organizations trying to bring relief and change to their communities are historically underfunded or simply overlooked by philanthropists. That’s according to Raymond Guthrie of the American Heart Association’s Bernard J. Tyson Impact Fund.

This month the Tyson Fund received a $1 million gift from the Andréa W. and Kenneth C. Frazier Family Foundation to support local nonprofits and social entrepreneurs working to improve access to health care food and housing as well as economic empowerment in North Philadelphia.

The Tyson Fund works with cities across the country to invest in community-based organizations and solutions that reduce the economic and social barriers to health equity. Since launching in June 2020 it has supported 11 social entrepreneurs and nonprofits in New York San Francisco and Oakland Calif. The fund honors the late Bernard J. Tyson a longtime American Heart Association volunteer and former Kaiser Permanente CEO who worked to overcome structural and systemic barriers to support social justice and equitable health for all.

“We want it so that a child no matter where they’re born [has] the opportunity to live a healthier longer life” said Guthrie the fund’s managing director. “Unfortunately the way our country is where you live disproportionately impacts how long you live irrespective of the health care that you receive once you get into the hospital.”

Guthrie said that requires shifting to an investment approach that allows community members and entrepreneurs within a given neighborhood to drive the change and the solutions.

According to data from a 2019 Philadelphia Department of Public Health report on the health of neighborhoods the Nicetown-Tioga Sharswood-Stanton and Strawberry Mansion neighborhoods rank among the lowest in the city for both length of life and quality of life as well as health factors such as the physical environment and social and economic factors.

“But really we look at North Philly as an opportunity and not as a place of need” said Guthrie. “And one of the things that’s unique about our approach is that we don’t come into those communities and say what needs to change. Instead we say `What is working?’”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sen. Bernie Sanders has dominated the Internet for nearly a week with his now-iconic outfit worn at President Joe Biden 's inauguration on Wednesday becoming a popular meme throughout social media.

However Sanders isn't going to be pocketing any of the money earned from his newfound Internet fame. Despite the high price-tag the website promises that all proceeds from the sale of the sweatshirts will be donated to Meals on Wheels Vermont.

However getting one of these shirts may take some time with the website also warning that it will take 4-8 weeks for deliveries to arrive ""due to overwhelming demand.""

The meme in question consists of the two-time Democratic presidential candidate sitting on a chair at the inauguration clad in a parka blue face mask and very prominent wool mittens with distinctive patterns his arms and legs both folded. According to reports the photo was taken by AFP photographer Brendan Smialowski who thought it was a nice moment and represented a good slice of life. The photographer behind the Bernie Sanders chair meme tells us how he got the instantly iconic shot.

The mittens in question known as ""smittens"" as they are part mitten and part sweater were actually made by Vermont school teacher Jen Ellis who had given them to Sanders on his campaign trail according to CNN

Now she has been flooded with requests for more mittens.

""Sadly I have no more mittens for sale"" she tweeted on Thursday but added that ""There are a lot of great crafters on ETSY who make them.""

EG,Everest Re,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcXVpbGxhbmRwYWQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjIvbXl0aGJ1c3RpbmctMy1wZXJzaXN0ZW50LXBhdGVrLXBoaWxpcHBlLWFuZC1yb2xleC1teXRocy1kZWJ1bmtlZC1yZXByaXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mythbusting: 3 Persistent Patek Philippe And Rolex Myths Debunked - Reprise,"The rise of the internet and the consequent evolution of the watch-watching community from its early days on forums and chat rooms into fully-fledged horology-related blogging and online retail empires all fueled by social network apps like Instagram and Facebook has inevitably amplified the phenomenon whereby certain objects come to exert an extraordinary hold over the collective imagination. This leads to certain watch brands becoming prized for their value as short- medium- or long-term investments rather than timekeeping devices. You could go so far as to regard them as a currency in their own right.

Against this feverish backdrop rumors and legends abound. For there is no better way to boost the sale price of a vintage watch than to have it associated with a particular person or historical event. Case in point: the “Paul Newman Rolex Daytona” which is not the same thing as the late Paul Newman’s Rolex Daytona(s) but the link is established in collectors’ minds and prices soar accordingly.

Here are three watch myths circulating widely and freely online and in print and in some cases these urban legends are brazenly perpetuated by persons and platforms who should know better.

Myth 1: Nicolas Sarkozy took off his Patek Philippe to shake hands with his supporters

Nicolas Sarkozy president of France between 2007 and 2015 drew considerable flak from a broad section of French society for his undisguised taste for the good things in life (not to mention well-heeled personae) in particular after his post-election celebratory dinner at Fouquet’s in Paris in May 2007.

As anyone who follows both French politics and fine watchmaking may be aware the nec plus ultra comment about Rolex watches was made by journalist Jacques Séguéla on a live chat show: responding to accusations that Sarkozy’s choice of wrist wear proved that he was the “bling-bling” president Séguéla was simply pointing out that in the real world it’s quite normal for the president of a country to wear a Rolex.

“Why would you criticize a president for wearing a Rolex?” Séguéla postulated. “After all everyone has a Rolex – if you don’t have a Rolex by the time you’re 50 you’re a failure.”

This statement which was a perfectly banal and light-hearted observation ricocheted round the media as evidence of how France’s media personalities and by implication the president he was defending are out of touch with “ordinary” French people for whom a Rolex is both an unattainable object and a vulgar display of luxury.

French presidents are expected to wear a less ostentatious home-grown timepiece such as a LIP or to show support for French industry as did Emmanuel Macron by sporting a modestly priced quartz timepiece by Biarritz-based March LA.B. Since the COVID-19 crisis however in ostentatious displays of media-savvy hair-shirtedness Macron has repeatedly appeared on camera with his sleeves symbolically rolled up wearing . . . no watch at all.

Sarkozy subsequently graduated to a Patek Phillipe a gift from wife Carla Bruni but the press came down heavily on him again when in a news clip of an election rally he launched into a bain de foule (literally a “crowd bath”) to press the flesh.

While vigorously shaking both right and left hands with admirers leaning over the barrier Sarkozy appears to deftly whisk his Patek Philippe off his left wrist and stuff it in his jacket pocket before carrying on. Here was evidence that he clearly did not trust the people who vote for him.

In the Anglophone horological press the incident is typically misreported for example (the more usually accurate) Time & Tide’s “Get your hands off my Patek . . . ” Remembering the watches and antics of Nicolas ‘Bling-Bling’ Sarkozy. This accusation is quite unfair however as a frame-by-frame analysis of this video filmed from a better viewpoint shows that the watch which is on a leather strap on a deployant buckle suddenly becomes looser on his wrist just before he slips it off and pops it in his pocket.

The clasp likely didn’t come loose due to the vigorous handshaking: one frame clearly shows a young man with fair hair lunging forward over the barrier and rather than grasping Sarkozy’s hand he has his thumb on the watch crystal a well-known Albanian pickpocketing technique involving pinning the watch case to the wrist with the thumb while undoing the clasp with the other fingers – a method to which George Bush was reported to – though officials later denied – to have fallen victim to while meeting crowds near Tirana in Albania.

Nicolas Sarkozy was being robbed in broad daylight without his bodyguards even noticing.

With this technique as soon as the victim feels that the bracelet has been successfully loosened he instinctively withdraws his arm to save his watch but the watch stays in the pickpocket’s hand. Fortunately in this instance Sarkozy was able to save his Patek Phillipe.

Verdict: A myth. Monsieur Sarkozy is not guilty as charged.

Myth 2: the “Mirbat nine” gold Khanjar Rolex Sea-Dwellers

The second myth is one that I have to confess to having helped at least for a time. In recent years it has become an accepted truth that “the Sultan of Oman awarded Rolex Sea-Dwellers emblazoned with gold khanjars to nine members of the British SAS who fought off hundreds of Omani rebels at the battle of Mirbat” on the southern coast of Oman in 1972. And at least one Rolex Sea-Dweller has been sold by Phillips with this description.

However there is in fact no evidence of this. The idea started life with a single article on these watches on the website of Rolex expert and dealer Daniel Bourn Vintage-DB.com in which he analyzed the serial numbers of known examples of the red and gold khanjar watches and conjectured on a purely hypothetical basis  that these logo watches could have been awarded to the 90-odd SAS members clandestinely operating in Oman in the early 1970s and the gold ones to the nine SAS men involved in the battle of Mirbat. The SAS (Special Air Service) are British troops deployed in special situations.

In my Quill & Pad article Khanjar And Qaboos Rolexes: Are They The Vintage Watch Industry’s Blood Diamonds? I quoted the Vintage-DB website as follows “Given that the Battle of Mirbat was a pivotal moment in defeating the insurgents and the lack of recognition given to the SAS soldiers by their own government it is not inconceivable to think that Qaboos who had previously commissioned the Red Oman watches to commemorate the SAS soldiers who occupied Oman during the 1970-1976 campaign would commission a small special batch to honor the nine SAS troops who put their lives at risk during the Battle of Mirbat to defend Oman from the rebellion.”

Like the lost text identified by Bible scholars as “Q” (for Quelle “source” in German) the inspiration behind the Gospels of Matthew Mark and Luke thus it was that the Vintage-DB website became the unintended “Q” of the Khanjar Rolex Sea-Dweller myth.

Following Quill & Pad’s publication of my Khanjar article in December 2019 a flurry of articles on Khanjar Rolexes and other watches appeared in the online and offline press especially after the death of Sultan Qaboos in January 2020 many of which clearly drew on my article and on Daniel Bourn’s website.

For example where my article states “this number might correspond to the nine SAS members who took part in the battle of Mirbat on 19 July 1972” in its May 2020 article on Khanjar Rolexes GQ magazine stated “Recipients of these special pieces included members of the British Armed Forces which helped the Sultanate consolidate power from the 1950s onwards. Of particular note are those presented to SAS soldiers for their help in quelling the Dhofar uprising in the 1970s.”

This highlights how a simple but attractive hypothesis very quickly morphs into fact in the mainstream media which is in turn quoted by watch dealers and auctioneers in their product descriptions in order to drum up interest and boost prices. The circle becomes self-fulfilling.

Perhaps the parties concerned should have read to the end of Daniel Bourn’s article where they would have read: “Of course without official delivery information from Rolex Qaboos or the surviving SAS soldiers we cannot be certain but the theory should encourage further discussion research and understanding of the events in Oman during the 1970s and the important watches that commemorate the period.”

In separate confirmation of this I asked a contact at Phillips as to whether they had handled any Khanjar Rolexes consigned by former SAS members to which the reply was that they had sold a Khanjar Sea-Dweller but “we only had one consigned by the son of the original owner but the latter was not part of the SAS.”

Furthermore I was contacted by a London-based watch collector who had bought one of the supposed “SAS” Khanjar Sea-Dwellers and out of curiosity tracked down one of the SAS operatives who had actually been at Mirbat. He told me that the SAS man “laughed incredulously and replied categorically that neither he nor his colleagues received any recompense of any sort for their role in that battle let alone a Rolex . . . ”

Myth 3 (also featuring the illustrious coronet): Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were wearing Rolex watches when they reached the peak of Mount Everest in 1953

Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay wearing Rolex watches while summiting Everest is a dual myth that needs to be doubly scotched. No ice.

The first part is easy: it is frequently claimed that Hillary and Tenzing were wearing Rolex Explorers on their conquest of the peak or at least some form of “pre-Explorer.”

It has been clearly documented that the 1953 team led by Sir John Hunt was equipped with 13 watches from Rolex: six given to team members who had been on the previous year’s unsuccessful Cho Oyu expedition and seven for the new members of the 1953 team.

But as collector James Dowling explains in his article in the final issue of the now-defunct QP magazine these watches were standard Rolex Oyster Perpetuals not Explorers as the Explorer model with its distinctive 3-6-9 dial was still in development and would not emerge in that form with or without the Explorer name on the dial until later in 1953. The famous Mercedes hands would not be added for another 18 months.

The second aspect of the myth is more controversial and has remained so for many years due to lack of clear photographic or written evidence. Particularly the absence of a categorical statement either way by the persons concerned or by Rolex itself. The myth perpetuated to this day by numerous print and online publications some of which ought to know better and backed up by a stream of almost subliminal advertisements by Rolex is that Sir Edmund Hillary was wearing his Rolex Oyster Perpetual when he reached the peak of Mount Everest on May 29 1953 accompanied by Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.

Sometimes the myth is extended to include Tenzing Norgay as well claiming that he was wearing the gold Rolex Day-Date given to him by mountaineer Raymond Lambert on the Swiss Everest expedition in 1952.

For example the following publications categorically claim that Sir Edmund Hillary was wearing a Rolex Oyster Perpetual at the peak of Everest.

Hodinkee.com: FOUND – The Rolex Sir Edmund Hillary Wore To The Peak of Mount Everest states: “In 1953 the not-yet-Sir Edmund Hillary became the first man to summit Mount Everest along with expedition partner Tenzing Norgay. And he did so with a Rolex on his wrist an Oyster Perpetual that would prove to be the ancestor of the Explorer.”

The Watch Book Rolex by Gisbert Brunner published by now-bankrupt TeNeues states authoritatively that “When Edmund Hillary glanced with a mixture of relief and joy at his wristwatch on May 29 1952 its dial showed 11.30 A.M. . . . Like all other members of the official expedition he had picked up his watch two months previously in Jaynagar an Indian city along the border with Nepal where it had been sent by Geneva-based Montres Rolex S.A.”

Phillips Hong Kong watch auction XI November 29 2020: “The story of the Rolex Explorer was really made when it was the very first wristwatch worn on the summit of Everest by none other than Sir Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa Tenzig [sic] Norgay.”

Online retailer analogshift.com gets it even more muddled: “The Explorer traces its heritage back to the first successful summit of Everest in 1953. While we know now that the watch on Sir Edmund Hillary’s wrist was a Rolex Oyster Precision. The Oyster Precision was the precursor to the Explorer and it was the Precision that introduced the 3-6-9 Arabic dial that we associate with the Explorer today. It was after the successful summit that Rolex rechristened the model as the Explorer in honor of Hillary and Norgay’s historic accomplishment.”

So it is hardly surprising that like the mist that shrouds the peak of Kanchenjunga for much of the year the truth of the matter is shrouded in myth which is in turn enveloped in nonsense. And the key to this mystery is encapsulated in that last sentence: “It was after the successful summit that Rolex rechristened the model as the Explorer in honor of Hillary and Norgay’s historic accomplishment.”

If Sir Edmund Hillary was wearing a Rolex (of any sort) at the summit why didn’t Rolex re-issue a Rolex Everest in celebration of the fact just as French watch manufacturer LIP did with its LIP Himalaya after Maurice Herzog’s conquest of Annapurna in 1954?

And why did a now-defunct English watch manufacturer by the name of Smiths issue a Smiths Everest in 1953?

Furthermore when I interviewed professional diver Nigel Band about his father George’s Everest and Kangchenjunga Rolexes he described attending a Royal Geographical Society talk given by Sir Edmund Hillary in the 1970s where he overheard one of the regular society members leaning over to another member and muttering “of course it wasn’t a Rolex he was wearing at the top it was a Smiths . . .”

Definitive answer to the Hillary/Tenzing/Rolex/Smiths controversy

Several commentators and bloggers have tried to find a clear-cut answer to this question but after combing through all the available photographs advertisements and correspondence they have usually failed to come up with a concrete answer addressing all the issues and have generally restated whichever myth they prefer to believe.

However a definitive answer has finally emerged from outside the self-perpetuating smoke and mirrors of the watch-collecting world: an article published by outdoorjournal.com describes the background to the supplying of the expedition team with watches and other equipment producing categorical evidence that not only resolves the matter once and for all but ties up several loose ends and explains Rolex’s rather curious advertising strategy with regard to the Explorer model ever since.

The article can be found here but the facts can be summarized as follows:

Rolex was an early adopter if not the inventor of product placement. It had therefore already been supplying various mountaineering expeditions with a view to the publicity that would be gained by having its watches on the wrists of whoever was going to conquer Everest one day.

Smiths was a British instrument company that had been canny enough to supply the Everest team with a range of equipment such as altimeters and oxygen regulators in addition to its watches. In return it extracted a promise from the mountaineers that they would wear their Smiths watches to the summit.

Rolex jumped the gun on June 2 after Times journalist James (subsequently Jan) Morris’ coded message announcing the conquest reached London by publishing a full front-page advertisement in the Times that featured a picture of an Oyster Perpetual captioned “The Rolex Oyster Perpetual that reached the top of Everest on May 29th.” However this is the last advertisement or communication of any kind in which Rolex categorically claims that one of its watches had been at the top with either Hillary or Tenzing. Morris’ message did not indicate what watches they had been wearing. Interestingly Smiths Watches placed a modest congratulatory advert on June 2 as well followed on June 3 by a much bolder self-congratulatory celebration of the fact that its watch had conquered Everest.

Even though Rolex subsequently had Hillary Hunt and Tenzing on the payroll as brand ambassadors the ensuing advertising is non-committal and confusing. Testimonies by Hillary and Hunt quoted in Rolex advertisements (“I wore the watch continuously day and night”) refer to the previous year’s Cho Oyu expedition or merely praise Rolex watches in general terms.

In a typical example of this the first advertisement for the Rolex Explorer features a drawing of two mountaineers ascending a ridge (with some way to go to the top) and a testimony from Sir John Hunt signed on June 15 1953 to the effect that “Our Rolex Oyster Perpetuals were completely waterproof unharmed by immersion in snow and withstood the extreme change in temperature from the warm humidity of the foothills to the great cold of the higher camps.” No mention of the cold at the peak you will note. The ad also features a picture of a black-dial Explorer which is probably at the root of the “Explorer conquered Everest” myth. Again circumstantial evidence but nothing that would stand up in a court of law.

In the end it is a somewhat heated exchange of correspondence in the Journal of the British Horological Institute (as people used to do in the days before flame wars on internet forums) that categorically settles the matter.

In one letter the managing director of Smiths English Clocks Ltd D.W. Barrett wrote: “Our watches and certain other Smiths equipment including oxygen gauges were supplied and we received a written assurance that the watches would be worn to the ultimate point reached on the mountain. Sir Edmund Hillary has stated in writing that he took a Smiths watch to the summit and no other . . .”

To which Mr. R.A. Winter director of Rolex Watch Co. Ltd of Mayfair London replied: “We supplied Rolex Oyster Perpetuals for all members of the British Mount Everest 1953 Expedition but if by a fortuitous chance Sir Edmund Hillary’s watch did not reach him or if he was not wearing it in his ascent of the last few hundred feet then we regret that our first advertisements in connection with Everest suggested the contrary although we had every reason to suppose that he received his watch.

“It would appear from Mr. Barrett’s letter that Sir Edmund Hillary was in fact only wearing one watch at the summit and that a Smiths watch. We congratulate Smiths on the fact that their Smiths Deluxe ordinary wind wristwatch reached the summit with Sir Edmund Hillary.”

Let’s just read that again: “Sir Edmund Hillary was in fact only wearing one watch at the summit and that a Smiths watch.”

Everything that Rolex subsequently produces in terms of advertising and communications is hamstrung by the fact that although 13 Oyster Perpetuals did go up Everest on that expedition including two on the wrists of Charles Evans and Tom Bourdillon who made the first attempt turning back just 70 meters from the peak due to oxygen problems none of them made it to the top. Now that we know this for sure Rolex’s marketing of the Explorer model and all the subsequent advertisements make sense.

Smiths however stakes its claim in no uncertain terms even though its advertisements look amateurish in comparison to Rolex’s. Some have commented that Hillary’s statement that he “carried” a Smiths watch to the summit indicated that he wasn’t wearing it and must therefore have been “wearing” his Rolex on his wrist.

I initially thought the same thing but have since then read several descriptions written in the mid-twentieth century of men “carrying” a wristwatch. Given that a gentleman carried rather than wore a pocket watch and wristwatch production did not overtake pocket watch production until the 1940s it is quite plausible that a man of Hillary’s generation in a surviving vestige of common English usage would speak of “carrying” a watch rather than “wearing” it.

In any event the Smiths watch that Sir Edmund Hillary wore to the peak of Everest is now on display in the London Science Museum.

As for the watch that Norgay was wearing the received wisdom is that he was wearing the engraved gold Rolex Datejust given to him by mountaineer Raymond Lambert after the previous year’s Swiss Everest expedition.

However none of the numerous photographs of him on the 1953 expedition show him wearing a gold watch. All of them clearly show a steel watch on a Bonklip “bamboo” bracelet the type that came on the ubiquitous army issue West End Watch Co Sowar model issued to Indian and British soldiers in India for much of the first half of the twentieth century – and as would certainly have been worn by Gurkha regiments in Nepal.

As you may be aware if you read my article The Grail Of Attic Finds: Reunited With The First Watch I Ever Owned A West End Watch Co Sowar Prima  I am a fan of the Sowar and I would be delighted to think that Sherpa Tenzing Norgay was wearing one at the peak of Everest. Perhaps it was one of the Smiths Deluxes lent to the expedition put on a Bonklip bracelet as Tenzing would have been aware of the strength easy adjustability and extreme comfort in hot weather of these rather unassuming-looking bracelets.

If it was a Rolex the brand would have established this fact when it debriefed future brand ambassadors Hunt Hillary and Tenzing after the descent and would have exploited it to the fullest. In any event only 13 Oyster Perpetuals were supplied by Rolex to the Everest team for the 1953 expedition and at that point Norgay did not count among the original 13 team members.

So there we have it. Rolex eventually acknowledged in writing that Sir Edmund Hillary was wearing his Smiths Deluxe and only his Smiths at the peak. And although Tenzing Norgay owned a gold Rolex given to him by Raymond Lambert in 1952 there is plenty of evidence in the color photographs of the Royal Geographical Society archives that he was not wearing it at any point on the Everest mission.

Unless somebody has evidence to the contrary . . .

|

Small motorhomes – including those marketed as a Class B Plus RV – are all the rage. Here is our list of the 5 Best Small Class C RVs for 2021.

Getting out to see the latest and greatest RVs at RV shows is going to obviously be tricky for the foreseeable future as we all wait for the COVID-19 pandemic to play out and hopefully soon come to an end.

We’re working hard to help you with making a decision and that’s why we decided to bring you the RV Lifestyle list of the seven Best Small Class C RVs for 2021.

As we’ve noted in previous reports in which we evaluate RVs we have seen and toured all of the RVs below. We have also visited many of the factories and watched how they are built. We have met owners of several of the companies as well as their product managers and many of the RV dealers who sell the seven models we have selected.

Also before we start let me share this in full disclosure. We are owners of a Leisure Travel Vans Class B Plus RV. In fact we have owned two of them. Leisure Travel Vans is one of the sponsors of our RV Lifestyle platform. We think it is important to tell you that Jennifer and I paid for the LTV RVs we have owned (the Wonder and the Unity). They were not “given” to us.

Leisure has not told us what to say nor do they have any editorial control over what we write and publish. The opinions we share are all our own.

Before we get into our list of what we think are the Best Small Class C RVs for 2021 let’s talk a bit about the rigs which are sometimes called Class B+.

Class C vs. Class B Plus RV

A Class B + RV is really a Class C RV.

B + is a made-up term.

But the term Class B Plus RV is so widely used now that people and RV salespeople commonly refer to them that way. Whether accurate or not the Class B+ RV is the choice for many who want something bigger than a B but smaller than a normal C.

They are the choice for Jennifer and me. As we've said we've owned two of them: One a Leisure Travel Vans Unity FX built on the Mercedes Benz Sprinter cutaway chassis.

And our brand new one a 2021 Wonder RTB (Rear Twin Bed) model built on the Ford Transit cutaway chassis.

Before we got the B + RVs we drove several other Class B motorhome models built on the Sprinter van chassis. So we've had both Bs and B + RVs.

Why did we choose a Class B Plus RV?

Because a Class B Plus RV has more room than the Class B RV but is still a small enough motorhome to be easily maneuvered.

Class B RVs are known as campervans. They consist of a van body. The RV stuff is built and formed inside the walls of the van. It can get pretty close quarters in a B van.

Class B Plus RVs are built on a cutaway chassis

A Class B Plus RV (and the traditional Class C RV) is built on a cutaway chassis.

A cutaway chassis consists of the engine and cab and behind that just the rails and wheels without walls. That back portion of the cutaway chassis is what RV manufacturers build the RV part on. Think of the RV part as a box attached to rails and outriggers to that cutaway chassis.

The box is a bit bigger and has more living room than the B van.

What is with the Class B Plus RV designation?

In short a Class B Plus RV is an unofficial industry classification that refers to a Class C size (chassis/body) RV minus the cab overhang at the front that typically is used for sleeping on Class Cs. For registration and insurance purposes in fact Class B+ RVs are listed as a Class C.

“People said ‘Well I want something that doesn't have that overhang” said Dean Corrigal territory sales manager Leisure Travel Vans “And so (the industry) came up with the name Class B Plus RV.”

In other words it's a marketing term. Totally made up.

A Class B + RV is built on the same cutaway chassis cabs used for Class C RVs typically from Mercedes-Benz or Ford. The living space of the Class C RV — or any class for that matter — is built by a third-party RV manufacturer.

A Class B + RV offers more space and amenities than Class B RVs.

Advantages of a Class B Plus RV

Because the only real difference between a Class C and Class B Plus RV is the absence of the traditional overhang associated with Class Cs a Class B Plus RV generally offers more space and amenities than Class B campervans.

Space: For example the 2021 Leisure Travel Vans Wonder RTB (Rear Twin Bed) model Jennifer and I now have is a Class B Plus RV built on the Ford Transit chassis. It is a little bit wider (7 ft 10 in.) than Class B and also a little bit longer at 24 ft. 9 in. The height is just under 10 ft. meaning it will be able to fit into some garages. The length is just under 25 feet.

With a size like that there’s plenty of room.

Our Rear Twin Bed model has a rear “garage” that has a massive pass-through space that can hold bicycles and all the gear you'd ever need.

Other Wonder models don't have the “garage” but have six different storage bays accessible from outside of the RV.

Of course there’s plenty of additional storage inside as well.

A Big Class B Plus Benefit: The Bathroom

With a Class B RV you don’t always get a full bathroom. And if they have a shower it's usually a wet shower meaning the entire bathroom gets wet when you shower in it. Most Class B RV showers share space with the toilet and sink.

Most Class B Plus RV models however offer an enclosed dry shower separate from the toilet and sink which stay dry as you shower. In our case the enclosed shower on our Wonder has a skylight and is plenty roomy for a person who is 6'1″ or even a bit more to be able to stand up without stooping.

Another Plus for the Class B Plus RV

There’s one last thing: Because the Class B Plus RV is not quite the size of a full-sized C or a Class A RV they are easier to drive and park. From my experience I can pretty much take our B+ motorhome anywhere I could take our former Class B vans. Ours can even fit in a parking spot at most fast-food restaurants.

In fact when we are at our sticks and bricks home in Michigan I use our Class B Plus RV as a second vehicle running errands shopping doing everything we would with the family car.

I asked Dean Corrigal why he thinks Class B Plus RVs are so popular.

“I think it's because the big Class As are big and…some of the smaller Class Bs are a little bit too small for first time owners” he said. “This is like Goldilocks and the Three Bears…she found the exact right one. I think that's what it is. It's not too big not too small.”

That's a great definition. We wanted a little more room than we had in our Class B campervans. I didn't like those traditional Class Cs with the cab-over bunks. And most of the regular Class Cs seemed a bit more challenging to use as a second vehicle. For us a Class B Plus RV is the perfect choice.

The one drawback of a Class B Plus RV

The Class B Plus RV is best used by just two people. There are seatbelts for only two people. And while you could rig up a way to sleep a small adult or child by putting a platform of sorts across the two seats in the front a Class B Plus RV is usually designed to sleep just two people.

A Class C with the overhang can usually sleep three or four.

Jennifer and I almost always travel with our 65-pound Norwegian Elkhound BO. We sleep on the beds. Bo gets the floor unless we're not looking. For us the maneuverability and ease in driving we get with the Class B Plus RV is worth losing the extra sleeping capacity of a Class C RV.

Now that you know more about small Class C RVs (aka Class B+ RVs) let's look at what we think are the best of the best for 2021.

Our previous motorhome was the 2019 Leisure Travel Vans Unity FX Class B Plus RV (really a Class C RV0.

We loved it. for the luxury comfort and safety it provided.

It is built on the Mercedes Benz Sprinter and boasts a 3L V6 BlueTEC diesel engine under the hood. We found it to provide a smooth yet powerful ride with fuel economy in the 16-18 mpg.

CLICK HERE for an article I did back then when we got our Unity on the Sprinter chassis

The Unity also comes standard with the all-new MBUX multimedia system with a 10.25″ touchscreen heated and electric driver and passenger seats Traffic Sign Assist Attention Assist cruise control with Active Distance Assist Distronic Active Brake Assist Active Lane Keeping Assist and more. See the full list of Sprinter upgrades.

The Unity is available in eight European-inspired full-body paint options. Each Unity is painted using LTV's five-coat process and the company says this will help your vehicle “look great for years to come. The Unity is available in five floorplans.

We really enjoyed the Unity…if you want to know why we sold that unit for our current Wonder model check this story.

But in our book the Unity is the top of the line the best all-around Class B Plus (small Class C RV) on the market today considering value amenities and reliability.

The Unity ranges start in price at $138460.

The Wonder is our current RV and is powered by the Ford Transit — a powerful twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 gas engine and LTV’s first-ever offering of optional intelligent all-wheel-drive that the company says is sure to “open up new possibilities to Wonder drivers.”

Features such as advanced driver-assist technology auto start-stop and electric power-assisted steering make driving the Wonder a pleasure. The new Ford Transit also includes many notable safety features including Forward Collision Warning Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking Post-Collison Braking Lane-Keeping System Side Wind Stabilization and much more.

When it comes to fuel I have been pleased with the gas-powered Wonder for numerous reasons:

Gas prices are reasonable and currently better than diesel.

Owners can opt for higher octane gas (I go with 89 octane on hard-driving trips).

Gas is easier to find

Additionally the diesel sensors and related technology on Sprinters can be costly to fix. And while I generally found the Mercedes warranty to be excellent diesel engines are by nature more expensive to repair. There's also Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF). My Sprinters needed a jug or two every 4000-6o00 miles at about $20 a fill-up. I won't need that with the Transit.

Mileage is not as good as we had on our Unity. We average about 126 mpg in the Wonder. My Sprinter-based Unity typically got 14.5-15 mpg of diesel. Cost-wise because gas is cheaper right now it's a wash. And 2 or 3 mpg less is no big deal to me.

One of the first things we noticed with our new Wonder is how quiet and smooth it is to ride in. All six of our previous Sprinter RVs rode much rougher. Some were better. Some like the 4WD one was worse. But all of the Sprinters had more of a truck-like ride. The ride in the Wonder is awesome. It feels more like a car. Or SUV. Not completely. But mostly.

The Wonder's stylish interior is matched by its sleek exterior featuring contoured sidewalls a fiberglass flex roof and aerodynamic integrated front and rear fiberglass caps. The Wonder also is painted using LTV's five-coat process.

The Wonder is available in four floorplans.

We love the Wonder floor plan with the rear twin beds. The rear twin beds are always made up. When it's time to stop there's nothing that has to be set up or pulled down when it's time to turn in as we did with the Murphy Bed on the Sprinter-based Unity.

Those Wonder twin beds can easily be pushed together to make a Queen-sized bed too.

And one more thing that the Wonder had that we really wanted: A garage.

This was a big factor in our choosing the Transit vs Sprinter – the pass-through rear garage on the Wonder that can hold two bicycles

A massive pass-through rear storage bay can hold two bikes full-sized lawn chairs and lots more gear. And inside just beneath both of the beds is a cavernous storage area that serves as a hanging wardrobe and storage area.

The Wonder starts in price at about $121000.

Here's the most recent tour we did of our Wonder RTB model:

The EKKO is really getting a lot of great press these days!

It combines the efficiency of a camper van the added capacity of a Class C coach and the enhanced capability of AWD. It's on the Ford Transit chassis.

Combining the efficiency of a camper van and the capacity of a Class C coach the EKKO has a massive heated pass-through gear garage – large enough to store bicycles inflatable kayaks and other outdoor gear – and a large living sleeping and cooking space. Winnebago likes to call it an adventure vehicle and it has some great off the grid and four-season capabilities.

The 3.5L EcoBoost V6 delivers 310 horsepower and 400 lb.-ft. of torque while the 31-gallon fuel tank greatly extends the EKKO's range compared to other Class B Plus RVs. Standard safety features include Adaptive Cruise Control Lane-Keeping System Pre-Collision Braking Driver Alert and more plus the Winnebago-added Blind Spot Monitoring system.

It comes with three solar panels that pump out 455-watts a second alternator dedicated to charging the batteries while driving and the lithium-ion batteries are standard to provide further energy independence. The 50-gallon fresh water tank plus proportionately large waste tanks make extended boondocking stays possible.

With all tanks and water lines inside the coach above the floor extra all-season insulation in the roof walls and floor dual-pane acrylic windows and multiple insulated exterior compartments Winnebago says it can camp in cold weather easier than its competitors.

It has seating with three-point seat belts and child seat tether anchors and has added sleeping capacity with an optional pop-top.

The Ekko is available in two models – 22 feet and 24 feet long

The Ekko starting price is $163622.

These two options from Winnebago are very similar so I consider them one entry.

The View and Navion are both built on the diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz Sprinter chassis and have advanced safety features like active brake assist lane-keeping assist and a touchscreen infotainment system with an interactive voice interface navigation Wi-Fi hotspot and more.

Cross-coach storage holds larger items while the above-bed storage stows necessities. Roof port wiring access simplifies accessory wiring; available hydraulic leveling jacks with automatic controls ease set-up and the wide running board with pet loop keeps your pet close by.

Winnebago says they are quieter and better insulated than most RVs on the market thanks to thermal and acoustic insulation.

They come with standard 200W solar Group 31 batteries (or available lithium smart batteries) and a 2000 W inverter. The 24 foot Winnebago View has an MSRP of about $181000 The Navion starts at about $173000

The Atlas Touring Coach is a very luxurious touring coach made by Airstream. It’s a Class B Plus RV built on the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van chassis and inspired by the Airstream Interstate series. It is larger than the Interstate with a power slide-out high-end features and finishes and sleek automotive styling from grill to bumper. It is 24 feet long 8′ 3″ wide seats four and sleeps two with a Murphy Bed and a floor plan similar to the Leisure Travel Vans Unity. It has a 23 galling fresh water tank a 23-gallon black tank and a 31-gallon gray tank. The interior height is 6; 6″. The 15000 BTU Air Conditioner is ducted providing even cooling throughout the coach. And it comes with an optional Tommy Bahama styled interior upgrade. The starting price for the Atlas is $244000 making it perhaps the most expensive Class B Plus RV on the market.

Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday it plans to sever ties with the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race after this year's 49th edition of the contest citing economic concerns.

“After careful review of sponsorships in light of current economic conditions we’ve decided to conclude our sponsorship of the Iditarod following the 2021 race” Ashley Alemayehu an Exxon Mobil spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

Exxon’s sponsorship focused on the race’s education program which provides study material to schools nationwide.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) a longtime Iditarod foe claimed a victory with the decision.

“No reputable company wants to associate with a race that forces dogs to run until they collapse"" PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said calling on other sponsors to quit ""this spectacle of suffering.""

In response to Exxon’s decision PETA said it will cancel an anti-Exxon ad and protest campaign set to start next week.

Animal rights activists have criticized the Iditarod for pushing its dog teams too hard in racing and training and for subjecting its canine contestants to dangerous conditions. Five dogs died during or immediately after 2017's race.

Iditarod mushers and officials have defended their dog-care record citing the army of volunteer veterinarians involved and extensive dog health screening conducted before each race.

Iditarod's chief operations officer Chas St. George suggested Exxon's withdrawal was a ""short-term situation"" and said he hoped the company a sponsor since 1978 would renew ties with the race once financial difficulties posed by the pandemic abate.

""This is a time when we're all rebuilding and reassessing"" St. George told Reuters. ""We know that Exxon Mobil is very much a proud supporter and a proud part of the Iditarod. That will never change.""

Exxon’s decision follows the loss in recent years of such longtime corporate sponsors as Alaska Airlines and Wells Fargo.

This year’s race has been sharply pared back due to the coronavirus pandemic to an 860-mile out-and-back trail instead of the traditional 1000-mile route from Anchorage to Nome.

The race is due to start in Anchorage on March 6.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It could be a scam,"CNN Business —

Most people who buy things online just have to worry about their deliveries being delayed or never arriving. But some people are dealing with a different problem altogether: getting weird stuff like hair clippers face creams and sunglasses they never even ordered at all.

The Federal Trade Commission and cyber experts have been warning consumers about these deliveries which can be part of something known as “brushing” scams.

Here’s how these scams work: Third-party sellers on Amazon eBay and other online marketplaces pay people to write fake positive reviews about their products or do it themselves. To be able to post the reviews these so-called “brushers” need to trick the site into making it appear that a legitimate transaction took place. So they’ll use a fake account to place gift orders and address them to a random person whose name and address they find online. Then instead of actually mailing the item for which they want to post a review the brushers will send a cheap often lightweight item that costs less to ship.

Sending an item (even the wrong one) creates a tracking number and when the package is delivered it enables brushers to write a verified review. If you’re on the receiving end you usually aren’t charged for the purchase and your real account isn’t hacked — but you are left in the dark as to who is repeatedly sending the mystery packages. In many cases there’s no return address. You don’t need to worry that anything bad has happened to you or will happen to you if you get a package that might be part of a brushing scam experts say. But we all need to be concerned about the scams affecting reviews we rely on when buying products.

Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” Jen Blinn

Brushing scams reportedly took off on e-commerce sites in China around five years ago. They resurfaced in headlines last summer when all 50 states issued warnings about mysterious unsolicited packages of seeds that people across the nation received in the mail.

But it’s not just seeds. Unsuspecting recipients have also found boxes with goods ranging from dog pooper-scoopers to power cords to soap dispensers on their doorsteps.

Jen Blinn of Thousand Oaks California told CNN Business she has been receiving random packages since June including most recently a briefcase a backpack a hair straightener and a coffee-cup warmer.

“Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” she said. Blinn notified Amazon of the issue but a customer service agent “didn’t really understand what I was saying. She obviously didn’t know about it” she said. The agent looked at Blinn’s account and found nothing wrong with it.

Jen Blinn holds up some of the unusual items she received in Amazon packages. She didn't order these goods and doesn't know who sent them to her. CNN

It’s not illegal to send customers unordered merchandise. But “the [Federal Trade Commission] has long gone after marketers that use fake reviews” said David Vladeck a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and a law professor at Georgetown University.

Amazon says its policy prohibits sellers sending unsolicited merchandise to customers and that sellers can be removed from the site for doing so.

“Third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and we take action on those who violate our policies including withholding payments suspending or removing selling privileges or working with law enforcement” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Amazon would not say how how many brushing scams have been found on the site or how many sellers have been removed due to these scams.

An eBay spokesperson said in an email that brushing schemes “do not appear to be highly prevalent” on the site. It violates eBay policy to send unsolicited merchandise to customers or falsify reviews and can result in eBay restricting sellers’ accounts or suspending them from the site.

Experts also say it’s difficult to quantify the frequency of such scams because it can be hard for companies to know whether reviews are fake and scams often go unreported by consumers.

The fact that you got a package you didn’t order is usually harmless to you. The harm is to people who rely on reviews when deciding on a purchase said Chris McCabe a former policy enforcement investigator at Amazon tasked with stopping scams and fraud. He is now a consultant to sellers on the site.

The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews” Chris McCabe consultant and former Amazon policy enforcement investigator

“The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews because they might see 100 positive reviews and then there may only be 60 or 70 of them that are legitimate” he said.

The likelihood that a consumer will buy a product that has five reviews is 270% higher than the likelihood they will buy a product with zero reviews according to a 2017 report by Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center.

Some fake reviews are also being driven by Facebook groups where sellers offer buyers money if they write positive product reviews said McCabe. Amazon and Facebook should work together to crack down on these groups he said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company analyzes more than 10 million reviews every week to try to keep fake ones from being published and that it provides details of its investigations to social media companies “so they can stop these bad actors from abusing their platforms.”

A Facebook spokesperson said in an email that when the company is told of groups that may encourage fake reviews it reviews them and removes them if they violate its policies.

Unwanted sheets and Shiatsu massagers

For consumers the unexpected deliveries can be jarring. The packages Ashanté Nicole never ordered started arriving at her home in Fort Lauderdale Florida in 2019.

iPhone and portable car chargers. An iPad case. A heated shiatsu massage. A nail cleaning brush and a blow dryer. Sheets. A mattress cover. A floppy fish toy.

They didn’t have return addresses so Nicole wasn’t sure who was sending the packages. She reached out to Amazon to try to stop them from coming but they still keep arriving at her doorstep.

“It was just kind of a little bit concerning because I don’t know who has my information” she said. “I don’t know what they’re going to send me. Like they could send something illegal and then I’m in trouble because I didn’t know whoever that person was or what they were sending me.”

If you get merchandise you didn’t order it could mean that scammers have created an account in your name or taken over your account an FTC spokesperson said in an email. Scammers may have even created new accounts in other names tied to your address allowing them to post lots of seemingly-real reviews.

“We recommend keeping an eye on your online shopping accounts. If you spot activity that isn’t yours report it to the site right away and think about changing your password for that site” the spokesperson said.

There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” Ashanté Nicole

Nicole feels she has done all she can by alerting Amazon each time unsolicited packages from the retailer arrive at her doorstep.

“There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” she said.

Amazon declined to comment directly on Nicole and Blinn’s accounts but said if a customer receives a package that was unsolicited they should contact Amazon’s customer service team.

Nicole said she hopes Amazon will do more to stop brushing and ban sellers who participate in the scams.

“I just think they need to be a little bit more concerned with shutting those stores down and making sure those sellers can’t use the platform.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9mZWRleC1kcml2ZXItZGllcy1hZnRlci1zZW1pLXRydWNrLXBsdW1tZXRzLW9mZi1kb3dudG93bi1kYWxsYXMtb3ZlcnBhc3Mv0gGDAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9mZWRleC1kcml2ZXItZGllcy1hZnRlci1zZW1pLXRydWNrLXBsdW1tZXRzLW9mZi1kb3dudG93bi1kYWxsYXMtb3ZlcnBhc3MvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Driver of FedEx truck killed when it plunges off I-345 overpass in downtown Dallas,"The driver of a FedEx truck was killed Saturday morning when it crashed through a guardrail on the Interstate 345 overpass in downtown Dallas and plunged to Cesar Chavez Boulevard.

But the use of these services has also highlighted another issue: the food delivery fee dramatically increases what the customer pays and takes a huge cut from restaurants.

To encourage customers to use their services many food delivery companies have promised deals like low-cost delivery or even a free delivery fee but consumers may be faced with secret or hidden charges nonetheless.

Food delivery fees are notoriously high making your food purchases up to 91% more expensive according to an investigation by The New York Times.

The food delivery fee charged on top of the cost of the actual food itself can comprise a number of different things including tax service costs and the delivery fee sometimes all on the same line. Some restaurants also increase the prices of food ordered through these delivery apps. A tip for the driver however is not included and would be an additional expense.

These fees can be dramatic and impact consumers and restaurants alike.

For years consumers have complained about the food delivery fee problem. Some say that they were hit with unexpected and undisclosed markups on their food deliveries. A class action lawsuit was filed in 2016 against DoorDash alleging the company charged markups of at least a few dollars without customers’ knowledge.

GrubHub has been hit with a similar class action lawsuit over its fees allegedly charging higher delivery fees than those it lists on the app.

Even when these third-party delivery service apps offer a free or low-cost food delivery fee the customer may not be left paying for just the food as they might expect. Instead they may face additional costs like tax convenience fees service costs and inflated food prices as well as an optional tip for the driver.

Toll on Restaurants

Third-party food delivery services are also taking a toll on restaurants. In April 2020 pizza restaurant owner Giuseppe Badalamenti wrote a viral Facebook post showing that out of the $1042.63 worth of orders his restaurant’s customers placed through GrubHub the previous month the fees pocketed by the company left the restaurant making only $376.54 through the service.

Some states and cities across the country have chosen to cap the food delivery fee charged by third-party services in order to help keep local businesses afloat during the pandemic including big cities like New York City Minneapolis Chicago and are now moving to smaller areas like the county of Schenectady in New York which have introduced a food delivery fee cap of 15%. The states of Washington and Oregon have also introduced 15% caps and a similar bill in Massachusetts is currently pending Gov. Baker’s signature.

If you were charged a hidden food delivery fee by a third-party app like GrubHub Postmates DoorDash Caviar or Uber Eats you may be able to join a class action lawsuit investigation and pursue compensation. This investigation is looking for California consumers in particular who may have been charged hidden fees by these companies.

Courier Staff Writer

Professional athletes are fully aware that their basketball football baseball or hockey careers can’t last forever.

COURIER

EXCLUSIVE

After retirement some athletes go into coaching such as Bill Cowher the former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach. Cowher played five seasons in the NFL before getting into coaching eventually becoming Steelers head coach in 1992 and winning Super Bowl XL after the 2005 season.

Aliquippa’s own Tony Dorsett a Hall of Fame running back with the Dallas Cowboys enjoyed a successful stint in the business world after his playing days ended in 1988.

Michael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest basketball player of all-time but even he wanted to accomplish more after retirement. He went on to become the NBA’s second-ever Black majority owner of a franchise the Charlotte Hornets.

Ashley Battle used her intellect passion and determination to succeed on the court during a six-year career in the WNBA and overseas. She’s used the same attributes to craft a substantive career after retiring from the game in 2011 due to a number of injuries.

Battle became an associate product line manager for Nike’s “Jordan Brand” entity in September 2020. Once the coronavirus pandemic is controlled she told the New Pittsburgh Courier she’ll be moving to Portland Oregon to work at Nike headquarters. But for now she works remotely from Pittsburgh.

That’s right Pittsburgh where it all began for Battle.

The Manchester neighborhood is where Battle was born and raised attending Manchester Elementary School and for middle school she attended Frick. Battle had the gift of basketball early on playing for the Western Pennsylvania Bruins AAU team at age 12. Her team ended up winning the national championship that year and by the time she reached the seventh grade Battle received her first letter of recruitment to play college ball at William & Mary a university in Virginia.

For high school Battle made the decision to play for The Linsly School a private boarding school in Wheeling W.Va. There she recalls “breaking every record known to mankind” becoming a must-see attraction each time she hit the court.

The 6-foot Battle said she was recruited by pretty much “every school except North Carolina and Tennessee.” She narrowed her final choices for collegiate play to Connecticut and Penn State. In November 1999 as a high school senior Battle ultimately chose Connecticut (UCONN) the school that had come into prominence as a women’s college basketball powerhouse after winning the 1995 national championship. The university also was the home of Swin Cash the mighty McKeesport basketball star who had been on the UCONN team for a full year before Battle signed.

At UCONN Battle and the Huskies flourished with a capital “F.” Not only had the team won its second national championship in 2000 right before Battle arrived on campus but UCONN won three straight national titles from 2002-2004 Battle right there on the court playing either shooting guard or small forward for the Huskies basking in the team’s glory.

ASHLEY BATTLE won three titles at UCONN.

During her sophomore season in 2003 she was named the Big East Defensive Player of the Year and had earned the reputation of being one of the best defensive players in the country.

Battle wasn’t sure she would be drafted in the WNBA after her UCONN days were over in 2005. That label of Battle being a “defensive player” seemed to scare some WNBA teams away but Battle had a good WNBA draft combine and she indeed was drafted No. 25 overall to the Seattle Storm.

Being cut and the comeback

The Women’s National Basketball Association in 2005 had names that are considered WNBA legends today—Sheryl Swoopes of the Houston Comets; Chamique Holdsclaw of the Los Angeles Sparks; Diana Taurasi Battle’s former teammate at UCONN who played with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury; Tamika Catchings of the Indiana Fever; and Lisa Leslie of the Sparks.

Battle had been selected to play for the Storm who made a thunderous bang the season prior winning the 2004 WNBA Championship over the Connecticut Sun. Battle was joining a team loaded with talent including Finals MVP Betty Lennox Lauren Jackson and former UCONN standout Sue Bird.

The Storm also had a legendary head coach Anne Donovan who by winning the 2004 WNBA title became the first woman to win a WNBA championship as a head coach. Van Chancellor won as head coach of the Comets for the first four WNBA Championships (1997-2000) Michael Cooper won the next two WNBA titles as head coach of the Sparks (2001-2002) and Bill Laimbeer won the 2003 WNBA title as head coach of the Detroit Shock.

Battle recalls playing during the preseason games with the Storm her rookie season but when the regular season began she rarely saw the court. She appeared in two regular season games and right before the All-Star break in July 2005 Donovan informed Battle that she had been cut from the team.

“I thanked her (Donovan) for the opportunity and I left” Battle told the Courier.

Battle returned to Pittsburgh during that stressful month of July 2005 on the outside of the WNBA.

But she was determined to get back in.

She didn’t need her mother Deborah Blackwell Battle to give her any inspirational vitamins. Deborah Battle according to daughter Ashley had given her buckets of advice on life early on in her basketball career dating back to Manchester Elementary School when she was outplaying the boys on the basketball court there. Ashley Battle said her mother always allowed her to make her own decisions—about going to The Linsly School or UCONN—“She never once tried to sway me one way or another because this was the life I had to live” Ashley Battle told the Courier.

During this period of reflection in Pittsburgh in 2005 mom and other family members “didn’t have to say anything” Ashley Battle recalled. “I was very determined to make a team and play in the WNBA. I already knew what I had to do I knew what was needed of me I knew what I needed to do to get better.”

Battle headed overseas to play basketball and feverishly worked on her shot her one-on-one skills and soon showed the doubters that she was more than just a defensive player. “It’s crazy because I scored more than 1000 points at UCONN” Battle said.

In 2006 Battle was back in. This time she was headed to The Big Apple New York City where she would play with the WNBA’s New York Liberty for the next four seasons. She played in all but one of the team’s 34 games in 2006 averaging 14 minutes 4.3 points and 1.9 rebounds per game. Her next season 2007 was her best in the WNBA. She played in all 34 games upped her minutes to 22.3 per game and upped her points per game to 7.4 with nearly 4 rebounds per contest. Battle was a steady tenacious player for the Liberty appearing in all the team’s games the following two years (2008 2009) averaging about 4.5 points and 2.1 rebounds per game.

In 2010 Battle played for the San Antonio Silver Stars where she played in five regular season games and the playoffs but she also was hindered by injuries. A sciatic nerve issue with pain shooting down her leg along with torn ligaments in her ankle left Battle to discontinue playing after the 2010 season.

A new career(s)

After a collegiate career in which Ashley Battle played in nearly 150 games scored more than 1050 points snared nearly 700 rebounds and won three national championships; and a WNBA career that included more than 150 games played nearly 750 points scored more than 350 rebounds collected and three playoff appearances what was next?

The bank.

Literally the bank as in Fifth-Third Bank which operated branches in Pittsburgh as far back as a decade ago. Battle began working at Fifth-Third eventually running her own branch on the North Side. As she performed those duties she became head coach of the Chartiers Valley High School girls basketball team in May 2013.

A few years later she landed back in Connecticut this time as the director of new business development at Barnum Financial Group a financial planning and consulting services company. The connections she made in these various positions landed her into the business side of the NBA where Battle helped female international players with aspirations to play in the U.S. in the WNBA or collegiately. (Although the WNBA has its own commissioner the WNBA was started by and is owned by the NBA.)

This past summer Battle became one of the members of the second cohort of the “Women In Nike” two-year program a partnership between the WNBA and Nike which provides dynamic work experience for retired or retiring WNBA players while building the next generation of talent at Nike.

Battle was hired to work on Nike’s “Jordan” brand as an associate product line manager. A typical workday currently involves managing the process of sneaker development in the kids and women’s divisions for the “Jordan 23 Engineered” line. She must be on top of the latest fashion trends then steer the shoe designers to build the shoe and the corresponding color waves “that we think will work well for consumers” Battle 38 told the Courier.

Anyone who’s into sneakers knows that if a shoe doesn’t have the right colors blended the right way and isn’t in style it just won’t sell. No one will want to rock them. With a brand as legendary as Jordan it’s gotta be right. It’s what people have come to expect from the brand.

That’s why Battle said she works on shoes that are going to be released say in the fall of 2022 or on a holiday in 2023. “So in a typical day I don’t know what year it is” she joked.

When the pandemic clears Battle will leave Pittsburgh and head to Portland the site of Nike’s headquarters. Who knows…she could be at Nike for a “very long time” she said. Her ultimate goal is to be part of the front office of a basketball team such as a general manager. But for now “I’m enjoying what I’m doing thus far” Battle the Pittsburgh native told the Courier “and I feel like there’s a lot of growth in the different categories that I’m in. It gives me the opportunity to grow a brand and grow the women’s platform better than what it is currently.”

Pittsburgh adores its sports heroes. They say that Western Pennsylvania is more known for its football than its basketball. But for the Ashley Battles the Tanisha Wrights the Swin Cashes the Shatori Walker-Kimbroughs and other African American female basketball legends from the Pittsburgh area there’s no greater sport.

During an interview at the WNBA’s Inspiring Women Luncheon in 2018 Battle said she hopes her journey from Manchester to earning a bachelor’s degree from UCONN to playing professional basketball and now succeeding in the corporate world inspires young women. “Just really showing them that people from the inner-city can make it” Battle said “and showing them that there’s a way there’s an opportunity. Take care of yourself do your work and be diligent and make smart decisions.”

If used on a large scale solar-powered cars not only help with environmental pollution but also noise pollution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtcG93ZXJ3YWxsLWNvbW11bml0eS1hdXN0cmFsaWEtdmlydHVhbC1wb3dlci1wbGFudC_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYXJhdGkuY29tL3Rlc2xhLXBvd2Vyd2FsbC1jb21tdW5pdHktYXVzdHJhbGlhLXZpcnR1YWwtcG93ZXItcGxhbnQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Powerwalls selected for first 100% solar and battery neighborhood in Australia,"By

Economic Development Queensland (EDQ) recently announced a landmark deal with Tesla for the use of its Powerwall 2 batteries in a massive sustainability community project. The initiative aims to establish the first government-backed community in Australia that is 100% powered by solar energy and batteries.

The project would involve 80 homes in the Brisbane suburb of Oxley with each home receiving a AU$5000 rebate if they purchase a heavily discounted package for the Tesla batteries and solar panels from Natural Solar. All homes in the community would come with solar panels batteries heat pump hot water systems WiFi air conditioning and electric vehicle charging equipment.

Each home in the community would be fitted with seventeen 365w solar panels from Natural Solar and one 13.5 kWh Tesla Powerwall 2 battery. Such a setup is expected to generate an average of 9000 kWh annually which equates to an estimated savings of AU$2100 per year for every household.

Considering that the homes in the Oxley project are expected to generate 120% of their electricity needs as well as the fact that each house could store energy in their Tesla Powerwall batteries homeowners would have the option to sell surplus power on the energy market. This also allows the homes in the Oxley project to become part of Australia’s Virtual Power Plants initiative.

In a statement to local news outlets Michael Kane from Economic Development Queensland highlighted the potential of virtual power plants to Australia’s power grid. He also noted that interest has been fairly high about such projects among consumers. “They’re little power stations and they’re generating more than enough power for each individual home. The market interest has been very strong” he said.

Tesla is currently building a massive virtual power plant in South Australia. The system which is expected to involve 50000 homes would deliver 250MW of solar energy and store 650MWh of backup energy for the region. This makes Tesla’s South Australia virtual power plant far larger than battery installations such as the Hornsdale Power Reserve which is one of the world’s largest batteries.

South Bend Tribune

North Liberty Elementary will become the first public school in St. Joseph County to become virtually free from electricity bills when it completes an 846-panel solar field in the middle of March.

The John Glenn School District will pay for the $700000 project with more than $7 million in new bonds it has issued with the main focus on improving energy efficiency in the district’s buildings.

“The bonds are replacing others that were paid off so it won’t result in increased taxes” said Superintendent Chris Winchell.

In fact the energy savings from the solar field new windows LED lights and other improvements will help the district save thousands of dollars moving forward.

“The improvements will help us stay within budget while maintaining programs for students” said Winchell adding that the planned work should largely be completed before the start of the new school year.

The idea of cutting costs by focusing on energy savings is one that’s been embraced by schools universities nonprofits and even government agencies throughout Indiana and across the country.

When it comes to total output Indiana schools rank fifth in the nation — behind only California New Jersey Arizona and Massachusetts — with 41070 kW in solar capacity according to a September 2020 report from the Solar Foundation a nonprofit that advocates for solar usage.

And they hold a sizable lead on neighboring states when it comes to solar energy capacity with Michigan coming in at 26th with total capacity of 3617 kW according to the report.

Problems with school funding might be one of the reasons that solar has been embraced in Indiana as it allows districts to reduce fixed costs for utilities moving forward according to experts.

But solar also allows schools to reduce their carbon footprint since it produces electricity without the use of fossil fuels and it provides an educational component for students. At North Liberty for example a monitor will be placed in the foyer or some other common area where students can witness the amount of power being produced at any given moment.

“From a student’s perspective it’s a whole lot different to see something with your own eyes rather than just reading about it and seeing pictures in a book” said Randy Romer principal at North Liberty. “They’re excited about it but so are the teachers.”

Even at the elementary school level the solar panels can be incorporated into the curriculum with students perhaps observing how power output varies for example on a cloudy day compared to a sunny day or at different times of the year Romer explained.

The solar field will occupy about a half-acre parcel that wasn’t serving any purpose and will be monitored and maintained by Johnson Melloh Solutions of Indianapolis.

Winchell said the solar is a first step into renewable energy for the district but he hopes it serves as a catalyst for a grades 5-through-12 magnet that might include an outdoor lab with crops and even some animals.

“We already have a great agriculture program” he said. “This could help us expand what we’re able to offer.”

An educational component

Providing an educational component to go along with the cost savings inherent in solar is becoming increasingly common among companies that design install and maintain solar panels for schools universities and other institutions across the country said Nathan Vogel senior vice president of marketing and brand enhancement at South Bend-based Inovateus Solar.

“It connects in nicely with the growing emphasis on STEM education throughout the schools” said Vogel. In addition costs for solar have come down about 85% over the past 10 years and creative financing programs have been developed to help schools and nonprofits handle the upfront costs.

For the past several years Goshen Community Schools has leased space on the roof of the high school to a solar operator and in 2020 it started its own solar fields at Model Elementary and Prairie View Elementary. Those projects will be paid for with the money the district saves each year — estimated as high as $148000 — on its utility bills said Judy Miller energy education specialist for the district.

“There are environmental and educational components but it also allows us to save money and control expenses” said Miller. “I believe our payoff is estimated at about five years.”

Even if they’ve been sitting on the sideline wondering about the feasibility of solar fields some schools and nonprofits in Indiana have been motivated to take action in recent years because of legislation that was passed in 2017 that would do away with net metering for projects not completed by July 1 2022.

Net metering is an important financing component for schools and others interested in installing solar equipment because it requires utility companies to credit solar producers at the same rate they charge retail customers.

At a school with a solar field for example excess electricity might go back into the electrical grid on days when there is plentiful sunshine and electrical consumption is low.

In an effort to encourage the installation of solar equipment and to account for its high price tag Indiana once required utilities to credit solar producers the same amount they charge other customers for 30 years.

But that time frame was cut down to 2032 for projects installed after the legislation was passed and it will be cut again for projects completed after July 2022 said Kerwin Olson executive director of the consumer advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition.

“It’s a big issue for us this legislative session” said Olson. “There are three good bills attempting to extend the deadline from two to five years beyond the 2022 deadline.”

If efforts to extend the deadline fail solar projects completed after July 2022 would be reimbursed only at the wholesale rate plus 25%. “It doubles if not triples the payoff period” said Olson making it more difficult to justify the upfront expense.

Utilities have argued that net metering is tantamount to a subsidy for solar that is being paid for by other consumers but Olson argued that solar generation in Indiana — despite the widespread adoption by schools — is nowhere near the level that it’s hurting utilities.

“Basically net metering allows an even swap for excess energy sent to the grid” Olson said. “When a school or other solar producer needs electricity they’re credited at the same rate that utilities charge other consumers.”

The extension would also allow the state to continue working on a new payment formula whereby solar users are fairly compensated for their electricity while also maintaining the long-term strength of utility companies said Olson.

If the extension for net metering goes away expect a flurry of installations until the summer of 2022 as schools and others rush for the higher reimbursement rate and the shorter payoff period.

“Everybody is in favor of utility companies that are financially strong and provide dependable power to our homes schools and businesses” said Olson. “But rates don’t have to serve as a disincentive for schools and municipalities looking to save money either.”

Though solar is providing a learning opportunity for schools Winchell said finances were the driving factor behind the decision to spend on solar panels LED lighting and other energy-saving measures.

“You really have to have a sound financial plan to protect your programs and the best way to do that is to have a strong facilities plan” said the John Glenn superintendent. “Controlling utility costs helps us achieve those goals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndicnouY29tL25ld3MvZGVzcGl0ZS1zdHJpY3Rlci1yZWd1bGF0aW9ucy13YnItcmVzaWRlbnRzLXdhcnktb2YtbmV3LXNvbGFyLXBsYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Despite stricter regulations WBR residents wary of new solar plant,"Despite stricter regulations WBR residents wary of new solar plant

BATON ROUGE - A proposed solar power plant planned for West Baton Rouge Parish is back on track after a moratorium on solar farms is lifted.

Power plants will now be required to secure a special use permit to make sure they follow any special guidelines for the project.

""The one they put on on Rosedale Road didn't turn out quite as good as we

thought it would look"" Parish President Pee Wee Berthelot said.

The parish moved to the special permit process for solar plants after residents

complained about the the first solar farm on Rosedale Road.

Homeowners said the farm was not well kept and was not supposed be visible

from the road.

""We're are going to look at each one individually. It may work for some

and may not work out for other places"" Berthelot said.

""I don't thing I'd like it"" James Sonier said.

Sonier owns a house right across the road where the proposed solar

project could be built: 1200 acres in the Bueche Road area. It would be the largest solar plant in the state.

""I don't think I want to look at those many solar panels right in front of the house"" Sonnier said.

Construction on the proposed solar farm is still a long way off. Property owners in the area said they are still in negotiations with the California-based developers behind the project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5jZ3RuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDEtMjQvSGVhZGluZy10by10aGUtc3VuLUNoaW5hLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1pdHMtc29sYXItcHJvYmUtaW4tMjAyMi1YamU2d1lFcU1VL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmNndG4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS0wMS0yNC9IZWFkaW5nLXRvLXRoZS1zdW4tQ2hpbmEtZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWl0cy1zb2xhci1wcm9iZS1pbi0yMDIyLVhqZTZ3WUVxTVUvc2hhcmVfYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dancing with the sun China expected to launch its solar probe in 2022,"Prototype of the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) being displayed in a video made by Xinhua News Agency.

Prototype of the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) being displayed in a video made by Xinhua News Agency.

The probe will monitor solar storms at least one to three days ahead of their arrival which is expected to facilitate early warnings of damage to the Earth's electromagnetic environment Gan said.

Carrying a solar telescope a magnetic imager and an X-ray imager ASO-S will observe solar activities and stormy atmosphere on the star on a 24-hour basis according to Gan Weiqun chief scientist of the ASO-S program at CAS' Purple Mountain Observatory.

The probe named Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) will orbit on the sun-synchronous orbit 720 kilometers above the Earth for at least four years said researchers.

China is expected to launch its first solar probe in the first half of 2022 making forays into sun exploration according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on Friday.

NASA launched its Parker Solar Probe to space in 2018. The probe completed three of 24 planned passes through never-before-explored parts of the sun's atmosphere the corona and eventually arrived at about 6.1 million kilometers of the sun's surface making it the closest-ever spacecraft to the sun.

""The scientific mission is different between Parker and ASO-S"" said Gan. Parker intended to have a closer observation to the sun while ASO-S is designed to track the sun's magnetic fields and activities.

Although the ASO-S is not as close to the sun as Parker it is able to bring more payloads than Parker said Gan. Because the more distant the probe goes the more fuel the probe has to consume which in turn will limit the payload weight.

""This will also allow the probe to carry out more scientific tasks"" he added.

Every 11 years or so the sun's magnetic field goes through a cycle known as the Solar Cycle during which the sun's north poles and south poles would switch places and a series of solar storms would erupt.

Giant eruptions which increase during the Solar Cycle send powerful bursts of energy and material into space. These activities impact the satellite systems and radio communications on Earth with extreme ones posing threats to electricity grids according to NASA.

With the last Solar Cycle occurring in late October 2003 the star is soon to enter its next one. It is estimated to reach its peak radiation around 2025 said Gan saying the ASO-S may be able to obtain detailed records of solar activities during its rise to the peak years.

Since the 1960s more than 70 satellites related to solar observation have been launched globally. The ASO-S program was first proposed in 2011 and officially approved by the CAS in 2017.

The prototype performances have been tested including environmental and heat experiments according to news published on the CAS website on January 13.

The final product is expected to be finished by the end of the year it added."

According to Argo’s Friday release the upgraded tech is more affordable and much closer to being automotive grade which basically means that it can withstand tons of different climates and extreme conditions. Whether your car is baking in the Texas sun or battling a Minnesota blizzard this tech will need to be functioning at its best.

Argo focused on quite a few different areas for improvement but the most important are its lidar radar and camera technologies.

Previously Argo’s lidar system was a little bit scattered. Now it’s been condensed into a single unit that has a longer visual range which basically means that it’s more efficient and can make better predictions about what it can see ahead of you. Plus the company added fans and water jets to help the system regulate its own temperature and cleanliness. The upgraded radar also focuses on long-range improvements which means the car will be able to travel faster.

Cameras are another important factor and Argo has added both near-field and far-field high-definition cameras that can cope with changing—and challenging—lighting situations. Even when you’re dealing with glaring headlights in the pitch black night Argo is going to be able to keep your car on course. Always a good thing.

To really stay on top of things Argo is using two self-driving computer systems. The first and main system called the Autonomous Vehicle System takes on pretty much all of the car’s autonomous technologies. So any processing and directing that needs to be done will come from this computer. The second accurately titled the Complementary Autonomous Vehicle System hosts some of the collision avoidance technology but is primarily there as a backup in case the first computer fails.

All of which is very cool stuff—but it’s still difficult to evaluate Argo’s technology in light of say updates that Waymo has made. Right now we can really only judge by appearances and Argo still hasn’t updated the body armor its cars have to wear to actually be able to use all this new tech. Maybe that’s its next step.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3JkLW11c3RhbmctbWFjaC1lLWdldHMtY29vbC1uZXctbG9vay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Mustang Mach-E Gets Cool New Look,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3JkLW11c3RhbmctbWFjaC1lLWdldHMtY29vbC1uZXctbG9vay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8xOTcwcy1kZWNhZGUtc3RyaWtlLXdvcmtlcnMtbGFib3ItaGlzdG9yedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 1970s: Decade of the Rank and File,"The US Bureau of Labor Statistics in its accounting of the year 1970 revealed an extraordinary statistic: there had been in that year alone 5716 strikes involving 3 million workers. The year 1970 saw strikes in almost every employment category. Many seen from the outside were inconsequential affairs; others shook the nation. In Chicago a truckers’ strike — “a revolt against the union leadership” according to the New York Times — spread nationwide including to Los Angeles and Cleveland where roving pickets fought with police and national guardsmen. The Times reported that in Cleveland Strikers have set up a roving patrol system that they say can muster 300 men within an hour to stop any truck moving goods in the area. The strikers are allowing trucks carrying food drugs and beer to continue but they have become outraged when they have found food trucks carrying other cargo. There has been rock throwing windshields have been smashed tires slashed and air hoses cut. The United Press reckoned that 500000 people were out of work as a result of the strike. In New York City postal workers kicked off the year with a national wildcat strike which was against federal law. Rank-and-file workers organized the strike and no mail moved in the nations’ major cities. The strike lasted eight days in New York despite the deployment of 30000 national guardsmen. In total some 200000 workers participated in the largest wildcat strike ever. New York according to the Economist became “the city of strikes.” Telephone workers struck for eight months. City workers shut down the bridges that connected the boroughs with Manhattan in what came to be known as the “drawbridge strike.” This was just the beginning. In the decade that followed — or the “long seventies” lasting from 1965 to 1981 — the United States experienced a strike wave like few others. Uniquely the ’70s strikes were often led by “restless” young workers whose grievances went far beyond the bread-and-butter disputes typical of the postwar decades. These disputes included the entire range of strikes: wildcats and sit-downs grievance strikes as well as contract rejections and contested local union elections often initiated by a rank and file. The strikes taken together were reflective of the rebellious movements of the era. The 1972 strike at the General Motors colossal plant at Lordstown Ohio was led by long-haired unshaven workers. The president of the local was Gary Bryner then twenty-nine years old. Lordstown wrote Studs Terkel “was the Woodstock of the working man.” Ed Sadlowski just thirty-four when he challenged the leadership of the United Steelworkers in District 31 (Chicago-Gary 128000 members) spoke for a generation: I consider democracy within the union to be the most important single issue. If the steelworkers had been consulted they never would have agreed to an International Executive Board which excluded blacks Latinos and women. If the steelworkers were consulted they would insist on their right to vote on union contracts in the same manner other unions do. They rightfully feel they are not running their own affairs and are not being represented on the district level. The Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) electrified black workers as well as the Left. Its origins and that of the black caucus movement that followed were in ranks of the workers recruited in the late ’60s: young black workers often Vietnam veterans with little tolerance for racist foremen. Paul Dietsch a spokesperson for the Fraternal Association of Steel Haulers (FASH) suggested that the steel haulers were the “Black Panthers of the Working Class.” Terkel called the workers’ rebellion the “new new left.” In the auto plants workers struck to “humanize working conditions”; coal miners fought for an end to chronic poverty in Appalachia; black workers demanded access integration and equality; truckers called for union democracy; UPS workers rebelled against “being treated like machines”; millions of workers clearly wanted something better in life. Black workers Latinos women and young workers brought their movements into the workplace. With their demand for democracy in their unions workers sought to make these institutions their own recalling the students’ demand for self-government or “participatory democracy.” The strikes taken together were reflective of the rebellious movements of the era. That is they fought for control of their jobs. And as their signs so often said they fought for “dignity” a central demand of course of the southern civil rights movement. Commonly they called themselves “radicals;” they were defiant and courageous advocates of direct action to change their world. Importantly they did this in the context of a general challenge to authority and they did this in the shadow of the great spectacle of radical conflict: the Tet Offensive the Paris Spring the Black Panthers Kent State Jackson State Attica.

“The Strike Movement Continued Uninterrupted” This then was not the labor movement of the 1950 and ’60s though those decades too had been at times places of workplace turmoil. Nevertheless in 1956 George Meany president of the AFL-CIO for twenty-four years (1955–79) speaking to the convention of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) reassured the delegates assembled there: I never went on strike in my life never ordered anyone else to run a strike never had anything to do with a picket line . . . there is not a great difference between the things I stand for and the things that NAM leaders stand for. I stand for the profit system. I believe in the profit system. I believe in the free enterprise system completely. In another setting Walter Reuther president of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) complained that “these hundreds of thousands of young workers . . . They don’t know where they came from. They don’t know where they’re going.” The working class that emerged in the late ’60s had been transformed by technology by demographics and by a cultural revolution. In its vanguard were teachers whose wildcat strikes had swept through districts large and small north and south and into the West in the new spirit of rebellion. They were far from alone but the sight wrote the historian David Montgomery “of school teachers hospital workers and garbage men going off to jail for violating injunctions is becoming routine. And the teachers are demonstrating that arbitrary authority is as common and as intolerable in education as it is in the factories.” Their ranks had been swollen by the great expansion of higher education in the ’60s. They with the explosion of the baby boomers argued Montgomery represented the basis of a “new unionism.” With their demand for democracy in their unions workers sought to make these institutions their own. There had been strikes in the 1950s and ’60s; some including the 1959 strike of steelworkers were massive. There were in fact many strikes certainly by today’s standards yet these were often routine affairs; picket lines were frequently token. Workers went hunting repaired the house or just had a vacation. The union officers were left to settle disputes behind closed doors in smoked-filled rooms. The trade union leaders had become increasingly wedded to collaboration with the employers in a sort of modus vivendi. The unions one-party organizations typically were led by old men or bland bureaucrats sometimes by gangsters nearly all lifers (honorable exceptions aside). They dominated the internal life of “the machines” and looked to the Democrats and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for remediation. Dave Beck the Teamsters’ leader declared that “Unions are big business.” These leaders offered peace to the employers above all on the shop floor and in return workers expected (and often got) steadily rising wages plus expanding benefit packages — improvements they could count on. In return the employers got peace — sometimes enforced by the union itself as shop stewards often appointed became policemen on the beat — and the promise of uninterrupted production in a period of high profitability. At the same time whatever the merits of this system these were restricted to a core of union members skilled workers and the inheritors of the industrial wars of the ’30s. The majority of workers were excluded — women people of color farmworkers and service workers. In truth this system sometimes referred to as the “New Deal system” never fully worked; the truce between labor and capital was always partial and temporary; it always favored the employers. In addition it was based on a steadily expanding economy of the postwar boom — the years of prosperity fueled by war and war production — which came to an end in the late-’60s crisis of profitability and the employers’ response to it. The Vietnam War too had fueled economic expansion but by the end of the ’60s its costs were sending prices soaring. The working class that emerged in the late ’60s had been transformed by technology by demographics and by a cultural revolution. In these changing conditions collaboration gave way to conflict and an employers’ offensive marked by their resistance to wage and benefit demands to stubborn opposition to organizing and perhaps above all on the “shop floor” to the speedup typified by line speed in the assembly plants and the United Parcel supervisors with their time and motion stopwatch mania. In 1971 hard-pressed by the shippers West Coast longshoremen defied the flag wavers with a strike that threatened the flow of military goods and personnel to Vietnam. Richard Nixon asserting that the strike undermined the war effort invoked an anti-strike Taft-Hartley injunction though this failed to deter longshoremen from conducting the longest waterfront strike in US history. The strike organized in opposition to the union’s leadership was the first coastwide strike since 1934. The number of strikes remained high throughout the decade — they amounted to tens of thousands and only fell off dramatically in 1982. The strike wave continued in “good” times and bad. The strike count in 1974 nearly matched that of 1970 yet it took place amid the worst recession since the 1930s clearly signaling that the postwar economic boom was over. Long lines at unemployment offices became the norm as did free food distribution in industrial centers. In addition this recession was accompanied by inflation — hence the term “stagflation” — and with it increasing pressure on workers to resist. In 1975 the economy expanded again but millions of jobs had been lost. Instability gave rise to insecurity; Merle Haggard’s 1974 “If We Make It Through December” topped the charts at Akron’s radio WSLR. In boom and bust the strike movement continued uninterrupted if unpredictably. The coal miners exemplified this — the ability of workers to win great victories yet also alas the limitations of trade unionism. On November 12 1974 negotiations stalled and 120000 miners walked off their jobs honoring their tradition of “no contract no work.” The United Mine Workers (UMWA) had long been the backbone of American labor; as the largest union in the ’30s it had bankrolled the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Its great battles were legendary — Ludlow Blair Mountain Harlan County. In the 1960s however it was a shadow of its former self. In 1950 there were 416000 working miners; in 1959 just 180000 remained at work in the coalfields. John L. Lewis the autocratic leader of the union for half the century had in the ’50s negotiated away the miners’ jobs accepting as inevitable the mechanization of mining while receiving next to nothing for miners in return. In 1963 Tony Boyle a nonentity from Montana handpicked by Lewis inherited the leadership of the union. The result was an embattled rank and file seething under the iron hand of management in the mines. Discontent was near universal in the face of the slow-motion inevitability of the deadly black lung disease and in the stunning horror of each recurrent coal mine catastrophe. In November 1968 seventy-eight miners lost their lives in the explosion at Consolidation Coal’s No. 9 mine in Farmington West Virginia. In total one hundred thousand coal miners were believed to have been killed in the mines in the twentieth century. In 1969 Jock Yablonski a union officer in Clarksville Pennsylvania challenged Boyle but lost in an election mired in fraud. Yablonski filed suit with the Department of Labor. In response Boyle had him murdered. On New Year’s Eve three petty criminals hired in a Cleveland bar shot and fatally killed Yablonski his wife and his daughter in their beds. The Miners for Democracy (MFD) was founded at the Yablonskis’ funerals. In 1972 the US district court in Washington DC responding in part to an outraged rank and file ordered a new election. Arnold Miller a partially disabled West Virginia miner running on the slate of the MFD defeated Boyle — Boyle himself would be charged and convicted of ordering the murders. In 1974 he received three life sentences. The MFD identified itself as a rank-and-file miners’ movement. It brought together the various oppositional currents within the union uniting them with a mission of not just defeating Boyle but also of transforming the union top to bottom. In 1973 in Pittsburgh the MFD led its first UMW convention. Miners there rewrote the union’s constitution guaranteeing rank-and-file rights. In an atmosphere of jubilation they increased district autonomy and reorganized the union’s dues structure in favor of the districts and the locals. The rank and file won the right to ratify contracts. Thus inspired rank-and-file miners then set out to transform formal democracy into practical democracy and coal miners embarked upon a campaign to transform relations in the mines themselves. One result was the national strike of 1974 and 1978 as well as literally thousands of wildcat strikes. The MFD would become a model for radicals and union reformers — in many ways it still is.

Industries Hit by Recession Elsewhere the impact of recession in 1974 was devastating above all in the auto industry. The recession’s origins were in large part structural and in that sense long overdue but matters were made worse by OPEC’s (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) 1973 oil embargo in response to the Arab-Israeli War. As a result the price of oil rose by 300 percent. The recession raced through US industry. Construction unemployment reached 15 percent. The auto industry was hit hardest; unemployment in the six-county Detroit area topped 20 percent. Plants were shut down in New Jersey and California in Cleveland and St. Louis. The Ford Motor Company shut down 22 of its 66 plants in the United States idling 55 percent of its hourly paid work force of 155000. The industry would never fully recover. Closures became permanent. Rolling back the clock a chorus of employers introduced demands for deep concessions from its workers. Chrysler threatened bankruptcy. UAW president Douglas Fraser responded with this prophetic retort: “I believe the leaders of business community with few exceptions have chosen to wage a one-sided class war today in this country.” Indeed they had. In 1979 the federal government stepped in to save Chrysler bailing out the company; concessions layoffs and plant closures followed. Gas prices provoked “political” walkouts in West Virginia; striking miners demanded that the governor roll back the cost of fuel complaining they could not afford the cost of their commutes to work. Then totally unexpectedly truckers — who were independent operators — emerged in an astonishing movement that challenged the Nixon administration’s energy policies. The truckers began shutting down the nation’s highways snarling traffic and disrupting the distribution of goods and services. With CB (citizen’s band) radios and “handles” to obscure their identities they formed convoys and organized slowdowns and blockades. Thousands of tractor trailers jammed the turnpikes in Ohio and Pennsylvania. They choked off the New York–Washington DC corridor at the Delaware Bridge. The truckers’ movement was a striking example of the creativity of workers and their capacity to organize and fight. Industry already hemorrhaging was hit again. Within hours GM management was forced to close its Lordstown plant. In Toledo factory workers left their jobs to join truckers at the interchange of I-75 and the Ohio Turnpike. Exhausted by gas lines a weary public applauded. The response of the authorities including the White House was fierce; state troopers hated by the truckers waded in whenever they assembled. In Ohio the National Guard was deployed and trucks were commandeered and towed away. Interestingly interviews with truckers near Cleveland invariably turned to the Kent State killings by these same guardsmen. Ultimately the blockaders failed. Their movement however was a striking example of the creativity of workers and their capacity to organize and fight — their blockages were in certain ways analogous with the sit-down strikes of another era. They took control of their workplaces: the highways. That same year in March four Service Employees International Union (SEIU) locals representing hospital clerical maintenance and social workers rejected a wage offer from San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors and struck. They were joined by teachers who honored picket lines set up at the schools. The Municipal Railway’s mostly black motormen and conductors joined in as did transit drivers. Farmworkers joined substitute teachers to shut down school bus barns. Governor Ronald Reagan threatened to send in the National Guard but the strike continued to spread. Only an early settlement by the SEIU leaders prevented a much wider strike. In August 1974 “Everywhere you turn” wrote one reporter “someone is on strike: airline mechanics bus drivers copper miners sanitation workers firemen hospital workers painters steelworkers telephone workers. The American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) voted to shut down the state of Ohio.” The miners with their new leadership struck for twenty-eight days winning a package valued above 40 percent. The rank and file accepted this though only barely — nearly half voted to stay out longer. By the middle of 1975 employment was nearly back to pre-recession levels and the workers’ insurgency remained very much alive above all in the coalfields. In the summers of 1975 1976 and 1977 there were nationwide wildcat strikes. The first was in 1975 when 80000 miners struck for the right to strike. Then in 1976 120000 (virtually the entire workforce in the East) walked out against injunctions imposed on striking miners. The extent of the solidarity of the miners was such that a single “stranger” picket could shut down an entire shift. The strikes continued into the summer of 1977 when in anticipation of a national strike 85000 miners struck. In 1976 the number of major strikes — 5648 — nearly matched that of 1970 — 5716 — though the number of strikers was not so high. In the years between 1976 and 1979 there were again strikes nearly everywhere — that is in every sector and throughout the country. The teachers in wave after wave of strikes confounded school boards local authorities and even teachers’ unions striking and winning. By the mid-1970s according to historian Michael Honey the Southern civil rights movement had spilled over into industry so that “after decades of painful effort . . . black workers in a core of unionized factory jobs had torn down most Jim Crow barriers within their workplaces and unions.” In addition “Black Power” had migrated north; in industry it represented a tactic to force both the employers and the unions to recognize the rights and demands of black workers. The companies had recruited thousands of new young workers and a large proportion of these workers were in Detroit. The majority of the new recruits worked in unskilled often dangerous jobs performing the monotonous nerve-racking tasks that led to the high turnover and absentee rates for which the auto industry was notorious. The majority of the new recruits worked in unskilled often dangerous jobs performing the monotonous nerve-racking tasks that led to the high turnover and absentee rates for which the industry was notorious. The origins of the black caucus movement were in these conditions. In the automobile industry this movement began in wildcat strikes and the development of a revolutionary union movement spearheaded by DRUM (Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement) at Chrysler’s Dodge Main plant in Detroit. Other black autoworkers followed establishing revolutionary union movements at Eldon Road (ELRUM) Ford’s River Rouge plant (FRUM); at Chrysler’s Jefferson Avenue Assembly plant (JARUM). Workers in other industries also joined in; hospital workers organized HRUM newspaper workers NEWRU United Parcel workers UPRUM together leading to the creation of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. The revolt of black workers inspired many including white workers. It did not however lead to the unity that many hoped for certainly not in the automobile industry. When black autoworkers fighting the speed-p staged sit-in strikes in the summer of 1973 in Detroit at the Jefferson Assembly Eldon Road and Mack Avenue plants they were not for the most part supported by whites a few radicals excepted. The results for tens of thousands of workers were devastating. This alliance that did not happen together with the 1974 crash in automobile production resulted in the end of the movement in auto dashing the perspectives of two generations of radicals who had banked everything on a rebellion in auto. The steel industry once dominated US industry its scale gigantic. In the Pittsburgh region alone a dozen great mills lined the banks of the Monongahela River. Nationally hundreds of thousands worked in basic steel. In the ’70s however steelworkers were losing jobs; they faced stagnant and declining real incomes and witnessed increasing numbers of plant closings. The industry and the union blamed foreign competition but just as important was overcapacity in an aging capital-intensive industry. The steel companies used the crisis to combine jobs intensify “discipline” and increase productivity at the same time replacing older facilities with new technology. In 1973 the union agreed to the Experimental Negotiating Agreement (ENA) a national no-strike pledge that exchanged the right to strike in national bargaining for cash bonuses cost-of living adjustments and widened access to arbitration. Steelworkers retained the right to strike on local issues and in 1977 there were more than one hundred strike votes compared to just seven in 1974. All this produced a rebellion within the union first and foremost in District 31 the United Steel Workers’ (USW) largest where Sadlowski defeated the incumbent for the position of district director. The steel companies used the crisis to combine jobs intensify “discipline” and increase productivity. The insurgents proposed to end the 1973 ENA; they demanded the right to ratify contracts and sought to elect a new national leadership to mobilize the rank and file. In 1975 these workers and local militants throughout the union formed Steelworkers Fight Back a national network of oppositionists. The decision was made to run Sadlowski for USW president with Fight Back as the campaign organization. The 1976–77 campaign developed a crusading spirit focusing on issues like the ENA opposition to a dues increase and the right to ratify contracts. This spirit was deepened by the fact that Sadlowski himself had been outspoken on broader social issues such as the Vietnam War and civil rights. In the end Sadlowski lost though he received 43 percent of the votes including a majority in the largest locals which were mostly in basic steel. The industry however was on the verge of a precipitous decline and the beginnings of a new brutal phase of deindustrialization; predicted by few it moved to center stage. Domestic steel production plummeted sharply following 1979 as steel corporations carried out drastic rationalizations. A full 200000 steelworkers lost their jobs. In early 1980 steelworkers in Youngstown Ohio occupied the district headquarters of U.S. Steel in a bold but desperate attempt to stave off shutting down their mill. It was hoped that the sit-in might be the spark to ignite a resistance movement. Instead to the dismay of hundreds of workers and supporters involved it was quickly abandoned on orders from the local union officers and their advisers.

The Right to Organize The major breakthrough for workers in the postwar system was winning the right to organize by local state and federal government workers and the subsequent organization of millions of these workers into trade unions. “The growth of US public sector unions” in the ’50s and ’60s was according to Mark Maier “analogous to the expansion of private sector unions during the 1930s.” Women entered the service and public-sector sections of the labor force in millions; they became the backbone of the new teachers’ movements in particular of the NEA now transformed into a union. In the 1970s public employee unions grew four times as fast as total union membership and women made up a very large proportion of these new members. The Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW) founded in 1974 in Chicago was born in a moment of great enthusiasm and embodied a potential movement to support working women and their struggles. The new union women joined office workers telephone workers nurses and health care workers garment workers and factory workers. Three thousand trade union women attended its founding convention; nearly a third in attendance were reported to be young radicals. CLUW seemed an ideal vehicle for uniting women’s liberation with a movement of working-class women one capable of speaking for the vast increase in the numbers of working women the great majority unorganized. Within two years however CLUW was essentially dead undermined by the women of the bureaucracy themselves as often as not second-class citizens in their own unions. Nevertheless for working women the struggle continued. In September 1976 in Seattle 2500 nurses were on strike a strike that lasted sixty-five days the longest nurses’ strike ever at that point reflecting according to the New York Times “the new militancy of registered nurses here and elsewhere.” The issues were wages staffing and the agency shop. But there was also an “emotional issue” according to one doctor. It used to be nurses could be yelled at and their opinions ignored . . . Now they will challenge doctors and sometimes even substitute their judgments for his . . . This is the issue of parity brought by the smart young nurses who have recently graduated and sparked by the women’s movement that is making it hard to end this strike. The service workers public-sector workers and women workers set the foundations of public-sector and service-sector unionism that are with us still today. These unions forecast the future for much of labor developing in the midst of the transition from an industrial working class to one based on the public and service sectors. They represented large numbers of women and workers of color. Two movements in the Teamsters also illustrate that the rebellion continued. In 1976 Frank Fitzsimmons Teamsters president called an official strike nationwide of truckers in the freight industry under pressure from the rank and file including the new organization Teamsters for a Decent Contract (TDC). The following October TDC became Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU). The same spring the Teamsters struck UPS in the central states this time pressured by UPSurge the organization of the UPS rank and file. The settlement in freight was met with a wildcat strike in Detroit. UPSurge responded to the UPS settlement with wildcat strikes in eight Midwestern cities. The service workers public-sector workers and women workers set the foundations of public-sector and service-sector unionism that are with us still today. In the Teamsters then the largest industrial union in the country the TDU set out to build a national rank-and-file movement within the union a corrupt union often with close ties to the mob (the gangsters who cut deals with the union’s officers national and local and sought ways to slice up the union’s highly lucrative pension fund). TDU quickly grew to a movement of thousands; its mission was to transform a powerful union into a force for progressive change. It became active in contract negotiations promoted solidarity in strikes and among jurisdictions sponsored bylaw reforms and exposed corruption and criminality. Its greatest achievement came in 1991 when it played a key role in the victory of Ron Carey the UPS workers’ leader in his successful contest for the union’s presidency. UPSurge the rank-and-file UPS workers’ organization founded in Cleveland in 1975 was allied with the TDU but differed in that it was first of all organized to fight the company. Its initial focus was preparation for the 1976 central states’ contract negotiations. UPSurge was built on an informal shop stewards network with roots in decades of militant activity. In the ’60s and ’70s there were continuous conflicts — strikes official and unofficial including in 1973 the Pittsburgh wildcat strike with roving pickets that shut down UPS operations in Western Pennsylvania and much of Ohio. In this period UPS became the largest employer of Teamsters as well as the largest transportation company in the world. It became well known even internationally for brown trucks its military-style uniforms and its ubiquitous supervisors armed with clipboards and stopwatches. In an industry still dominated by small and medium-size firms UPS became an innovator — it specialized in “Taylorism” a form of scientific management that took control of every detail in work producing in Harry Braverman’s words “the disassociation of the labor process from the skills of the worker.” UPS introduced new technologies added airfreight and brought in students and young workers as part-timers. The conflict at UPS revealed the depth of rank-and-file unrest in this country this time in a powerful national highly profitable company. The founding “convention” of UPSurge was held in Indianapolis on January 31 1976. It was astonishing; 650 UPSurgers gathered in a Holiday Inn in the eastern suburbs of the city. The meeting was part business part protest rally part celebration — and it was certainly unparalleled in UPS history. Workers came from as far as Portland Oregon and Boston Massachusetts though overwhelmingly from the central states. Ten contract demands were chosen; they focused on the following areas: part-timers appearance standards; supervisors working unsafe equipment sick days holidays and radios. The conflict at UPS revealed the depth of rank-and-file unrest in this country this time in a powerful national highly profitable company. The UPSurge steering committee was in essence a shop stewards’ movement in the classic sense; that is nearly every member was a working elected recallable shop-floor leader. In 1980 UPSurge joined forces with TDU and today UPS workers represent its single largest section — in addition they numerically dominate the Teamsters union itself. TDU remarkably has weathered the storms of more than forty years. It continues to stand out as a voice for rank-and-file Teamsters and a model for the kind of rank-and-file movement we still need.

The End of the Long Seventies In the late 1970s strikes continued to be the order of the day. The example of successful United Farm Workers (UFW) strikes and boycotts of grapes and lettuce in the ’60s was followed by strikes and consumer boycotts in clothing and textiles at the Farah Company and J. P. Stevens as well as at Coors Brewing. These boycotts involved considerable numbers of supporters and other workers as well as the general public. In September 1976 workers in the tomato fields of northeastern Ohio and cannery workers near Toledo struck and occupied the Morgan Packing Company facilities. The strikers erected barricades held off the authorities and won in a crucial early victory for the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC). FLOC was founded by former student activist Baldemar Velásquez. In Seattle 17000 Boeing machinists struck. In bitter strikes of miners at Stearns Kentucky and factory workers in Elwood Indiana strikers were beaten shot at and arrested. That same year firefighters struck in Memphis a wildcat strike as well as in Normal Illinois and Dayton Ohio. In September 1978 20000 members of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) walked off their jobs in Philadelphia. Safeway was shut down in Northern California in a bitter confrontation with Teamsters — in August a picketing striker was killed. The final conflict of the decade of rank-and file insurgency came in the 1977–78 strike in coalfields. Railroad workers in defiance of federal interventions turned an eighty-one-day dispute with the Norfolk Western into a national railroad strike. And 15000 pulp and paper workers used mass action and traveling pickets in a near general strike in the Pacific Northwest. In 1979 there was a wildcat strike of steel haulers in Youngstown. Car haulers wildcatted in Linwood New Jersey and Lordstown Ohio as well as postal workers at the Richmond California bulk mail center. Nuclear workers walked out at Goodyear’s Piketon Ohio plant. Steelworkers won recognition in the shipyards at Newport News following a two-year strike. Faculty struck at Boston University and the University of Cincinnati and again schoolteachers. There were 199 teachers’ strikes in 1979 matching the previous high in 1975–76. Teachers struck for more money reduced class size additional preparation time and in some places student discipline. Finally there was the 1979 strike of California farm workers. The final conflict of the decade of rank-and file insurgency came in the 1977–78 strike in coalfields. The strike of 160000 miners lasted 110 days continuing despite the Taft-Hartley injunction issued by President Jimmy Carter. Twice rank-and-file miners defied UMW leaders and rejected concessionary contracts. The operators wanted what miners called a “1930s-style contract” with the right to fire strikers big health deductibles and punitive absentee controls. Critics contended the union called the strike in the worst possible circumstances; there were months of coal stockpiles on the ground. Critics also insisted that the union leadership had no intention of winning the strike. Nevertheless the rank-and-file miners did and they fought the companies — all subsidiaries of giant energy corporations — to a bloody standstill. They also fought state troopers national guardsmen in Indiana and thousands of company guards and goons. Three miners were shot and killed on picket lines hundreds were arrested and thousands were fined. There was widespread sympathy for the striking miners including solidarity rallies food collections and caravans but no other union took action in their support. The miners fought alone; nevertheless they defeated the companies on many issues. Only hunger forced them back. Even then 40 percent of the miners voting rejected the settlement preferring to fight on. The miners were exhausted in 1978 but not defeated. They were not however prepared for what was to come — the wholesale removal of coal mining to the West. And the teachers again. In the ’70s teachers’ strikes were overwhelmingly called by the National Education Association (NEA). In the 1975–76 school year alone there were 203 strikes. In January 1978 when teachers struck in the Canton Ohio schools 400 were arrested including 230 in one swoop at Timken High School. These are just two examples in a history yet to be written. The NEA was already a large organization in the 1960s. Historically it was a professional organization; unlike the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) it had no ties to the organized labor movement. In the 1960s however this began to change. “Within the NEA” wrote the historian Marjorie Murphy “internal changes had made it clear that the mammoth organization was slowly but inevitably restructuring itself into a union.” In the course of the 1970s the NEA grew at a rate of nearly 100000 new members each year reaching the 2 million mark in 1980. The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) grew as well though not nearly so dramatically. The AFT was organized as a trade union and its roots were in the cities above all in New York City; it was affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Membership in the two unions came to exceed that of the Teamsters union. Both unions responded to changing conditions in the ’60s with strikes and organizing drives. The NEA however quickly outpaced its rival. In the thousands of teachers’ strikes in the ’70s perhaps as many as 80 percent were led by NEA teachers; moreover these teacher’s strikes represented a grassroots movement led locally. The NEA was highly decentralized certainly in comparison to the top-down unionism of the AFT. The NEA had another advantage. In these years of extensive teacher activity the AFT was embroiled in racial disputes — a legacy in part of its racist confrontations with black community activists in the New York teachers’ strikes of 1968. There were also conflicts with black parents in Youngstown and Newark where black activists challenged the union even when led by black teachers. In September 1975 in Boston 4950 teachers 90 percent of the workforce struck in response to a bargaining impasse — their strike also however crippled the district’s two-week-old court-ordered desegregation program. The AFT welcomed the anti-affirmative-action Bakke decision the Supreme Court ruling against racial quotas and opposed NEA policies that implemented racial and gender quotas in its governing bodies. The NEA despite its conservative origins in the era of segregated schools — it organized biracial unions in the South — supported integration and affirmative action. In 1964 it ordered that all its affiliates be integrated though in 1974 the Louisiana association remained segregated. In 1967 Elizabeth Koontz an African American classroom teacher from North Carolina became the NEA’s first black president. In 1972 when two black students at Southern University were shot and killed by police the NEA joined students and black organizations in demanding an official investigation. The NEA denounced a court ruling that would not require school authorities to readjust attendance zones to keep up with racial population shifts. When the AFT and the NEA abandoned unity talks in 1974 the reasons were numerous including simple organizational issues and the problems of professionalism the latter strongest in the NEA. But when Helen Wise president of the NEA rebutted the charge that the NEA teachers were not trade unionists she said fairly that there “are many liberals within the association who think of the AFL-CIO as too conservative.” She continued “The AFT while paying lip service to minority involvement opposed an effective way to assure it. There is no compatibility between the NEA commitment and the AFT laissez-faire attitude on this issue.” From the first the NEA enthusiastically supported the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) for women. In 1974 it won a Supreme Court case striking down mandatory leave for pregnant teachers. In addition then to aggressive organizing including the use of the strike the NEA in Murphy’s words took “bolder more progressive positions on a range of social issues.” The AFT and the AFL-CIO strongly supported the war in Vietnam — they no doubt believed that American workers did as well. This was not the case with teachers however and the AFT paid a price. Between 1970 and 1980 the NEA grew by a million members. The majority of these new members were women and many were black and Latino; tens of thousands of these new members attended university in the 1960s. At the same time according to Murphy “teachers complained about over supervision increasing bureaucratization inappropriate assignments and a lack of control over licensing training and assignments.” Out of these conflicts emerged what was soon to be the nation’s largest union — demonstrating that given the right circumstances and the willingness to act trade unions and above all progressive trade unions could still grow and succeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2V4dHJlbWUtYXVjdGlvbi1kaWxlbW1hLTE5ODAtYm13LW0xLXZzLTIwMDUtZm9yZC1ndC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Extreme Auction Dilemma: 1980 BMW M1 Vs 2005 Ford GT bringatrailer.com,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2V4dHJlbWUtYXVjdGlvbi1kaWxlbW1hLTE5ODAtYm13LW0xLXZzLTIwMDUtZm9yZC1ndC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Hometown favourite Ray Bourque lost the Shooting Accuracy Competition to Mark Messier and his perfect round at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.

Mark Messier not exactly a fan favourite in Boston when the Bruins played the Rangers but an absolute fan favourite at an All-Star Game was lights out in the shooting accuracy competition hitting four targets in four shots. He edged out the hometown favourite Ray Bourque who won the accuracy shooting contest at the All-Star Game seven times in his career.

Bourque Scores Winner

All-Star Games are forgettable unless someone does something epic. Bourque did exactly that. He scored the winning goal with less than a minute left to play to give the Eastern Conference a 6-5 win and send the Fleet Center crowd into a frenzy.

Bourque was named the game’s MVP after an unusual voting process. Dominik Hasek was actually voted the MVP but the voting took place before the winning goal was scored. Hasek insisted that Bourque in his 17th season and playing in front of his home crowd in Boston should be the MVP.

Other memories from the game were how absolutely dominant with the puck Mario Lemieux was. He only had two assists on the night but seeing how he toyed with the top defenders in the Western Conference made everyone realize his incredible talent level. As an Ottawa area native and a Senators fan I was also excited to see rookie Daniel Alfredsson play in his first of what would be many All-Star Games. He went on to win the Calder Trophy that year.

From the countless All-Star Games I have watched and from the dozen or so games I have been to this was clearly the best game and one of the best events.

But we don’t remember it for that. We remember it for a gimmicky glowing puck streaking across our analog low-def TV screens.

The Glowing Puck

I watched most of the game in the Pinnacle Brands Inc. suite. They produced Score and Pinnacle hockey cards along with a few other brands like Select Zenith and Certified. I wrote a lot of the card backs for them back then. A few months later I was hired as their hockey brand manager and relocated to the brand-new but excited hockey market of Dallas.

The memory I will keep forever was that most of the people in the suite including all of the Dallas natives turned their backs to the game and were fascinated by the Fox glowing puck.

The FoxTrax puck system was introduced at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.

Pinnacle CEO Jerry Meyer an energetic corporate Texan and a guy I absolutely loved to work for stood there with his wife Sue-Sue watching the glowing puck streak across the screen. They chatted with me and asked me a lot of questions about hockey. I rolled with it just assuming that it was exciting for them to talk hockey with a real Canadian. I should have worn denim from head to toe and told them we ate seal meat from the concession stands at games in Canada. I saved those antics for the staff when I actually started to work in Dallas.

What we were all staring at was the debut of the FoxTrax. I went to the presser held that weekend to talk about FoxTrax. The explanation they gave was simple. They wanted to attract new hockey fans and grow their audience. The thinking was that the puck was too hard to follow and the glowing streak would enable new fans to hockey a better chance to follow the play.

The pucks used were developed by Etak. It was a digital mapping company that was a pioneer in the GPS market. Etak was purchased by News Corp. which was owned by Fox co-founder Rupert Murdoch. The Australian-born media mogul was shown the idea a year before the All-Star Game took place. Murdoch liked it and green-lighted it.

Etak took regulation NHL hockey pucks sliced them in half and put infrared transmitters a circuit board and a battery in the puck. The halves of the puck were then put back together using epoxy glue.

The project manager for the development of the FoxTrax puck and system was Rick Cavallaro who spoke at the press conference. Years later Cavallaro wrote a first hand account of the puck and its development for Engineering and Technology History Wiki (ethw.org) called ‘First-Hand: Recollections of the development of the FoxTrax hockey puck tracking system’.

“I was lead engineer probably simply by virtue of the fact that I was with Etak/News Corp” wrote Cavallaro in the ethw.org article. “The others were contracting for us. Instrumenting the camera became one of my subprojects and instrumenting the puck became my other primary subproject.”

Cavallaro and his team worked relentlessly and around the clock experimenting with different technologies and testing prototypes.

Will the FoxTrax Puck be Ready?

“We were two weeks away from the All-Star Game still wondering if we could finish building a system to put on the ice” wrote Cavallaro. “So we drafted another guy from Etak a guy by the name of Terry O’Brien who did a lot of our mechanical work at Etak. Terry had also done the layout on the circuit board that goes into the puck. He had designed the battery can and a few of the components in the puck. So we drafted him and designated him our puck expert to go and meet with the guys at the NHL. We had done everything we could to make sure that the puck was survivable — that it wasn’t going to break apart and that it had exactly the same weight and rebound properties that an official NHL puck has. We had removed a lot of rubber from the puck to accommodate the electronics. And then we filled that back up with electronics and a compound that we developed that was basically a flexible epoxy mixed with some filler material to get the right rebound and weight.”

The technology created a blue tail that would trail the puck making it look like a comet on the screen. If the puck’s speed reached 70 mph the tail became red. The batteries in the pucks had a limited lifetime of about 18 minutes of usage. About 50 pucks were created for each game.

The glowing puck lasted until the end of the 1997-98 Stanley Cup Final. ABC obtained the NHL’s broadcasting rights for the United States in the summer of 1998 and the FoxTrax puck era had come to an end.

Fox kept the FoxTrax branding alive and transitioned it to other sports. They have used it NASCAR broadcasts and also for the electronic strike zone display for baseball games.

Cavallaro went on to be the chief scientist for SportVision a company that revolutionized sports television graphics. Among their innovations is the yellow first down line that viewers see when watching a game.

“The All-Star Game proved to be a success” Cavallaro said in his ethw.org article. “Even so it wasn’t all roses and sunshine going forward. We continued to face new problems at many of the early games. Looking back I’m proud of what we accomplished but there were still plenty of tense times ahead at that point. At that time broadcasters weren’t really exposed to systems in an R&D phase.”

When the game and the NHL FanFest ended we loaded up the SUV and got ready for the trip home. Our office was in St. Catharines ON in the Niagara area. My co-worker drove and I rode shotgun as we rode along I-90 from Boston to Buffalo. Our boss forgot to tell us before letting us use his SUV for the trip that the driver’s side electronic window was malfunctioning.

We hit our first toll booth early into the trip. My friend and co-worker Rob put down the window. It would come back up. We tried everything and could not get the window to roll up. Unfortunately this was a few years before we all had cell phones.

It was cold that weekend. The temperature was below zero Fahrenheit and about minus-20 Celsius. We drove the entire way from Boston to Buffalo at 70 mph with the window open and the heat cranked up.

The only thing colder than we were that weekend was the reception that hockey purists gave the FoxTrax puck.

It wouldn’t be until President Gerald Ford signed a bill in December 1974 that Americans could freely buy and trade bullion for the first time in over 40 years.

A lot happened as a result. Its price no longer fixed gold exploded 385% from the end of 1974 to 1980 when the metal topped out at $850 an ounce as the U.S. coped with historical levels of inflation.

Over the past 50 years gold has expanded more than 46 times with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 8%.

The ability to trade gold freely has obviously been good for investors. Today gold bullion is one of the most liquid assets in the world its daily volume standing at more than $145 billion according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Only the S&P 500 and U.S. Treasuries trade more—but not by much.

The age of runaway debt

The drawback is that in the years since the end of the gold standard there’s been a significant and growing lack of discipline when it comes to government spending. Before 1971 there was a natural limit to how much money could be printed. New issuances were dependent on the amount of gold sitting in the nation’s coffers.

Today with the dollar backed not by a hard asset but by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. government the federal debt is closing in on an astronomical $28 trillion which is more than 130% of the size of the U.S. economy.

To give you some idea of how dramatically times have changed federal debt in 1960 was only a little over half the size of the economy.

The debt is expected to surge even more in the coming months now that Joe Biden has been sworn in as president and Congressional control has shifted in the Democrats’ favor. Biden who turned 78 in November has called for a $1.9 trillion economic relief package that includes $1400 checks for all American adults.

I’m not advocating that we return to the gold standard. It’s probably no longer feasible. According to the Treasury Department official gold reserves currently stand at approximately 261 million ounces for a market value of some $493 billion.

That’s just not enough metal to support an economy as large as the U.S.—not unless the price of each ounce of gold was fixed at something outrageous like $100000.

There’s been some discussion of making Bitcoin a reserve currency. Like gold its supply is limited and it has the potential to scale up. But at the moment cryptos are far too volatile. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum corrected substantially on Thursday (the first 21st day of the 21st year of the 21st century) with the former falling 13% the latter close to 19%.

So for now we’re left with the current monetary system of unlimited money-printing which in turn makes each U.S. dollar less valuable and each ounce of gold more valuable.

The rise of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)

What this is all pointing toward is the rapid adoption of modern monetary theory (MMT). I’ve written about the concept before.

In short proponents of MMT say that governments that issue their own currency as the U.S. does are free to spend as much as they want regardless of the amount of revenue generated. And if the government ends up with a spending deficit it can just print more money to cover the difference.

Isn’t this what we’re already doing? In 2020 the federal government spent a total of $6.55 trillion despite it collecting $3.42 trillion—about half of that—in tax revenue.

What’s more the amount of M1 money supply—which includes the most liquid and readily available forms of money—was up an unprecedented 67% in December 2020 compared to the same month the previous year.

As Ray Dalio billionaire founder of Bridgewater the world’s biggest hedge fund has said a number of times “Cash is trash.”

Our favorite ways to get exposure to gold

So where does Dalio put his money instead? A look at Bridgewater’s third-quarter filings reveals large positions in physical gold and gold mining companies. At 11.6% the gold-backed SPDR Gold Trust is the fund’s second-largest position. The fifth-largest position at 3.4% is the iShares Gold Trust.

Among the gold producers in Dalio’s portfolio are Newmont Yamana Gold and Freeport-McMoRan.

Besides the securities already mentioned we also like to get exposure to gold and precious metal miners via the royalty companies.

Our two favorites that follow the royalty and streaming model Franco-Nevada and Wheaton Precious Metals have impressive track records of outperforming bullion and gold miners over multiple time periods in bull and bear markets.

Below you can see that Franco significantly beat gold and senior producers during periods when asset prices were rising as well as falling.

Wheaton similarly performed well over multiple periods. For the one-year three-year five-year and 10-year periods Wheaton crushed not just gold and silver but also miners and the popular VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF.

These strong track records have resulted in the companies consistently returning value to shareholders.

As of September 30 Wheaton had an incredible $1.2 billion declared in dividends. Franco meanwhile has had 14 straight years of dividend increases with $1.4 billion paid out since its 2008 initial public offering (IPO).

Both companies are scheduled to report in early March which I’m eagerly awaiting.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Georgia Baker (Team Garmin Australia) won the final hot and hectic stage of the Santos Festival of Cycling wrapping up the criterium while teammate Sarah Gigante made it safely to the finish line to comfortably take overall victory at the 4-day National Road Series event.

Team Garmin Australia were always among the favourites to win the one hour criterium at the 1.1 kilometre Victoria Park circuit as the team of the overall winner was also stacked with Australian track talent. That’s why Gigante secure in her lead of the general classification instead became a workhorse on the final stage of the four-day National Road Series tour.

“What a perfect day. It was so so cool. We were hoping to finish it off today strong” said the 20-year-old Australian rider who won the tour with a gap of 3:12 to Lucy Kennedy (Team Bike Exchange).

“We were trying to keep the bunch under control we knew we had some awesome sprinters and that was pretty much the ideal scenario. I tried my best I’m not the best crit rider but I wanted to help pay them back for all their wonderful work this week” said Gigante.

Team Garmin Australia made the most of those efforts adding a third stage victory to Gigante's overall title and two stage wins.

“Given the heat and the really hard conditions today we weren’t sure how we would go” said Baker who said they had decided to make the call on the road about whether her or Annette Edmondson would go for the final sprint. “I am just so happy. I feel so honoured to have had my track girls lead me out. I couldn’t have asked for a better lead out in the entire world so it was just awesome.”

“We came together at the beginning of the week not having worked together much and by the end of the week it is like we have been working together all year” said Baker.

Roseman-Gannon sprinted to second behind Baker with stage 1 winner Peta Mullens (Roxsolt LIV Sram) in third. That second place and time bonuses from the intermediate sprints meant Roseman-Gannon comfortably retained her third position on the overall and even got close to threatening Kennedy’s second place finishing only one second behind.

How it unfolded

Riders on the exposed Victoria Park track were desperately trying to keep cool any way they could with ice vests and stockings filled with ice cubes shoved down the back as the temperature hovered around 40 degrees. The wind too was set to add to the degree of difficulty with the flags on the side of the course flying and the sight of a billowing plume of smoke rising off in the distant hills of the bushfire prone area.

When they took off from the line the ever-aggressive individual rider Alana Forster went straight to the front leading out the peloton as they braced for an hour of hot racing. The speed ebbed and flowed with some small digs at the head of the race and riders falling off the back when the accelerations came but it was the intermediate sprints the riders were mainly saving their reserves for.

At the bell to indicate the first of four intermediate sprints the group wound up the pace but with teammate Alexandra Martin Wallace providing a powerful lead out for Ruby Roseman-Gannon (ARA Pro-Racing Sunshine Coast) there was no real competition. The young rider swept up the top points and 3 second time bonus with ease both crucial to Roseman-Gannon as at the start of the stage she was just two seconds ahead of Nicole Frain (Sydney Uni Staminade) on the overall and was equal with Gigante in the competition for the sprint jersey.

Right before the second intermediate sprint with 15 laps to go Chelsea Holmes (Giant Racing Team) took off out the front to take maximum points while Roseman-Gannon secured second just ahead of Frain. As the third approached Amber Pate was off the front on her own but was more interested in grabbing a bottle of water than trying to grab the points so got swept up before the line and Grace Brown (Team BikeExchange) took maximum points. The fourth at five laps to go ended up going to Kelly Fettes (Butterfields Racing) but by now the focus in the peloton was squarely shifting toward that final line.

Team Garmin Australia started flexing their muscles with an impressive train led by Gigante. Other riders tried to infiltrate but ultimately the team managed to placed Baker where she needed to be before the tricky run into the line so she could respond to the charge of Mullens and Roseman-Gannon and take victory on the final stage.

Roseman-Gannon’s second added to her lead in the sprint classification which meant that at least one of the individual jerseys went to some one other than Gigante. Not surprisingly Team Garmin Australia also won the team classification.

Conducting a thorough analysis of those stats has enabled many players to get better by pinpointing specific areas in need of improvement.

Now thanks to major advances in smartwatch technology over the last several years recreational players can reap some of those benefits too. But given the multitude of data that is now available at our fingertips — er wrists — it can be difficult to know which numbers to prioritize.

Tommy Fleetwood recently made his debut as a Tag Heuer ambassador and will be wearing the brand’s Connected Golf edition watch. I had the chance to speak with Fleetwood via Zoom on behalf of Tag Heuer this week and asked him which data he feels is most beneficial to the average player.

“With this new watch you’re going to have your rounds — every single round you play whether it’s on the same golf course or on different golf courses” Fleetwood said. “You’re going to see your driving your iron play your putting. And you’re going to have access to stats there without having to do that much.”

What Fleetwood is referring to is the Connected Golf Edition watch’s ability to record your shot distances and scores as well as show you the best zone to target off the tee utilizing 3D mapping technology and data recorded from your past rounds. These recommendations are possible via Tag Heuer’s Golf App which is available for free even without the purchase of an accompanying Tag Heuer watch.

According to Fleetwood easy access to your performance metrics after each round is an incredibly valuable tool not only if you’re looking to improve but also as an effort to focus on the positive by giving yourself credit for what you did well.

“I think you can improve so much easier as a golfer and lower your scores easier just by [the data] being right there in front of your eyes” Fleetwood said. “And again for us that play the game all the time we just take that for granted because that’s what we do. All the stats are on the internet that everybody wants to see. But I think for average golfers I just think it is a great step forward in being able to improve in kind of an obvious way but that’s just not been there. It’s kind of new for the average golfer. And I just think it’s going to help so many people.”

The decision wasn’t taken for granted after the tragic death of Catalan mountaineer Sergi Mingote which Lunger had witnessed personally but after what was ""a very turbulent time for me full of worries tears and dark moments"" she has decided to remain on the second highest mountain in the world ""because I always try to find in every bad thing also something to discover to understand to overcome and thus become stronger.""

The mountain is now far less crowded than just a week ago: following the historic first winter ascent of K2 carried out by 10 Nepalese mountaineers last Saturday many of the climbers have already left base camp. In the wake of Mingote’s death Tamara's original climbing partner Alex Gavan from Romania has preferred to withdraw from the expedition.

Lunger announced that she now plans on continuing with young Chilean mountaineer Juan Pablo Mohr Sergi Mingote's climbing partner with whom she has already acclimatised during the first rotations on the mountain.

Writing on her social media channels Lunger explained: ""We decided to join forces and continue our climb in Sergi's name and spirit. Looking at the first photo here it doesn't seem true that he is not here anymore! J.P. and me in the sun and Sergi in the shadows who I know is now our guardian angel with us during the climb! Sergi we miss you but we will take you up with us. Sincere gratitude for everything""

Just like when we looked at World Cup DH cockpits every rider has their unique setups for their race cockpit. We have looked back through our collection of bike checks from EWS races to find some of the bar and stem combos that are being run by some of the world's top riders.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1a2UtZHVyYnJpZGdlLXNldC1mb3Itb3ZlcmFsbC1zYW50b3MtZmVzdGl2YWwtb2YtY3ljbGluZy12aWN0b3J5LWFmdGVyLXdpbGx1bmdhLXBvZGl1bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Luke Durbridge set for overall Santos Festival of Cycling victory after Willunga performance,"Luke Durbridge (Team BikeExchange) looks set to carry the lead of the Santos Festival of Cycling from start to finish holding an advantage on the overall of two minutes as he heads into the final criterium stage of the four-day event

The power of his 80-kilometre long solo break on stage one set the scene early for overall victory at the National Road Series event but if there was any stage that his rivals may have seemed likely to be able to take back at least a little of that time on Willunga Hill was probably it. The Australian time-trial champion however fended off the climbing specialists in a typically hot day of racing with temperatures rising into the high 30's. He conceded only a handful of seconds to the best of them finishing third behind Richie Porte (Team Garmin Australia) and Luke Plapp (Team Garmin Australia).

""The boys did a really good job and I’m really happy with that actually. That’s probably the fastest I’ve ever been up Willunga in my life by about a couple of minutes so it’s nice” said Durbridge.

The 29-year-old overall leader came over the line only eight seconds back from Porte who is known as the Willunga Hill king and young rider Plapp who is the nearest rival on the GC.

The South Australian race is this year largely being contested by domestically-based riders with the exception of Team BikeExchange and a sprinkling of other top-level riders returning home for the Australian summer. The WorldTour race was cancelled due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I’m really really happy Richie’s obviously the best up there and I wasn’t too far off so I’m really happy with that performance” said Durbridge. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a club crit an NRS the Santos Festival of Cycling WorldTour it doesn’t matter the quality and the depth is so high now all the way through Australian cycling.”

Durbridge not only finished just seconds behind Porte who came third in the Tour de France in 2020 but also five seconds ahead of Jumbo Visma climber Chris Harper racing for Cervelo-Tonsley Village at the event. Harper’s performance moved him up to third on the overall and he is now sitting 2:42 behind Durbridge.

The 29-year-old’s display of time-trial power with the long stage 1 solo and podium worthy performance on the Willunga climb couldn’t be much better timed as not only is it likely to net him the win at the Santos Festival of Cycling but it can’t hurt his Olympic aims either. Durbridge is seeking a spot in the Australian team for Tokyo to ride in a support role for the climb heavy road race and to contest the time trial.

However for now the focus remains on safely making it through the final stage of this event and trying to pick up another win for the team at the stage 4 criterium in Adelaide which is just over an hour of racing around the 1.1 kilometre Victoria Park circuit.

""We’ll go in tomorrow and give it a crack for Kaden Groves. I’m just so excited. They’ve just done a great job putting on such a great race in such difficult times"" said Durbridge."

Big technology corporations including Apple  Alphabet's Google and Microsoft have raced to create a pair of fashionable smart glasses readily embraced by consumers but 2021 is shaping up to be one more year these gadgets fall short of mass adoption. With a launch of Facebook smart glasses as early as this summer technology companies are getting one step closer but widespread consumer interest is five to 10 years away says Tuong Nguyen a principal analyst at technology consulting firm Gartner. And some tech CEOS agree. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel speculated it would be at least 10 years before consumers widely adopt smart glasses speaking during the 2019 TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco. A recent report from Gartner forecasts the wearable device market will see significant growth but that includes not only smart glasses but watches and virtual reality headsets. Gadgets like the Apple Watch already have been big successes. Gartner forecasts wearables will reach $109 billion by 2024 with watches and virtual reality headsets for gaming growing by compounded annual growth rates of 20% and 22% respectively. For smart glasses the lag in mass market adoption is a result of slow progress on easy-to-use designs fashionable appearances and easy-to-use content Nguyen said. Many products remain bulky making it a hard sell for consumers looking to stay fashionable on the go while slow connectivity issues dissuade those looking for efficiency. Companies also have yet to work out powering kinks such as whether its tethered to a computer or battery-powered. But the latest iterations of smart glasses are showing progress. Last week Vuzix premiered a fashion-forward product at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show expected to hit the market this summer and that will feature speakers noise-canceling microphones and offer options supporting WiFi and data.

New Vuzix smart glasses priced at $1000 are expected to hit the market in mid-2021 and will mark the company's first foray into the consumer end of what has been an enterprise market for this growing niche of wearables. Vuzix

The Rochester-headquartered company which has long created smart glasses products for enterprise clients is making its first major foray into the consumer market. In 2015 Intel Corp. invested nearly $25 million for a 30% stake in the company. Lenovo introduced its ThinkReality A3 smart glasses at CES which tether to a PC and some Motorola devices. These smart glasses allow users to project several virtual screens at once and come with an added speaker and microphone for interacting with peers or coworkers. There's also a range of everyday benefits to this product niche which continue to multiply as it develops. Smart glasses can be used for virtual shopping figuring out what furniture fits into homes and could one day replace screens entirely said Rick Kowalski director of industry analysis and business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. For years IKEA has toyed with using the Microsoft's HoloLens to allow customers to plan out a kitchen bathroom or room redesign while Lowe's implemented a pilot program in several stores in 2016. ""The value that they bring is so far beyond what they can think of right now"" Kowalski said.

A troublesome history

Smart glasses initially hit the market as early as 2012 but most have relied on enterprise clients with only a few temporarily targeting consumers. In 2013 Google released the first prototype of the Google Glass to a select group of consumers before going public in May 2014. Retailing at $1500 a pair the product fit few consumer price points and came under fire for potential privacy issues related to its connected camera; it's consumer model was discontinued in 2015 and the company found a place developing line for warehouse and manufacturing use. The latest iteration geared toward the enterprise community was launched in 2019. Retailing at $999 the model comes equipped with voice activated applications can be managed from a mobile device.

Despite a slow integration into the consumer market Covid-19 and the rise in remote work could accelerate smart glasses integration in health medical and service fields. Vuzix recently announced they would partner with a medical technology company to assist with remote servicing during the pandemic. Microsoft is also putting smart glasses to use in the defense sector. First available to consumers in 2019 the HoloLens glasses can overlay images and display computer programs. In 2019 the company won a $479 million contract to deploy 100000 prototypes to the U.S. military hoping to improve soldier effectiveness a move which came under harsh employee criticism. The decision caused some concerns among employees who across the tech sectors have been more vocal in recent years as activists questioning some uses of their own technology. But Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later defended the decision in an interview with CNN Business citing that the company would not ""withhold technology from institutions that we have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy."" In 2016 Snap made its foray into the smart glasses market with Spectacles a wearable product that allowed users to record videos to sync with their phones. But by 2017 several media outlets reported that the creator of Snapchat largely overestimated demand and less than half of buyers continued using the product within a month of purchase internal company data obtained by Business Insider suggested. Though largely unsuccessful among consumers the most recent iteration offers 3-D capabilities and retails for $380 a fraction of the price of its competitors.

The price point for most smart glasses is still high with many models upwards of $2500. The new Vuzix glasses are expected to retail for $1000; Lenovo has not yet detailed pricing on its ThinkReality A3 smart glasses. Offering consumer-friendly pricing for the products is one way to accelerate the rollout but companies also need to ensure smart glasses are accompanied by easy-to-use apps and libraries of content that keep consumers occupied. Without these vast content libraries released in tandem with smart-glasses consumers are less likely to materialize the benefits of the product said Allan Cook a managing partner at Deloitte leading the digital reality practice. ""People think it's weird to be wearing AR or smart glasses"" he said. ""There's been blocks to the market in the past but in 2021 we are going to see some dramatic increase."" Some experts thought 2020 would be ""the year"" of headsets due to the pandemic but it wasn't and again in 2021 while there will be growth it will be off a low base and more of it continuing in the enterprise market according to a Deloitte analysis. Overall spending on AR and VR headsets software and services including purchases by consumers rose in 2020 to $12 billion globally which was up 50% from 2019 but below the pre-pandemic forecast of almost 80% growth. With the pandemic accelerating the opportunity to demonstrate their value digital reality headsets may continue to gain ground after the pandemic ends due to a variety of other benefits such as lower cost greater safety and better learning retention but those benefits still show more appeal to and adoption among enterprise clients rather than consumers according to the Deloitte outlook.

Big Tech's vision of the future

As technology companies push for greater consumer adoption several tech giants beyond Google and Microsoft have announced plans for their own smart glass creations expected to hit the market in the next few years. Facebook plans to release its smart glasses created with Luxottica 's Ray-Ban. The social media giant is banking on the popular sunglasses brand style-sense to offer a fashion-forward model that will appeal to skeptical customers. In 2019 CNBC also previously reported that the company was working on an accompanying artificial intelligence voice assistant to rival Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. ""I can't go into full product details yet but they're really the next step on the road to augmented reality glasses"" said CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a September livestream from Facebook Connect where the company annually showcases virtual reality products. Simultaneously the company is working on Project Aria an initiative that will distribute devices to employees to accumulate video audio and location data and ultimately help the company research and develop its smart glasses. Facebook first announced its Luxottica partnership in 2019. Apple is reportedly working on its own AR glasses that would allow users to view maps text messages and control Siri expected to hit the market by 2023 at the earliest. Development on the product is shrouded in secrecy — like all of Apple's R&D which the company never provides comment on. An augmented and virtual reality headset similar to Facebook's Oculus Rift is also reportedly in the works. Wall Street is anxious for an Apple unveil with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives putting Apple Glasses on his 2021 wish list and making a prediction that the company's first augmented reality eyewear — the result of many years of development in the labs of Cupertino — will be introduced at the company's WWDC 2021 developers conference expected to be held in June. Amazon has not announced plans for a full-scale augmented reality competitor but it currently offers the Echo Frames a pair of glasses enhanced with a speaker and built-in Amazon voice assistant. Jio an India-based technology company that's backed by both Google and Facebook announced Jio Glass last year a mixed reality headset that connects to the internet through a cable connected to a smartphone. Although the company part of India's largest conglomerate Reliance Industries has yet to announce a price point they've hinted that the product works with more than 25 applications and could benefit remote work and school.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9ueW91bmdlci8yMDIxLzAxLzIzL2ZyZWVsYW5jZS1maXRuZXNzLWluc3RydWN0b3JzLW5ldy1iZXN0LWZyaWVuZC1tZWV0LW9ucG9kaW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freelance Fitness Instructors' New Best Friend: Meet OnPodio,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonyounger/2021/01/23/freelance-fitness-instructors-new-best-friend-meet-onpodio/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9ueW91bmdlci8yMDIxLzAxLzIzL2ZyZWVsYW5jZS1maXRuZXNzLWluc3RydWN0b3JzLW5ldy1iZXN0LWZyaWVuZC1tZWV0LW9ucG9kaW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYmx1ZWxpbmVzdGF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzIzL29uLWphbnVhcnktMjMtaW4tbmV3LXlvcmstcmFuZ2VyLWhpc3RvcnktamFyb21pci1qYWdyLWpvaW5zLXRoZS10ZWFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On January 23 in New York Ranger history Jaromir Jagr joins the team,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3NtYXJ0cGhvbmVzLWxhcHRvcC1jb25maWd1cmF0aW9uLW1vZGVsLTExOTM5NTYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why don't phones use a laptop configuration model?,"Follow tech enthusiast discussions for long enough and you’ll invariably find someone asking a recurring question: why can’t you choose a phone configuration like you can with a laptop? People have widely varying preferences for screens cameras and other features.

It therefore stands to reason that you could custom-order a phone that meets your exact needs and (hopefully) lasts longer. Storage and memory aren’t the only concerns people have after all.

The reality however doesn’t quite line up with the dream. As Google discovered when it shelved Project Ara there are a number of practical hurdles to offering phone configuration options and modular designs. Some are technical limitations others are simple business considerations. Here’s why you’ll likely have to settle for a fixed-configuration phone at least for now.

Phone configuration doesn’t make business sense

Adam Molina / Android Authority

Phones sell in much much higher volumes than computers. Gartner researchers noted that companies sold over 366.6 million smartphones in the third quarter of 2020 alone. Comparatively there were roughly 71.4 million PC shipments — and that’s in a pandemic-struck market in which laptops are faring better than they have in a long time.

Those kinds of manufacturing scales make it considerably harder to offer a custom phone configuration. More choices add more steps to manufacturing. That can slow down production that frequently needs to move as quickly as possible. Fewer shipped phones in turn leaves companies recouping their costs with higher prices. If you don’t like paying a premium for a phone like the Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12 you’ll like it even less if you have to pay extra for the privilege of choosing your screen resolution or processor.

And let’s not forget the logistics of supporting these options. The fewer phone configurations there are the easier it is to develop software updates and offer customer service. OS upgrade schedules and device repairs can already take a long time now. It won’t get any easier if there’s a myriad of bugs that only appear with specific part combinations.

It’s technically difficult

The very nature of smartphone design makes customization very challenging. While laptops are frequently large enough to have swappable modules (if just at the factory) phones are small tightly-packed devices with little to no breathing room. Processors graphics memory and storage are soldered in and companies have removed features like headphone jacks just to free up space. Even making 5G optional could require a different set of antennas. As such modular components are a tough sell. They tend to occupy more real estate as a matter of course.

Standards pose a problem as well — or rather the lack of them. It’s relatively easy for laptop makers to offer configuration options when they’re built on established standards like CPU sockets RAM slots and storage interfaces. Phone builders however don’t have those luxuries. They either have to develop their own processes for swappable parts or hope the industry will move to common formats. Unfortunately neither is very likely.

There are technical hurdles for both hardware and software.

Let’s not forget software either. Android doesn’t have a PC-like approach to drivers. The kernel has to be configured for specific hardware and offering a wide range of component choices could make those kernel tweaks nightmarishly complex. That’s not including firmware updates or accommodating varying hardware specs in apps — how would a hybrid zoom feature adapt to multiple camera choices? You could expect significant delays in OS updates and you might get fewer of those updates.

Google illustrated many of the difficulties involved with its ill-fated Project Ara. Prototypes suggested the fully modular phone concept could work. However the company had to develop a module standard from scratch marshal support from partners and explore many iterations. It’s not surprising that Google delayed and eventually killed the project when there was little to show after years of development. It would get somewhat easier to configure phones without user-replaceable modules but vendors would still have more work ahead of them than if they simply went with static designs.

Would you even make use of it?

There’s also the looming question of whether or not custom phone configuration would make a difference. Phones are quickly becoming powerful enough that even a mid-priced phone like the Pixel 4a 5G can satisfy the needs of many people. Why customize your phone with a faster CPU or a sharper display if the improvements would be negligible especially if there’s a higher-end phone model available?

The odds are high that at least one existing phone model will accomplish what you need with no customization required.

It doesn’t help that expectations for phone and laptop software are different. Where PC users may have exacting hardware requirements for advanced games or professional apps that’s generally not true in the mobile world. A custom phone configuration will only be of limited help if you’re playing Call of Duty: Mobile or editing a family video. The odds are high that at least one existing phone model will accomplish what you need no customization required.

This isn’t to say you’d never appreciate the option for a laptop-like phone configuration option. The market is as diverse as it is because it’s difficult for any one model to satisfy many people let alone most. However it’s equally tough to imagine those people buying a slightly upgraded (or even downgraded) phone instead of simply purchasing the next in the range. For now at least the status quo often is good enough.

Traditional beauty standards formerly forced Chinese women to opt for wired push-up bras but today’s working millennials prioritise comfort and simplicity.

Investment capital has recently been flocking to Chinese digital bra start-ups after “disrupter” labels including Ubras and Bananain grew into multimillion-yuan businesses in barely two years.

Lingerie start-ups targeting China’s millennials and Gen Zers had an exceptional year in 2020. Digital bra labels have been the darlings of the Chinese fashion investment capital set these past few years. In 2018 alone over US$30 million (200 million yuan) of growth capital was poured into China’s digital bra start-ups according to a report by the data firm iiMedia. And from 2019 to 2020 more than a dozen emerging lingerie brands succeeded in raising millions of dollars – or even hundreds of millions of dollars – to grow their businesses.

Notably most of these labels were founded by women. And according to most of their companies’ mission statements they are here to revolutionise the industry because of their own frustration with the ill-fitting curve-enhancing bras they wore growing up. Today they are shifting the paradigm by promoting comfortable gender-neutral and versatile styles.

One of the biggest stories in China retail last year was the decline of domestic lingerie giant Dushi Liren (Urban Lady) which specialises in body-flattering push-up bras much like the Western brand Victoria’s Secret . Despite several changes in management and re-branding initiatives the company’s sexy product styles still failed to attract China’s millennial crowds. Instead a growing cohort of digital bra labels has gained ground by catering to the younger consumers’ lifestyles.

Ubras a digital-native brand specialising in one-size lingerie surpassed Uniqlo in just two years to become the platform’s No 1 selling underwear brand during last year’s Singles‘ Day event . Another label called Bananain which was founded in 2016 by a Shenzhen tech company became one of Tmall’s top-five performing brands by featuring gender-neutral underwear with bright colours and no skin-scratching labels.

Livary Mio a modern feminine label founded by Miche Huang recently raised millions of dollars from the VC firm Artesian Invests to grow its online business. Despite being in the market for just over two years these emerging brands’ overnight success stories imply that there is still a lot of untapped potential in lingerie that touts modern aspirational values.

“Chinese consumers are very receptive to new brands” explains the director of Tmall’s underwear division Sun Su during an interview with local media outlet Xinlinshou. “Twenty per cent of the top 100 brands at this year’s Singles‘ Day sale were labels founded in the past three years.”

In China’s US$61-billion lingerie market the move toward comfortable styles is a relatively recent event. Traditionally brands would promote curve-flattering effects as the lingerie’s central selling point while mainstream beauty standards also encourage women to strive for a sexy and ultra-feminine look.

Since 2016 wireless lingerie sales have grown 50 per cent each year mostly thanks to post-90s consumers according to the consultancy CBNData. By 2020 up to 76.6 per cent of Chinese lingerie consumers said they preferred wireless bras to the traditional push-up models. The busy working lifestyles of young Chinese women have prompted this surge in demand for bras that feel like they’re barely there.

But comfort itself is only a start. As a part of China’s overall consumption upgrade trend lingerie has turned from functional apparel into a tool of personal expression. “China’s female consumers really care about whether a piece of lingerie can be both beautiful and comfortable whether it makes them look good and whether it can pair stylishly with their clothes” said Miche Huang founder of the lingerie brand Livery Mio. “They have a higher standard about the lingerie’s aesthetic.”

Zhuorui Fu a Shenzhen-based investment professional and lifestyle blogger also emphasised the importance of aesthetics. “Many business reports have overlooked the influence of aesthetics” said Fu. “Women consumers like myself flock to brands like Neiwai who have an international design team for their products’ modern clean aesthetic.” And while China’s youth continue to value lingerie as an indispensable part of their evolving lifestyles opportunities for brands that embody progressive concepts remain huge.

One untapped market niche is sustainability. Huang said: “as concerns about sustainability grow in the international lingerie world brands and consumers in China have also started to be more aware of using environmentally friendly materials.”

Fu echoed this call for sustainability. “I hope to see more sustainable labels that use innovative materials and have a more efficient recycling system” she said. “Thinking about used bras becoming useless waste is harsh to me – and not just me.”

Another untapped niche is lingerie that touts body diversity. Unlike their Western counterparts Chinese lingerie labels that promote inclusivity and diversity are still rare in China. While brands like Neiwai and CandyLaVie have made PR strides in fighting the stigmas of ageism and sizeism they are only the tip of a much-anticipated broader movement towards celebrating body diversity.

“Contrary to the myth that Chinese women are all slim there is a large variety of body shapes among us” blogger Zhuorui Fu says. She also challenges brands to think beyond “size” when considering diversity. “It is not just about size” she adds. “It is also about shapes.”

Therefore moving beyond the millennial clichés of comfort by further catering to China’s niche needs is the next ground-floor opportunity in China – for both domestic and international lingerie brands.

Bitcoin hit a new high in early January reaching a price of nearly $42000. On Friday morning the price of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency was about 32500 according to CoinDesk. Even mainstream financial institutions are warming up: JP Morgan said in the long-term if the market cap gets high enough that it competes with gold the price of bitcoin could reach $146000 in a note published in January. (Bitcoin currently has a market value of over $600 billion.) But more than just a cryptocurrency bitcoin has become an obsession for many. Here are some of the behavioral and psychological reasons why.

Bitcoin becomes part of your identity

Bitcoin is ""more religion than solution to any problem"" billionaire Mark Cuban told Forbes in December. In fact bitcoin aficionados have their own jargon full of acronyms and phrases from ""HODL"" to ""whale"" and (pre-Covid) bitcoin conferences would attract thousands of attendees. The crypto crow even has a preferred car to buy with their bitcoin: the Lambo (aka Lamborghini). ""The culture around bitcoin is part of the appeal"" says Finn Breton professor of science and technology at the University of California Davis and author of ""Digital Cash: The Unknown History of the Anarchists Utopians and Technologists Who Created Cryptocurrency.""

""When you buy bitcoin you're actually buying into a whole scene"" Breton says. ""And it's a scene that can be a part of your identity."" Though bitcoin is getting more attention from some serious investors and mainstream financial institutions it's still a somewhat subversive concept so people who invest in it can view themselves as radical or participating in counterculture Breton says.

Social media plays into it

From celebrities who invest in bitcoin to a highly-engaged bitcoin community on Twitter TikTok and Reddit social media feeds into bitcoin's popularity. ""Suddenly there's like a new way to see finance and to have an identity of yourself as an actor in like the financial space"" says Lana Swartz assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and author of ""New Money: How Payment Became Social Media"" tells CNBC Make It. These social platforms can also drive behaviors according to Utpal Dholakia professor of marketing at Rice University who studies consumer financial decision-making. Research has shown that when people talk about their investments in online social environments they tend to become more risk-seeking in the types of investments they make he tells CNBC Make It. ""The same dynamic applies to a lot of investment decisions which are being made right now"" Dholakia says.

The volatility can be exciting

Many smart investors from Kevin O'Leary to CNBC's Jim Cramer have likened buying bitcoin to going to Vegas. Berkshire Hathaway CEO and chairman Warren Buffett has been a longtime critic of bitcoin saying that ""cryptocurrencies basically have no value"" and are a ""gambling device."" And as with gambling ""some people certainly enjoy that thrill"" Dholakia says. Checking the price of stocks regularly is an activity that could get boring says Tom Meyvis professor of marketing at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. ""With something like bitcoin it's exciting because there's constantly something happening"" he says. ""You can check it 10 times a day and the price can vary wildly."" Also many young people especially who have grown up with video games and social media are conditioned to want instant gratification and fast-paced cycles Swartz says. Being drawn to high-risk high-reward investments like bitcoin ""makes perfect sense"" she says.

FOMO

People get excited by the prospect of bringing a new potentially life-changing technology into the world. And with bitcoin bulls predicting the crypto's price could go as high $200000 over the next decade and with mainstream financial businesses from Paypal to Square getting into bitcoin it's hard not to fear missing out. Add to that the viral stories about people who have had success with bitcoin: There are enviable windfalls from instant bitcoin millionaires to stories like the ""Bitcoin Family"" a Dutch family of five who liquidated their assets in 2017 in exchange for bitcoin (when bitcoin was priced at $900) moved into a van and traveled the world. ""People focus more on the upside than the downside"" says Meyvis. So it's easy to get swept up in the possibilities that could come from bitcoin.

As a culmination of the existing trilogy Hitman 3 caps off the generation with the most impressive iteration of the Glacier Engine to date with all existing current-gen Hitman content retrofitted into the latest game while being essentially 'remastered' for next-gen consoles. PC owners can rejoice too - the game does everything that PS5 and Series X can and more besides thanks to some nice upgrades and further scalability.

In delivering this article IO interactive has furnished us with the exact PC settings for every console the game is running on. So by using these settings on PC at the proper resolution it is possible to see how a PC GPU fares in comparison to the consoles with some interesting observations. First of all though I'd like to give IO some kudos for a more fully featured PC options menu. The lack of granularity in settings was a real issue I had with Hitman 2 but this was improved over time and those efforts are ported over directly into Hitman 3 allowing high-end PC users to increase fidelity over console quality.

That starts with shadow quality which sees PS5 operate at the normal preset with Xbox Series X upping that to high. Ultra allows PC users to further refine the effect and in my tests had very little impact on performance. Screen-space ambient occlusion is interesting in that all console builds operate at the 'minimum' setting - perhaps not surprising when dropping from ultra to minimum can add 20 per cent to frame-rate. Minimum can look a little rough and I'd say that medium is the optimal setting - you claw back 16 per cent in frame-rate by dropping from the max and halo artefacts are minimised in the process.

Screen-space reflections are similarly taxing with next-gen consoles at the equivalent to PC's medium setting. That's what I'd recommend for optimised settings too - dropping from high you gain four per cent of performance and while grainy artefacts are present as a result it does not distract in most scenes. Another important setting is the mirror quality - a render to texture effect that effectively sees the game drawing the same scene from an extra angle. When a mirror dominates the scene the performance hit is more noticeable. Here I found an anomaly - IO tells us that PS5 renders at PC's medium setting but this does not seem to change fidelity from the high setting on the PC version when really it should. If medium is fixed I'd recommend that based on the PS5's showing but for now high settings will have to do.

Level of detail is the last meaningful setting you should take a look at - the higher you set it the more detailed you'll find objects in the distance. IO pegs next-gen consoles at the medium setting but on balance I'd recommend the high preset for optimised settings as I find the object pop-in to be a tad distracting on medium and low and indeed on the consoles. Then there's the motion blur setting to consider - its performance hit is only really noticeable if you have fast-moving objects taking up most of the camera view where switching from high to off produced a maximum of 15 per cent of extra performance. But this is a real outlier - I'd recommend tuning it to whatever you think looks best. For the record consoles disable it.

From there we move on to other PC exclusive settings kicking off with simulation quality. There are two options here - base and bestwith all consoles using the latter in order to cut down on CPU load. By opting for the base configuration NPCs in the distance effectively run at half-refresh and other features are also tweaked. To be honest only the NPCs were noticeable to me. IO recommends the base option for those with quad-core CPUs and to be honest I'd opt for best. It ran just fine for me on a Ryzen 5 3600 - the mainstream consumer champion CPU of the moment.

Our video also includes analysis on which PC GPUs best match the PS5 and Series X - the RX 5700 XT is looking pretty close here...

DF Optimised Settings PlayStation 5 Shadow Quality High Medium SSAO Medium Minimum Screen-Space Reflections Medium Medium Mirror Quality High Medium Level of Detail Quality High Medium Simulation Quality Best Base Motion Blur Quality Medium (Optional) Off Variable Rate Shading Quality (If Supported) N/A Texture Quality Ultra Ultra

The final option is variable rate shading - which looks to be the less impressive tier one implementation supported by Intel integrated GPUs and applies to objects in the scene rather than the perceptual similarity of colour or speed of movement as found in tier two variants of VRS seen in titles like Gears 5 or the Wolfenstein games. Two options are present - quality and performance - and I can't recommend the latter which noticeably impacts overall quality. If your GPU supports VRS there is a three per cent frame-rate gain by using the quality mode based on analysis from the game benchmark.

All in all looking at our optimised settings they are similar to the compromises made on consoles like the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X but they are purposefully set higher in those areas where I believe quality can be gained without too much in the way of a meaningful performance downgrade. Running optimised settings up against max in the benchmark you get a nice 17 per cent performance advantage and the game basically looks much the same in most scenarios. You'll see in the video how this all plays out across a range of Nvidia and AMD GPUs but I was also impressed with CPU performance.

With Hitman 3 DX12 is the standard and the DX11 renderer is deprecated boding will for better CPU performance. I tested a scene that proved particularly heavy on the CPU in Hitman 2 and found that even the mainstream Ryzen 5 3600 ran beautifully - and even lowest frame-rates were in the 80s. In terms of percentages the Ryzen 9 3900X ran about 17 per cent better than the 3600 and the Intel Core i9 10900K delivered a 32 per cent advantage.

Bearing in mind we could get a nigh-on exact match for console settings via IO's assistance I thought it might be interesting to see how PC GPUs stack up against PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X using a stress test scenario from the Hitman 2 Miami stage - one of the only places where you'll find any drop beneath 60fps on PS5. You'll find my complete workings within the video at the top of this page but perhaps not too surprising is the fact that AMD's Radeon RX 5700 XT provides the closest match to Sony's new machine. It possesses four more Navi dual compute units than PS5 but runs at a slower clock. I had some fun with this and the comparisons with Series X at 4K resolution are also interesting but I do expect that memory bandwidth plays a significant factor in the result based on what's being rendered owing to particle overdraw being the most obvious challenge presented by the scene.

All told the PC version of Hitman 3 is excellent - it looks great and runs well and I hope to see further improvements made to this release over time. In particular I really look forward to seeing what type of ray tracing may be added in the future - the current screen-space reflections are good but a number of levels in Hitman 3 really look like they could benefit from full-blooded RT alternatives. It would also be great to see how DLSS would fare on the Glacier Engine. Typically Nvidia's AI upscaling produces 'better than native' image quality on games with heavy TAA and post-processing so I'd be interested to see how it would fare on a more precise pristine-looking title like this one. Hopefully we'll see that in the future but right now Hitman 3 on PC comes highly recommended.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3RlY2gvYTM1Mjk2MDc1L3Jlc2lkZW50LWV2aWwtOC12aWxsYWdlLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1kZW1vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Resident Evil 8 release date announced as PS5 gets exclusive demo,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.digitalspy.com/tech/a35296075/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-demo/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3RlY2gvYTM1Mjk2MDc1L3Jlc2lkZW50LWV2aWwtOC12aWxsYWdlLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1kZW1vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Pepsi got 58% of its revenue from the United States in fiscal 2019 and 42% from international territories. Revenue for PepsiCo was $67.2 billion in fiscal 2019 and was up year over year for the fourth consecutive year.

PepsiCo had revenue growth of 5.3% year over year in the third quarter to $18.09 billion.

The dividend yield for shares of Pepsi is 2.9%. Pepsi has raised its dividend 48 consecutive years.

Stock Action: Shares of Coca-Cola have fallen 14% over the last year. The stock is up 18% in the last five years and up 56% in the last 10 years.

Shares of Pepsi are down 2% over the last year. Shares are up 48% over the last five years and up 112% over the last 10 years.

What’s Next: Coca-Cola has made several acquisitions over the years to grow its non-sparkling soft drink segment. This could be a continued focus by the company.

Coca-Cola is also phasing out underperforming brands like Zico and Tab. A national launch of the company’s Topo Chico hard seltzer is happening in the first half of 2021 with distribution partner Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE: TAP).

Pepsi has been acquiring food brands to boost its more profitable business segment. Acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery will help strengthen the company in Africa and China respectively.

Benzinga's Take: Coca-Cola has a strong brand and international presence. The company has the higher dividend yield of the two beverage giants.

But the growing food portfolio of PepsiCo and the consecutive years of revenue growth could make the food and beverage giant the winner in this battle.

When there’s something strange on your cereal aisle —

My kids are about to FREAK OUT because there is a Ghostbusters cereal coming to a grocery store near you!

I remember back in the day we had the ORIGINAL version of the Ghostbusters cereal — I won’t say WHEN because it would really age me — and this NEW version is a total throwback to that cereal.

Just like the OG version this new version of the cereal appears to have crunchy reddish orange cereal pieces and Slimer-shaped green and white marshmallow pieces. Fun huh?

A release date hasn’t been announced but it is already showing up on the Walmart website so it can’t be long!

Technically we don’t even know if this is the FINAL version of the cereal but I’m guessing it’s a pretty good bet that we will see these boxes hitting shelves soon.

The release of this Ghostbusters cereal looks like it’s going to coincide with the June 2021 release of Ghostbusters: Afterlife and oh my gosh — I am totally giddy about this movie. It looks hella good!!

And you know as soon as they release the movie people are going to be buying the cereal up right and left. I know my kids are going to BEG me to get it — and of course I’ll give in. *Smile*

Just like the OG version of the Ghostbusters cereal I hope to goodness that the box is glow-in-the-dark. I totally want my kids to experience the fun.

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vYnVpbHRpbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYnVyZ2VyLWtpbmctZ20tbG9nb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burger King & GM's Logo Redesigns Have 1 Big Thing in Common,"The year isn’t the only thing that’s new. Two storied brands Burger King and General Motors recently gave their visual identities a refresh exchanging time-honored logos with new ones that better reflect their tech-forward aspirations.

Let’s start with Burger King.

The hamburger chain ditched the logo it’s had since 1999 for one strikingly similar to the one it unveiled in 1969. Gone are the blue swoosh and shiny bun relics of a Web-1.0-era aesthetic. Replacing them are puffy fonts psychedelic shapes and lots of brown red and green. All that’s missing are bell bottoms.

Image: Burger King

Burger King’s design pivot to a ’70s vibe is no accident. It’s clearly “an appeal to nostalgia” according to James Bowie principal at Embelemetric a logo design analysis blog. It’s a design trend he’s spotted in several NBA teams as well as NASA. Using “throwback” logos helps organizations like these re-energize old generations and catch the eyes of new ones.

“It’s almost like when a newer artist covers an old musician’s songs” Bowie told Built In. “The young crowd likes it because [it’s] this cool new song and the older crowd is like ‘I remember the original.’”

“It’s almost like when a newer artist covers an old musician’s songs.”

But why use a vintage design in the smartphone era? At first blush the logo’s big disco energy seems more like a retreat back to analog than a forward push into digital. But that’s not exactly the case.

Despite evoking a bygone era the new design is calibrated to be more friendly to digital channels. For starters it’s flat meaning it doesn’t use techniques or flourishes to make it appear three-dimensional.

Flat design is often preferred by mobile-first designers. Its simplicity translates easily to the context of tiny screens where small details are harder to see.

Burger King’s previous logo had much more ornamentation and detail which made sense in the desktop computer age. Less so now when many people are pressing a tiny app icon to order lunch. Indeed the new design is as much a practical move as it is a cultural one.

Speaking of culture the other potential byproduct of Burger King’s redesign is that it’s highly photogenic. In an age when user-generated content is an increasingly utilized marketing lever for brands it’s likely Burger King designed its new cups and bags with social media in mind.

“The typographic sandwich wrappers are great and will probably become popular Instagram content” argued Brand New a popular brand design blog.

To capitalize on this Burger King also rolled out a new apparel line to coincide with its redesign. The merch looks similar to that of Popeye’s which took Instagram by storm when it was released early in 2020. So much so that the fried chicken restaurant’s online store quickly sold out.

BK which is owned by the same parent company as Popeye’s is likely angling for a similar phenomenon: vintage looks for a digital strategy.

Signaling an Electric Future

General Motors on the other hand appears to have gone in the opposite direction of Burger King when it comes to its new design.

The car manufacturer which owns Buick Cadillac Chevrolet and GMC swapped out the logo it’s used since 1964 for one that helps to underscore its new future.

Image: General Motors

The logo’s uppercase GM was changed to a lowercase gm and set in a friendlier font with a gradient color scheme — a far cry from the heavy navy blue the company’s used for decades meant to signal a commitment to progress and sustainability.

The negative space creates the shape of an electrical outlet though it’s not easily recognizable at a quick glance (similar to the way the two words in the FedEx logo form an arrow between them) which is meant to point to GM’s bet on electric vehicles. (The manufacturer is investing $27 billion in EVs and plans to launch 30 models in the next half decade.)

The move though criticized by several design commentators who don’t care for its late-aughts aesthetic is a forward-thinking one according to Bowie. “They’re not introducing a new logo just for the heck of it” he said. It is meant to set the tone for its sub-brands and declare its intention to be a progressive company with an electric-first future.

Image: General Motors

Logo redesigns don’t always go hand in hand with concrete policy changes or shifts in strategy. But GM’s does.

“I think companies that are smart will introduce a new logo in association with some larger move that they’re making” Bowie said. “If you’re just changing it for window dressing then it’s not going to be maybe as effective.”

Though they express it differently both Burger King and GM have used their redesigns to declare their intentions: They’re ready for the future a brave new digital world.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

LANETT — Langley Motor Company owner Mac Langley received a highly prestigious award on Thursday. General Motors’ zone manager Josh Weimer of Atlanta and the company’s district manager Quintin Siemer of Birmingham came to the dealership to present Mr. Langley an award recognizing the very rare achievement of having had a franchise for GMC Trucks for more than 50 years. He’s previously received an award on having been a Buick dealer for more than 50 years.

“Local dealerships are the backbone of our organization” Weimer said. “It’s an amazing achievement for any dealer to be in the business for 50 years. This is a big deal. Mr. Langley and his two sons have served the two-state area very well for a long time. We are privileged to present an award to a GM dealer who has done great work for the company over a half-century.”

“It’s very unusual for a stand-alone dealership to remain in the same location and under the same ownership for 50 years” Siemer said. “It’s an honor for us to be here today and present an award that is so richly deserved.”

The General Motors Company (GM) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Detroit Michigan. GM designs manufactures markets and distributes vehicles and vehicle parts. The company was founded as a holding company by William C. Durant on September Sept. 10 1908. The current entity was restructured in 2009. GM is the largest automobile manufacturer in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world. The current top five includes Volkswagen GM Toyota Hyundai-Kia and Ford.

Mac Langley has been in business on North Lanier Avenue in Lanett since 1959. He started out as a dealer for Goodyear tires. In 1965 he purchased the Bartlett Oldsmobile dealership next door to his tire business and has been a dealer with GM vehicles ever since. He had franchises for Oldsmobile and Buick in 1966 and was also a dealer for Opel vehicles which were made in Germany. Opel and Oldsmobile were phased out along the way but Langley has remained with Buick since the start. He added GMC trucks in 1969 and has been a dealer for them since that time. Langley Motor Company sold Pontiacs from 1982 until they were discontinued in 201o. Mr. Langley credits his two sons Mitchell and Mark for playing big parts in the company’s continuing success.

“I wouldn’t be here today without them” he said.

Mitchell is the vice president of the repair shop and Mark the vice president of sales.

Mark is pleased the dealership received an award from GMC Trucks.

“They are our biggest seller” he said. “People like our Buicks too and that’s okay.”

Mitchell is happy for his dad to still be active in the business.

“He’s going to outlive us all” he said.

Siemer said the award should have been presented months ago but that COVID-19 has caused lots of delays for a big company like GM.

Langley grew up on a Chambers County cattle farm at the end of the Great Depression and through the World War II era. He was doing farm chores at a very young age and drove a school bus to and from LaFayette High at age 16. He graduated from LHS in 1954.

After high school he attended the Nashville Auto & Diesel College in Nashville Tennessee. This experience was eye-opening for him. It taught him that there were all kinds of opportunities in the automotive field. Langley returned home to Chambers County and purchased a general store his grandfather George Henry had been running in the Ridge Grove community. Young Mac was quite an entrepreneur at that store. On the inside he kept the general store moving along and on the outside started a side business fixing flat tires changing oil and doing automotive repair. He also cut pulpwood on the side and became Chambers County’s first dealer for Poulan chainsaws.

He was doing quite well when he got his draft notice which would be a life-changing experience. He sold the store to his younger brother Ben Langley and the Poulan business to his older brother Scott Langley. Langley would spend several years in the U.S. Army undergoing training at Fort Jackson in South Carolina and at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. He also spent some time at Fort Stewart in Georgia before going to South Korea for 13 months. He was there several years after the Korean War ended and the place still looked like a war zone with rubble piles everywhere where buildings had once stood.

“Our compound was fenced in and guards patrolled the grounds all the time” he said. “I was fortunate not to have a lot of dirty work to do. They got me to look after the records.”

One of the more memorable experiences was the trip over and back on a troopship. It took 21 days and anyone not used to the rocking back and forth of a ship on the high seas was in for it.

“You had to stand up to eat” Langley said. “Your tray would go back and forth as the ship rocked.”

Like most of the troops being transported Langley got used to it in a few days but there was another problem when the ship ported in Hawaii Wake Island and San Francisco.

“When you’d try to walk on dry land it was almost like the pavement was coming to hit you” he said.

A sight Langley will never forget was the Golden Gate Bridge.

“I knew we were back home in the U.S.” he said. “I was so happy to see something of our country. I was glad to see far-away places like Korea Japan and Hawaii but I was so glad to be back on the mainland. When I got off the ship I again felt like the pavement was coming up to hit me in the face.”

Langley came back to the U.S. aboard the S.S. General Mitchell. It was a troop transport that could hold up to 5200 men. It served through the Korean and Vietnam War eras before being cut up and scrapped in the late 1980s for $1.2 million.

Following his military service Langley wanted to get back home to Chambers County and get involved in the automotive business in some way. In 1959 he purchased the CV Tire and Recapping Business on North Lanier Avenue in Lanett. Little did he know at the time but he would be along that section of street for many years to come. He called the new business Langley Tire Service. He sold Goodyear tires and offered recapping front-end alignments balancing and brake service. That building is no longer there today. Right next door though was Bartlett Oldsmobile a business that had been owned by George and Homer Bartlett since 1946. They sold the business to Langley in 1965.

Inside the Langley Motor Company’s conference room is a large-framed black and white photo of that building and the first shipment of new cars to be sold there. The Oldsmobiles were a carryover from the Bartletts but Langley had acquired franchises for Buick and Opel vehicles. The photo shows new Oldsmobiles Buicks and Opels waiting for customers to check out.

Manufactured in Germany Opels were phased out in the U.S. when General Motors stopped having them shipped here.

Langley dropped Opels but got something bigger and better a few years later when Pontiac was added to their line.

Pontiacs were sold by Langley from 1982 through 2010 when they were phased out following a downturn in the U.S. economy.

“Oldsmobiles were our dominant brand through the 1980s” Mark Langley said. “Since the 1990s Buicks and GMC trucks have been our top sellers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pY2hpZ2FuL2RldHJvaXQvMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9nbS1lbmdpbmVlcnMtaGVhdGVkLXRlbnRzLWZvb2QtYWlkLzY2NjE1MzcwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM engineers build heated tents to keep vital food aid rolling,"A team of engineers from General Motors built a heated tent system to reduce wait times during drive-thru food distributions run by Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency.

The system — made up of six tents a trailer six heaters propane tanks folding tables and storage bins — also aims to make it more comfortable for staff and volunteers to give out food during the winter.

""It's definitely going to help us with the process because the cold weather can make you slow down a little bit and have to take more breaks"" said Brittany King lead organizer of food distributions for Wayne Metro. Though their passion for ""helping the community"" kept staff and volunteers motivated it's difficult to stay outside all morning and sometimes into the afternoon she said.

Me & My Car: ’89 Ram for ’51 Nash turns out to have been good deal Local News | Me & My Car: Disastrous press day SEC probe ruined Tucker’s dream

Me & My Car: Disastrous press day SEC probe ruined Tucker’s dream Local News | Me & My Car: Doomed ’48 Tucker dazzled auto press at first Are you familiar with the expression “if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it’s probably a duck?” Take a look at the car pictured this week. It looks like a 1947 Cadillac. It sounds like a 1947 Cadillac. So is it really an experimental 1947 Cadillac as the rear license frame states?

Walnut Creek resident Jay Prouty is not only a master craftsman; he is also a master trickster.

“I love hearing people tell me their dad owned one of these or they saw one just like this only it was red.”

Prouty’s car is literally one of a kind though and he built it himself.

“It started because I love the teardrop fenders on the Cadillac. My idea was if Cadillac had built a roadster in 1947 what it might have looked like” he said.

Prouty thought he knew. He went on to explain that if one is to build a car you need to start with something that has a windshield a firewall and two doors. A mechanic he knew gave him an early 1970s MG MGB so the windshield doors and firewall are all MGB. Then he bought a 1947 Cadillac four-door sedan to get the front and rear fenders hood and grille which he had to greatly customize. All of this is sitting on a 1970s Chevrolet Camaro running gear.

“The Camaro had sat outside near the ocean and although it had just a few miles on it it had a rusted-out body. I got it real cheap because of the rust but I just wanted the running gear with low mileage” Prouty said.

The car is powered by the Camaro’s 350 V8 engine with automatic transmission and uses the same car’s power steering and brake systems. The Continental Kit idea came from the 1941 Lincoln which has always been a favorite of Prouty and the taillights are from a 1959 Cadillac. The car is painted Seafoam Green a 1949 Ford color. Prouty likes the color because it is nonmetallic and makes the car look older.

“The top cost more than anything else on the car” he said. “I wanted it green to match the car and the only green convertible top material available was from BMW so I had to buy their material and have the top made.”

The seats and interior door panels are from the MGB and the upholsterer was able to match the color with the exterior. The project started about 15 years ago before Prouty retired and he worked on it nights and weekends. He said it took him four to five years to complete it.

Not counting any value for his labor he estimates he has about $4000 invested. It’s very hard to determine the current market value of this car but Prouty said at a car show in Fresno a few years ago a man wanted to trade him a Rolls Royce for his car. He does have a $45000 collision insurance policy on the car but he wouldn’t sell it for $45000. In fact he has no desire to sell it which is understandable.

“I never pull up to a stop sign next to a guy alongside of me who has the same car” Prouty explains. “The car drives great and it will do 70 miles an hour all day long. I’ve put it in shows where I’m probably the only full customized car in the show plus both of my sons want the car when I’m gone.”

So if it is not really a Cadillac what is it? According to the DMV it is officially a registered as a 1964 Chevrolet. Prouty drives the car about 2000 miles a year mostly in the summertime and to car shows. He recently won an award at the Danville Hot Summer Nights event but probably the highest compliment came from a former GM design engineer who was familiar with Cadillac designs of that era. The man spent about 20 minutes crawling over and under the car and then said to Prouty “We never built this car but we damn sure should have.”

Paton who's spent the last 14 seasons in Minnesota's front office was named Denver's GM six days ago after the Broncos interviewed five candidates for the position. And on Tuesday during his introductory press conference Broncos President and CEO Joe Ellis made it clear Paton was Denver's man from the start.

""Let me just say this from the beginning of our interview process George Paton stood out to us"" Ellis said. ""He is a seasoned smart steady person and executive who is going to go on to be a great asset for the Broncos for many years to come. He’s going into his 25th year in the league his depth of experience and knowledge is very impressive — from drafting and developing talent to working with the support staff. We’re very lucky to have a man of his caliber and very excited about his addition to the Broncos.""

And Paton who has turned down several GM jobs over the years had no hesitation when Ellis and President of Football Operations John Elway called him.

""The more I dug in the more I learned the more I really wanted I wanted this job bad"" Paton said. ""This was a job I really wanted.”

For those who tuned into Paton's press conference it was easy to see he isn't a man of many words opening with a 850-word pre-written statement before fielding 27 questions. His 850-word statement was more than double the length of any answer he gave during his 28-minute press conference.

But while Paton didn't say a whole lot while covering a variety of topics — from linebacker Von Miller's future to quarterback Drew Lock's potential — he did make his plan clear emphasizing two words: draft and develop. Paton said simply ""the more draft picks you have the more flexibility you have.""

“My philosophy and vision it starts with the process driven in our scouting department"" Paton said in his opening statement. ""There’ll be no shortcuts. We’re going to embrace the day to day we’re going to embrace the grind and we’re going to do it together. Drafting and developing players will be our foundation. It’s going to be the lifeblood of this football team. We’re going to be aggressive but we’re not going to be reckless in player acquisition. We’re going to leave no stone unturned.""

Paton was hesitant to share his ideas saying several times that he's taking the job week-by-week and day-by-day by not making any crucial decisions until he meets with his entire staff. Therefore he didn't offer much insight into Miller and Lock.

Paton said of Miller who is under criminal investigation while entering the final year of his contract: ""All those tough decisions start when I can meet with the coaches and the scouting staff. That's when you get your plan for the offseason.""

Paton said of Lock whose future in Denver seems to be in question as rumors about Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson swirl and the draft approaches: ""I liked Drew coming out of the draft. A big arm athletic a play-maker. I haven't studied him. I haven't gotten into a lot of tape. I've only been here four days. I've watched enough tape to know that he's talented. He can develop.""

Paton however did express confidence in the future of the team backing up his quote from the day he was hired when he said he felt the Broncos' were a ""sleeping giant.""

“I just think they have drafted well the last couple years. They have some good young players to build around"" Paton said. ""Now how long it takes I don’t know. We have to do our part but I do think there’s some pieces in place. They have a healthy salary cap position. ... Typically in this league you don’t have a lot of time to turn things around. You don’t have the six years it has to be quicker. ...

""I’m not going to give you a timetable but they do have some young pieces in place a healthy cap so there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic.”

While Paton didn't give many definitive answers on specific questions regarding the team or when success can be expected he Ellis Elway and coach Vic Fangio did emphasize that Paton will have final say on every decision including Fangio's future in Denver as he enters his third and final year of his contract.

“That's just life in the NFL. He might have to (make a decision about my future) but I'm not worried about that in any shape or form"" Fangio said. ""It's best for him to form his own opinion without the influence of me or the other coaches.""

But the bigger question isn't whether Fangio will meddle with Paton's vision but instead will Elway?

""Ultimately it’s going to be George’s decision"" Elway said. ""I’m going to be there to support him to give my opinions and give him everything I would look at when I was the GM and give him everything that would be in my mind in that situation to help him again make that decision and the best decision he possibly can. Once he hears everything he will still be the one making that decision because that’s his role and that’s his responsibility. ”

Paton was quick to acknowledge he has big shoes to fill replacing arguably the most influential figure in the franchise's history . It's a challenge he's willing to accept saying “I’m not going to worry about that. I’m just going to try to work with everyone here to do our best but John’s going to have to get in my ear and tell me how he did that.""

He added he's excited to work alongside Elway and that all decisions regarding the team will be made in unison.

""This is going to be a collective positive and diverse work environment with free-flowing ideas"" Paton said. “We’re aligned. We all believe that to draft and develop talent that you bring high-character players into your organization you develop them and hopefully get them second contracts and that’s how you build your best culture. Now when you go outside will you be aggressive and dip into free agency or the trade market? Yeah every now and then but it takes that right type of player to do that. I think we all believe in drafting and developing and making them into your own.

""It won’t be my decision it won’t be Vic’s or John’s — it will be a Denver Broncos decision.""

With exactly 100 days until the draft Paton's ""draft and develop"" plan will start almost immediately.

In the coming weeks he'll interview each member of the Broncos' front office and coaching staff and likely hire a ""right hand man."" He'll also have contract negotiations with players like safety Justin Simmons and defensive tackle Shelby Harris as well discuss Miller and Lock. And he'll start evaluating players for the draft — which he says will be ""very challenging"" with no combine this March — as the Broncos have their first top-10 pick since 2018.

In the coming years Paton hopes to restore the Broncos to their former glory and accomplish something he's never done in his 25 years in the NFL:

“I would like to win a Super Bowl here.”"

The Swedish company is now valued at $11bn and is Europe's second most highly-valued startup allowing shoppers to defer payments on goods at no cost.

But Klarna's stronghold in Europe is slowly coming under attack from a wave of new BNPL startups.

Among them are Scalapay Twisto and France's Alma who all announced fundraises of between €16m and €49m this month. This follows a record funding year in 2020 for the BNPL sector which raised $1.5bn globally according to CB Insights and prompted a strong public listing by Affirm in the US a fortnight ago.

The map below showcases Europe's 'Buy Now Pay Later' market including its top startups.

Note that Klarna is now in 12 European countries having recently expanded into Italy (it acquired Moneymour there in 2020).

Meet the mini-Klarnas

It's worth looking a little closer at the new BNPL startups and their varying products.

Alma

Alma's founders

HQ: France. Also looking to move into UK Belgium Italy and beyond.

Funding: €62.5m (its €49m Series B was announced today)

Notes: Alma reaped the benefits of locked-down shoppers and a retail sector in shock telling Sifted it saw “very strong growth” during lockdown and onboarded hundreds of merchants every month.

Led by Louis Chatriot — a well-respected second-time founder — Alma boasts a unique credit scoring system providing instant lending decisions to shoppers.

Divido

HQ: UK. Now works with banks in Italy Scandinavia France and Germany.

Funding: €16.1m

Notes: Divido is another consumer offering but does not front the loans itself. Instead it integrates with over 30 banks that process the debt. Divido simply handles the partnership and integration with merchants.

Twisto

HQ: Czech Republic. Now also live in Poland and looking at Romania next.

Funding: €36.8m

Notes: Backed by the likes of Finch Capital and ING Bank Twisto is one to watch as it races across Central Europe. Founded in 2013 1.6m customers have now used its app. It is now hoping to also become the top BNPL player in Poland taking on current leader PayPo.

Scalapay

HQ: UK Funding: €36.4m Notes: Zilch has launched what it dubs “an American Express for millennials and Gen Z” offering a card with a personalised credit line which is then paid back in installments. The company has won a rare consumer credit license from the UK regulator the FCA and recently hit the 100k user milestone.

ViaBill

HQ: Denmark. Now also in Spain. Funding: $10m (plus €40m in debt) Notes: Denmark's ViaBill counts over 900 merchants. Similar to Zilch it gives users a capped account of 2k kr which can be used to shop in online stores and paid back in installments.

The BNPL battleground

Klarna's CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski himself has acknowledged the threat these newer players pose.

He recently told Sifted he “worr[ies] about other startups more than PayPal"" explaining:

“I run around [the office] and I say ‘Have you seen this startup.’ And they say ‘oh my god here he comes again.'

“I always look at the smallest… [I'll say] like this little company here in Prague they’re doing something really exciting.”

Indeed Europe is still wide open to disruption.

""You've actually got no real European player [yet]"" Alma chief Louis Chatriot tells Sifted. ""Klarna is missing from France Central Europe and more...If you talk to big French retailers and ask what countries they're in Klarna isn't in that many [of them]."".

Alma now plans on filling the 'Klarna' gap itself by offering merchants a comprehensive offering across Europe buoyed by its latest €49m Series B. While having begun as a localised provider in France Alma is now among the most ambitious BNPL startups in Europe.

Investment boom

Despite continued questions about the ethics of BNPL VCs are keen to get a piece of this fast-growing pie (as shown below).

The average deal size in 2020 was $113m compared to just $26m in 2018

This boom is linked to BNPL's growing popularity especially in Europe.

By 2025 BNPL volumes in Europe are predicted to hit $357bn constituting nearly half of the entire global estimate and 30% of all estimated ecommerce spend.

Already in the UK £4 in £100 in the UK is spent using BNPL proving especially popular among millennials and Gen Z and soaring further during lockdown. The benefit for BNPL providers (and their investors) is they take an average cut of 3% of the entire transaction base. This has given way to a pretty resilient business model.

There's also a clear exit path for these startups whose hard-earned merchant base constitutes an attractive asset. For instance Spanish BNPL player Pagantis was recently acquired by Clearpay as part of its expansion strategy. The public markets also seem to be optimistic about the future of the BNPL sector (trading at many multiples their revenues).

Uphill battle

Nonetheless it's worth remembering that Europe's BNPL newcomers are up against some big players. Among them are PayPal Amazon and American Express who all recently launched 0% ‘installment’ payment options. In addition Australian-listed firms like Zip Laybuy and Afterpay (owner of London's Clearpay) have unveiled plans to spread into continental Europe. They could undercut startups like Twisto who so far have enjoyed a near-monopoly in their native countries. It could especially hurt startups dependent on a small number of big merchants (even Affirm makes ~28% of its revenues from just one client Pelaton!). The other threat to BNPL startups is innovation on wage-payments. ""Salary-on-demand"" fintechs like Hastee are helping employees get an advance on their wages hoping to reduce the need for short-term lenders.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYWxlZWp0aW1lcy5jb20vYmFua2luZy1hbmQtZmluYW5jZS91YWUtZXhjaGFuZ2UteHByZXNzLW1vbmV5LXdpbGwtcmVzdGFydC1vcGVyYXRpb25zLXNvb27SAW1odHRwczovL3d3dy5raGFsZWVqdGltZXMuY29tL2JhbmtpbmctYW5kLWZpbmFuY2UvdWFlLWV4Y2hhbmdlLXhwcmVzcy1tb25leS13aWxsLXJlc3RhcnQtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy1zb29uP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UAE Exchange Xpress Money will restart operations soon,"The appointment of the advisor represents a significant milestone in the consortium’s plan to recapitalise Finablr on behalf of its customers employees and stakeholders the consortium said in a statement. — File photo

Published: Sun 24 Jan 2021 4:34 PM Last updated: Mon 25 Jan 2021 7:22 AM

Two flagship brands of the troubled Finablr Group — UAE Exchange and Xpress Money — are expected to restart operations soon following the recapitalisation and revamping of the global payment solutions firm.

A consortium of Prism Group of Israel and Abu Dhabi’s Royal Strategic Partners which reached a pact in December to acquire the debt-ridden Finablr for “a nominal initial consideration of $1 has appointed Moelis & Company as its advisor.

The appointment of the advisor represents a significant milestone in the consortium’s plan to recapitalise Finablr on behalf of its customers employees and stakeholders the consortium said in a statement.

“The move will lead to the swift re-opening of UAE Exchange the Abu Dhabi-based remittance house whose branches have been closed since March 2020 along with the group’s other leading products. They include global money transfer group Xpress Money and businesses in international markets including India” it said.

The Prism-RSP consortium said the investment bank would advise them on the restructuring and transformation of Finablr Ltd and its subsidiaries founded by BR Shetty the embattled Indian businessman who left to India leaving behind huge debts running into several billions of dollars.

Prism Group headquartered in Switzerland is linked to a former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. RSP which is headed by Abubaker Al Khoori is affiliated with Sheikh Hazza bin Zayed Al Nahyan Vice Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council.

The consortium and Finablr have been working in conjunction with regulators and stakeholders to conclude the formalities of the acquisition. “In addition the consortium has been funding urgent working capital needs to stabilise the business and to preserve value and is seeking to restart operations and develop a business plan for the group going forward.”

The statement said the acquisition would enable acquisitions to restart and secure the future of the group which is a major provider of cross border financial services in the UAE. The products it offers include currency exchange and remittance solutions services to more than 25 million customers and over 1500 corporate partners in more than 45 countries.

Dr Hamad Al Ali CEO of Royal Strategic Partners said the consortium had continued to make tremendous progress over the past months with the leading global advisors assisting on this deal.

“Our engagement of Moelis as our financial advisor is yet another testament to our commitment to reviving the business swiftly whilst keeping in mind the best interests of its lenders customers and employees.”

“I am thankful to the leadership of the UAE its regulators our creditors and all our stakeholders for their engagement and support as we push forward with the transaction with the Consortium to revitalise the Company’s operations in the UAE and beyond” said Robert Miller Finablr Group CEO.

Speaking from Prism’s regional office in Dubai co-founder Amir Nagammy said the consortium is committed to implementing a long term group-wide transformation programme at Finablr so that it can better serve its customers strengthen its balance sheet and play a leading role in driving economic growth in the UAE.

“The fintech market is evolving rapidly and Finablr’s transformation will build on its proprietary technology to ensure that it is well placed to drive further innovation and investment in leading digital payment platforms and services for all its global customers”.

“Together with Royal Strategic Partners the consortium is committed to working with all of the Finablr Group’s stakeholders to build a major international fintech company that can contribute to the continued economic and commercial success of the UAE” said Nagammy.

Thanks to the dyskinesia-dancing my Fitbit registers 10125 steps while I sit in the truck for the seven-hour drive to Vancouver. Dyskinesia is the involuntary movement caused by the medicine I take to help manage my Parkinson’s disease.

I am on my way to Vancouver travelling in the time of COVID so I can get my long-awaited deep-brain stimulation surgery. It won’t be a cure – there isn’t a cure for Parkinson’s – but it has the potential to mitigate the most bothersome of my symptoms.

On the morning of the surgery it takes four tries and four different nurses to get my IV started. I decide this is not an omen.

My neurosurgeon rubs the top of my buzzcut scalp.

Nice he says softly.

And then he pushes the stretcher to the MRI lab. I decide this can be the omen his kindness his attentiveness.

MRIs are loud! Really loud.

The young Scottish neurosurgeon doing a fellowship with my doctor fits me with a halo. Halo. Funny word for a metal brace bolted to my skull. It takes a while. There’s quite a bit of tugging. It seems as if it might be hard work. I recite poetry in my head; Yeats and Frost and Mary Oliver get me through.

I am back in pre-op while the surgical team use the MRI to fine-tune their plans. I ask my daughter to take my picture so I can see what the halo looks like. I don’t recognize myself. I am bald. I am kind of smiling. I look nothing like an angel.

There are a lot of people in the operating room when we finally get there. My double-vision makes it seem like more. They all introduce themselves. I appreciate that.

“In our family we call this procedure ‘getting my magic wires’” I tell the surgeons. They laugh a little.

A while later my surgeon says “I like that ‘magic wires’ we may use that from now on.”

I am quietly pleased.

I listen as my surgeon advises his Scottish counterpart how to cut my scalp to create the skin flaps that will be peeled back to expose my skull for the drilling of the two holes into which the magic wires will be inserted. Their endpoint is in an area of the brain known as the globus pallidus. Globus pallidus. It sounds like a Harry Potter charm. It begs to be said with a wand flourish.

“Nice curved lines” the senior surgeon coaches. “No sharp corners.”

Am I this young doctor’s first deep-brain stimulation surgery? I wonder.

The thought does not concern me. Someone has to be first and I feel in very good hands. Or maybe there are just really good drugs in the IV.

“Magic wires time!” he says cheerfully.

The drill is loud. Really loud. And it takes a while. Nancy the lovely nurse holds my hand. My mantra begins: Please guide his hands. Please guide his hands. Please guide his hands before devolving to: Don’t hit grey matter. Don’t hit grey matter. Don’t hit grey matter. He doesn’t. Then it is over. The drilling that is.

Nurse Nancy asks me if I’d like music.

“Beatles please” I say because I will know the words and be able to sing along in my head. And I am running out of poetry. The first song is Here Comes The Sun.

There are squishy things like giant blood pressure cuffs on my legs. They rhythmically inflate and deflate keeping the blood flowing preventing clots.

The probe goes in first one side then the other. The surgeons talk to each other in co-ordinates and millimetres. The senior neurosurgeon holds my hand to monitor my reaction. I repeat 4 5 6 to make sure my speech is okay. At one point I find I am having trouble getting the numbers out. They back up and try again. Beautiful job magicians.

I see flashing lights like tiny starbursts on the edge of my vision. The younger doctor has never witnessed this particular response before. My doctor asks me to describe it for him.

“Bright” I say “like sparklers. Kind of cool.”

That makes them chuckle.

“Old hippie” I add.

There are definitely good drugs in the IV.

The halo is removed. Thank goodness. I think of little children strapped into car seats and understand why they go ballistic.

I get to sleep for the final phase of the surgery the part where the battery is placed in my belly. Typically it goes in the chest but I am too thin. After all I have been moving non-stop for years.

I wake in the recovery room. My head hurts a little. My belly hurts more. The battery is the size of a deck of cards but it seems larger and the incision site is tender.

You did a good job the surgeons tell me. It went really well.

Thank you I say. You did a good job too.

I mean it. But this is not the end. I need to heal before my device can be activated in about six weeks’ time.

The next day I am discharged and my daughter and I walk slowly back to our hotel. It’s not far.

I have two full days to rest before the trip home. The surgery seems to have settled the dyskinesia in my upper body. It makes me cry – being able to sit still. When we drive home I clock under 1000 steps for the entire day.

This beautiful calm does not last. Three weeks post-surgery I am full-body dancing again. But the lighting of my neural Christmas tree is not too far away.

When the day comes my daughter and I meet the DBS specialist nurse in the same small office in which I had my pre-operative assessment. That was a gruelling process several hours long during which we confirmed that dyskinesia was my most disabling symptom and therefore the focus of the surgery.

The “turning on” of my magic wires is different a gentle subtle drama. Working with an iPad on her lap the nurse finds the sweet spot settings through trial and error a process that triggers multiple sensations from tingling to nausea to a full-on Starry Starry Night explosion behind my left eye.

My daughter takes a short video with her phone.

Hey Mom she asks “What just happened?”

“I’m sitting still” I answer and I let the tears fall.

I am sitting still. I am standing still and walking normally. My foot doesn’t roll up on its side and I have experienced no muscle cramps no hand or leg tremors since that day. I still have Parkinson’s. The disease has many ways to make its presence known. Symptoms may return and new ones lurk somewhere in my future. But for now and possibly years to come I get this sweet return to some of what I was. Who I was.

I believe in magic.

The “kind of laugh where you turn blue” said her son Newton Murphy.

For Dorothy Murphy family was the light of her life the people she cherished and protected.

“A real-life Carol Burnett” said her nephew Donny Patscheider.

Known as Sue Dorothy Murphy died April 27 after a brief battle with COVID-19. She was 83.

A lifelong resident of Massachusetts Sue was born in Peabody and was a longtime resident of Salem. She was one of four children.

Sue was a single mother until her oldest son Robbie was 10.

“Sue lived a very tough life in her own right” Donny said. “Never stopped working.”

In 1966 she met Donald the man who would become her husband. It was as if her “life fell into place” her family said. They were married for 35 years and ran S & M Answering Services together for more than 20.

A graduate of Marion Court College where she received awards for her shorthand writing skills Sue never stopped learning always keeping up with current events. Her interest prompted her to volunteer to help Ted Kennedy in his 1994 US Senate reelection campaign.

“She had what she needed and did what she wanted to do” said her cousin Joe Reilly.

While Sue’s love for her husband and sons ran deep the love she felt for her nieces and nephews was rare. “Auntie Sue” forged special bonds with them serving as a mother figure.

“She always remembered everyone’s birthday she made sure everyone always got a birthday present” said Joe whom she nicknamed “Fella” and said he felt more like her nephew than cousin.

“She was my favorite person” Donny said.

Later in life Sue’s “favorite place in the whole world was going down to see her second family in New Bedford” said Newton referring to her sister’s home.

“It was where she felt at peace” he said.

Sue would visit Joe and his family at least once a month. They would sit around the kitchen table for hours catching up and laughing relatives said. Sue loved music so Donny would strum a guitar while sitting on the kitchen floor as the family gathered around the table and sang along. Sue would request anything from Patsy Cline to Elvis.

Sue was a young soul whose presence was captivating Joe said.

“She always knew who she was” he said. “She always had that way about her. You always knew where you stood in her heart.”

If you caught her on the phone with any of her nieces and nephews she would never be interrupted Newton said. She always made sure you knew that when you were speaking with her you had her full attention.

Sue was cracking jokes until the very end.

“I’ve never seen her mad” Joe said.

Working at Goldman Sachs has taught me that the most impactful solutions are best arrived at by answering a simple question: “How does this help our clients?” Last year I was offered the opportunity to join our Transaction Banking (TxB) business as a Product Manager to ask that question often and apply this core ethic of GS in solving a new client need – simplify billing for corporate clients. Innovation has been in the DNA of TxB and we took that same mind-set to build a billing product that is easy to use error proof and powered by analytics.

Why a new billing approach?

We started our journey by listening to our clients and the challenges they face today. Here’s what we heard:

Clients receive paper statements that are clunky and difficult to understand

They are charged for thousands of services that make bill statements complex and less transparent

There often are errors in bill statements resulting from manual processes and disjointed legacy billing infrastructure

Clients have to invest in tools to make sense of complicated bill statements

The solution

These insights from clients motivated us to reimagine billing. We started from scratch and first designed an end-to-end client journey for the treasury of the future. Our goal was to create a workflow that was efficient and automated. Here’s some of the progress we’ve made so far:

Simplified Pricing. Simplifying pricing is the first step toward simplifying billing for our clients as it makes statements concise simple and transparent. We simplified our charging structure and reduced chargeable services by more than 50%. For instance clients are now charged only for processing a transaction and not for multiple other hidden charges attached to the transaction.

We simplified our charging structure and reduced chargeable services by more than 50%.

We created a modern infrastructure that is fully integrated with the Transaction Banking technology stack to ensure there are no gaps between what is agreed to with clients and what is eventually charged. Additionally being cloud native and end-to-end automated our billing platform was designed to deliver error-proof bill statements to our clients within just a few days of completion of bill cycle.

Prowess of Analytics. We designed a digital-first billing experience that is easy to use and powered by analytics to empower treasurers to optimize costs using their own activity data. In addition to providing simplified bill statements our billing experience includes a gamut of innovative functionalities to support modern treasury management solutions. We’re looking at disruptive billing solutions to support our industry leading liquidity products such as virtual accounts Hybrid Deposit Accounts offering earnings credit and interest and others. We’re also integrating billing analytics and cost optimization strategies for smarter treasury management and an API enabled platform to integrate bill data easily with ERPs and Treasury Management software.

Miles to go...

So far the journey to build an innovative product from the ground up far beyond what the industry offers today has been very exciting. We look forward to further building out and sharing our vision as we expand internationally to solve billing complexities of global treasury.

When Goldman Sachs announced that it would help companies go public only if they had at least one diverse board member — meaning that the bank wouldn’t work with I.P.O. hopefuls whose directors were all white men — it was met with a mix of support and skepticism. In the year since with less fanfare the bank has also built up a business to help recruit directors for those boards which has expanded to cover public companies as well.

Yet while E&P companies sold off sharply on the news one can argue that the decision wasn't exactly a surprise for the drillers themselves because as the following chart from BofA shows federal drilling permits spiked into year-end as companies clearly anticipated a ban on drilling on federal lands.

But it's not just speculation about what impact on drillers - and especially frackers will be - Biden's intervention will have: an just as important question is what to expect on the price of oil as a result.

Well overnight Goldman's commodity team said that a lack of urgency from the US government to lift Iranian sanctions and a push for larger fiscal spending support the constructive view on oil and gas prices; at the same time it estimated that a 2 trillion stimulus over 2021-2022 would increase US demand by 200k bpd and stated that delays in a full return of Iran production would support the bullish oil outlook. Goldman's summary which could say is obvious: ""policies to support energy demand but restrict hydrocarbon production (or increase costs of drilling and financing) will prove inflationary in coming years given the still negligible share of transportation demand coming from EVs (and renewables).""

In short just what Putin and the Crown Prince ordered.

Below we excerpt from Goldman's note:

Initial orders by the Biden administration include restrictions on North American hydrocarbon leasing drilling and pipelines. In turn initial comments suggest no urgency in lifting sanctions with Iran. Combined with a push for greater fiscal spending - and hence higher energy demand - these initial actions reinforce our constructive view on oil and gas prices. As we have argued policies to support energy demand but restrict hydrocarbon production (or increase costs of drilling and financing) will prove inflationary in coming years given the still negligible share of transportation demand coming from EVs (and renewables).

The Interior Department imposed on Wednesday a 60-day moratorium on oil and gas leases and drilling permits on federal lands minerals and waters . This order is temporary and has no impact on near-term activity as producers had aggressively accumulated federal drilling permits. While temporary this order nonetheless suggests that the new administration views its pledge to halt leasing on federal lands as a priority of its climate plan with such a broader moratorium on federal leasing potentially scheduled for next week according to Bloomberg. As we argued ahead of the election such actions point to both higher production and financing costs for shale producers in coming years as well as lower recoverable resources. The additional orders to impose a moratorium on leasing activity in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to revoke Keystone XL’s border permit point to a similar regulatory shift.

On their own these actions do not point to a faster tightening of the oil market. in 2021-22 as a ban on permitting would still leave a window of up to two years to drill from elevated outstanding permits . In fact this would likely shift drilling activity away from private to federal land (for example from the Midland to the Delaware basin) for a couple years to minimize the loss of recoverable resources. While producers are focused on shareholder returns over production growth investors may support more aggressive drilling to secure future cash flows potentially creating a modest headwind to sharply higher oil prices in the next few years. The administration’s focus on fiscal spending and recent foreign policy comments are however likely to help tighten the oil market in 2021-22.

The release of President Biden’s COVID-relief plan has led our economists to increase their assumption for additional fiscal measures from $750bn to $1.1tn. Larger boosts to disposable income and government spending will make this recovery energy intensive long before it hurts oil demand in our view especially as they come alongside those in China and the EU. On our estimates a $2 trillion stimulus over 2021-22 would for example boost US demand by c. 200 kb/d. Such spending would further contribute to a weakening dollar which itself lends support to oil prices. A faster vaccination roll-out would in turn accelerate the rebound in jet fuel consumption which still accounts for more than half of the remaining lost oil demand. ADVERTISEMENT

Finally the new administration’s focus on reaching bi-partisan policy support suggest a lessened incentive to quickly revisit the divisive Iran nuclear deal. While the US president has significant freedom to re-enter the JCPOA agreement (see Appendix)the confirmation hearing for the US Secretary of State and Treasury Secretary focused on the need for consultation with Congress and US allies on Iran being non-compliant and on the goal of reaching a stronger and longer new deal. We view such statements as consistent with our assumption that the increase in Iran exports will remain moderate in 2021 (we assume 0.5 mb/d in 2H21) with in fact risks that our assumed full recovery in Iran production in 2Q22 proves optimistic. Delays in a full return of Iran production would reinforce our bullish oil outlook since we already forecast a tight 2022 crude market with low OPEC spare capacity.

Stronger demand and a slower ramp-up in Iran production would create a larger call non shale production which will face higher regulatory costs leading to further increases in long-dated oil prices . The oil market experienced such an outcome in 2018 when the loss of Iran production and strong economic growth pushed oil prices sharply higher. As we argued at the time the rally to $80/bbl Brent prices was necessary to bring high-cost Bakken barrels to the global market by rail. Notably the potential halt to Dakota Access Pipeline flows could recreate such conditions incoming years (the pipeline may need a new Environmental Impact Study from the Army Corps of Engineers which is led by a presidential appointee which could stay its operations).

Leon Rose and Co. instead opted for another sliding prospect Obi Toppin but Haliburton delivered a close-up view of what the Knicks passed on Friday night.

The point guard from Iowa State provided a spark off the bench with 16 points and hit a dagger 3 late to sink the Knicks’ comeback hopes as the Kings pulled out a 103-94 win at Golden 1 Center.

Haliburton who wound up being the No. 12 pick by the Kings was also active defensively finishing the night with four blocks two steals and five rebounds while shooting 7 of 13 from the field with two assists and three turnovers in 31 minutes.

“I guess it fueled me personally” Haliburton said with a grin after the game when asked if playing the Knicks added any motivation. “But I love it here. I’m glad I slid to 12. … It’s not hard feelings or nothing it is what it is. It’s a business I don’t care.

“My job is to make them think about that when they go to sleep. So I’m just going to go out there and be the best player I can be. I’m not that big into that [motivation].”

Haliburton scored 11 points in the second quarter alone showing off an ability to get to the rim but his biggest shot came in the fourth quarter. Shortly after the Knicks had worked to cut a 10-point deficit to two he drained his second 3-pointer of the night to put the Kings ahead 96-87 with 2:35 to go.

“He finds a way to make winning plays” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “He makes a fair share of mistakes as well for being a young player but he finds a way and he plays with a confidence that’s contagious. It really makes it enjoyable to be out there on the court with him.”

Haliburton’s impact was felt on a night when Toppin and Immanuel Quickley the point guard the Knicks ended up grabbing with the No. 25 pick had quieter performances. Quickley in particular has opened eyes early in the season but he and Toppin combined for just 14 points Friday night.

Haliburton meanwhile entered the night averaging 11.1 points and 5.1 assists per game while shooting 50 percent from the field and 49.2 percent from beyond the arc.

“Very good young player” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said before the game. “The thing I like about Haliburton is the versatility. He’s both good with the ball and can play off the ball.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvb3BzcnVtb3JzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxL2Vhc3Rlcm4tbm90ZXMtaGFsaWJ1cnRvbi1rbmlja3MtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWJ1bGxzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eastern Notes: Haliburton Knicks Ellington Bulls,"Kings rookie Tyrese Haliburton made the Knicks pay on Friday for choosing not to draft him last month Greg Joyce of the New York Post writes.

Haliburton who was selected with the No. 12 pick in the draft finished with 16 points and four blocks off the bench in the team’s victory over New York. The Knicks ultimately bypassed Haliburton in the event and chose to draft Obi Toppin at No. 8 instead.

“I guess it fueled me personally” Haliburton said with a grin as relayed by Joyce. “But I love it here. I’m glad I slid to 12. … It’s not hard feelings or nothing it is what it is. It’s a business I don’t care.

An investigation by The Ferret ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow aka COP26 can reveal that both Glasgow and Strathclyde universities invest in Royal Dutch Shell and BP. Glasgow University also invests in Halliburton a US firm which operates in the oil and fracking sectors.

The universities also own shares in arms companies such as BAE Systems Thales and Leonardo major players in a military-industrial sector whose carbon footprint has caused concern.

According to one report arms firms annually emit more greenhouse gases than 60 individual nations – including Uganda which has a population of 45 million people.

Critics have called on both universities to divest from these firms arguing they should not fund companies that profit from environmentally damaging practices and conflict.

Campaign group People and Planet said academic institutions continuing to invest in fossil fuel companies “shows a clear and indefensible gap between words and action”.

In reply however both Glasgow University and Strathclyde University said they are fully committed to tackling the climate emergency.

COP26 Uni network

COP26 is due to take place in Glasgow in November. The United Nations event will be hosted by the UK Government with US President Joe Biden expected to attend as well as dozens of other world leaders.

Both Strathclyde and Glasgow universities are part of the COP26 Universities Network which involves more than 40 UK universities.

The Network’s mission “is to ensure that the UK academic sector plays our role in delivering a successful COP26 getting all players on track to deliver a low-carbon resilient world”.

It adds: “We aim to do so by easing access to evidence and academic expertise for COP26 for government NGOs and other actors and by taking action ourselves.”

The Ferret looked at hundreds of firms’ green credentials after obtaining details of universities’ share holdings through freedom of information requests.

We found that Glasgow University’s shares in BP Shell and Halliburton were worth £2161314 collectively as of 31 July 2020. Strathclyde University’s shares in BP and Shell were jointly worth £1052731 on the same date.

Both universities also invest in arms companies whose operations impact the environment.

Glasgow University has shares worth £524381 in BAE Systems and £18253 in Leonardo an Italian arms firm which employs nearly 2000 people in Edinburgh.

Its shares in US defence company Lockheed Martin are worth £151587 while shares in Northrop Grumman amounted to £80230. It also invests in the French arms firms Thales with holdings worth £16418 while its shares in Qinetiq were worth £523994.

The total Glasgow University has invested in arms firms amounts to £1314863.

Strathclyde University has shares worth £514200 in BAE Systems and £137653 in Thales a total of £651853.

The Ferret calculated that both universities collectively hold shares worth £5180761 in fossil fuel and arms companies.

Military activity such as deploying combat planes warships and tanks is energy intensive and dependent on fossil fuels.

A report last year by Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) and Declassified UK said the military-industrial sector is a large source of greenhouse gas emissions.

SGR analysed the carbon emissions produced by 25 leading UK-based arms companies.

The report said the carbon footprint of UK military spending in 2018 was the “equivalent to the total CO2 emitted by the annual average mileage driven by over six million UK cars”.

BAE Systems the UK’s largest arms corporation contributed 30 percent of the emissions the report said.

Ric Lander divestment campaigner at Friends of the Earth Scotland said: “Glasgow University students and staff will be especially surprised given the university made a historic commitment to divest from fossil fuels as long ago as 2014. What’s the hold up?”

The continued investments of academic institutions in fossil fuel companies the industry most responsible for the climate crisis shows a clear and indefensible gap between words and action. J Clarke People and Planet

Lander pointed out that some of Scotland’s universities have gone fossil free including Glasgow Caledonian and Edinburgh University. He said this proves that “investment in zero-carbon solutions is entirely achievable”.

Lander continued: “In 2021 the year of COP26 divestment from fossil fuels would be a fantastic way for Glasgow-based institutions to make a bold statement for climate justice.”

J Clarke co-director of climate campaigns at People and Planet – a UK-wide student network – said: “The continued investments of academic institutions in fossil fuel companies the industry most responsible for the climate crisis shows a clear and indefensible gap between words and action.”

Clarke added: “Universities positioning themselves as key actors in the solution to the climate crisis must immediately cease actively participating in the causes of that crisis. As the divestment movement has been saying for almost a decade: if it is wrong to wreck the climate it is wrong to profit from that wreckage. It is time to move the money out of fossil fuel companies.”

Emma Cockburn Scotland co-ordinator for Campaign Against Arms Trade said it was “disgraceful” that Glasgow’s two largest universities are investing millions of pounds worth of public money into “companies who thrive on arms sales and the exploitation of the Earth’s natural resources”.

“These institutions are supposed to be working for the public good ” Cockburn added.

She called on universities to “do the right thing by adopting ethical investment policies”.

Cockburn added: “With COP26 fast approaching the contribution of Scotland’s universities should be to champion positive-change and to focus on the devastating impact that these sectors are having in conflict zones around the world and on the environment around us.”

We are committed to implementing a responsible investment strategy that takes account of a range of environmental social and governance issues to inform the university’s investment portfolio. Steven Wallace Strathclyde University

In reply Strathclyde University said that last year it transferred approximately seven per cent of its investment portfolio to a sustainable fund “resulting in a near halving of the carbon intensity of the portfolio”.

The university added it does not invest in companies that breach a number of criteria on human rights and ethics including firms deemed “incompatible with the ‘2 degree world’ climate change objective”.

Steven Wallace Strathclyde University’s chief financial officer told The Ferret: “As a socially-progressive values-driven organisation the University of Strathclyde recognises and is fully aware of its responsibilities towards tackling climate change.

“We are committed to implementing a responsible investment strategy that takes account of a range of environmental social and governance issues to inform the university’s investment portfolio.”

A University of Glasgow spokesperson said the institution was “proud to have taken a leading role among higher education institutions in making real and lasting commitments to tackle the climate emergency”.

The spokesperson pointed out that in 2014 Glasgow became the first UK university to commit to fully disinvesting from fossil fuel investments within a decade adding that “this was a promise we are on track to deliver”.

Sustainable development goals

In 2017 Glasgow University signed the Sustainable Development Goals Accord to formalise efforts to combat climate change.

The university spokesperson added: “In 2020 we launched Glasgow Green our climate change strategy and action plan in which we promised to go further and faster with our climate actions setting an ambitious target to make the University carbon-neutral by 2030.

“Last year we also established our Centre for Sustainable Solutions to find new ways to turn our climate-related research into action and to further our integration into the local community’s climate change planning.”

Defence-related organisations provide a small fraction of the university’s total income the spokesperson added.

A BAE Systems spokesperson said: “We’re committed to the highest standards of environmental management and as a major manufacturer we’re focused on reducing the environmental impact of our operations products and supply chain as part of our sustainability agenda.”

A Shell spokesperson said: “We agree action is needed now on climate change. What will accelerate the energy transition is effective policy investment in technology and changing customer behaviour.

“Addressing a challenge this big requires a collaborative and global approach. Shell is playing its part. We have set an ambition to be a net zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner which means moving in step with society to address our own emissions and help customers to reduce theirs.”

A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said: “Lockheed Martin is applying sound science and forward thinking to address some of the most pressing environmental social and governance issues facing society today and in the future.

“As a global technology leader we’re engineering science that supports the world’s most advanced infrastructure from space-based communications to efficient energy access to government stability.

“As a responsible global citizen we’re developing our products and services in ways that protect the environment strengthen communities and propel responsible growth.”

Northrop Grumman says: “A global security company we understand that the conservation of natural resources and the mitigation of environmental impacts are vitally important for the protection of this generation and those to come.

“Our corporate values strongly support environmental sustainability and our greeNG Program is leading the charge on turning these ideals into action for the company. Through corporate programs and sector executed projects we are helping to drive long–term affordability and provide value to our customers and shareholders by reducing our environmental footprint and improving operational efficiency.”

Halliburton says: “Protection of health safety and the prevention of pollution to the environment are primary goals of the Company. The Company will strive to develop and provide products and services that have no undue environmental impact and are safe in their intended use efficient in their consumption of energy and natural resources and can be recycled reused or disposed of safely.”

BP says: “We approach every major project aiming to understand and sustain the local environment through reciprocal engagement with local communities. To identify potential impacts we carry out detailed environmental and social assessments before starting major projects.

“In 2019 we updated our requirements and associated guidance in our operating management system (OMS) for sites to effectively mitigate their environmental and social impacts through the mitigation hierarchy.”

In 2019 The Ferret reported that Shell had been named in a new database on pollution compiled by the government’s Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Shell’s St Fergus gas plant near Peterhead emitted nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas.

BP’s operations have caused oil spills.

Fire at Ororo oil rig

According to the organisation the public was earlier made to believe that the fire eruption which happened in May 2020 had been stopped after some months. It added that community contacts and a report by Africa Oil + Gas Report affirm that the fire has continued to burn at the time of this report.

The blowout in the oil rig followed by a fire already had huge impacts on the environment generally the aquatic ecosystem particularly and the livelihoods of community members especially fishers stated the Benin City-based outfit.

“Considering the enormity of the incident and its impacts the pall of silence over it is rather dreadful. It is sad to note that oil companies operating in the Niger Delta are rapidly setting a pattern of totally ignoring oil spills for weeks and months in the same way they have ignored gas flares for decades. This impunity must stop. Our people deserve better. The Niger Delta must not continue to be a sacrifice zone” according to Nnimmo Bassey the Director of HOMEF.

The National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) reportedly tweeted on May 18 2020 after the blowout and fire outbreak that Halliburton had been engaged to assist in extinguishing the fire.

According to NOSDRA “It will certainly take at least six weeks in the earliest to accomplish. Chevron itself battled a similar fire outbreak on [a] well head last year (2019) and it took it eight weeks to extinguish the fire through an indirect well. Joint Investigation was carried out yesterday Sunday because of the emergency nature.”

“It is saddening that eight weeks have become eight months and counting yet the fire has not been extinguished and is still causing destruction to the environment” lamented Ogechi Cookey HOMEF’s Communications and Research Officer.

HOMEF called on Chevron Nigeria Limited to immediately take steps to stop the fire.

“Besides stopping the fire Chevron should be adequately sanctioned for this act of ecocide and impacted communities and fishers should be adequately compensated. NOSDRA should be adequately supported to discharge her responsibilities without hindrance” declared HOMEF.",,,

By Ronni Newton

A fire in a single-family home on Elmfield Street in West Hartford late Saturday night has claimed the life of one person Fire Chief Greg Priest said.

According to Priest there were four individuals in the house when the fire occurred and three were able to evacuate on their own. At least one of those individuals was being evaluated at a local hospital he said.

No further details were available regarding the individuals who were in the home when the fire occurred and it is not known if they all resided there.

According to Priest a resident of Elmfield Street called 911 at 9:52 p.m. reporting “heavy fire condition inside their residence.”

Priest said the first apparatus arrived at 9:57 p.m. and found significant fire condition and were also told that at least one or possibly two people were trapped inside the residence.

Priest said that while multiple fire crews immediately began to extinguish the heavy fire others searched the interior of the residence for the missing occupant.

“The first of two companies located a victim in the first floor with non-survivable injuries and extricated that person” Priest said. He said the victim was presumed dead at the scene.

The rest of the family had self-extricated he said.

The fire was extinguished by 10:10 p.m. Priest said.

All on-duty West Hartford fire companies responded to the scene in addition to American Medical Response and the West Hartford Police Department. The Hartford Fire Department and UConn Fire Department provided back-up coverage for the town.

West Hartford Police the Fire Marshal’s Office and the state Police Fire Investigation and Explosion Unit will be assisting in the investigation Priest said. He said there was no determination at this time of the cause of the blaze but there was no reason to believe there was any foul play.

The Red Cross will be assisting those impacted by the fire.

“I’d like to offer condolences to those who may be affected by this loss” Priest said.

HERSHEY Pa. — Hershey certainly missed the sight of teddy bears raining down from the Giant Center stands ranging from fun-sized stuffed animals all the way to teddy bears the size of a car which in 2021 was fitting.

""We couldn't do our normal teddy bear toss where we toss our bears on to the ice. Instead we invited the community to toss bears from their vehicles and you can't even see the end of the line of cars"" said Hershey Director of Communications Kathleen McGraw.

The Hershey Bears teddy bear toss turned into a drive-thru this year and the cars were lined up an hour before a single teddy was tossed.

""I'm surprised that this many people came"" said Gabby Kerchner. ""It's a lot different than in the stadium.""

Kerchner's contributions to the teddy bear toss have been legendary over the years and a new approach wasn't about to stop her.

""We brought 4500"" added Kerchner.

""We were just happy that we were going to have a toss to get together with Bears fans and to spread a little cheer throughout the community"" said Brock Kerchner.

The event is usually held in December to set up a cheerful holiday season for many.

""We reached out to our community partners and said 'You know we'd like to do this in January' and they immediately said they'd absolutely have recipients so they'll be distributing bears over the next few weeks"" said McGraw.

""It brings joy to everyone we give it to said Gabby. ""When we count our bears we count them in smiles because we know it's going to go to that person and that it's going to make them happy.""

And this year it wasn't just the 31381 bears that were tossed. More than a truck full of food donations are now on their way to the Central PA Food Bank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2FwaXRhbHNvdXRzaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9oZXJzaGV5cy10ZWRkeS1iZWFyLXRvc3MtbGl2ZXMtb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hershey's Teddy Bear Toss Lives On,"Photos courtesy Hershey Bears

There was no official Teddy Bear Toss in Hershey this past holiday season due to COVID protocols but the Hershey Bears kept the spirit alive by soliciting donations at Giant Center on Saturday where they collected 31381 stuffed animals to give to charity.

Last season the Bears set a world record of 45650 stuffed animals tossed onto the ice after the Bears scored the first goal of the game. This year the Bears also collected non-perishable food to give to charity.

California's population and job growth have both slowed to a trickle with many citing concerns about high taxes cost of living and heavy regulations.

It's also the largest cruise port in the French overseas territory and serves about 2 million cruisers annually (pre-pandemic).

In addition to multi-night cruises Papeete port is also the embarkation point for regular ferries to Moorea and Bora Bora.

Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic the region is welcoming international visitors. Here's everything you need to know about French Polynesia's reopening.

French Polynesia

Tip: If you're traveling to Papeete from the United States you'll fly from Los Angeles San Francisco or Honolulu. The mainland's flight duration is about eight hours while it's about a six-hour trip from Hawaii. Those are long-haul flights and -- especially if you started from the East Coast -- you'll be tired when you land. Be sure to arrive a few days before your cruise embarks so you can enjoy a hotel and get over your jet lag.

Two cruise ships -- Paul Gauguin Cruises Paul Gauguin and Winstar Cruises' four-masted luxury motor-sail-yacht Wind Spirit -- homeport out of Papeete. Typically these ships offer seven-night or longer itineraries to neighboring islands in French Polynesia and beyond.

Paul Gauguin Cruises (owned by Ponant) specializes in French Polynesia cruises. It's all the line offers. Its voyages explore the Society and Cook islands as well as the Marquesas and Tuamotus. The 332-passenger Paul Gauguin also sails to Fiji and Tonga and sometimes calls on Melanesia and Indonesia's ports.

Cruise line transfers

As Paul Gauguin cruises are all-inclusive prices already include a flight from LAX to Tahiti on Air Tahiti Nui round-trip airport/pier transfers. (Note: If you prefer to book your own flights ask for the cruise-only fare.)

If you booked your cruise with Windstar Cruises ask about buying transportation from the airport or hotel to the port unless you booked your pre-cruise hotel through Windstar Easy Stays which takes care of your transfers to and from the ship terminal.

If you're sailing on Aranui 5 you can arrange to get to the port via taxi.

Hotel shuttles

Paul Gauguin's Extend Your Trip program includes a pre-/post-cruise hotel stay as well as transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the cruise port. Aside from that and Windstar's Easy Stays program you're hard-pressed to find hotels offering shuttle service to the pier unless you're willing to pay for private or group transfers.

Car rentals

You can also rent cars on some of the other Society Islands such as Moorea. (Photo by EQRoy/Shutterstock)

If you like to explore on your own you can rent a car SUV or scooter on Tahiti from a local agency like Ecocar Ecoscoot Tahiti Aeroport.

Daily rental rate starts from around $40 for an ""economic"" car such as the Fiat Panda which seats four people. Rate includes insurance unlimited mileage an infant or child seat and even free delivery during limited hours (subject to availability).

Independent van and car services

It's also possible to book a private car or van for your transportation needs on Tahiti. Marama Transports Touristiques is a good choice since its vehicles can accommodate groups of eight or more. Its fleet consists of Hyundai and Mercedes minivans Porsche SUVs Land Rover 4WD vehicles Mazda 4x4s and Chrysler 300 sedans.

Taxi and ride-hailing services

If you're not traveling by rental car or van in Papeete your best alternative would be a taxi; ride-hailing services aren't available here yet. What's good about taxis in Tahiti and even in neighboring Moorea is that the rates are regulated (warning: PDF link) by the government so you'll know what the trip should cost before you even get into the taxi.

Taxis charge a minimum of 1000 XPF (about $10) any time of day. The per kilometer price during the day (6 a.m. to 8 p.m.) is 130 XPF (about $1.50); at night (8 p.m. to 6 a.m.) it's 230 XPF (around $2.50).

Additional charges may apply for luggage uphill rides and long waiting times.

Public transportation

Tahiti has a bus service called ""Le truck."" It operates on a regular schedule on a route that mainly follows the coastline. Buses operate from Mondays to Saturdays only so if you arrive on a Sunday or during public holidays you'll have to arrange alternate transport in advance.

With a mostly local clientele the buses only take CFP francs so make sure to have enough cash to pay for your fare beforehand.

Where to stay

With Tahiti's interior being a mountainous paradise tourists should seek accommodations along the coastline. You'll find hotels from Mahina to Pa'ae but most congregate in and around Papeete's downtown area which is conveniently near the cruise port.

One hotel the InterContinental Resort Tahiti even offers airport views for you AvGeeks!

Note that many Tahiti hotels are bookable via cash or Ultimate Rewards points via the Chase travel portal.

Where to shop near the port

The cruise port in Motu Uta doesn't have any shops on its premises so you'll have to visit nearby establishments. Fortunately there are many shops close by.

Marche de Papeete (Papeete Market)

Marche de Papeete (Photo by EQRoy/Shutterstock)

Just a stone's throw away from the waterfront stands Marche de Papeete (BP4588 Papeete) the local public market that has been selling an assortment of local Tahitian products and produce for more than 150 years. Also serving as a cultural center of sorts the Papeete Market provides an inside look into the Polynesian islands within its two levels.

On the ground floor vendors sell fresh fruits local vegetables and flowers handcrafted items and more. Be on the lookout for vanilla beans black pearls and monoi products (soaps shampoos creams and oils) which are made from a mixture of gardenia tahitensis and Nucifera coconut oils. If you arrive around 4 p.m. you should spot some colorful fish being brought in from fishing boats.

The second floor is reserved for artisans selling tifaifai wall hangings or quilts pareos carvings embroidered items and other handicrafts. There are also vendors hawking their products such as leis and Tiare Tahiti flower crowns outside the market.

If you're feeling hungry an on-site cafeteria serves local dishes. Early Sunday mornings are a great time to grab breakfast here. That could include some coconut-flavored donuts called firi firi pua'a roti (roasted pork) and chao pao which are stuffed steamed buns.

The Papeete Market is open from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and until 9 a.m. on Sundays which can get a bit busy as Tahitian families drop by the market to shop ingredients for their Sunday feast.

Vaima Shopping Center

Vaima Shopping Center on Avenue du Marechal Foch about 2 miles away is a Tahitian mall where you can find various goods (including pearls) and services at reasonable prices. (You can see the mall from the cruise terminal and it's about a 30-minute walk.) The mall also features Le Kiosk Tahiti (Papeete 98714) which sells atlases stamps tourist maps and souvenir cards.

A little further away but still within a 10-minute drive is Champion at Rue du General de Gaulle behind the Temple Protestant de Paofai. The Champion Supermarket sells fresh pastries if you're feeling peckish as well as spices and other products; plus it has longer operating hours -- until 7:30 p.m. Also there are three Carrefour supermarkets in Tahiti: Carrefour Arue Carrefour Faa'a - Pacific Plaza and Oasis Carrefour Arue.

Where to Tahitian buy pearls

If you're on the hunt for pearls try Tahia Exquisite Pearls at Boulevard de la Reine Pomare IV (about 1.5 miles from the cruise port). The store features jewelry adorned with Tahitian pearls 18-karat gold and pave diamonds. The Tahiti Pearl Market (Rue Colette BP3396 PPT Papeete) about 1.5 miles from the port is another good spot to find some pearls. The family-owned establishment allows you to pick your pearls and the design you want with the final product available within a few hours.

Nearby drugstores

For any drugstore-related purchases you can head to Pharmacie du port (1 Rue Paul Gauguin) Pharmacie Prince Hinoi Papeete (Avenue Prince Hinoi Papeete) and Pharmacie Fariipiti (Papeete 98714). All are within 2 miles of the port.

Where to eat

Tahiti's cuisine highlights the fresh seafood and produce that are abundant on the island. Fish such as mahi mahi tuna and grouper are mainstays in restaurant menus. In addition Tahitian cuisine also features French and Asian influences.

One of Tahiti's top restaurants is Le Lotus at the InterContinental Tahiti Resort 6 miles from the cruise port. Set in an over-the-water building Le Lotus serves French and Polynesian cuisine featuring freshly caught seafood (catch of the day) meat dishes and a selection of French wines. The romantic ambiance one filled with candlelight live piano music and spectacular sunset views is perfect for a night out -- especially if you've got something to celebrate.

Another restaurant that combines good food with an amazing sunset view is O Belvedere. From its perch some 2000 feet above Papeete take in the city's sunset views below and even Moorea beyond. The restaurant has a treehouse ambiance with its outdoor terrace even built around a tree trunk. A ""must-order"" is the house specialty: fondue Bourguignonne served with six sauces. With its location in Pira'e about 4 miles from the port it's nice that the restaurant provides round-trip transportation from hotels and back or to the airport if you have a flight to catch.

You don't need to go far to eat good food though. Come evening head to Place Vai'ete (369 Boulevard de la Reine Pomare IV) a portside plaza about 2 miles from the port to take part in perhaps the most popular ritual of Papeete: roulettes or food trucks. At 6 p.m. colorful food trucks start rolling in and within a few minutes vendors start whipping up big portions of dishes from fresh ingredients for the crowds locals and tourists alike which have started to gather.

You'll find all sorts of food here at affordable prices from fresh Polynesian fish dishes to French classics as well as pizza and burgers Thai curries and Chinese stir-fries such as ""chao mein."" Must-tries include the poisson cru a Tahitian specialty of fresh raw fish with coconut milk and cold vegetables similar to poke or ceviche; brochettes or kebabs; and steak frites and poulet frites—charbroiled steak and chicken respectively— with french fries. If you're not here for a meal grab a crepe or waffle and enjoy the sunset.

To order simply go up to the truck and once your food is ready take it to one of the plastic tables. Don't forget to bring cash (the local currency is Pacific Francs) as the roulettes don't accept credit cards.

Sights to see

While a known honeymoon destination Tahiti's sights and attractions also welcome the entire family. Cruise passengers passing through the island have plenty of options from shopping and dining to sightseeing and outdoor activities. Here's what we recommend.

Point Venus (lighthouse and beach)

Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places in Tahiti Point Venus wasn't named after the Roman goddess but after a historic event that transpired in 1769 when Captain James Cook and the rest of the crew of Bounty observed the transit of the planet Venus — a once-in-a-century happening — from the site.

However the lighthouse Phare de la Pointe Venus wasn't built until about a hundred years later and remains to be Tahiti's sole lighthouse. It stands several feet away from Pointe Venus Beach whose black sand is a popular setting for picnics. If you'd like to have a memento of your visit take a look at the on-site souvenir shop and grab a bite to eat at the snack bar if you're feeling peckish. Point Venus is at the northernmost part of the island more than 8 miles from the cruise port.

Faarumai Waterfall

A hiking and sightseeing trip in one the journey to Faarumai Waterfall takes you through the village of Tiare on Tahiti's north coast. Roughly 15 miles from the cruise port Faarumai Waterfall actually consists of three cascades (Faarumai Waterfall is also known as The Three Cascades).

To see the first one Vaimahutu you'll have to hike through a mape (a type of chestnut) forest for about 325 feet. The second and third falls Haamarere It and Haamarere Rahi respectively are almost side by side and can be accessed after a 20-minute walk. Parking and admission are free. However swimming is prohibited so just enjoy the view. Don't forget to bring insect repellent to avoid stinging mosquito bites.

Gardens

There are many lovely gardens to explore when on the island including:

Water Gardens Vaipahi

Perhaps the best place to enjoy the island's tropical flora is at the Water Gardens of Vaipahi (Teva I Uta) along the southern coast of Mataiea roughly 30 miles from the cruise port. The garden features more than 75 tropical plant species including exotic flowers from around the world as well as winding streams springs pools waterfalls and a lily pad. The plants are marked with signs in both English and French.

This tranquil place is also sacred to Tahiti's Great Teva clan who believe their deceased souls must be purified by the waters of Vaipahi. The well-maintained and quiet environment is a good place to meditate or simply relax amid nature. A walk along one of its three paths ranging from a 1.2 mile/one-hour walk to a 3.1 mile/two-hour walk will be invigorating. Admission is free and there is parking available on site.

Paofai Gardens

If you'd rather stay close to Papeete and the cruise port head out to Paofai Gardens instead. It's by the boulevard so there will still be traffic noises but it's a peaceful enough place for a stroll along the waterfront. There are paved walking paths and the area features planter boxes with some blooms and several trees. Along the shore you might find some pirogues (outrigger canoes) and if you're timing is right i.e. afternoons and Sunday mornings you might catch local teams practicing racing on them.

Museums

There are also some very interesting museums on Tahiti.

Museum of Tahiti and The Islands

If you want to learn more about Tahiti and French Polynesia in general the Museum of Tahiti and Her Islands (Musee de Tahiti et des Iles) in Puna'auia is a good place to do so. Here concise and easy-to-understand exhibits explore Tahiti's geography and natural history its pre-European culture the effects of colonization and its natural wonders. There are displays in English too. Must-sees include its collection of ritual items canoes tattooing equipment and statues of wood or stone depicting various divinities called tiki.

After you visit the museum step outside to observe surfers on the water or Moorea beyond. Or peruse the gift shop which other visitors said was excellent.

Robert Wan Pearl Museum

Pearl pioneer Robert Wan's Pearl Museum (56 Avenue du Commandant Destremau Papeete 98713) isn't only a place to learn about pearls. Here you can buy them too.

The museum features myriad treasures such as a copy of the rosary beads with 57 pearls that were presented to Pope John Paul II in 1987 and Charles II of France's pearl-encrusted prayer book. Meanwhile the retail section offers jewelry single pearls and of course Tahitian black pearls of the highest quality and original designs. It also sells skin products with extracts of nacre the mother-of-pearl shell. The museum provides free tours for groups of two or more. Let them know of your visit at least five days in advance.

Bottom line

With a paradise island setting Tahiti is the perfect place to relax and unwind albeit for just a little bit. Cruisers who stopover here may want to stay closer to Papeete due to time constraints but those who'd like to extend their stay will have the rest of the island to explore. And for the uninitiated Tahiti is a great place to learn more about Polynesian culture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaXRzLXBhcmlzLWhpbHRvbnMtZmF1bHQtaGFuZGJhZy1kb2dzLWJlY2FtZS1hbi1hY3R1YWwtMjAwMHMtdHJlbmQuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's Paris Hilton's Fault 'Handbag Dogs' Became an Actual 2000s Trend,"Paris Hilton has been grabbing headlines for years now. The influential celebrity is responsible for setting quite a few trends some better than others.

These days Paris Hilton has been grabbing headlines not for outlandish behavior but for confessions about her past. Between explaining that the character she has been portraying was simply a persona she put on to handle her own traumas and laying bare her memories of serious abuse the Hilton we see today is a far cry from the one that rose to fame two decades ago.

Even so that character she created had a massive influence on pop culture and her impact on the landscape of reality TV still ripples out into today’s social media stars. One trend that can be linked directly to Paris’ rise to fame is that of “handbag dogs.” It sounds too ridiculous to be true but Hilton really did influence a generation — or at least a particular subset of it — to carry around living dogs like accessories.

Paris Hilton was a reality TV socialite

Hilton was born into extreme wealth. The heiress of the Hilton Hotels franchise her entire life was firmly situated in the lap of luxury and she was used to rubbing elbows with the elite from an early age.

These connections helped Hilton land a gig as a model from an early age and that work segued seamlessly into her time spent as a club promoter. She made big bucks — and plenty of flashy headlines — for simply showing up at nightclubs and events.

Around this time Hilton befriended Kim Kardashian who was also an up-and-comer on the fledgling reality TV scene. The pair were often spotted together and as Hilton began appearing in her reality TV series The Simple Life Kardashian was often labeled as her “assistant” — though Kardashian disputes that was her actual role.

What’s clear however is that the two women were each poised to take advantage of a new kind of influencer culture.

‘The Simple Life’ helped spark trends

Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie Reunited and Now Fans Want a ""Simple Life"" Reboot https://t.co/ooSZR21o59 pic.twitter.com/u2Vbmc7LUM — Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) April 10 2018

It was another close friend who became closely linked to Hilton as she rose to fame. She and BFF Nicole Richie starred in The Simple Life a reality TV series that premiered in 2003 and ran for five seasons.

The premise of the show was that Hilton and Richie — famously rich party girls who had always lived a life of luxury — would voluntarily give up access to their considerable wealth travel the country and take on odd jobs to earn cash. In other words they would be living “simple” lives in comparison to what they’d left behind.

While the show’s premise may have provided an appreciation for blue-collar labor it coincided with a rise in Hilton and Richie’s fame that made their unachievable lifestyles even more appealing. Their clothes hairstyles and speech patterns all became trendy.

Paris Hilton sparked a canine-related trend

Hilton’s ability to start a trend is undeniable. In the podcast Even the Rich the hosts talk about how Hilton’s unofficial endorsement of Juicy Couture helped the brand gain traction with other celebrities and go on to become a fashion trend.

Another trend that Hilton helped spark — even if it was accidental — was the use of tiny dogs as a sort of fashion accessory themselves.

Hilton was frequently seen with a Chihuahua in tow. As ABC News reports Her beloved pet Tinkerbell — who sadly died at the age of 14 in 2015 — had a ubiquitous presence in the many shots paparazzi grabbed of Hilton as she rose to fame.

The tiny pup often accompanied the heiress tucked into a fashionable handbag and soon the trend of acquiring dogs small enough to tote around town was spreading fast.

The trend has finally gone out of fashion and many dog lovers are sighing in relief. As The Guardian explains puppies purchased for the primary purpose of fitting into a purse soon found themselves — literally — outgrowing the role.

As the trend wound down many tiny pups found themselves dumped at rescue centers — a good reminder to us all that dogs are likely going to outlive fashion trends and maybe shouldn’t be at the center of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhc3ZlZ2FzYWR2aXNvci5jb20vcXVlc3Rpb24vMTAtb2xkZXN0LWNhc2lub3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Are the 10 Oldest Casinos in Las Vegas?,"Your answer about the oldest casino in and around Las Vegas (Railroad Pass) led me to wonder about the 10 oldest casinos that still exist in Las Vegas? Would you please list them? And can you include the dates they opened?

A:

We certainly can.

After Railroad Pass which will celebrate its 90th anniversary next August 1 (it opened less than five months after wide-open casino gambling was legalized in Nevada) the next oldest is El Cortez (1941).

Both the Golden Nugget and Flamingo opened in 1946. Binion's followed in 1951.

Then came the Sahara (1952) the Golden Gate (1955) the Fremont (1956) and the Tropicana (1957).

That's it for the '40s and '50s. Three casinos that opened in the '60s are still extant: the Four Queens (1965) Caesars Palace (1966) and Circus Circus (1968). The Westgate (previously known as the International the Las Vegas Hilton) opened in 1969.

Yes that makes 13. Yes it's more than 10. So sue us. But it gets us through the '60s."

(WECT) - Gage Justice has overcome a lot. He was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy when he was 5 and he’s had around the clock care for years -- but he’s always wanted to work. And sometimes good things happen when you least expect it.

He applied for a job at The Home Depot and it has been life-changing for him and his family.

“I don’t think they expected me to be like in a wheelchair they didn’t expect that. So when I went in for the interview he looked at me like ‘oh I didn’t expect this’” Gage said.

Gage said that he was both nervous and excited when he got the call for the interview but is so glad he got the job.

“That’s all he ever talked about ‘Nana you know if I could work I would help you. Nana I just want my own money to spend.’ So I was tickled I was really tickled” Bonnie Justice Gage’s grandmother said.

For Gage who loves music and horror films he said he is happy to buy things with his own money but most importantly he can help his grandmother.

If you would like to stop in and see Gage and maybe bring your dog along he works this coming Wednesday at The Home Depot on Carolina Beach Road.

Including a couple of forfeits Lake-Lehman won nine bouts picking up bonus points in six of them. Nick Zaboski won his match with a pin. The defending district champion and his coach told Newswatch 16 they like what they're seeing on the mat.

""I learned that our team had a lot more than I actually initially thought we had"" Zaboski a senior at Lake-Lehman said. ""There's a lot of kids that came back this year from last year and are bringing it a lot harder in the room and on the mats than they were last year. Kevin Burke I'm super impressed with along with our brand new heavyweight Chad Honeywell. They're both really bringing it this year and making a huge difference for our team. I would love to make another state run with this team like we did my freshman year. We have a lot of the kids back like we did our freshman year. We're all a bunch of hammers and we're better than we were then. That's for sure.""

""The biggest part is as a team we wrestle well"" added Lake-Lehman Wrestling Coach Jay Konigus. ""We have a lot of good individuals this year. We're a tight-knit group here. Wyoming Area hats off to them. They got a really good team. They got a lot of really good individuals also. I was really happy with the kids with their conditioning-wise and everything we're doing in the room. Our potential is pretty high. I'm very pleased with the kids.""",,,,,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

The Cezanne Ryzen 5000 part is seemingly restricted to a maximum clock of 2.60 GHz which leaves a mixed impression against the older Ryzen 3 4300U. However the results at base clock rate are a sign of good things to come.

More can be expected from the AMD Ryzen 3 5400U that recently turned up on Geekbench as part of a new HP ProBook x360 435 G8 laptop. The test results were 888 points in the single-core run and 3676 points in the multi-core test. When placed against results we have measured with the previous-generation Ryzen 3 4300U a fair initial response would be disappointment especially as the Ryzen 3 5400U is a 4-core 8-thread processor while the older Renoir chip does not support simultaneous multithreading and is limited to being a 4-core 4-thread part.

The differences between the Zen 3 Cezanne representative and the Zen 2 Renoir chip are striking in both tests. The Ryzen 3 4300U is only -9.41% behind in the multi-core test which is surprising considering the generous IPC gains one can expect from Zen 3 parts over Zen 2 SKUs and the Ryzen 4000 processor is even +15.65% ahead of the Ryzen 3 5400U in the single-core test. You would be forgiven for thinking that the Ryzen 5000 chip in this thin and light HP ProBook x360 435 G8 laptop was seriously underperforming.

However the Ryzen 3 4300U was in a 14-inch Acer Swift 3 laptop that had sufficient system performance to allow the Zen 2 chip to operate at its boost clock of 3.80 GHz. The figures from Geekbench for the Zen 3 processor are from a very early sample (stepping level 0) that is trying to take on a rigorous benchmark test at its base clock of 2.60 GHz. So if the Ryzen 3 5400U can produce these kinds of scores while being artificially hamstrung imagine what it might produce once further refinements are in place and it can utilize its reported boost clock of 4.0 GHz. Certainly a good sign for future benchmark runs.

When “making fast cars faster since 1991” is your chosen motto you better have an impressive portfolio to support that claim and the pros over at Hennessey Performance have plenty of remarkable undertakings that demonstrate their graceful abilities. In the past a few of this tuner’s most notable ventures have adorned the autoevolution pages with their might including a supercharged Ford F-150 Platinum (dubbed Venom 800 ) and a brutal GMC Sierra AT4 with 700 ponies on tap.All things considered there’s some serious talent at work on this Texas-based firm’s premises so it’s no wonder Hennessey’s specialists earned their rightful place at the very top of Uncle Sam’s aftermarket food chain. Not only will their tuning treatment bless your ride with a healthy dose of additional oomph it’ll also bring about a menacing aesthetic that’ll let everyone know they’re not dealing with a stock vehicle.I’ll tell you what; let’s dive in for a closer look at one of the juiciest custom pickups brewed under this company’s roof shall we? The masterpiece in question goes by the name of Mammoth 1000 – a Ram 1500 TRX that appears to have been hitting the horsepower gym for some time now. To give you a better idea as to how far this project has come we’ll kick things off by examining the standard truck’s main specs and features.A 2021 model from the ominous Ram 1500 TRX lineup is put in motion by a cruel 6.2-liter supercharged V8 colossus that’ll be more than happy to deliver as much as 702 hp at 6100 rpm. On the other hand the intercooled behemoth is fully capable of summoning up to 650 pound-feet (881 Nm) of ruthless torque at around 4800 revs.This vicious force is distributed to all four wheels by means of an eight-speed automatic transmission enabling the four-wheeled beast to accelerate 0-60 mph (0-96 kph) in just 4.5 seconds while its top speed is generously rated at 118 mph (190 kph). Without going into any other technical details we can probably all agree this bad boy is a genuine showstopper!Although an original TRX is pretty damn rad straight out of the box Hennessey’s Mammoth 1000 dials everything to eleven. For starters the tuner fiddled with the creature’s suspension settings to obtain an extra 2.5 inches (64 mm) of ground clearance. The factory hoops have been discarded to make room for the aftermarket artists’ very own 20-inch ten-spoke counterparts hugged tightly by off-road rubber for good measure.The new shoes are appropriately complemented by an assortment of bodywork tweaks that do a neat job at looking the business such as a chunky ram bar and a muscular bumper wearing auxiliary LED lighting modules at the front joined by a malicious rear bumper on the opposite end. To round out the visual modifications Hennessey went about adding electronic fold-out steps as well as their iconic badges on the Mammoth’s windshield doors and front bumper.Now that’s cool and all but the engine bay is where the real party’s at. Besides a fresh 2.65-liter supercharger unit you will also find upgraded pulleys high-flow fuel injectors and a custom air induction system. Furthermore a stainless-steel exhaust equipped with top-shelf catalytic converters allows the engine to breathe with ease.This whole shebang increases the mill’s output figures all the way up to 1012 wild horses and 969 pound-feet (1313 Nm) of feral twist which is truly staggering to say the least! Ultimately the pickup’s 0-60 mph (0-96 kph) acceleration time dropped to a remarkable 3.2 seconds while its quarter-mile time sits at no more than 11.4 seconds.To top it all off Hennessey’s package comes with a two-year (or 24000-mile) warranty. Mammoth 1000 will be subjected to a limited production run of 200 units and each copy will be priced at a hefty $135350. To be quite frank this beauty will leave you wanting for nothing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS9hYnQtc3BvcnRzbGluZS11cGdyYWRlcy0yMDIxLWN1cHJhLWZvcm1lbnRvci10by0zNjUtaHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ABT Sportsline Upgrades 2021 Cupra Formentor To 365 HP,"ABT Sportsline specializes in tuning VW Group vehicles and has just added the Cupra Formentor to its portfolio.

Thanks to a new engine control unit the German tuner has increased the turbocharged 2.0-liter TSI four-cylinder’s output by 60 PS (59 HP / 44 kW) and 50 Nm (37 lb-ft) of torque for a total of 370 PS (365 HP / 272 kW) and 450 Nm (332 lb-ft). With this upgrade the 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) sprint has according to ABT dropped from 4.9 to 4.6 seconds while top speed is still limited to 250 km/h (155 mph).

Also Check Out: Does This Cupra Formentor VZ Prototype Sound Like It’s Packing Audi Sport’s 2.5L Turbo Five-Pot?

An ABT exhaust system which enhances the soundtrack and features 102 mm (4 in) tailpipes is also available for the Formentor. Another option is a spring kit for the active suspension that lowers the ground clearance by up to 35 mm (1.4 in) while still leaving room under the arches for the new wheels.

The Formentor pictured here sits on the tuner’s 20-inch Sport GR alloys with a diamond-machined surface. The wheels are optionally available in matte black too and if the pattern does not suit your taste ABT also offers its 20-inch FR and 19-inch DR and ER-C rims.

For the time being no other parts for the Cupra Formentor can be found on the tuner’s catalogue but we reckon they could also launch a few exterior and interior upgrades in the future."

Revenue slipped across the company’s business lines though the most painful miss came in Big Blue’s cloud and cognitive software segment which saw revenue fall 4.5% year over year to $6.8 billion. That was well below the $7.3 billion Wall Street had been expecting for a key business unit that had been showing steady growth of late. The Dow component’s share price sunk 10% on Friday in its worst post-earnings reaction in at least five years according to FactSet.

View Full Image IBM's share prices

Friday’s selloff also takes the stock back to its levels from before the company announced a plan in October to spin off a major part of its services business in order to focus more on growth areas such as cloud computing. That gave a boost to the shares on the belief that a smaller more-focused IBM would be able to regain some growth momentum. But that deal isn’t expected to be completed until much later this year and IBM has yet to share the financial details of what the remaining company will look like. In the meantime analysts are growing more sceptical about IBM’s promise that it can grow post-spin revenue in the mid-single-digit range. David Vogt of UBS called the target “lofty"" in a note to clients Friday.

At less than 11 times forward earnings IBM is the cheapest stock among tech companies valued at more than $100 billion according to FactSet. But valuation alone won’t sell the stock in a market that favors growth prospects above all. IBM’s market value is now below that of Zoom Video Communications—a company that generates less than 3% of IBM’s revenue. In such a market it will take more than a radical diet for Big Blue to get back some sizzle.

Aerospike Connector For Presto Hits GA

Aerospike announced that its Aerospike Connect for Presto is now generally available. Highlights include:

Run ANSI SQL queries in-place on massive amounts of data Query data stored in Aerospike without the need for complex and error-prone processes of copying data over to other analytics systems which significantly helps with governance and compliance. Support for Presto data types including complex types such as maps and arrays along with both read and write SQL statements Presto Aggregate functions such as min/max sum avg etc. are supported

Federate queries across multiple Aerospike clusters or between Aerospike and other databases Enterprise database deployments are typically polyglot in nature but users can now deploy Aerospike into an ecosystem of DBs that consist of Cassandra PostgreSQL Oracle etc.

Analyze Aerospike data via Business Intelligence (BI) tools Create insightful dashboards using Tableau Qlik Looker etc by accessing Presto over JDBC to analyze data stored in Aerospike.

Query records with different schemas within the same set in Aerospike Aerospike is a NoSQL DB and schemaless but the presto connector reconciles those differences and offers a SQL experience that users are familiar with while leveraging the benefits of a NoSQL DB. It supports schema inference so that users have the option to not provide any table definition in the Presto Catalog.

Accelerate queries by leveraging Aerospike’s massive parallelism It parallely scans 4096 partitions to load data into up to 32K Presto splits across one’s Presto cluster and uses the recently released Aerospike expressions for pushdowns to the database

Leverage Presto Cost-Based Optimization via row count for query optimization Aerospike Connect for Presto is one of the few Presto connectors that supports it for speeding up joins in Presto

Secure deployment with TLS and LDAP support Use TLS to secure connection between Presto and the Aerospike clusters and LDAP for authenticating Presto users with the Aerospike database

Deploy anywhere Deploy in a cloud or Kubernetes environment to help users leverage Managed Presto Services offered by Cloud providers

Inverclyde officials are drawing up a new development plan for the district and their preferred option for the former IBM Greenock land is for a masterplan to be developed first.

Greenock businessmen Sandy and James Easdale and Advance Construction own a large part of the site (Area B in the drawing below) and have already submitted a planning application proposing around 450 houses/flats plus commercial retail and food/drink premises plus a park-and-ride facility serving the railway line.

A second area of land (Area C in the drawing below) is owned by Sanmina who have told Inverclyde Council they propose up to 400 houses on 65 per cent of the developable land plus business retail and community uses.

The council say both proposals deviate from the current planning strategy and are based on the view that there is market demand for housing and limited demand for business and industrial uses in the area.

Planners have compiled a main issues report which is the first stage in the preparation of Inverclyde’s new development plan. In it they state: “The preferred option [for Spango Valley Greenock] is the requirement for a comprehensive masterplan for the site with 50 per cent of the developable area for residential 35 per cent for business/industrial and the remainder for a mix of uses.

“[The masterplan] option is preferred because a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach will ensure the most appropriate layout of uses and the creation of a successful place. It will also ensure that any infrastructure requirements and constraints are jointly and fully addressed.”

The report continues: “The alternative is for the different ownerships of the sites to be recognised with a residential-led strategy for each area. This option would allow each site owner to bring forward their own proposals for the site focused on residential development.

“This could lead to development on the site being delivered sooner. However such an approach may not deliver the most optimal mix and layout of uses across the site.

“The council is not convinced that the scale of residential development proposed under this option is appropriate in relation to a preference for mixed uses including employment on the site and impact on the road network.”

Public consultation on the main issues report runs until the end of the month.

The last IBM staff at Spango Valley moved to offices at Riverside Business Park Pottery Street Greenock in September 2016 and the land was cleared.

In fact the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 120.4%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way.

A Big Run: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has had a bumpy ride since 2016. But despite lots of struggles along the way Intel investors have gotten some decent overall returns.

The rise of smartphones online gaming cloud computing cryptocurrency and other innovations created a boom in semiconductor demand over the past decade. Unfortunately for Intel innovation missteps and production delays led to missed opportunities for company in the past five years.

Throughout 2018 and 2019 Intel was unable to produce enough CPUs to supply its customers essentially turning over market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and others for free. In 2020 Intel said chip manufacturing issues would once again be delaying production of its 7-nanometer chips and the company may be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers for the first time.

At the beginning of 2016 Intel shares were trading at around $34. The stock hit its low point of the past five years in mid-2016 dipping down to $24.87.

From that point the stock steadily churned higher over the next several years reaching $50 in early 2018 and $60 for the first time in early 2020.

Intel In 2021 Beyond: Intel peaked at $59.29 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic sell-off which pushed the stock back down to $43.63 in March. Intel revisited its 2020 lows again in late October but skyrocketed back up to above $57 per share in January after the company announced a new CEO Pat Gelsinger.

Investors who had no knowledge of the massive gains from semiconductor peers like AMD in the past five years would be fairly satisfied with their Intel returns.

Intel investors that bought and held on through a volatile five-year period turned a significant profit. In fact $1000 worth of Intel stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $2408 today assuming reinvested dividends.

Looking ahead analysts expect Intel to grind higher in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 33 analysts covering the stock is $60 suggesting only 4.5% upside from current levels.

That pits the industry veteran against investors and analysts who are hankering for quick results and think Intel’s bottom line takes precedence.

“This is a national asset. This company needs to be healthy for the technology industry for technology in America” Gelsinger told analysts late Thursday after pledging to keep most of Intel’s semiconductor production in-house. “It’s an opportunity to help and to unquestionably put Intel and the United States in the technology leadership position.”

A manufacturing turnaround could take years and cost billions of extra dollars. Some investors had advocated for Intel to outsource more production before Gelsinger revealed his hand.

“Catching up is both a long shot and long journey” Jefferies LLC analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note titled “U.S. Semi Manufacturing Crusade = No Quick Turnaround.”

Intel will struggle to live up to Gelsinger’s assertion that the company can catch and pass Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. the current leader in chip production. However his rallying cry resonates more with other audiences and may bring Intel allies in the new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden.

The chip industry is at the heart of a growing national rivalry between China and the U.S. China is the biggest consumer of semiconductors and the government there has vowed to spend more than $160 billion to create a domestic semiconductor sector. So far though it still relies heavily on U.S. chipmakers.

That equation has become more complicated amid increasing scrutiny of the global technology supply chain. While many U.S. companies still design advanced chips they have them made by TSMC in Taiwan.

Intel is one of the few remaining chip companies that supply themselves with leading manufacturing. And it still makes many chips in the U.S. with factories in Oregon Arizona and New Mexico. These components power computers that run or design government encrypted communication nuclear power plants military hardware and banking systems.

If Intel outsourced production to TSMC — as some on Wall Street want — the U.S. would lose a major advanced manufacturing sector and hand more crucial know-how to Taiwan a country China calls a rogue province that is only 100 miles off the coast of the mainland.

Some U.S. lawmakers have begun listening to Intel and other U.S. chip industry players who have argued for years that incentives to keep manufacturing in the country just aren’t enough compared with what’s offered in China and other parts of the world.

Last year a bipartisan bill to provide $50 billion of incentives to build production in the U.S. was proposed. But to put that seemingly staggering amount of money into perspective earlier this month TSMC said it’s planning to spend as much as $28 billion on new plants and equipment this year.

“What we’ve heard from the U.S. government is we need access to advanced microelectronics technology and manufacturing here in the U.S.” Intel’s outgoing CEO Bob Swan told analysts. “We need a safe and secure supply chain increasingly here in the U.S.”

While improving its own manufacturing Intel could develop a technology partnership with TSMC and other major operators of chip foundries. TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. are either working on or considering new factories in the U.S.

“This type of a partnership could also leverage new U.S. tax credits for onshore manufacturing for further value creation” Timothy Arcuri an analyst at UBS wrote in a note to investors.

Last year Biden proposed a 10% “Made in America” tax credit covering projects such as increasing domestic production and retooling or expanding manufacturing facilities.

Even U.S. government spending power won’t quickly fix Intel’s main problem: The sheer difficulty of making chips. The tiny squares of silicon are home to billions of tiny switches or transistors. Intel factories in Oregon Arizona and New Mexico churn out millions of these semiconductors a month. But doing that reliably has become increasingly difficult and TSMC has forged ahead by gaining more experience as the biggest maker of smartphone chips.

Semiconductors made using Intel’s latest production technology called 7-nanometer won’t arrive until 2023 executives said last week. The TSMC equivalent has been used by Apple to mass produce chips for the iPhone for about a year already.

“Even if Intel does successfully execute on 7-nanometer they are still a node behind TSMC” said Raymond James analyst Chris Caso. “And we don’t think Intel can deliver leadership products without leadership in transistors because it has never been done before. That keeps Intel behind the industry for four more years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiyAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9JbnRlbC1Db3JlLWk3LTExMzc1SC1pbi1Bc3VzLVRVRi1EYXNoLUYxNS1zaG93cy1uby1mZWFyLW9mLVJ5emVuLTUwMDAtSC1zZXJpZXMtYXMtNS0wLUdIei1ib29zdC1oZWxwcy1pdC10by1zaW5nbGUtY29yZS1tYXN0ZXJ5LTI0LWhpZ2hlci10aGFuLXRoZS1pNy0xMDc1MEguNTE2NDk5LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i7-11375H in Asus TUF Dash F15 shows no fear of Ryzen 5000 H-series as 5.0 GHz boost helps it to single ...,"An Intel Core i7-11375H (Tiger Lake-H35) has appeared on Geekbench in an Asus TUF Dash F15 gaming laptop. The i7-11375H was measured reaching a clock rate of 5.0 GHz and produced a single-core score that beats out the i7-10750H by +24% and can even hold up against the incoming barrage from AMD’s Ryzen 5000 H-series Cezanne chips.

4 Reviews

The Intel Core i7-11375H is something of a surprise addition to the Tiger Lake lineup and the 4-core 8-thread part is going to give fans of mobile gaming some serious food for thought when it comes to choosing a 2021 gaming laptop. While it was widely expected that the Zen 3 mobile APUs from AMD’s Ryzen 5000 H-series were going to smash everything in sight in the laptop arena this year Intel has thrown a big blue spanner in the works with Tiger Lake-H35.

The single-core performance of this i7-11375H in the Asus TUF Dash F15 laptop is highly commendable: 1577 points is the final score here. The Tiger Lake chip clocks from 3.30 GHz to 5.00 GHz in the benchmark while being accompanied by 16 GB RAM and supported by Windows 10 OS. With just 4 cores to play with the multi-core score of 5159 points is nothing out of the ordinary. But that single-core score will have many gamers wanting to know more.

For instance the 11th Gen i7-11375H (28-35 W TDP) wipes the floor with the Comet Lake i7-10750H (6C/12T 2.60 GHz-5.00 GHz 45 W TDP). Our median score with the i7-10750H is 1269 points while one sample in a Schenker XMG Core 17 got to 1333 points. The i7-11375H scores +24.27% and +18.30% more respectively. Even leaked scores from Ryzen 5000 H-series parts aren’t overwhelming for the Tiger Lake chip at this point so far. We reported on a Ryzen 9 5980HS chalking up to 1541 points (-2.28%) and a Ryzen 9 5900H racking up 1520 points (-3.61%).

As always there are many additional things to consider in this type of Intel vs. AMD comparison: the laptop the chip is being tested in and its cooling solution the power requirements and how long boost clocks can be sustained and of course that age-old conundrum – is single-core performance more important than multi-core performance? Unsurprisingly those two aforementioned Cezanne chips absolutely thrash the i7-11375H in multi-core scores but they do have double the cores and AMD’s Zen 3 microarchitecture to their advantage. But for those who only care about single-core processing Team Blue has seemingly delivered with the i7-11375H.

Just a day after Core i9-11900K and Core i7-11700K have both appeared on Geekbench a 6-core member of the same family decided to show up as well.

The Core i5-11500 is a 6-core and 12-thread CPU with a base clock of 2.7 GHz. As rumored before the CPU will also have a turbo frequency of 4.6 GHz. Thanks to the new leak from Geekbench those frequnecies appear to be confirmed now.

The CPU has been tsted on Intel’s Rocket Lake-S evaluation board not Z490 or Z590 motherboards which indicates that whoever leaked the score has one of the final qualification samples which shouldn’t be much different performance-wise from the retail unit.

Intel Core i5-11500 Rocket Lake-S CPU Score Source: Geekbench

The i5-11500 single-core performance is actually higher than 11700K’s. The CPU scores 1588 points which is also 35% faster than its predecessor based on Comet Lake-S architecture the i5-10400.

The 11500 SKU is not expected to compete with Ryzen 5 5600X. The manufacturer will also release multiple 11600 SKUs offering noticeably faster frequencies (rumored to be 300 MHz higher). Despite this fact there is not a significant performance gap between 11500 and 5600X just 1% in single-core and 11% in multi-core.

Intel is expected to launch its 11th Gen Core series in March. The i5-11500 SKU will be one of the slowest Cypress-Cove based processors sincet he i3 and Pentium series will be based on Comet Lake-Refresh.

Investors are by now conscious of the heightened risk of a stock-market pullback in the near future given the euphoric speculation that has continued to drive valuations upwards.

Eighty-nine percent of financial professionals surveyed by Deutsche Bank earlier this month said that they saw bubbles in financial markets and Bank of America and Charles Schwab both recently warned that investor sentiment is approaching extremes making stocks vulnerable to a sell-off.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

But if market conditions are solid over-enthusiastic investor sentiment by itself often isn't enough to make the market liable to a downturn. When investors should become worried is if indicators start to deteriorate according to Charles Schwab's Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders.

""Where you tend to get a bigger problem is if sentiment is really really elevated and then you start to see a brisk deterioration in the market but sentiment just stays optimistic"" Sonders told Business Insider in December.

""That to some degree is what happened in the early part of 2000"" she added. ""You started to see some underlying deterioration in what was going on in the market but sentiment was like 'nope doesn't matter it's a new paradigm.'""

That underlying deterioration may now be here says John Hussman the notorious market bear and president of the Hussman Investment Trust.

An indicator that measures ""market behavior in 'debt securities of varying creditworthiness'"" has started to weaken as it has before previous market crashes he said in his most recent market commentary posted on January 18.

""Interestingly those debt-sensitive components were also the first to shift negative at the 1987 and 1929 peaks. The equity components shifted later. I often describe unfavorable shifts in market internals as being driven by 'deterioration' and 'divergence'"" Hussman said.

""In 1987 and 1929 the ascent to the bull market peak was so steep and indiscriminate that there was little 'divergence' in the equity components at the highs"" he continued. ""Instead the equity components shifted only after a sharp near-vertical initial loss.""

Hussman is calling for a jaw-dropping crash ahead: a decline of 65-70%. In addition to the shift in market internals the S&P 500's drastic departure from valuation norms means it's due for a drop he said.

He laid out the scenario in the below chart. The blue line represents S&P 500 price action while the green line represents the index's valuation norms.

With sentiment and valuations at highs and with the ""fresh deterioration in our key gauge of market internals"" Hussman said a recipe for disaster is coming together especially if that deterioration continues.

""Put simply the present constellation of market conditions creates the potential for the sort of 'trap door' situation we observed in March"" he said.

Hussman's track record — and his views in perspective

While there are growing concerns about the exposed position that current stock valuations and investor sentiment are putting markets in Hussman's call for a 65-70% drop is still extraordinary.

Just about every major Wall Street institution expects the S&P 500 to rise in 2021.

But Hussman's position is usually in the margins.

For the uninitiated he has repeatedly made headlines by predicting a stock-market decline exceeding 60% and forecasting a full decade of negative equity returns. And as the stock market has continued to grind mostly higher he's persisted with his doomsday calls.

But before you dismiss Hussman as a wonky perma-bear consider his track record which he broke down in a recent blog post. Here are the arguments he lays out:

Predicted in March 2000 that tech stocks would plunge 83% then the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index lost an ""improbably precise"" 83% during a period from 2000 to 2002.

Predicted in 2000 that the S&P 500 would likely see negative total returns over the following decade which it did.

Predicted in April 2007 that the S&P 500 could lose 40% then it lost 55% in the subsequent collapse from 2007 to 2009.

However Hussman's recent returns have been less-than-stellar. His Strategic Growth Fund is down about 50% since December 2010 though it's risen more than 11% in the past year.

Still the amount of bearish evidence being unearthed by Hussman continues to mount. Sure there may still be returns to be realized in this market cycle but at what point does the mounting risk of a crash become too unbearable?

That's a question investors will have to answer themselves — and one that Hussman will clearly keep exploring in the interim.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbnltYWcuY29tL2ludGVsbGlnZW5jZXIvMjAyMS8wMS93YWxsLXN0cmVldHMtbGF1cmVuLXNpbW1vbnMtcmVhZGllcy1oZXItbmV4dC1hY3QuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street's Lauren Simmons Readies Her Next Act,"Photo: Courtesy of Pamela Sisson

For anybody over 26 years old Lauren Simmons’s career trajectory will likely make you feel very very old. At the tender age of 22 she made history by becoming the youngest woman trader on the New York Stock Exchange and only the second Black woman in the entire history of the NYSE to have that position. She didn’t stay on Wall Street for long — she was gone by 2018 — but she hasn’t left the world of finance. She’s now gearing up to host a forthcoming reality show called Going Public which is like Shark Tank but it lets you the viewer be Mark Cuban and invest in the contestants’ companies yourself as they prepare to (as the title suggests) come out with an IPO. Simmons’s job on the show is demystifying the investment process. Intelligencer spoke to Simmons on the phone about the new show diversity in the finance world and her prediction on what will cause the next financial collapse.

Investing remains mysterious to a large portion of Americans. What do you think everybody should know about the stock market and making investments generally?

The main thing is to have no fear but also really taking the time and using your tools and resources to be educated about the stock market. I know we’ve come to a time where trading is easily accessible and there are no fees attached to many platforms that are out there today. Apps such as Robinhood really tried to target millennials without giving them the tools and resources so that they can make educated decisions. They use really predatory practices.

Really I want people not to be intimidated. You can turn on CNBC and it will take a little time and work to understand all the information that they are giving. But if you gave yourself three months’ time to Google any- and everything about investment terminology that you don’t understand. Or [in 2021] you watch me on Going Public since my role is breaking it all down in layman’s terms to really help give people a basic understanding of if they should invest in a company. Now I’m not there to say whether you should or shouldn’t; I’m there just to give you the facts.

I don’t think that most novice investors should be investing overnight. I think it takes time to understand what investing is.

Most industries have become increasingly accepting of women and minorities but in 2017 you became the second-ever Black woman trader on the New York Stock Exchange. Why do you think the NYSE has remained closed off to people who aren’t white men?

People aren’t applying for those positions but also companies aren’t reaching out to [a diverse group of people] to join the trading floor. I also think speaking with [NYSE president] Stacey Cunningham about my time there that they don’t deem it important. There was recently an interview with Stacey on Bloomberg [and she was asked] about how the NASDAQ is very open to making sure that everybody that is listed has diverse members and Stacey said something along the lines of “I don’t think we should be on a quota system like that.” You can very much see that she doesn’t care for diversity and inclusion on the trading floor.

Even before 2020 and the Black Lives Matter movement it was said that it starts from leadership. If leadership doesn’t see [lack of diversity] as a problem it’s not going to be funneled through the culture or the company. Wall Street has a long way to go. Outside of the New York Stock Exchange I do think that other companies are making changes. In 2020 we’ve come way too far for it to just be a conversation and we should just be doing it.

Now a lot of companies aren’t diverse. But my generation younger millennials and also Gen Z are looking for companies that have that social component to it. If you don’t you’re not going to be a company that is strong. Period.

The 2008 financial crisis happened when you were in middle school but were you impacted by it at all? Did it factor into your career decisions?

I wasn’t impacted by it but as I’ve gotten older and now work in finance I understand how it impacted people. In 2020 I see how a lot of people didn’t recover from 2008. Now they’re being hit again. Two years ago I said that we’re due for a recession. I thought it would come from student-loan debt and I still believe that we’re due for another recession that will be caused by the trickling trillions of dollars that we have in student-loan debt. Canceling student-loan debt would help but not solve the problem entirely because it’s also the astronomical tuition costs. Why are some schools charging $80000 a year? That’s absolutely insane.

With recessions a lot of people don’t recover. When the next one comes probably in eight years or so there are going to be a lot of people trying to make up from 2008 and 2020. With everything I’m doing today I can hopefully prepare people for the next recession so they’ll move through that gracefully.

What made you feel excited about working on Going Public?

With Going Public we are making sure that all sorts of Americans are represented. Oftentimes we think of Wall Street and we think of many of the companies that are listed as being founded by older white men. It’s important that we have diverse founders and that everyday Americans hopefully get to invest in the Tesla or Amazon of this generation. I love the concept of the show and being able to do that.

Going Public seems to try to democratize investing. How possible do you think that really is?

Investing in an IPO typically is only for institutional clients or people with high net worths but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they know how to invest any different or any better than Middle America. [My job as the host] is to let you understand how capital is raised.

Wall Street has done a phenomenal job of making itself seem like an exclusive boys’ club and that information [about stocks] is hard to digest. It’s not. Going Public lets everybody be a part of [the investment world]. It isn’t as hard as people have made it out to be in their minds.

The show is called Going Public but it also seems like you’re going public in many ways becoming a TV host and also producing your own biopic. What’s important to you about telling your story?

I am a multifaceted entrepreneur and at the root of it it’s about making sure people have a full understanding of all-around financial wellness and making sure people have these conversations — whether that’s advocating for more diversity and inclusion within finance or helping people be better at finance. I definitely could’ve stayed on Wall Street and made six or seven figures. But for me it’s about passion and purpose and that everything I attach myself to is an extension of Lauren Simmons.

Being able to be an executive producer on a biopic of my life story with [actress] Kiersey Clemons most of the cast isn’t people who look like me because the guys at the New York Stock Exchange don’t look like me. But I made sure the crew and the director looked like me. To bring it back to Going Public [creators] Todd [Goldberg] and Darren [Marble] are making sure we have women founders and people from diverse backgrounds. In a lot of people’s minds the only way to be wealthy or successful is to be a white male. The show is completely debunking that.

This is the note's back.

The back of the Royal Canadian Bank 1865 $2 note has lathework in dark brown ink and an interesting handwritten annotation “Taken From Mr. Thomas Dupree/1 April 1866/The First in Pembroke” at one end with further annotation at the other end.

The star of the Stack’s Bowers Galleries Jan. 15 New York City auction was the only PMG-certified Royal Canadian Bank 1865 $2 note. It sold for $30000. The portrait on the left of the face is of the Prince of Wales the future King Edward VII. This piece clearly circulated.

The Lebanese 100-livre specimen note back shows a cedar tree at right Mount Lebanon at left and the value in red above both left and right.

A Gem New 65 PPQ Lebanese 100-livre specimen note of 1945 from the Banque de Syrie et du Liban sold for £18000 among the top sellers at the Spink Jan. 15 auction in London. The zero serial number note shows the value in Arabic in black at top left and right.

Among top sellers at the Spink January auction in London originally scheduled for the NYINC was a Government of Sarawak $1 note dated 1 July 1919 with a low red serial number of 2 that realized £32400 (or $44000).

The two world paper money auctions affiliated with the canceled New York International Numismatic Convention were held a few hours and 5400 miles apart on Jan. 15 one by Spink in London and the other by Stack’s Bowers Galleries in Newport Beach California. Despite the absence of live public participation results from both sales were promising.

Spink claimed three world record prices. The highest was the £32400 (or $44000) including the buyer’s fee for a Government of Sarawak $1 note dated 1 July 1919 with a low red serial number of 2. The face has the bust of Charles Vyner Brooke the third and last White Rajah of Sarawak at the top left an allegorical maiden with beehive and anchor representing Industry and Commerce at top center and laureate arms at top right. The back is blank. Its grade of Choice Very Fine 35 by Paper Money Guaranty is 15 points higher than the next best example of the note listed in the Track & Price World Paper Money census. The previous record for the note was $27070 for a Fine example sold by Spink in 2011.

The £18000 ($24500) paid for a Legacy Currency Grading Gem New 65 Premium Paper Quality Lebanese 100-livre specimen note dated 1945 from the Banque de Syrie et du Liban exceeded by $5300 the $19200 that a similar PMG-graded note brought in September. The intricately designed multicolored note is perforation canceled. On the face is a zero serial number and an ornate Arabesque design in the field with the value in Arabic in black at top left and right. The back shows a cedar tree at right Mount Lebanon at left and the value in red above both left and right.

The third record was also one of the sale’s big surprises when a 1918 500-ruble Debenture Bond issue of North Russia’s anti-Bolshevik Tchaikovsky government sold for £15600 ($21200) after being given a probably erroneous estimate of £150 to £190. It was graded by Spink as Almost Extremely Fine. The same note in Fine condition was sold in Germany last October for €8500 (or $10250).

Stack’s Bowers Galleries stars

The star of the Stack’s Bowers sale was the only PMG-certified Royal Canadian Bank 1865 $2 note. It is listed in the Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Bank Notes with the notation “No Known Issued Notes.” This note with a blue serial number 14468 was obviously issued. It was printed by American Bank Note Company. The central vignette has a circular coat of arms surrounded by a lion at left and unicorn at right. The portrait on the left of the face side is of the Prince of Wales the future King Edward VII who in 1860 visited North America and laid the cornerstone of Parliament Hill in Ottawa. On the right is a seated woman with a basket of produce. The back is composed of lathework in dark brown ink and has an interesting handwritten annotation “Taken From Mr. Thomas Dupree/1 April 1866/The First in Pembroke.” The other end of the note reads “Pembroke April 6 1866.”

This is the sole note of the type to be graded by PMG who assigned it a grade of Very Fine 25. It sold for $30000.

The next highest result at $24000 was a scarce Panama 1941 10-balboa note issued by El Banco Central de Emision de la Republica de Panama and dubbed the “Arias Issue.”

President Dr. Arnulfo Arias was elected president in 1940. He was deposed in a coup the next year. Before his exit he allowed private banks to issue currency but El Banco Central was the only one that did so. The note printed by Hamilton Banknote Company of New York was issued on Oct. 2 1941 and Arias was booted out a week later. The bank was closed and all notes were pulled from circulation. PMG has graded 10 of these. This one was designated Very Fine 25.

Canadian currency made up four of the top 10 prices realized for Stack’s Bowers. At $16800 was a Dominion of Canada $1 note 1898 in PMG Choice Uncirculated 63 EPQ. The attractive design has a vignette of a quartet of lumberjacks in the center flanked by portraits of the Count and Countess of Aberdeen. He was governor general throughout the terms of four prime ministers. She is credited with lasting contributions to Canadian society.

The back has the Parliament building in Ottawa at center flanked by ornate designs.

Special to The Commercial Appeal

Like many of us Grayden Mazur and his girlfriend of six years Victoria Walker were surprised by some of the events that took place in 2020 due to COVID-19. The couple met on Instagram in 2014 through a shared interest in trains. She was from North Conway N.H. and he was born in Bangor Maine and found they hit it off well on a number of fronts.

Victoria ended up making the move to Memphis in 2016 after two years of long-distance dating. The big-picture plan was for them to tie the knot; however the pandemic threw a sizable wrench into those plans.

“If you had told me in January of 2020 that I was going to be a homeowner by the end of the year I would have laughed out loud” said Grayden. “The plan was to eventually buy a house but Victoria and I were comfortable in our Germantown apartment and really had no desire to get out and look. That all changed when the mortgage rates started dropping during the pandemic.”

With their apartment lease coming up for renewal and enough funds in their savings to cover a down payment the couple started the house-hunting process on the condition that whatever they found needed to perfectly fit their requirements or they'd just renew the lease on the apartment.

Location was first on the list. Grayden had lived in or near Collierville for the past 15 years so he was very comfortable with the area. However after having an apartment in Germantown he was open to looking at homes there too. Grayden works in transportation at International Paper and Victoria is an administrative assistant for a local packaging company so the eastern location was best suited for their work as well.

“I knew the first house I bought wasn't going to be my last so Victoria and I approached the search with the idea of resale in the future in mind” recalled Grayden. “We focused on two-story homes with a minimum of three bedrooms and a fenced backyard thinking that down the road that would be something that would appeal to a family with small kids. Additionally I had to have a garage because I consider myself handy and like to tinker and repair just about anything I can.”

Grayden and Victoria set their budget in the $250000 to $300000 price range and thought they might find a “fixer-upper.” Ideally they were looking for something that just needed updates and maybe a few minor repairs. In other words they weren’t looking to take on a full house flip. The couple contacted Suzanne White of Keller Williams Realty to serve as their realtor.

“I was first introduced to her by my mom when she listed her house in Eads with Suzanne” explained Grayden. “My mom's place was a tougher house to sell due to the uniqueness of the property it was a custom-built home with an unusual floor plan. Suzanne stuck by that listing and did a lot of work to get it sold. So when I finally decided it was time to dive into home ownership she was the first person I called. Suzanne educated me on the whole process from start to finish and went above and beyond her role as an agent.”

“We had been looking online for a while to get an idea of what we would be interested in but only ended up setting foot in two houses prior to the house that became our home” said Victoria. “Homes in our price range in Collierville were extremely competitive so we were quick to review listings. The two houses that we did tour ended up needing a little more work than we felt comfortable undertaking.”

Ultimately the couple found a traditional two-story brick home in the Wolf Ridge neighborhood of Collierville. They were up against several competing offers and locked in at a purchase price of $300500. The home was built in 1995 and offered four bedrooms plus a bonus/office room upstairs and three full baths.

“What drew us to this house was the location and the overall condition of the property” said Grayden. “While the property hasn't been updated since it was built it was very apparent the previous owners had gone to great lengths to maintain the house and the yard. The yard is professionally landscaped and there’s a beautiful wooden deck in the backyard. We really liked how the floor plan was laid out with the second story having a bedroom/bath and a bonus room. The house is located on a quiet street that is within walking distance to Johnson Park one of Collierville's largest and nicest parks. Also we are only a few minutes away from all the essential stores in Collierville.”

After moving in Grayden and Victoria began immediately addressing repairs and routine maintenance tasks like repainting the wooden deck and replacing compromised windows. Their eventual grand plan is to update the kitchen with new appliances and countertops in addition to updating both of the downstairs bathrooms.

As for their neighborhood the couple said they really enjoy their quiet street and their neighbors.

“We closed on Oct. 30 2020 so the day after moving we spent Halloween night in our driveway meeting families who came by for some (socially distant) trick-or-treating” said Victoria. “It was a nice way of getting to know the neighborhood and the people living around us. We appreciate that everyone takes pride in where they live. Plus we have so much more privacy and have more room for our hobbies and for hosting visitors than when we were living in an apartment. Now we’re looking forward to the time when we can have family and other guests come visit.”

The Pensacola MESS Hall is distributing free Kits for Classrooms to provide elementary teachers with engaging hands on science lessons for their students thanks to help from two local organizations.

Two different kits one focused on the science of light and the other focused on the science of water target learners in 3rd and 4th grade. Both kits will be provided for free to twenty-five local high need schools thanks to generous support from Ascend Cares Community Impact Grant and International Paper Foundation.

Each kit contains the instructions and materials for fifty or more students to explore and discover. The kits are designed to be used for many years to come.

In a typical year thousands of young learners would visit the MESS Hall on school field trips including many who might never have the chance to visit the MESS Hall otherwise. With the loss of field trips from the pandemic the MESS Hall is eager to inspire curiosity about science by delivering these kits to teachers. As teachers have had to adjust their lessons to accommodate social distancing providing materials for all students becomes even more important.

Schools interested in receiving one of the limited sponsored kits or purchasing one for their students should contact the MESS Hall at info@pensacolamesshall.org or by calling 877-YES-MESS (937-6377).

This year marks 80 years since the death of the great Irish writer James Joyce (1882-1941). His most famous novel Ulysses (1922) is one of those books like Moby-Dick or Infinite Jest that more people begin than finish. The tome is widely believed to be a stream of consciousness novel and you could certainly be forgiven for thinking that if like many you only made it 100 pages or so in.

I often advise against starting at the beginning of the novel. In the case of Ulysses you are thrown head-first into the difficult stream of consciousness of Stephen Dedalus a precocious 22-year-old writer. The fourth chapter instead is a much more accessible opening. It too offers a stream of consciousness but an easier sort belonging to the novel’s other main character Leopold Bloom a hapless but loveable 38-year-old advertising canvasser. On the day the novel is set 16 June 1904 Stephen and Bloom strike up an unlikely friendship in Dublin. To read Bloom’s thoughts is to be taken into a world of sensations trivia and wonder.

However venture further and you’ll discover that Ulysses morphs becoming instead a great anti-stream-of-consciousness novel.

Bergson’s stream of consciousness

For French philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1941) our stream of consciousness is our continuous sense of time in which past present and future merge. It is the fluid life at the heart of our identity. According to Bergson these streams are at the centre of every object and every person.

Bergson believed we can either “analyse” or “intuit” things or people. When we “analyse” something we remain outside its stream. We superimpose on its fluid life our own static symbols like language. Using words means “we do not see the actual things themselves” just “the labels attached to them”.

Another example is numbers. We impose minutes and hours on fluid life. For instance you can “analyse” a day breaking it into 24 hours. But to “intuit” it to see it from within the stream is to see that time is not so rigid or easily quantifiable – it moves slower when you’re bored and faster when you’re having fun.

In our workaday lives “analysis” is a necessary shortcut. We need words and numbers labels and time to get things done. Artists however according to Bergson have the gift of intuition.

For example authors’ imaginative use of language makes words a gateway to the streams at the heart of life rather than distracting labels imposed upon it. Borrowing such ideas literary critics posited that the stream-of-consciousness novelist is one who can “intuit” the stream of consciousness of characters and so become them.

Just as Joyce’s characters can’t intuit streams of consciousness nor can he. He knows that static literary words can’t account for the fluidity of our interiors

Joyce tries for a moment becomes his characters but soon gets bored with Stephen and Bloom’s streams of consciousness. By the seventh chapter he begins a long firework display of other styles. From here on Stephen and Bloom’s streams of consciousness are elbowed out of the way by newspaper headlines expressionist drama and even romantic fiction. Or they’re shushed by a scientific manual or an encyclopedia of English prose styles.

Joyce fails to find the stream

So Ulysses is a much less consistent stream-of-consciousness novel than many. But it’s also an anti-stream-of-consciousness novel as Joyce comically demonstrates both his and his characters’ failure to intuit streams.

Joyce enjoys showing us that people are mechanically absent-minded often because language itself is a mechanism which gets in the way of our efforts to intuit fluid reality.

For example Stephen though a creative writer isn’t at all intuitive. All he can see are the labels attached to things albeit highly literary labels. When he sees a dog on the beach his love of words conjures a horse a hare a calf a bear a wolf a leopard a panther and a stag. He can’t focus on the dog.

Bloom’s mechanical behaviour is less literary (words) and more scientific (numbers). True he is better at intuiting his cat than Stephen is the dog: “Wonder what I look like to her?” he muses trying to intuit himself into her stream of consciousness. But soon his mind turns to numbers: “Height of a tower? No she can jump me.” Here he reverts to analysis as he strains to make sense of their difference in height using his human scale not the cat’s.

Just as Joyce’s characters can’t intuit streams of consciousness nor can he. He knows that static literary words can’t account for the fluidity of our interiors. Every time he reaches for a new style in each new chapter he acknowledges these failures and moves on with glee to the next.

A stream of consciousness does dominate the last chapter. Here we tune into Bloom’s wife Molly’s stream and hear about her afternoon of sex with a colleague. Is this the stream we have been waiting for? Yes and no.

Molly’s thoughts do flow through past present and future uninterrupted and unpunctuated. But the Molly we get to know while charismatic is something of a static symbol herself: the stock character of the sexually frustrated wife. As we reflect on 80 years since Joyce’s death Ulysses reminds us that consciousness will always elude the novel – but that really that’s where the fun lies.

Capital News Service

Lansing — The switch to virtual classes meetings and social activities during the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult for any student but imagine not understanding the reason for making the change.

That’s what students with autism cope with every day.

“It’s hard for people with autism to spin on a dime or make a change” said Kathy Williams whose daughter is a Clawson Public School student with autism. “It’s more of pulling a rug out from under them. They’re so used to structure and schedules.”

That makes it difficult to explain social distancing why they can’t go to their aunt’s or grandma’s or why they can’t hug their friends she said.

Those are the kinds of challenges facing nearly 22500 Michigan pre-K through 12th​ grade students with Autism Spectrum Disorder according to the state Department of Education. They are among 1.5 million students enrolled in Michigan public schools.

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior according to the National Institutes of Health. The severity and symptoms vary but people who have it can have difficulty communicating and functioning in school and work life.

Structure is helpful for people with autism so losing the routine that school provides is worrying said Matthew Brodhead an assistant professor in the Michigan State University Department of Counseling Educational Psychology and Special Education.

“School provided structure and predictability” Brodhead said. “And for some kids that was the only structure that they had in their life and now that is gone too.”

And having no example of how to teach students with autism online only adds to the difficulty.

“Before this educators or researchers operated under the assumption that they will always be able to have access to school” Brodhead said. “Therefore much of our work on understanding how to be effective at teaching has centered around that environment. Lacking in one major way was a body of research to inform on how to do” online school.

The research gap makes it challenging to make accommodations for students with autism. Accommodations can range from extra time to take tests to having a paraprofessional with the student at all times.

Veronica Hartley has difficulty working online with her students with autism spectrum disorder at the Clawson School District. It’s especially tough with non-verbal students who usually receive visual cues in person.

“Our students depend on the assistance” said Hartley a paraprofessional who assists teachers and their middle school students. “They need the reinforcement of the staff and the teachers to push them through a little more. It’s harder to do that online than it is in person.”

Students may also miss parts of their Individualized Education Programs which spell out accommodations a school is required to make for them.

“We know that some of the (Individual Education Program) services aren’t being met because they can’t be because you can’t be with the kid physically” said Iron Mountain resident Sally Beauchamp a parent mentor for the Upper Peninsula with the Michigan Alliance for Families. “If you’re in (occupational therapy) and your kid gets it twice a week it’s really hard to do occupational therapy via computer.”

The organization assists caregivers of children with disabilities improve their child’s education. Families are connected to a regional parent mentor who assists in navigating the education system and finding help.

Families have adapted educational programs to their homes forming a new routine for both school and social activities.

Williams whose daughter Callan is taking an extra year at Clawson High School said “In terms of lessons on cooking or home-required skills we’re able to put them into action right away — whether it’s folding towels or putting dishes away.

“We’re also creating our own little personal cookbook. It’s allowing us to do a little more with the curriculum” Williams said. “We created pen pals — my daughter has a host of kids who she’s been pen pals with.”

Callan also enjoys friends who frequently come over to enjoy a book and eat lunch together on opposite sides of a gate outside the family’s house.

“Weather is changing that somewhat now” Williams said. “When the weather got cooler we started doing hot chocolate over the gate.”

Adapting to the pandemic should be individualized she said. What works for her and her daughter isn’t transferable to every student with autism.

The daily routine is different for Anne Pancost of Clawson and her 19-year-old twin sons Nick and Joe who attend Berkley School District. But their first reaction to the switch to online learning mirrored that of the Williams.

“Everything was abrupt and cut off” Pancost said. “They never really got closure from school. Their regular routine was upended.”

Pancost works at a dental office two blocks from her home and walks home for lunch. Her husband works from home but Nick and Joe have become more independent since the onset of the pandemic.

“They fold their laundry now” she said. “They take their sheets off the bed.”

But Pancost said the decreased amount of social interaction has impeded her sons’ social development.

“Conversation was always hard for them in the first place” Pancost said. “Last year they were getting better and then everything shut down.”

Williams agrees that challenges are related to social interaction. Callan misses her peers she said. “We went through a lot of sadness and tears.”

MSU’s Brodhead said that in theory online learning can be effective if a teacher is set up in a system designed and executed well to meet the student’s individual needs. But that isn’t the case for everyone.

He said he fears students in lower income and minority communities will experience more negative effects from the change.

“My professional worry is that the learning is not going to be as much as we would expect it if things were normal” he said. “Are they going to be able to get caught up? I’m afraid that the answer is closer to the probability of no versus yes.”

Schools already struggle to help students who fall behind. By adding on the deficits and trauma from the pandemic Brodhead says they may not have the time and money to meet everyone’s needs.

Solving these problems starts with research on online education he said. Then policymakers need to follow the data to inform the decisions they make.

“When this is all over I think we’re going to see some form of online instruction prevailing more than it has” Brodhead said. “Regardless of how these kids are accessing their education they’re still entitled to a free and appropriate public education. One that is effective and individually tailored to be able to meet their needs.”

Caregivers of people with autism in Michigan who need support can visit the ​Spartan Caregiver Support website​ a telehealth service directed by Brodhead. The program started during the pandemic to help caregivers address social or behavioral challenges. Or those looking for assistance can find their regional Parent Mentor on the ​Michigan Alliance for Families website.",,,,,,,,,

KLEIN Texas (KTRK) -- We've been following former Klein Cain football player and two-time cancer survivor Jacob Munoz's fight for a while.

Things have changed since the last time we checked in on Munoz when he was a high school senior. He beat cancer twice and made it back to his teammates.

""It's just showing everyone with injury or a tough time that they can come back from anything"" Munoz said in 2019.

Now he's on to a new chapter with new goals as a student at the University of Houston.

FROM 2018: Klein HS student prepared to fight after rare cancer returns

""I want to study Kinesiology because of what I saw when I went through trying to get back to a sport I love"" Munoz said. ""That's why I'm pushing because I just want to help people.""

Next week marks seven years of Munoz's fight. He was diagnosed with an aggressive and rare form of Leukemia. Countless rounds of chemotherapy a bone marrow transplant blood transfusions did their job and inspired him to spread a message of hope.

""Keep your faith. Stay positive and keep fighting"" Munoz said. ""No matter what just keep fighting.""

Someone that's been with Munoz to see the ups and downs is his sister Juliana.

""We're like best friends"" she said as she held back tears.

Juliana can't help but get emotional thinking about all her brother went through. Now the Klein Cain senior wants to help others in the same situation

""It's a big motivation and I want to help anybody and everybody who had to deal with that"" Juliana said. ""So hopefully we can end cancer.""

Juliana is taking part in the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Student of the Year campaign. She's looking to raise $50000 for Jacob's team and has a personal goal of raising $15000 over the next 6 weeks.

""LLS funds a lot of the treatments"" she said. ""Even some of the treatments that Jacob used. If he didn't have them he may not be here today. It means a lot to me because LLS provides that to cancer patients.""

But Carrie Underwood made an exception on Thursday to mark her son Jacob's second birthday.

The 37-year-old country music superstar posted an adorable photo of her toddler from when he was still a newborn to mark the occasion.

Adorable: Carrie Underwood 37 posted a sweet photo of her son Jacob that was taken shortly after he was born to mark his second birthday on January 21

Jacob seemed to be sleeping peacefully in the picture which showed him with a hat and swaddled in a white patterned blanket.

'Jacob we longed for you. We prayed for you. We walked a long hard road in order to one day hold you' Carrie captioned the snap.

'Today you are two. You are silly and strong. You love to play and sing and follow your big brother around. You are loved. You are cherished. You are an incredible blessing from God. Happy birthday sweet boy!' she concluded.

Carrie's husband Mike Fisher also got in on the birthday love with his own photo of present-day Jacob.

The former professional hockey player caught his son trying to follow in his footsteps by wearing a pair of black skates.

He had on gray Batman pajamas and looked too cool for school with a pair of white sunglasses.

'Happy 2nd birthday Jacob! You’ve brought so much joy to our family the last 2 years!' he wrote.

'Your laugh may just be the best thing in the world:) Can’t wait to see what God has in store for you in the years ahead! #happybirthday.'

Carrie and Mike welcomed their first son Isaiah in 2015 but throughout 2017 and 2018 the American Idol star suffered three miscarriages as she tried to conceive again.

In a 2018 interview with CBS News she admitted that the family tragedies were the inspiration for her 2018 single Cry Pretty on the album of the same name.

'Throughout the whole process [of miscarrying] you know I'm writing and like literally right after finding out that I would lose a baby I'd have a writing session I'd be like ""Let's go. You know I can't just sit around thinking about this. Like I wanna work I wanna do this""' she recalled.

'I would literally have these horrible things going on in my life and then have to go smile and like do some interviews or like do a photo shoot or something you know? So it was just kind of like therapeutic I guess.'

After years of trying again the couple were blessed with Jacob who was born on January 21 2019.",,,,,,

Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. appears to be backing off her threat to force a vote on ousting Speaker Mike Johnson R-La. this week.

""We've had discussions in the speaker's office and right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" Greene told reporters alongside Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. on Tuesday.

The pair met with Johnson for roughly an hour and a half Tuesday after a two-hour meeting on Monday afternoon where they outlined a list of demands for the speaker that included a pledge to not pass any more aid to Ukraine and de-funding Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They're also seeking assurances that Johnson would not bring any bills to the floor without support from a majority of the House GOP conference and commitments to cutting federal spending if a deal to fund the government in fiscal year 2025 is not reached by Sept. 30.

ANTI-MCCARTHY GOP REBELS DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM PUSH TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

""He understands that he's got to be our Republican Speaker of the House. The things that we've discussed about that got leaked out to the press are very simple and they serve the American people. They serve the people that gave us the majority"" Greene said.

It comes after Greene and Massie held a press conference last week announcing that they would aim to force a vote on their motion to vacate the chair this week. The motion to vacate is a procedural measure whereby under current rules just one lawmaker can call for a House-wide vote on the speaker's removal.

But the pair would not give details on how they planned to move forward on Tuesday nor if they would be meeting with Johnson again.

""We didn't give a specific timeline but it's pretty short"" Greene told reporters when asked how long Johnson had to adhere to their demands later adding that it would be ""unrealistic"" to expect results right away.

2 HOUSE REPUBLICANS MOVE TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON 6 MONTHS AFTER HE TOOK GAVEL

Massie said that he communicated to Johnson ""If his plan is to drag this out until the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him. It doesn't serve him or us to drag this out.""

""But if it does become obvious that he's just trying to drag this out we'll do him a favor. We'll do you a favor. We'll do the GOP a favor and we'll call this motion"" he added later.

MASSIE THREATENS TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON IF HE DOESN’T STEP DOWN OVER FOREIGN AID PLAN

When pressed about if she expects a third meeting with Johnson Greene said ""I expect to walk in his office and him to say here's my action items here's what I'm going to do. That requires a meeting right?""

Johnson told reporters of his second meeting with the pair ""We're talking through ideas and suggestions. It's what I do with all members all the time. So there's nothing unusual.""

Greene Massie and Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. are the three lone Republicans actively pushing to oust Johnson in protest of his handling of foreign aid and government spending.

It's the product of long-simmering concerns of conservatives who have felt sidelined by Johnson on critical pieces of legislation. They've accused him of not fighting hard enough for GOP priorities and instead acquiescing to the Democrat-controlled White House and Senate.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. is vowing call up a vote this week to oust Speaker Mike Johnson R-La.

While her move is expected to fail with House Democrats already vowing to save Johnson and stave off another extended speakership vacancy there are still concerns among members about the chaos that could follow another ousting.

And a potential successor to Johnson remains unclear.

Greene has yet to name her favorite but said last Wednesday she thinks ""we have people that are capable."" Contenders could include the same lawmakers who sought the job after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. was removed in October.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

Steve Scalise

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise R-La. was his party's first nominee to replace McCarthy last fall. But the Louisiana Republican withdrew from the race a day later following skepticism that he would be able to garner enough support to win the gavel.

The No. 2 ranking House Republican Scalise was diagnosed with a treatable form of blood cancer in August.

Jim Jordan

Following Scalise's short-lived span as speaker nominee in October House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan R-Ohio was next up for the job. But after three rounds in which Jordan failed each time to earn enough votes the GOP ultimately decided to drop him.

Jordan has helped lead Republicans' impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden alongside House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer R-Ky.

Tom Emmer

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer R-Minn. put his name in the speakership race soon after Jordan's exit.

The No. 3 House Republican had an endorsement from McCarthy who has since left Congress. But just hours after becoming the GOP's third nominee Emmer withdrew in the face of criticism from House conservatives – and former President Donald Trump.

Emmer's step back cleared the way for Johnson's nomination and successful election.

Wildcards

If the speakership were to be rendered vacant again the floodgates could open again and other GOP lawmakers could throw their hat in the ring alongside the three major previous speaker candidates.

Alongside Scalise Jordan and Emmer a handful of other GOP lawmakers sought the speakership last year as well. Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. chair of the Republican Study Committee the largest caucus of House Republicans ran thrice for speaker last year.

Rep. Byron Donalds R-Fla. a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus and a rising star in the Republican party could also run again for speaker after previously making a bid last year.

Other lawmakers who ran for speaker last year include Reps. Austin Scott R-Ga. who launched a protest bid against Jordan and Gary Palmer R-Ala. chair of the House Republican Policy Committee.

Some previously floated members who ultimately did not run last year could jump in this time around. Some Republicans raised the chair of the House Budget Committee Jodey Arrington R-Texas as a potential consensus candidate last year but the Texas Republican declined to run.

Chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee Tom Cole R-Okla. considered an institutionalist on Capitol Hill and respected on both sides of the aisle was also brought up as a candidate but the long-serving lawmaker stayed out of the race.

But it's unclear if any of these candidates considering how they all either failed to win last year or didn't run could turn things around and unite a deeply fractured House Republican conference that controls the lower chamber with just a one-vote margin.

Ministers are to meet on Tuesday to weigh up the merits of a border policy that could require all new arrivals including British citizens to quarantine at their own expense in government-supervised hotels.

Johnson and the transport secretary Grant Shapps are said to favour a more targeted approach that would only require travellers from high-risk countries like Brazil or South Africa to stay in quarantine hotels.

The health secretary Matt Hancock and the home secretary Priti Patel are said to be arguing for stricter measures backed by some scientists on the government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Downing Street has said both options remain under consideration and a source said the debate was still “live” about the best approach.

Patel who has openly said she was among those who wanted to close the borders at the height of the first wave of the pandemic in March is among ministers making the case for the need to “act decisively” in order to protect the advances the UK has made in its vaccination drives.

“Anyone who slips through could be a new mutant strain hence the need for blanket measures” one Home Office source said.

Hancock said he was concerned about unknown variants coming into the UK and that while both Brazil and South Africa had “decent-sized” genomic sequencing programmes other countries did not.

“The new variant I really worry about is the one that is out there that hasn’t been spotted” he told Sky News. “There’s probably those elsewhere that simply haven’t been picked up because the country doesn’t have that genomic sequencing service.”

It is understood that the chancellor Rishi Sunak is not among those resisting tougher quarantine measures for travellers and is even open to wider restrictions though he has asked for there to be a roadmap of how those quarantine measures would be eased.

Others in cabinet are said to be concerned about unintended consequences of a blanket policy including fears that hotels could struggle to cope with the numbers in the first days after the policy is introduced or that it could prompt an unsafe rush to the UK which ministers believe they were already seeing evidence of in crowded scenes pictured over the weekend.

“Hotels will for the most part be grateful for it but there is a chance we could exhaust capacity in the immediate vicinity” one Whitehall source said.

Travellers to Britain are already required to self-isolate for 10 days or five with a negative test but enforcement has been patchy.

Those arriving in the UK apart from children hauliers and travel crew must test negative for Covid in the 72 hours prior to arrival in order to be allowed entry and anyone arriving without a negative test faces a fine of up to £500.

The UK has been criticised for its decision not to put in place tougher border restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic.

A new campaigning organisations One Rule For Them which takes inspiration from the Lincoln Project in the US which targeted Donald Trump with brutal and personal attack ads is to launch a campaign in northern English seats this week about the border failures.

The campaign is run by a former Labour adviser Adam McNicholas – unlike whereas the Lincoln Project which is run by anti-Trump Republicans – and is designed to damage the credibility and electoral appeal of Johnson in key seats.

Hancock emphasised in his interviews that the situation was particularly acute now given the vaccine programme.

“That’s why the conversation has changed about the borders. It’s not just about protecting Britain from countries abroad where there’s a high degree of spread – not least because there are very high levels of coronavirus here in the UK right now – it’s that these new variants can really set us back and we need to protect ourselves against them coming in.”

Prof Kamlesh Khunti professor of primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester who sits on both Sage and the Independent Sage group of experts said variants could “appear anywhere” and the border policy should reflect that.

“We should therefore have a blanket policy on border control otherwise people may be traveling from high-risk countries to low-risk countries and then to the UK in which case we will miss these cases” he said. “Giving this clear recommendation also gives less risk of confusion as the risk in various countries will change over time.”

Gabriel Scally visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts also supported the use of hotels for managed isolation of travellers and said the policy would need to apply to all those entering the country.

“If you apply it to some countries then people will just go via a third country and give you potentially accurate but misleading information on their passenger location form” he said.

Prof Susan Michie a member of the government’s Covid-19 behavioural science team a subgroup of Sage also agreed that the policy should be applied to those entering from all countries.

“It is generally recognised that not controlling borders earlier has been one of the weaknesses of the government’s Covid-19 strategy” she said. “We only know about variants in countries where there has been genomic sequencing so a blanket approach at this point of crisis would seem to be sensible.”

Dr Michael Head senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton said: “Quarantine for all arrivals into the UK should have been introduced since the first wave and should certainly be in place right now. It’s difficult to appropriately discern the risks between different countries so a blanket policy is a better idea.”

Prof Andrew Hayward director of UCL’s Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care also agreed that the blanket approach would be safest. “Obviously this would have major economic and social consequences especially if used as a long-term strategy to prevent the importation of new variants” he said.

However Hayward said it was important to note that there was not yet any evidence of strains escaping vaccine-induced immunity. “The likely scenario in the future is that there will need to be global surveillance of coronavirus strains and the extent to which they may evade vaccine related immunity and regular update of the vaccine components to account for this” he said. “This is exactly the model used in flu.

“In the meantime tightening border controls whilst we gain a better understanding of emerging variants is prudent and the short-term economic costs may be greatly outweighed by the future gains.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaS5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L3VoLW1hdWktY29sbGVnZS1hY2hpZXZlcy1uZXQtemVyby1nb2FsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UH Maui College achieves net-zero goal | University of Hawaiʻi System News,"Reading time: 2 minutes

The next virtually net-zero University of Hawaiʻi campus is up and running. Through a combination of solar photovoltaic energy distributed energy storage and energy efficiency measures University of Hawaiʻi Maui College has reduced the campus’ use of fossil fuel for energy by an estimated 100%.

More than 3300 photovoltaic ( PV ) modules were installed generating 1.58 MW of power enough to power more than 200 homes annually and offsetting greenhouse gas emissions equal to 4400 barrels of oil a year. The project also includes 13.93 MWh of battery storage.

“This project speaks to our college’s innovation to our responsibility to our community. It provides a deeper experience for our students and shows what we can do to protect our values and our environment” said Chancellor Lui Hokoana. “It also offers a living laboratory for one of the most exciting and dynamic career paths through our Sustainable Science Management program.”

UH Maui College is among the first campuses in the nation to generate 100% of its energy from on-site solar photovoltaic systems coupled with battery storage. The project is part of a partnership with Johnson Controls and Mauō a subsidiary of Pacific Current and also includes four UH community college campuses on Oʻahu.

UH Maui College follows successful energy use reduction efforts at Leeward CC  which became the first net-zero UH campus in July 2020 and Windward CC  which reduced its carbon footprint by about 70% in September 2020. Honolulu CC  Kapiʻolani CC and Kauaʻi CC are also on track to reduce their carbon footprints.

“We celebrate UH Maui College’s achievement and look forward to Kapiʻolani CC and Honolulu CC and Kauaʻi CC joining the UH Community College campuses that are making major gains towards UH ’s goal of becoming net-zero by 2035” said Erika Lacro UH vice president for community colleges.",,,,,,,,,

Deutsche Bank Barclays Bank of America Citigroup’s local unit Citibanamex Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Banco Santander Mexico and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were fined a combined 29.4 million pesos out of a potential 680 million (US$34.12 million) the document showed. Deutsche Bank and Barclays got the two biggest fines at 8.7 million pesos and 6.35 million pesos respectively (US$436606 and US$318673 respectively).

The ruling to be published as early as Monday January 25 follows a four-year investigation by antitrust commission COFECE that was aided by a whistle-blower who came forward in May 2015 the documents showed. Investigators said they found evidence in electronic chats from 2010 to 2013 of cartel behavior in the secondary market.

The fines are tiny compared to the billions of dollars Barclays and Deutsche paid back in 2015 to settle charges with US UK and European regulators. While COFECE can fine companies as much as 10% of their revenues when they engage in cartel-like behavior banks and traders were fined under a less-harsh statute that set maximums at 200000 times the country’s daily minimum wage.

When Goldman Sachs announced that it would help companies go public only if they had at least one diverse board member — meaning that the bank wouldn’t work with I.P.O. hopefuls whose directors were all white men — it was met with a mix of support and skepticism. In the year since with less fanfare the bank has also built up a business to help recruit directors for those boards which has expanded to cover public companies as well.

“It became very clear to us early on that board diversity is something that’s important — and should be — to all of our clients” said Ilana Wolfe Goldman’s head of corporate board engagement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2FudG9pbmVnYXJhLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvaG93LW1hdC1pc2hiaWEtY2FzaGVkLWluLW9uLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LXNwYWMtZXZlci1mcm9tLWJlbmNod2FybWVyLXRvLTEzLWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Mat Ishbia Cashed In On The Biggest SPAC Ever: From Benchwarmer To $13 Billion,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2021/01/23/how-mat-ishbia-cashed-in-on-the-biggest-spac-ever-from-benchwarmer-to-13-billion/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2FudG9pbmVnYXJhLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvaG93LW1hdC1pc2hiaWEtY2FzaGVkLWluLW9uLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LXNwYWMtZXZlci1mcm9tLWJlbmNod2FybWVyLXRvLTEzLWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHVzdHJ5bGVhZGVyc21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9tb3JnYW4tc3RhbmxleS1yYWlzZXMtY2VvLWphbWVzLWdvcm1hbnMtcGF5LXRvLTMzLW1pbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley raises CEO James Gorman's pay to $33 million,"Morgan Stanley raised CEO James Gorman’s pay package to $33 million after the company’s most profitable year despite the pandemic gloom.

Gone are the bewildering days of the Coronavirus Pandemic when executives’ salaries and bonuses felt the shocking tinge of the ensuing economic downtown. Now a number of American companies including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase acknowledge that stressed-out executives cannot reinstate the business to its pre-Pandemic glory days for partial pay.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman’s pay in 2020 was $33 million for steering the Wall Street firm without axing jobs despite the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Gorman’s salary is a phenomenal 22% raise for a year in which the investment bank generated record revenue announced two megabillion dollar acquisitions and successfully avoided one of the worst pandemic-led recession.

James Gorman gets 22% salary raise in 2020

Here’s how much James Gorman made in total compensation during fiscal year 2020 according to a securities filing on Friday. James Gorman’s salary ($33 million) is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a deferred equity award of $7.875 million; a cash bonus of $7.845 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $15.75 million.

Two-thirds of Gorman’s stock award is tied to how well he steers through the pandemic-recession over the next few years.

The Morgan Stanley executive was paid $27 million for his work in 2019.

Morgan Stanley’s directors based Gorman’s pay raise on the investment firm’s record financial performance in 2020 and Gorman’s progress in implementing the bank’s long-term strategy it said.

Bank’s profit crushes pandemic gloom

Under his leadership Morgan Stanley produced full-year net revenue of $48.2 billion compared with $41.4 billion a year ago. It largely benefited from the market’s swift recovery from the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

“The firm produced a very strong quarter and record full-year results with excellent performance across all three businesses and geographies” CEO James Gorman said in a statement adding that the bank’s long-term strategy with the acquisitions of E*Trade and Eaton Vance “serve us well.

Unlike other American banks Morgan Stanley was an active name in M&A activity throughout the year. Gorman negotiated two back-to-back deals to acquire E*Trade Financial Corp. and Eaton Vance Corp. strengthening the firm’s presence in retail stock trading and investment management respectively.

Early in 2020 the bank announced it would buy E*Trade for $13 billion launching Morgan Stanley into the low-cost brokerage space and adding 5 million new customers. This was the largest acquisition deal made by a bank since the financial crisis.

In October Gorman announced a $7 billion acquisition of Eaton Vance making Morgan Stanley one of the world’s biggest asset managers almost doubling its assets under management to an astounding $1.2 trillion.

Shares of Morgan Stanley rose by 34% in 2020 and are up another 8% so far in 2021 outpacing the S&P 500 Index on both counts.

James Gorman’s salary in 2020 was $1.5 million more than that of rival JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon who has been the highest-paid bank executive for past several years.

The resurgence of coronavirus cases and the deepening economic uncertainty continue to take a toll on the US labor market. Last week jobless claims stayed elevated around 900000 but it was slightly below economists’ prediction. The dismal employment scenario and continuing lay-offs show that the new president has a tough task at hand.

On the M&A front tech firms Lumentum Holdings and Coherent Inc. agreed for a merger last week. The $5.7-billion deal is expected to create one of the largest photonics and laser companies in the world. Elsewhere Boston Scientific signed a pact to acquire privately-held mobile health solutions company Preventive Solutions. In another tech buyout Cognizant agreed to acquire software company Magnetic Solutions to strengthen its digital engineering capabilities.

Some of the major Wall Street firms reported earnings this week which was shortened by the holiday with Bank of America Goldman Sachs and Netflix reporting their results on Tuesday. UnitedHealth Group and Morgan Stanley were the important company’s that published earnings on Wednesday while Intel and IBM reported on the next day.

Wall Street is headed into a busy earnings week with the likes of Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson preparing for their quarterly announcements on January 26. Apple’s first-quarter report a much-awaited event is expected on January 27. On the same day AT&T and Facebook will be unveiling their latest numbers.

It’s had a tumultuous on-again off-again history.

It would have been 1897 kilometres long carrying 830000 barrels of crude from the Alberta tar sands through Saskatchewan and Montana to Nebraska where it would have connected into the original Keystone pipeline and continued south.

Kenny in his wisdom sunk $1.5 billion into the project to back up TC Energy and start construction on the Canadian leg. It created short-term prosperity for some Alberta towns but it was a foolish gamble.

The National Energy Board approved construction of the Canadian section of Keystone XL in 2010 by which time Phase 1 of the main Keystone pipeline was on stream.

Things quickly got bumpy as various state and federal bureaucracies got their mitts into it. Environmentalists complained challenges were issued the route was changed several times.

Opponents questioned whether it was in the U.S.’ “national interest.” The U.S. Senate approved Keystone XL in 2015. Along came Barack Obama who nixed it shortly after following up on Secretary of State John Kerry’s determination that contrary to the Senate’s opinion it wasn’t in the national interest.

But then Donald Trump was elected and soon revived it signing his own presidential permit to give it the green light. Unlike Biden’s Day One executive order this week it took Trump four days. Legal challenges put a damper on that so Trump signed another order.

In March last year Kenney defeated Rachel Notley and pledged Alberta’s financial stake in the project.

Biden defeated Trump last November and signed the project out of existence this past Wednesday.

Keystone XL put the R in roller coaster. Political football is another term that comes to mind. The fact that Biden was vice president under Obama and opposed Keystone XL from the start and made a campaign promise that he’d kill it for good if elected president should have given Kenney a clue. But Kenney obviously was banking on Trump winning re-election. Oops.

One wonders why any investor would plug billions into a project when the process is so screwed up. When a project is given life killed off resurrected and killed again.

Building pipelines is a dicey business at the best of times. We all know the story of how Kinder Morgan bailed on its own Trans Mountain pipeline due to “uncertainty” surrounding the expansion forcing Justin to buy it up to keep it going.

It’s not just pipelines of course. Developing mines is just as chancy. KGHM spent years trying to get Ajax approved failed and is trying again.

Ajax is an example of a project that should never have been allowed to start and yet it refuses to go away. Whether you’re for such projects or against them surely we could come up with policies and processes that are definitive and fair where a proposal is either approved or it isn’t once. It either happens or it goes away forever. Doesn’t spend more than 10 years being batted around.

It’s not even over yet — lawsuits are sure to follow. The world will be fine without another pipeline and the end of the tar sands can’t come soon enough but there’s got to be a better way.

The Swedish company is now valued at $11bn and is Europe's second most highly-valued startup allowing shoppers to defer payments on goods at no cost.

But Klarna's stronghold in Europe is slowly coming under attack from a wave of new BNPL startups.

Among them are Scalapay Twisto and France's Alma who all announced fundraises of between €16m and €49m this month. This follows a record funding year in 2020 for the BNPL sector which raised $1.5bn globally according to CB Insights and prompted a strong public listing by Affirm in the US a fortnight ago.

The map below showcases Europe's 'Buy Now Pay Later' market including its top startups.

Note that Klarna is now in 12 European countries having recently expanded into Italy (it acquired Moneymour there in 2020).

Meet the mini-Klarnas

It's worth looking a little closer at the new BNPL startups and their varying products.

Alma

Alma's founders

HQ: France. Also looking to move into UK Belgium Italy and beyond.

Funding: €62.5m (its €49m Series B was announced today)

Notes: Alma reaped the benefits of locked-down shoppers and a retail sector in shock telling Sifted it saw “very strong growth” during lockdown and onboarded hundreds of merchants every month.

Led by Louis Chatriot — a well-respected second-time founder — Alma boasts a unique credit scoring system providing instant lending decisions to shoppers.

Divido

HQ: UK. Now works with banks in Italy Scandinavia France and Germany.

Funding: €16.1m

Notes: Divido is another consumer offering but does not front the loans itself. Instead it integrates with over 30 banks that process the debt. Divido simply handles the partnership and integration with merchants.

Twisto

HQ: Czech Republic. Now also live in Poland and looking at Romania next.

Funding: €36.8m

Notes: Backed by the likes of Finch Capital and ING Bank Twisto is one to watch as it races across Central Europe. Founded in 2013 1.6m customers have now used its app. It is now hoping to also become the top BNPL player in Poland taking on current leader PayPo.

Scalapay

HQ: UK Funding: €36.4m Notes: Zilch has launched what it dubs “an American Express for millennials and Gen Z” offering a card with a personalised credit line which is then paid back in installments. The company has won a rare consumer credit license from the UK regulator the FCA and recently hit the 100k user milestone.

ViaBill

HQ: Denmark. Now also in Spain. Funding: $10m (plus €40m in debt) Notes: Denmark's ViaBill counts over 900 merchants. Similar to Zilch it gives users a capped account of 2k kr which can be used to shop in online stores and paid back in installments.

The BNPL battleground

Klarna's CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski himself has acknowledged the threat these newer players pose.

He recently told Sifted he “worr[ies] about other startups more than PayPal"" explaining:

“I run around [the office] and I say ‘Have you seen this startup.’ And they say ‘oh my god here he comes again.'

“I always look at the smallest… [I'll say] like this little company here in Prague they’re doing something really exciting.”

Indeed Europe is still wide open to disruption.

""You've actually got no real European player [yet]"" Alma chief Louis Chatriot tells Sifted. ""Klarna is missing from France Central Europe and more...If you talk to big French retailers and ask what countries they're in Klarna isn't in that many [of them]."".

Alma now plans on filling the 'Klarna' gap itself by offering merchants a comprehensive offering across Europe buoyed by its latest €49m Series B. While having begun as a localised provider in France Alma is now among the most ambitious BNPL startups in Europe.

Investment boom

Despite continued questions about the ethics of BNPL VCs are keen to get a piece of this fast-growing pie (as shown below).

The average deal size in 2020 was $113m compared to just $26m in 2018

This boom is linked to BNPL's growing popularity especially in Europe.

By 2025 BNPL volumes in Europe are predicted to hit $357bn constituting nearly half of the entire global estimate and 30% of all estimated ecommerce spend.

Already in the UK £4 in £100 in the UK is spent using BNPL proving especially popular among millennials and Gen Z and soaring further during lockdown. The benefit for BNPL providers (and their investors) is they take an average cut of 3% of the entire transaction base. This has given way to a pretty resilient business model.

There's also a clear exit path for these startups whose hard-earned merchant base constitutes an attractive asset. For instance Spanish BNPL player Pagantis was recently acquired by Clearpay as part of its expansion strategy. The public markets also seem to be optimistic about the future of the BNPL sector (trading at many multiples their revenues).

Uphill battle

Nonetheless it's worth remembering that Europe's BNPL newcomers are up against some big players. Among them are PayPal Amazon and American Express who all recently launched 0% ‘installment’ payment options. In addition Australian-listed firms like Zip Laybuy and Afterpay (owner of London's Clearpay) have unveiled plans to spread into continental Europe. They could undercut startups like Twisto who so far have enjoyed a near-monopoly in their native countries. It could especially hurt startups dependent on a small number of big merchants (even Affirm makes ~28% of its revenues from just one client Pelaton!). The other threat to BNPL startups is innovation on wage-payments. ""Salary-on-demand"" fintechs like Hastee are helping employees get an advance on their wages hoping to reduce the need for short-term lenders.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ippudo stores worldwide are all known for the ramen chain’s rich pork-broth noodles going as far as claiming the title as the country’s top tonkotsu pork-broth noodle specialists. The ramen chain has now expanded its menu officially stepping away from its rich creamy pork broths for the first time in brand history. The newest release is the Plant-Based Akamaru and unlike other ramen restaurants such as Afuri which serve vegan ramen in clear miso or soy broths Ippudo plans to completely replicate the tonkotsu flavor and look.

Ippudo aims to provide vegan diners with the same tasteful experience providing a true alternative to the original tonkotsu broth. Ippudo has spent many years perfecting the recipe and will ultimately be using new Miracore technology where the soymilk offers a similarly rich and creamy texture soup base reminiscent of the meat tonkotsu broth. With the help of porcini mushrooms and a kelp soup stock the meatless broth will taste just as flavor-packed as the original broth.

Plant-based noodles created without eggs and containing whole grain flour will still maintain Ippudo’s Hakata straight and thin noodle style. A special char siu topping made with wheat protein sautéed mushrooms and green bean paste holds a similar shape to the meat char siu while also keeping a surprising amount of meat-like flavor.

Ippudo’s new Plant-Based Akamaru will be available in only 44 Ippudo stores across Japan starting from February 1 for a limited time only. Each bowl costs approximately $10.60 USD. If the plant-based ramen is well-received in its first round of rollouts it is expected to expand to overseas branches.

And for some the risk is a minuscule fraction of the reward.

As is the case for one player who managed to beat the odds and snag the third-largest lottery jackpot ever won in the United States of $1.05 billion Michigan Lottery announced Saturday morning.

""Lucky person"" Marcia Owens of Novi said as she loaded soda into her car's trunk with her husband Saturday afternoon. That's putting it lightly as the chances of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are one in 302.5 million.

Friday's winning numbers were 4 26 42 50 60 and Mega Ball 24.

Since a winning ticket was sold in Wisconsin on Sept. 15 the top prize has kept growing. Until one lucky player happened to buy a ticket at the Kroger store located at 47650 Grand River Ave. in Novi.

“Kroger congratulates the individual who purchased a winning Mega Millions lottery ticket at our location in Novi Michigan"" a Kroger spokesperson said in a short statement.

For selling the winning ticket the store will receive a $50000 flat-rate commission once the prize has been claimed said Jake Harris with the Michigan Lottery. It is unclear whether the commission will go directly to the local retailer or to the Kroger company.

Still as the Owenses stood feet away from where history was made at their usual grocer the couple — who don't buy tickets — contemplated the risk associated with partaking in the lottery.

""Somebody's gotta win but somebody's gotta pay for it"" said her husband who works for a casino and did not want his name published. ""You gotta lose more than you win.""

Owens said in more frank terms: ""I think it's stupid.""

""People are already hurting between unemployment and everything else and they're going to make it easier to lose more money"" she said.

The Novi Kroger was receiving a steady stream of customers Saturday afternoon with no line at the customer service desk where lottery tickets are sold.

The soonest the prize can be claimed would be Monday when Michigan Lottery offices are open but big prizes usually take a while to be claimed as winners wrap their heads around the life-changing money they're about to step into Harris said.

""What I would tell the winner is that they're gonna want to make sure to sign the back of the ticket and keep it in a very safe place"" Harris said Saturday. ""A lottery ticket is a bearer instrument. So in order to claim the prize they have to have that original ticket in their hand. And if they don't have the ticket we can't pay on the prize so just make sure to (keep it) safe at home or some people do a (bank) safety deposit box.""

Winners have a choice between accepting the prize as a graduated annuity or as a lump sum. In this case the annuity option would begin with a payment of $15.8 million and end with $65 million before tax and the lump sum would amount to $776.6 million before tax.

As Mega Millions is a multi-state jackpot there's no easy way to tell how many tickets were purchased in Michigan for this pot which was won on the record 37th drawing.

And Saturday's jackpot landing in Michigan doesn't ruin the chances for another Michigander to win the next pot with the next drawing for $20 million on Tuesday.

""You never know when the jackpot is going to hit so the odds of it hitting on Tuesday when they draw the numbers again for the $20 million jackpot are the same as they were at the last $1 billion jackpot so it's just as likely to be won on Tuesday that it was last night"" Harris said.

So it just might be worth it to try your luck.

DETROIT — One winning ticket was sold for the $1 billion Mega Millions jackpot to someone who bought it in Michigan making it the third-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.

The winning numbers for Friday night’s drawing were 4 26 42 50 and 60 with a Mega Ball of 24. The winning ticket was purchased at a Kroger store in the Detroit suburb of Novi the Michigan Lottery said.

“Someone in Michigan woke up to life-changing news this morning and Kroger Michigan congratulates the newest Michigan multimillionaire” said Rachel Hurst a regional spokeswoman for the grocery chain. She declined to comment further.

The Mega Millions top prize had been growing since Sept. 15 when a winning ticket was sold in Wisconsin. The lottery’s next estimated jackpot is $20 million.

Friday night’s drawing came just two days after a ticket sold in Maryland matched all six numbers drawn and won a $731.1 million Powerball jackpot.

Only two lottery prizes in the U.S. have been larger than Friday’s jackpot. Three tickets for a $1.586 billion Powerball jackpot were sold in January 2016 and one winning ticket sold for a $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot in October 2018.

The jackpot figures refer to amounts if a winner opts for an annuity paid in 30 annual installments. Most winners choose a cash prize which for the Mega Millions estimated jackpot would be $739.6 million before taxes.

The odds of winning a Mega Millions jackpot are incredibly steep at one in 302.5 million.

The game is played in 45 states as well as Washington D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtnZXQuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsLW5ld3MvZ2VvcmdpYS10ZWVuLWFjY3VzZWQtaW4tOTgwMDAwLWtyb2dlci1zY2FtL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtnZXQuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsLW5ld3MvZ2VvcmdpYS10ZWVuLWFjY3VzZWQtaW4tOTgwMDAwLWtyb2dlci1zY2FtL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Georgia teen accused in $980000 Kroger scam,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.kget.com/national-news/georgia-teen-accused-in-980000-kroger-scam/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtnZXQuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsLW5ld3MvZ2VvcmdpYS10ZWVuLWFjY3VzZWQtaW4tOTgwMDAwLWtyb2dlci1zY2FtL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtnZXQuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsLW5ld3MvZ2VvcmdpYS10ZWVuLWFjY3VzZWQtaW4tOTgwMDAwLWtyb2dlci1zY2FtL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8va3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzkxNTkxMS9rcm9nZXItdG8tb3Blbi1uZXctaGlnaC10ZWNoLWN1c3RvbWVyLWZ1bGZpbGxtZW50LWNlbnRlci1pbi1waG9lbml4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger to open new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Phoenix,"PHOENIX — Grocery retail giant Kroger announced on Thursday that Phoenix will be the location of a new high-tech customer fulfillment center.

Posted on: January 23 2021 01:08h.

Last updated on: January 23 2021 01:53h.

LVS subsidiary Sands China’s new integrated resort the $2 billion Londoner Macao opened some of its hotel rooms to guests Friday on Macau’s Cotai Strip. The opening was ahead of its planned official phase-one launch in February. The resort a rebranding of Sands Cotai Central is set to open in various phases throughout 2021.

Cor Blimey Guv’nor: the Londoner Macao pictured in computer rendering even has its very own changing of the guard. (Sands China)

It’s the company’s first new development project since 2016’s Parisian Macao. And like that property the Londoner brings some ersatz European flavor to East Asia.

The British-themed resort comes complete with a scale facsimile of the Big Ben clocktower. It has obligatory red telephone boxes. And it even has its very own changing of the guard and other crowd-pleasing pageantry.

London Without the COVID

Soon visitors will be able to dine on fish and chips courtesy of Gordon Ramsay O.D. on afternoon tea and browse the deliberately archaicized “Shoppes at Londoner.” This promises to introduce guests to the “chic boutiques of Bond Street Mayfair and Savile Row” and the “quaint stores” of Soho and Covent Garden.

Predictably “international businessman” David Beckham is an advisor on the project although he failed to advise the resort’s PR people that the British find the word “quaint” faintly insulting.

At the Londoner Hotel “Becks” has allegedly designed the aptly named “Suites by David Beckham” two floors of high-end luxury concept hotel rooms.

As Nikkei Asia quipped this week it’s basically London but without the virulent COVID-19 mutation.

Unlike the British capital Macau is happily coronavirus-free. The enclave has been remarkably successful at repelling the pandemic and has not reported even an imported case since July.

Macau Recovery in the Cards

But this has come at a cost. Travel restrictions designed to combat the virus have shut Macau off from the rest of the world. In 2020 the gambling hub booked its worst financial performance since 2006. Currently only visitors from mainland China are permitted to enter Macau.

But there are reasons to be optimistic too. Rob Goldstein acting chairman and CEO of LVS said in a statement last month that the company’s investment in the Londoner was “a clear signal that we believe Macao’s future as one of the world’s most important leisure and business destinations remains on course.”

Analysts are also sanguine about the Londoner’s prospects because Macau is predicted to bounce back this year. China is the only major economy to have recorded growth in 2020 and the rise of the yuan against the dollar suggests Macau’s resorts could soon be in high demand.

And of course realistically the Londoner is the only taste of the UK that China’s normally globetrotting middle classes are likely to get this year. The weather’s better too.",,,,,,,,,

Photo: Noam Galai/Getty Images

The entertainment industry is on pause but gradually beginning to start up again as the world battles the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Globally there are over 40 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus identified as COVID-19. In the United States that number has risen to over 8.3 million. In an effort to prevent spreading the virus many concerts festivals film and TV shoots and other events have been canceled rescheduled or modified. No Instagram influencers took a trip to Love Island this year as ITV canceled the summer 2020 season. Highly anticipated tours — including Taylor Swift’s Lover Fest Harry Styles’s Love on Tour and all of Billie Eilish’s 2020 dates — have been pushed back in addition to festivals such as Coachella Stagecoach and Lollapalooza. And the Summer Olympics was canceled for the first time since World War II.

However good news for the industry is continuing to emerge as film and television production was allowed to resume in California on June 12 as well as in New York City on July 20. Disney Parks have reopened numerous TV shows and movies are shooting again with heightened safety regulations and socially distant concerts are starting to become a thing. Broadway theaters though will remain closed until May 2021. Here are all the ways the virus has affected the industry.

John Lennon was extremely hard on his own music and during his time in The Beatles he regularly lashed out at his own songwriting. One song in Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band was written by Lennon and was subsequently branded as “garbage” and “a throwaway”. The track in question is Good Morning Good Morning an up-beat song which has Lennon depicting the story of an unhappy man. The lyrics read: “Going to work don’t want to go feeling low down”. Reflecting on the song in 1980 Lennon told reporter David Sheff: “Good Morning is mine. It’s a throwaway a piece of garbage I always thought.”

Interestingly enough Lennon went on to reveal that the song was actually thought up after he listened to a 1967 Kellogg’s cereal advert. The breakfast cereal advert in question was promoting Kellogg’s Corn Flakes whereby a song blared from the TV set announcing: “Good morning good morning the best to you each morning sunshine breakfast Kellogg’s Corn Flakes crisp and full of sun. Sunshine breakfast Kellogg’s Corn Flakes best for everyone.” Lennon explained: “The Good morning good morning was from a Kellogg’s cereal commercial. “I always had the TV on very low in the background when I was writing and it came over and then I wrote the song.” READ MORE: The Beatles White Album 'inspired' Charles Manson murders

McCartney said: “There’s a reference in the lyrics to ‘nothing to do’ and ‘meet the wife’; there was an afternoon TV soap called Meet The Wife that John watched - he was that bored - but I think he was also starting to get alarm bells.” The artistic and free spirited Lennon apparently felt tired being trapped inside with his wife shortly after coming back from tour prompting the song’s composition. However everything changed for the Beatle by the end of the year. When the song was written in early 1966 Lennon had not yet met Yoko Ono to whom he was first introduced that November. DON'T MISS...

Sometimes he'd walk on the stage. The strangest thing is I'd be in the middle of a song and then suddenly everyone would go 'ahhh' and I'd be thinking 'what's happened?!'""

There have been few stars so filled with life as Freddie Mercury. Of course the manner of his death should never be forgotten but his Queen bandmates and dearest friends like mary Austin have repeatedly stressed that the star's final months were filled with love. So it is particularly fitting that Freddie should be remembered at peace in his beloved garden in the very last photographs ever taken of him.

The final time Freddie was seen officially in public was at the 1990 BRIT Awards in February when Queen collected a lifetime achievement gong. Viewers were overwhelming distressed with how frail the idol suddenly looked. From then on there was no way to hide that the star was seriously ill. And yet the following year just months before he died Freddie rallied his strength and posed for a beautiful series of pictures. Even more touchingly the photographer Freddie's boyfriend Jim Hutton had no idea it was going to happen. To the last Freddie continued to surprise and amaze.

READ MORE Freddie Mercury's courage: Final two days by the friend who was there Jim described the scene in his autobiography Freddie And Me. He recalled he was photographing some of the gorgeous flowers in the West Kensington mansion's garden while he thought Freddie was resting inside. Suddenly the Queen star appeared smartly dressed and groomed one of his beloved cats by his side. Even then conscious of how his appearance had been affected by his illness he asked to be snapped at a small distance. Jim wrote: ""That summer Freddie posed for a camera for the very last time - mine. ""It happened like this. I was out in the garden photographing some of the flowers in full bloom and Freddie walked towards me.""

Freddie Mercury life and death

Freddie's PA and friend Peter Freestone said: ""Freddie at home alone with us would be sitting in a mismatched tracksuit on the sofa watching Countdown... ""There were many layers. Friends would come to lunch and a slightly different Freddie Mercury would appear. It was more real and playful than you would see with the fans outside the door but still different slightly dialled up and switched on. ""He loved entertaining friends. He would put on a matching tracksuit..."" So the smart shirt and trousers were clearly a very special effort Freddie made for himself and Jim alone.

The Royal Australian Air Force has declared an initial operational capability (IOC) of its Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighter capability.

Just two years after the first two F-35As arrived in Australia the RAAF now has 30 F-35As in service with 3SQN and 2 Operational Conversion Unit (2OCU) at Williamtown and an additional three aircraft at Luke AFB in Arizona preparing to be ferried across the Pacific.

The IOC milestone recognises the service’s ability to conduct type-conversion courses for pilots and maintainers in Australia that Australia can produce its own mission data files (MDF) and that a sufficiently deep level of spares and sovereign industry support has been established. The RAAF now has more than 40 qualified F-35A pilots and 220 maintainers trained on the F-35A.

The aircraft has been subjected to a detailed verification and validation (V&V) process over the past two years a process that has proven the F-35A can operate with other ADF capabilities such as the E-7A Wedgetail and KC-30A MRTT can be deployed to forward bases such as Townsville or Tindal and can integrate with the ADF’s command and control system.

“For the last two years Defence has rigorously tested the F-35A fleet to assess aircraft and system performance and declare this important milestone” Defence Minister Senator Linda Reynolds said in a December 28 statement.

“I would like to thank everyone that has worked so hard to get us to this point; to have accomplished all the required testing and materiel delivery is remarkable. The (ADF) now has an F-35A squadron ready to conduct technologically advanced strike and air combat roles and another squadron dedicated to providing world-class training here in Australia.”

Some 590 F-35s of all models have been delivered worldwide. The RAAF is the ninth service to declare IOC with its F-35s and follows the US Marine Corps USAF US Navy the UK Italy Israel Japan and Norway.

The F-35A’s IOC declaration follows the end of operations of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A/B classic Hornet from Williamtown with the withdrawal of the type from service with 77SQN. The RAAF’s final F/A-18A/B Hornet unit is 75SQN based at Tindal in the Northern Territory and it will retire its Hornets at the end of 2021.

77SQN will commence its conversion to the F-35A in early 2021 and 75SQN will follow in 2022. Ferry flights of RAAF F-35As will continue through 2021 and 2022 with at least 15 aircraft due to be delivered to the RAAF in each of those years and the type is expected to achieve a Final Operational Capability (FOC) in 2022/23. Australia currently has 72 F-35As on order under Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/2B and will consider an order for up 30 more aircraft for service entry from 2030 under Project AIR 6000 Phase 7.

To date Australian industry has won a total of $2.7 billion worth of work on manufacturing and sustainment phases of the global JSF program mainly on sub-contract to Lockheed Martin BAE Systems and Pratt & Whitney.

That’s what colleagues and friends of the late University of Washington Professor Robert Winglee said during a virtual memorial service held last weekend.

“The community has lost not only a strong researcher but also an architect of experiences” said Jonathan Wrobel a research engineer at Lockheed Martin who worked as a graduate student under Winglee. “Robert instilled a positive trajectory on so many careers and lives and made the world a better place by it.”

Winglee former chairman of UW’s Department of Earth and Space Sciences and current director of Washington’s NASA Space Grant Consortium died after suffering a heart attack on Christmas Eve. He was 62.

He is survived by his wife Jenny and two children Kathryn and Matthew.

Winglee was born in Australia to Chinese-Australian parents who from an early age instilled a drive for science learning his brother Peter Winglee said. But the family “also encouraged our exploration of the practical side of physics and chemistry” Peter Winglee said “So naturally we explored projectiles and their propellants.”

Winglee attended the University of Sydney where he earned a bachelor’s degree (with honors) and PhD. in physics. After graduation Robert and Jenny Winglee moved to the United States in 1984. In 1991 he joined the UW where he taught and studied space plasma physics and propulsion systems.

He was a science innovator. He developed the “Penetrators” – described as a “space harpoon” that could be fired into an asteroid or moon crashing through the surface to collect samples then recovered via a long line. He also led graduate students who developed Husky Sat 1 a technology demonstrator satellite launched into space in November 2019.

Winglee also was a skilled university administrator colleagues said. He served a decade as chairman of the Earth and Space Sciences Department and fought for his programs during the steep cuts that followed the Great Recession UW Astrobiology professor Roger Buick added. “I don’t know how he did it but he managed to keep things stable at a time when many other departments were shrinking dramatically.”

He had a knack for inspiring others. “He was like our Captain Picard” said Irene Svete a public information officer at UW. “An opportunity would appear on our horizon and he’d point at it as if to say ‘Make it so Number One.’ ”

But it was Winglee’s mentorship to his graduate students – and to high school students in underserved communities across the Northwest – that most of his colleagues remember.

“Trying to make a career out of science is all about mentorship” said Darci Snowden an assistant professor of physics at Central Washington University who was one of Winglee’s grad students. “Robert reintroduced me to the joy of science launching rockets and balloons and playing with robots.”

Winglee led student expeditions to launch rockets and weather balloons to places ranging from Moses Lake to the Australian Outback. He believed that being a science professor was not just about publishing papers but “getting students excited about STEM” Snowden said. “We will see his impact in the next generation of scientists and engineers.”

Many of those he reached were high school students. Winglee conceived the Northwest Earth and Space Science Pipeline a NASA-funded group that brings STEM education to traditionally underserved teens.

It was “a radical idea” said Melissa Edwards director of digital learning at Seattle’s Museum of Flight. Winglee proposed “colleges museums and K-12 educational partners across three states could work in tandem to deliver NASA-centric content to students.”

And it worked said Terrell Andrews a Yakama Nation member who is a high school student in White Swan Wash. “He encouraged us to do more doing stuff that his (college) students were doing but at the high school level.”

Winglee “dedicated his life to students seeking STEM careers” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine in a letter read during the memorial. Winglee’s efforts strengthened NASA’s workforce and will help get the United States get back to the moon he added. “I will forever be grateful to the Rocket Man his service to NASA and to the thousands of students he reached through his work.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxjbGVhcmRlZmVuc2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvc3ItOTFfYXVyb3JhX21hY2hfNV9oeXBlcnNvbmljX3NweV9wbGFuZV9vcl9teXRoXzY1NzYyMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SR-91 Aurora: Mach 5 Hypersonic Spy Plane Or Myth?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.realcleardefense.com/2021/01/23/sr-91_aurora_mach_5_hypersonic_spy_plane_or_myth_657623.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxjbGVhcmRlZmVuc2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvc3ItOTFfYXVyb3JhX21hY2hfNV9oeXBlcnNvbmljX3NweV9wbGFuZV9vcl9teXRoXzY1NzYyMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWphbnVhcnktMjUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of January 25,"Leading stock indices continued the recent rally this week with S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average setting new records helped mainly by the tech sector. Also the overall sentiment got a boost after new president Joe Biden took office.

The resurgence of coronavirus cases and the deepening economic uncertainty continue to take a toll on the US labor market. Last week jobless claims stayed elevated around 900000 but it was slightly below economists’ prediction. The dismal employment scenario and continuing lay-offs show that the new president has a tough task at hand.

On the M&A front tech firms Lumentum Holdings and Coherent Inc. agreed for a merger last week. The $5.7-billion deal is expected to create one of the largest photonics and laser companies in the world. Elsewhere Boston Scientific signed a pact to acquire privately-held mobile health solutions company Preventive Solutions. In another tech buyout Cognizant agreed to acquire software company Magnetic Solutions to strengthen its digital engineering capabilities.

Some of the major Wall Street firms reported earnings this week which was shortened by the holiday with Bank of America Goldman Sachs and Netflix reporting their results on Tuesday. UnitedHealth Group and Morgan Stanley were the important company’s that published earnings on Wednesday while Intel and IBM reported on the next day.

Wall Street is headed into a busy earnings week with the likes of Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson preparing for their quarterly announcements on January 26. Apple’s first-quarter report a much-awaited event is expected on January 27. On the same day AT&T and Facebook will be unveiling their latest numbers. Airlines companies like JetBlue Southwest and American will dominate the earnings scene on January 28.

If they carried hypersonic missiles they could hit targets from a distance which would be vital since they would not be steathly.

The U.S. Air Force could arm new F-15 Eagles with a hypersonic missile. That is assuming Congress lets the flying branch buy the upgraded fighters.

This first appeared in 2020 and is being reposted due to reader interest.

New Eagles could be launch platforms for ""stand-off weapons hypersonics"" Air Force major general David Krumm the service's director of strategic plans and requirements told Air Force magazine reporters John Tirpak and Brian Everstine.

""They can go a long ways to assist the penetrating forces"" Krumm said of the new F-15s.

It remains to be seen whether Krumm's argument will sway skeptics.

The latest F-15EX variant of the five-decade-old Eagle design has been the subject of simmering controversy in the media and in Washington D.C when in mid-2018 news first leaked that the Pentagon planned to buy from Boeing as many as 144 of the twin-engine planes.

Critics in the media pointed out that the Air Force didn't actually want the new F-15s. Instead the U.S. Defense Department's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office one of the military's many analytical organizations  convinced the office of acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan to add eight F-15EXs to the department's 2020 budget proposal.

Shanahan is a former Boeing executive. Shanahan's spokesperson Joe Buccino said Shanahan has recused himself from any procurement decisions involving Boeing but at least one ethics group has filed a formal complaint accusing Shanahan of favoring the Chicago plane-maker.

The Defense Department compelled the Air Force to request eight F-15EXs as part of the flying branch's 2020 budget request. The eight planes would cost $1.2 billion.

The Air Force reportedly would buy another 136 F-15EXs through the mid-2020s. The new Eagles would replace 1980s-vintage F-15Cs in some or all of the nine squadrons that fly the older type -- three in the active force and six in the Air National Guard.

The F-15EX boasts better sensors and avionics than the F-15C has and can carry more weapons than the older Eagle can do. Owing to worsening metal fatigue the old F-15Cs ""won't make it to 2030"" Krumm said.

Critics of the F-15EX include lawmakers in districts that heavily depend on Boeing-rival Lockheed Martin. The Air Force for 2020 has asked to purchase 48 stealthy F-35s from Lockheed. That's far short of the 80 to 100 F-35s the Air Force wants but can't afford to buy every year.

Other Eagle skeptics include retired Air Force generals who prefer for the flying branch to buy only radar-evading warplanes. The blocky F-15 lacks stealth features.

""No amount of capacity can overcome an inability to penetrate modern defenses and destroy high-value targets — severe limitations of the F-15X"" wrote John Michael Loh a retired general who served as the U.S. Air Force vice chief of staff and the commander of Air Combat Command.

Now that the Pentagon has required the Air Force to request F-15s service officials have defended the upgraded Eagle as being cheaper than the F-35 is to integrate into the force. The F-15EX and older F-15C are 80- to 90-percent common Krumm told Tirpak and Everstine. A new Eagle can use existing bases and support equipment. F-15C pilots can convert to the F-15EX in just six months.

By comparison it takes an active-duty fighter squadron up to 18 months to convert to the F-35. A reserve or Guard unit needs three years to convert to the stealth fighter. Buying F-15EXs could keep the Air Force nine F-15 squadrons on the front line for decades to come with only short breaks to add new airframes.

Krumm conceded that the F-15 isn't stealthy. But armed with a super-fast hypersonic missile the new-old fighter still could be useful in a major war with a high-tech foe. ""The F-15 design is technically capable of exceeding Mach three and so could accelerate a hypersonic missile close to its Mach five-plus operating regime"" Everstine and Tirpak noted.

""That in turn would permit smaller booster rockets for the rest of the acceleration to Mach five for weapons such as the Tactical Boost Glide hypersonic concept. The F-35 which was not designed to be USAF’s high-end dogfighter has a top speed of Mach 1.6 and the first generation of hypersonic missiles is unlikely to fit inside its weapons bay.""

The F-15EXs armed with hypersonic missiles would fight alongside older fighters such as A-10s and F-16s and newer stealthy planes including F-22s and F-35s. ""The way to use these things is to collaborate on a network"" Krumm said.

The Air Force already has developed tactics for mixing F-15Cs and F-22 Raptors. The Eagles with their more-powerful radars and heavier missile loads would fly behind the radar-evading F-22s helping to spot targets for the Raptors and lob missiles at targets the F-22s miss.

An F-15EX with a hypersonic missile could improve on that same concept.

And it's worth pointing out that the big powerful F-15 long has been the Air Force's fighter of choice for carrying large experimental payloads. In the mid-1980s the flying branch armed an F-15A with an 18-feet-long 2700-pound anti-satellite rocket.

During a test in September 1985 the F-15 accelerated to Mach 1.22 while climbing at a 65-degree angle. The anti-satellite rocket automatically launched at an altitude of 38100 feet and minutes later pulverized an obsolete U.S. satellite orbiting 345 miles over the Pacific Ocean.

Rob Lowe and his wife Sheryl Berkoff are one of the longest-lasting celebrity couples in Hollywood. The pair have been married since 1991 and share two sons together. At this point it’s clear that not many people can imagine them being with anyone else.

However it might come as a surprise that before Berkoff fell for Lowe she was romanced by a few guys in the film industry — one being the actor’s St. Elmo’s Fire co-star.

A few years before falling in love with Lowe Berkoff was romantically involved with his St. Elmo’s Fire co-star and best friend Emilio Estevez in the early ’80s.

Though it’s unclear how the two met or long they were together a 2009 piece published in The Guardian said the entire situation was “terribly incestuous in a glamorous Hollywood sort of way.”

After calling it quits from Estevez Berkoff dated actor Keanu Reeves for a time in the late ’80s. However the relationship between them didn’t last very long.

Sheryl Berkoff and Rob Lowe fell in love while working on a film together

Following her romance with Reeves Berkoff started dating Lowe whom she met a few years prior.

According to Bustle the pair met on a “half blind” date back in 1983. Though they went on a few dates after that both weren’t ready to be in a serious relationship. The two ended up not seeing each other again until 1989 when Berkoff was Lowe’s makeup artist on the set of his film Bad Influence.

Two years later in 1991 Lowe and Berkoff got married. Though Lowe had suffered from alcoholism unfaithfulness and had an infamous sex tape scandal under his belt Berkoff helped him overcome those obstacles.

Now he’s happier than ever.

“I had met my now wife Sheryl and was attempting my first try at monogamy — which was not really in my nature at the time — and I wasn’t able to do it” the 9-1-1: Lone Star actor told Haute Living LA in 2014.

“It made me examine how I was living my life” Lowe continued. “That led me to getting sober which led me to changing my life — giving me everything I now have.”

Rob Lowe and Sheryl Berkoff are still happily married

After tying the knot Lowe and Berkoff went on to have two sons together: Matthew Edward Lowe (born 1993) and John Owen Lowe (born 1995).

Today the pair are still happily married.

While long-lasting relationships are rare to come by in Hollywood Lowe and Berkoff have found the key to maintaining a successful marriage which the actor revealed during a 2019 appearance on the Goopfellas podcast.

“People always ask ‘Do you have any advice about marriage?’ and I’m reminded of when they asked Alfred Hitchcock about making a hit movie. He said ‘It’s all about the casting’ and that’s the same with marriage” Lowe said. “It really is all about who you pick. I always say to people ‘If there’s any way to marry your best friend do it.’ ‘Cause the rest of it comes and goes and I was very lucky there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvZ2luYS1iYXJ0bGV5LWxvd2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_cGlkPTE5NzYwMzM5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gina Bartley-Lowe Obituary (1989 - 2021),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/gina-bartley-lowe-obituary?pid=197603391 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvZ2luYS1iYXJ0bGV5LWxvd2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_cGlkPTE5NzYwMzM5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcG9wY3VsdHVyZS5jb20vdHYtc2hvd3MvbmV3cy90aGUtbWFza2VkLWRhbmNlci1yb2ItbG93ZS1wb2tlcy1mdW4tcGF1bGEtYWJkdWwtZW1pbGlvLWVzdGV2ZXov0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9wb3BjdWx0dXJlLmNvbS90di1zaG93cy9hbXAvbmV3cy90aGUtbWFza2VkLWRhbmNlci1yb2ItbG93ZS1wb2tlcy1mdW4tcGF1bGEtYWJkdWwtZW1pbGlvLWVzdGV2ZXov?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Masked Dancer': Rob Lowe Pokes Fun at Paula Abdul and Emilio Estevez's Relationship,"✖

The Masked Dancer guest judge Rob Lowe threw some light-hearted jabs at co-panelist Paula Abdul in the latest episode. Lowe made a joke referencing Abdul's past relationship with Emilio Estevez on the show. After the Hammerhead Shark performed to the Weeknd's 'Blinding Lights' Abdul began questioning the man hoping to guess the figure's real identity. ""You look depressed; did you get married recently?"" she asked predicting that the dancer In the shark suit was actually Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino of Jersey Shore. ""You were depressed because you were in jail."" Lowe made a quick comment in response ""As I'm thinking 'depressed marriage' I think it could be Emilio Estevez.""

Abdul and Estevez jumped into their relationship in the '90s while Abdul was also involved with another '90s heartthrob John Stamos. The two went on to get engaged after dating for a brief six months and wed in a private ceremony at a Santa Monica courthouse in 1992. The marriage was short-lived and Abdul filed for divorce almost two years later. ""It's with tremendous reluctance and great sadness that I've taken this action"" Abdul said in a statement. ""I have great affection and both personal and professional respect for Emilio. I know that we'll continue to be supportive of each other.""

The performer who actually wound up being eliminated was Cricket after he was unmasked and revealed to be Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter Brian McKnight. McKnight spoke with Entertainment Tonight about his experience on the show and the feeling of being unmasked. The [real] win is just being on the show"" McKnight 51 said. ""But in that moment your competitiveness says 'I just lost and now everybody's gonna know who I am.'"" While I'm dancing nobody knows but the moment I take this off now everyone's gonna be 'Oh man look at that loser.'""

McKnight admitted that he was actually opposed to being on the show out of fear that he would be easily recognized but said his wife convinced him to sign up. ""My wife was like 'You should try this. Get out of your comfort zone. Do something a little different'"" McKnight recalled. ""And her wish is my command."" He added ""She was there at every rehearsal. When I was getting frustrated you know she held my hand. I've never had anybody look out for me the way my wife does and I'm gonna continue to do everything she says. Period."""

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Perkins-Sinapati filed one of three civil lawsuits blaming HPD for the wreck.

In February the city council approved the settlement.

At last check Perkins-Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses. Meanwhile his attorney cast suspicion on his arrest.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June. All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

The lawsuit filed by Kylie McKenzie in March 2022 in Florida said Anibal Aranda who was employed by the sport’s national governing body for about seven years and later fired used his position as a USTA coach to gain access to vulnerable female athletes and commit sexual battery against them. McKenzie was 19 and Aranda was 34 when she alleges he abused her.



“I couldn’t be happier with the outcome. I feel validated” McKenzie said in a statement on Tuesday. “It was very hard but I feel now that it was all worth it. I hope I can be an example for other girls to speak out even when it’s difficult.”



The AP generally doesn’t name people who say they are victims of sexual assault but McKenzie agreed to let her identity be used in news coverage about her lawsuit.



Her lawsuit said the USTA negligently failed to protect her from sexual assaults and was negligent in keeping Aranda as a coach after he sexually assaulted a USTA employee.



As a junior player McKenzie – who is now 25 – reached a career-high ranking of No 33 in 2016. The year before she compiled a 20-6 record in junior competition including victories over Sofia Kenin who would go on to win the championship at the 2020 Australian Open and Tamara Zidansek later a semi-finalist at the 2021 French Open. In 2022 McKenzie said that the alleged sexual abuse had negatively affected her confidence and self-esteem and that the anxiety she felt from the abuse consumed her on the tennis court in 2019 and 2020. “It has been damaging to me as a person and as a player” McKenzie said.



The jury in Florida awarded McKenzie $3m in compensation and added $6m in punitive damages on Monday.



“We are very pleased with the jury’s decision to award Ms McKenzie for her pain and suffering but more importantly we believe the jury’s decision to award punitive damages sends the correct message to all sports organizations that they must take necessary steps to protect the athletes under their banner” her lawyer Amy Judkins wrote.



USTA spokesperson Chris Widmaier said the organization would appeal.



“We are sympathetic to the plaintiff and what she endured. We do not – and have never – disputed her allegations against a coach” Widmaier said.



But Widmaier said the USTA was “deeply troubled” by the decision including the fact that “the court ruled that the USTA was liable because one of its employees – a non-athlete – had an obligation to report her own experience with this coach to the USTA; an incident that was unknown until after the USTA removed the coach. This sets a new and unreasonable expectation for victims one that will deter them from coming forward in the future.”



Widmaier said on Tuesday that a review of the USTA’s safeguarding policies and procedures is ongoing. Two lawyers at a Washington-based firm were enlisted to look into how the USTA keeps athletes safe from abuse and how it responds to reports of misconduct.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vY2hpY2Fnby5zdW50aW1lcy5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvMjAyNC8wNS8wNi90aG9tcHNvbi1jZW50ZXItZ29vZ2xlLXByaW1lLWNhcHJpLXJlZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtbG9vcC1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thompson Center's $280M redevelopment into Google's Chicago HQ is underway,"Construction on the James R. Thompson Center is in full swing after the building’s developers on Monday officially kicked off the redevelopment project saying it will have an “unbelievable impact” on the Loop and strengthen Chicago’s reputation as a technology hub.

Once complete the building at 100 W. Randolph St. will become Google’s Chicago headquarters and house 2000 employees. The project is expected to be move-in ready by 2026.

The renovation of the center comes at a time of wider transformation for the Loop. Mayor Brandon Johnson announced in April that he was seeking $150 million in tax increment financing for four La Salle Street adaptive reuse projects. The conversions would create more than 1000 new apartments in the city’s Central Business District bringing new use to largely vacant office buildings.

Prime/Capri Interests a joint venture between developers Michael Reschke and Quintin Primo III is completing the $280 million build-to-suit redevelopment under an agreement with Google which intends to purchase the building once renovations are complete. PCI said the makeover is akin to a rebuild.

“When this project is complete this one single building will help lift up the surrounding area” Reschke said. “Not only will it lift up the buildings but it also will lift up ... all the people who work live and visit this area every single day.”

Reschke and Primo were joined by Gov. J.B. Pritzker Johnson and Google’s head of its Chicago operations Karen Sauder along with other Google executives and city and state officials.

Pritzker told Google’s leaders that it’s “an incredible investment both in your future and in ours.”

PCI will restore and modernize the Thompson Center with a new triple-pane glass wrap on the exterior a heightened colonnade three levels of covered terraces and access to green spaces.

The center’s CTA stop at Clark and Lake streets where six lines converge will remain open throughout construction. Google previously said passengers on those lines could expect a “new and improved CTA experience” though it hasn’t been made clear what that will look like.

Carbon-free energy

In 2022 Pritzker announced that the center traded hands inking a deal with Google in “a sale that has eluded State government for decades” according to a news release at the time. The state working out terms with developer Reschke sold it to Google for $105 million and then paid $75 million for 115 S. La Salle St. formerly the BMO Harris Bank building where the state moved its offices from the Thompson Center.

Construction at the 1.2 million-square-foot center started a month ago when Clark Construction placed equipment on the site and protective fencing was installed around the building’s perimeter and outdoor plaza. On Thursday construction crews could be seen tearing off the lower exterior of the building and a portion of the atrium.

The 38-year-old state government building has long garnered mixed reactions. Over the course of its existence three governors wanted the center demolished because of its age and high maintenance costs. State officials have said it costs $17 million a year to operate the building.

But pricey maintenance costs are expected to change through PCI’s redevelopment efforts. The developer is pursuing LEED Platinum status — the highest level of LEED certification — and transitioning the building to all electric. The Thompson Center’s internal systems will be replaced along with its heating and cooling systems to better handle Chicago’s climate. The glass facade which will bring a modern touch and higher visibility will also double as a way to improve the building’s thermal performance.

Efforts to make the center a green building are in line with Google’s goal to use 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“With the Thompson Center we saw a chance to revitalize the Loop but also take this iconic building that some thought of tearing down and instead make the renovations necessary to respectfully steward it into the 21st century” Sauder said.

Designed by Chicago architect Helmut Jahn the building opened in 1985 as the State of Illinois Center. It’s become recognizable for its 17-story atrium and the 29-foot tall “Monument with Standing Beast” sculpture. The sculpture nicknamed “Snoopy in a Blender” was removed last week and will be kept at a state facility until it’s moved to the Art Institute of Chicago.

Jahn’s namesake architecture firm is leading the redesign.

Johnson said Google’s investment proves Chicago is globally connected and a world-class hub for innovation. From 2022 to 2023 Chicago saw 32 new office openings.

“Chicago is the place to be” Johnson said.

And cut $600M,"The conundrum facing the firm charged with restructuring NJ Transit is to find $600 million in cuts while also identifying ways to help the agency evolve into a ""comprehensive transit system"" that meets the needs of modern-day straphangers.

The state is paying North Highland $6.7 million to conduct the study which the company launched in January. It is expected to deliver “quick wins” in June with a feasibility study report in late October or November.

Asked if the North Highland team has provided the month-five update of ""quick wins"" yet and if it will give an update to the public NJ Transit spokesman John Chartier said ""There is no update on North Highland at this time.""

Story continues after photo gallery.

North Highland is trying to answer this central question: “What are the opportunities and next steps for NJT to become the ‘Comprehensive Transit System’ that the public expects even in midst of this challenging environment?”

That is what the consulting team said to the New Jersey Transportation and Treasury departments in its 154-page response to a request for proposals part of a 214-page document withheld from the public for more than two months after NorthJersey.com first filed a public information request.

Contracts are supposed to be provided “immediately” according to state law. In this case the requested document wasn’t produced until after a significant fare hike proposal was approved by NJ Transit’s board even though the main point of the study is to cut 20% of the agency's operating budget.

Analyzing a 'doomsday' scenario

NJ Transit President and CEO Kevin Corbett said the study is partly analyzing a ""doomsday"" scenario — cuts the agency could be forced to make if state aid including a proposed corporate transit fee isn’t passed by the Legislature in time for the July 1 budget deadline.

The other part of the study will examine potential agency improvements good management practices it could adopt and how it could change service to meet ridership in a post-pandemic commuter environment.

“What happens if we don’t get that money?"" Corbett said in response to questions from senators and Assembly members during transportation budget hearings last month. ""We have to be able to come back and say ‘OK if we don’t have this money then we’re talking very dramatic potential cuts certainly nothing that we want to do after working so hard to rebuild the transit system.'""

Five firms are involved in the assessment: Atlanta-based North Highland Co.; Washington D.C.-based CPCS Transcom Limited; Houston-based Amey Consulting; Newton Pennsylvania-based Loutel LLC; and Trenton-based MBI a powerhouse New Jersey lobbying firm.

North Highland’s team will assess NJ Transit across three main categories: administration operations and capital. Here is an overview of the issues the consulting firm will target in each of those fields.

Administration

This piece of the analysis will focus on the workforce organizational design procurement practices use of technology discretionary spending and revenue.

The workforce assessment will provide NJ Transit with a better understanding of the true number of employees needed in each area and what jobs might be automated. NJ Transit’s nearly 12000-person workforce is the biggest area of costs for the agency.

The tech focuses will be applied to planning routes and collecting and using real-time data. NJ Transit currently provides no public data for cancellations of the three light rail systems or the agency’s 253 bus routes.

In addition it is aiming to “enhance existing systems for improved performance and user experience” which could help address data issues that have affected navigation apps offering real-time bus departure data and recent issues customers have reported with the app’s Departure Vision feature for real-time train information.

Operations

The operations section will focus on how to address “historical practices that can sometimes create added burden” on legacy transit systems like NJ Transit with the goal to improve service.

“An external perspective can be helpful in challenging the status quo and we see it as our role to get to the bottom of the ‘how’ and ‘why’ behind existing service operations” the proposal’s authors said.

Some specific issues they’ll explore: how long trains wait at each stop how best to cycle equipment and conduct maintenance what service changes could be made during peak and off-peak hours how to ensure on-time performance how to improve paratransit dispatch how best to cycle through crews how to improve accessibility and how to improve efficiency with train platform assignments.

Another focal point will be how to address post-COVID ridership trends such as longer peak travel times as well as how congestion pricing could affect ridership and “a more regionally distributed network that provides interconnectivity across a more dispersed set of origins and destinations” instead of focusing on Manhattan the proposal said.

Capital

The North Highland team will take a close look at NJ Transit’s assets and how best to manage them including train cars and buses and property to house them.

Much like other legacy transit operators NJ Transit has a mix of inherited outdated equipment and facilities along with some newer equipment and garages including the electric bus fleet and garage in Newton. This has created a “complex web” and “can spiral into a chaotic environment of redundant inventory systems obsolete stock and operational inefficiencies” the proposal said.

The analysis will aim to find redundancies and streamline inventory processes to cut costs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L2xha2UtYmx1ZmYtZHJlYW0taG9tZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lake Bluff 5-bedroom home with multi-level lawn: $4.2M,"The finished basement is equipped with a game area a recreation room a home gym and storage rooms.

What exactly does the term mean and what is its significance? (The oil boom here meant both oil wells and natural gas wells.)

Note: Check one of the photos at the bottom of this story. It shows one of seven wells shot on the Rev. Chris Badertscher farm on Bentley Road in 1898. At that time oil sold for 80 cents a barrel. Rev. Badertscher was offered $20000 for the oil rights but refused to sell. The well was pumped for 15 years.

Here’s a very brief background and much of this information is from the book “The Town at the Fork of the Rileys.”

In 1884 in Findlay natural gas was struck at a depth of 1092 feet in sufficient quantity to make a flame 30 feet high when ignited. This well was on the site of today's Hancock County Fairgrounds.

By 1886 there were 17 wells in Findlay. And Findlay became known as the City of Lights across the United States.

Those lights of Findlay were so bright they could be seen at night in Bluffton. The gas and oil attracted 31 industries to Findlay. Today the Marathon Oil Co. in Findlay is a direct result of that 1884 well.

Bluffton was affected by this prosperity affecting the growth of the village. The first oil well in Bluffton was drilled in 1890 on the Asa Stratton farm. The real rush happened in 1894 and from then on this boom brought a solid substantial prosperous decade of good times ready money and other conditions laying the groundwork for Bluffton’s industrial expansion.

Sixty-four foot derricks sprang up across the countryside. At night flickering oil lamps marked their locations as drilling crews worked the sites 24 hours a day.

At the height of this boom in 1900 there were estimated to be 500 oil wells pumping in the Bluffton area. Thirty crews were working the wells. The majority of these wells were in Orange Township.

When driving from Bluffton to Arlington on State Route 103 today count the farm houses constructed of brick. Those farms had oil and the farmers could afford brick houses.

The oil boom had its downside resulting in a dozen saloons in Bluffton. As you can imagine this helped the rise of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union which became present in Bluffton also at this time.

The oil boom began to fade in the early 1900s but the prosperity it brought was significant in the growth of Bluffton. And today the oil boom of the 1890s is part of forgotten Bluffton.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Azim Premji University in Bangalore has a specific social purpose of creating reflective practitioners in the domain of education and development.



This is an integral goal of the Azim Premji Foundation a major philanthropic organisation which runs the university and field institutes in 50 relatively less-developed districts of India in order to improve school education as well as a philanthropic initiative to extend financial support to non-governmental organisations for the purposes of social development.

Nearly 400 postgraduates pass out of the university every year and the majority take up jobs in non-governmental philanthropic and similar organisations which are active in the domains of education and development.



COVID-19 response



The Azim Premji Foundation has committed nearly US$135 million towards the humanitarian and health crises arising out of COVID-19. This money is used to regularly provide food to thousands of people who have lost their livelihoods or incomes as well as materials and equipment to government hospitals in under-served areas.



Azim Premji University has contributed to these efforts through the collection of data and information to analyse the extent of deprivation among different sections of vulnerable groups (such as migrant workers) so as to provide timely support to them or to bring their plight to the attention of governmental and other agencies; and has vetted funding proposals from different field organisations.



A group of university members became part of SWAN (the Stranded Workers Action Network) 2020 – ‘a group of volunteers connecting relief to workers stranded across India due to the COVID-19 lockdown while documenting their experiences’. The former students of the university played an important role in taking the foundation’s donations to those in need.



The university has also funded a set of research proposals most of which assess the effectiveness of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by governmental and non-governmental organisations.



It has taken other academic initiatives too. Its online platform called



The challenges to education especially online education which has become unavoidable during the pandemic were assessed in another series of publications.



Academics have a role to play when it comes to critically observing the actions of the state and other powerful actors and such critical reflection is important during the pandemic too. The faculty of Azim Premji University have written several articles in newspapers and on social media reflecting on the actions and omissions of governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.



To some extent Azim Premji University is unique since it is funded fully by the Azim Premji Foundation which works across 25 states and 450+ districts of the country with over 400 partner organisations. Some university students and faculty are integrated within the cross-functional teams of the foundation and work on the ground to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.



There are more than 65000 people who are teachers at government schools who collaborate with the field institutes or functionaries of partner organisations of the philanthropic initiative. They help to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and to provide an on-the-ground pulse of what is really happening. These ground-level assessments are carried out periodically and shared informally with governments to help inform their actions.



In sum the activities of the foundation create the demand and space for the university’s contribution on the one hand and help to generate the required data and information on the other hand.



The university’s role in the COVID-19 pandemic shows that a university is able to contribute to social actions in emergencies if it is collaborating closely with organisations which provide financial resources and carry out actions of humanitarian assistance and with other organisations on the ground. It also demonstrates the importance of universities having social connections in the communities where they are embedded.



The need to prepare the ground



The contributions of a university during a pandemic require adequate preparedness on the part of the academics. This preparedness has multiple dimensions. Humanitarian actions require a certain speed and the information and knowledge support for such actions needs to be provided in a timely fashion. This may require certain changes to the pace at which academics normally work.



The social issues arising from a pandemic may require lenses from multiple disciplines and an interdisciplinary approach. This may require an adaptation on the part of academics who are engrossed in their disciplinary frameworks. It is difficult to collect all relevant information during such emergencies and hence conventional research methods may not be appropriate and adequate.



So research methodologies may need to be adapted too.



Universities are known for public debate and student-led actions at times when societies face threats to democracy and human rights. Public critique is an expected social response of universities. However pandemics such as the COVID-19 one require not only criticism but also constructive action.



There should be a culture within universities that values appropriate and timely responses to pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of such a culture those universities which pursue liberal or social science education may be at a loss during such crises.



On 27 January 2021 University World News in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation will be bringing together experts and practitioners from across the world from the International Association of Universities the Talloires Network of Engaged Universities and the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program in an online webinar to discuss: How can universities improve their social impact?

Before the devastating coronavirus pandemic during the 2019 ASEAN Summit Thailand introduced the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) initiative to transform three Thai provinces into smart cities – which has turned out to be a success.

With the aim to create a centre for trade investment regional transportation and a strategic gateway to Asia - Thailand is confident that it would promote a seamless ASEAN.

In accordance with Thailand 4.0 the country aims to achieve 100 smart cities by 2024. That goal is well on its way to completion especially now that the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (depa) a Thai government agency has signed a partnership with City Possible global network. Pioneered by Mastercard 27 Thai smart cities had been inducted into the City Possible program which is designed to make technology work for people by aligning key stakeholders to address urban issues.

City Possible provides members with unrivalled access to a global community of urban leaders businesses non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and academics and are regularly invited to a series of knowledge-exchange forums where participants identify common challenges exchange learnings and establish holistic urban solutions.

“Cities around the world face similar challenges but they are too often solving in isolation. City Possible connects cities with insights and resources from cities around the world which accelerates progress and enables smart governance” said Miguel Gamiño Jr Executive Vice President Global Cities Mastercard.

The focus on smart cities is a core pillar of the government’s Thailand 4.0 initiative which aims to transform the kingdom into a high-income nation with vastly improved quality of life in urban centres.

“As a country relying on agricultural and tourism industries we want smart cities to be the ecosystem to promote both of these which in turn will afford to close the income gap and accelerate much-needed growth in the economy of the country as a whole” Dr Passakon Prathombutr Senior Executive Vice President of depa told The ASEAN Post.

“Two most important sectors are environment and economy. We place environment as the most important sector because it only makes sense for a city to be smart if it does not deteriorate the environment” he added.

Pollution and drought are the two most critical environmental issues facing Thais “the key idea is to deploy to the local governments by equipping them with the technology; such as sensors integrated data systems and a digital twin to monitor and predict foreseeable disasters” explained Dr Prathombutr.

Several cities in seven provinces have been committed to pursuing smart city development. They include those in Phuket Chiang Mai Khon Kaen Chon Buri Rayong Bangkok and Chachoengsao.

According to local media reports from May to July 2020 a total of 39 cities have submitted proposals for evaluation and approval to the National Steering Committee on Smart City Development to join the scheme.

In order to get approval for smart city development cities must meet five criteria: have clear geographical boundaries and smart city goals have infrastructure investment and a development plan have a design for an open and secure city data platform provide smart city solutions and have a sustainable management model.

Recently the Thai government decided to participate in the Smart Green ASEAN Cities project jointly coordinated by the European Union (EU) and ASEAN. The project’s framework aims to support sustainable urbanisation in the region reduce the environmental footprint of urban areas and improve the quality of life of residents.

It was reported that under the framework the EU would provide funding of €5 million (US$6 million) to selected ASEAN cities to develop smart sustainable and environmentally friendly urban areas.

""This cooperation is in line with the government's policy to develop Thailand's cities into smart and sustainable urban areas. This framework will lead to capacity building and the sharing of best practices which can lead to improvements in urban residents' quality of life"" said Rachada Dhnadirek a government spokeswoman.

Nonetheless the implementation of new infrastructure comes with its challenges and resistance. In terms of effectively utilising resources and technology three significant challenges lay ahead; the mindset of leaders in a city existing regulations and the capacity to act.

“Many city leaders do not have adequate technological literacy to pivot the role into innovators. Among those who do they are sometimes too timid to pose a technological vision” said Dr Prathombutr.

He further explained that “local agents of transformation in each city are needed to play a critical role in moving the cities toward becoming “smarter.""

Then one day in 2015 Huzaifa was pondering on the contradiction that lots of eating places throw away food every day when so many had nothing to eat and he turned to his friend Qasim Javid Khan and said: “There is a lot of food being wasted and a lot of people going hungry. Let’s do something.”



Huzaifa and Qasim were both second year students at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) Pakistan. Not sure what to do but with another student friend Musa Aamir they set up a Facebook page saying: “If anyone has excess food give us a call.”



The post immediately went viral among students at the school. “Soon people started calling and we bunked off classes to pick up food and drop it” Qasim told University World News.



This article is part of a series on Transformative Leadership published by University World News in partnership with Mastercard Foundation. University World News is solely responsible for the editorial content. This article is part of a series onpublished byin partnership withis solely responsible for the editorial content.

The boys felt they had started something worthwhile but they didn’t know where to go with it or how to make it last. Fortunately LUMS hosted the first social enterprise incubator in Pakistan the Social Innovation Lab (SIL) which provides a testing ground for aspiring student entrepreneurs. It helps students design business models and brands and find partners who are willing to take them to scale. Musa put in an application.



“They came to us and said Huzaifa’s mother does a wonderful job but what will happen when she dies?” Maryam Mohiuddin the founder and director of SIL told University World News. “That is the shortcoming of the charity model relying on a charismatic leader. So we helped them figure out how to monetise this model. They were very hesitant as they had seen Huzaifa’s mother give food away for free all her life but business folks were telling them to make money.”



“SIL gave us structure to the chaos” says Qasim who is now 26. “It made us think how to tackle the problem of hunger food insecurity and food wastage structurally.



“That’s when we started thinking about sustainability business modelling marketing. Before that we were just three friends on a mission to do good.”



First breakthrough



While the LUMS community played its part in uplifting what they were doing SIL gave them access to mentors and advice. One of them asked ‘Why are you only picking up food on a Saturday and Sunday. Are you doing this to solve a problem or for your own personal gratification?”



That brought them up sharp and they realised they had to pick up seven days a week and develop a model that would make that work which meant not relying on just the three of them but creating something that would keep running whether they were busy at college or not.



The first breakthrough came when a major restaurant in Lahore owned by a college alumnus gave them excess food to redistribute on a daily basis.



They gave the project a name Rizq (which is Arabic for provisions); bought a rikshaw van to use as an “ambulance for food recovery”; circulated a number on social media and started taking orders from anyone with excess food.



The bright yellow and salmon ‘Rizqshaw’ decorated with a poster of a child and the slogan ‘Don’t waste share food’ began weaving its way through the dry dusty streets of Lahore daily to pick up food and deliver to people who need it most.



Along with the logistics the trio – all three of whom are economists – spent time mapping out the city of Lahore in terms of areas of poverty looking for slums and communities in need of food and in terms of where the excess food is creating



“We studied global models food-bank networks and realised every country seems to have them except Pakistan so we developed the first food bank in the same community where we were channelling excess food from households catering companies and restaurants” says Qasim.



“It might be a simple idea but it is a radical idea” says Musa. “You are feeding people excess food.”



As they looked further into why people were going hungry they designed other projects including a school lunch programme for underprivileged government and non-government schools; and a flagship Rizq Ration programme which identifies and verifies families in need in targeted communities and provides assistance in the form of food supplies twice a month at half the normal price to applicants who have been registered and approved.



“To achieve sustainability we try to charge at every level” Qasim says. “So we charge the restaurant because we are giving them a logistical or individual service. And while at first we gave away food to individuals now we have a business-to-business model where we charge NGOs a monthly fee for giving people the food they need.



“Some NGOs are willing and some are resisting. But we are trying to persuade them to accept fees.”



The ‘Uber of food distribution’



Through mapping the places that need food and those with excess the hope Qasim says is that Rizq can become “the Uber of food distribution” and “end up being a logistical company” but one “which will solve the problem of food accessibility in Pakistan”.



Under the latest business model the beneficiary pays 50% the NGO pays 25% and Rizq pays 25% the latter share being funded via individual and corporate donors.



At the moment Rizq is running 11 food banks in Lahore and four in Islamabad.



“We save one ton of excess food daily via 50 partners and with that we support 1200 families on a monthly basis through the Rizq Ration programme” Qasim says.



Another Rizq project Rizq Daig (Cauldron) feeds 500 people daily.



The families they are helping are among the world’s poorest earning PKR12000 to PKR18000 (US$75 to US$112) per month Qasim says.



“Mostly they are people paid by the day such as domestic help food vendors some with their own cart or labourers. It means they can save US$10 a month” says Qasim.



Scaling up nationally



When COVID-19 hit Pakistan individuals corporations and government approached Rizq and asked them to help with food banks. “That’s when we really scaled up and had a national footprint distributing food rations in 23 cities around the country” Qasim says.



Their efforts using a mobile phone app earned Huzaifa and another Rizq leader Syed Hassaan Irfan international recognition in the form of a Commonwealth Points of Light Award bestowed by the UK monarch Queen Elizabeth II for “mobilising an army of 3000 volunteers and distributing 2.2 million meals to the most vulnerable people saving 20000 kg of excess food that would otherwise have gone to waste”.



According to the



These days Rizq has a certain cachet and produces its own branded merchandise with the slogan öi Rizq ‘Love Does Feed’. Profits go to making the Rizq programmes more sustainable.



Along with tennis star Aisam-ul-Haq Rizq has launched a Stars Against Hunger campaign which



Mobilising young people



A major part of Rizq’s success stems from its mobilisation of young people in universities and via social media.



“We set up university chapters in different universities around the country in cities we are working in” says Qasim. “In Lahore and Islamabad we have 22 of them in different institutions. These volunteers are our backbone we have around 3000 to 4000 youth leaders across the 22 hapters.”



This is a large share of the 10000 volunteers mobilised across the country who help with campaigning and fundraising in addition to 32 full-time employees.



“As an organisation we want to focus on youth development” Qasim says. “We believe this is the age when compassion is on the rise and they can take ownership of their own communities and change society.”



The support from SIL was also critical especially the way it ingrained the idea of business modelling.



“The model we created was to set up social enterprise incubators and youth and women centres that provide experiential learning – learning by doing” says Maryam Mohiuddin. “That’s something we strongly believe especially for entrepreneurship that you can’t teach in the classroom.”



The second aspect the model involved was using “pedagogy that borrowed from our South Asian culture its wisdom traditions and religious traditions”.



Regenerative design



She said there is a deliberate attempt to depart from the standard economic ideas of linear and exponential growth and think along the lines of a circular economic model incorporating lots of “regenerative design” into their work an idea which has been taken up globally by the Talloires Network of Engaged Universities Mohiuddin says.



She believes universities “can be great centres of social change if they choose to be” but “one of the things they need to start doing and really focus on – which we push with all partners – is giving space to indigenous and local religious traditions. We have given up and replaced our traditional wisdom practices with a lot of Global North pedagogies that are good but incomplete”.



“The Western approach is to take data convert it into information and use it to create knowledge. Indigenous pedagogies go further because they ask you to connect knowledge with the higher purpose of life so the next step is wisdom. In our model we have a dialogue of wisdoms” she says.



She points to the three Rizq founders “deeply grounding their work in the Isalmic Sufi tradition in which it is a shame if even one member of the community goes hungry so it is the duty of the leader or even the community leader to ensure that no one goes to sleep hungry at night. That is what inspired those boys” said Mohiuddin.



Maryam Mohiuddin is one of four panel speakers in an online webinar being held this Wednesday 27 January 2021 in which University World News in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation will be bringing together experts and practitioners from across the world from the International Association of Universities the Talloires Network of Engaged Universities the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program and the Social Innovation Lab to discuss: How can universities improve their social impact?

Profits go to making the Rizq programmes more sustainable.Along with tennis star Aisam-ul-Haq Rizq has launched a Stars Against Hunger campaign which auctions the signed clothes of sports superstars  from global tennis stars such as Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova to football stars such as Cafu and Sadio Mane cricket stars such as Shoaib Akhtar and Shoaib Malik and motor racing and boxing stars Michael Schumacher and Amir Khan respectively.A major part of Rizq’s success stems from its mobilisation of young people in universities and via social media.“We set up university chapters in different universities around the country in cities we are working in” says Qasim. “In Lahore and Islamabad we have 22 of them in different institutions. These volunteers are our backbone we have around 3000 to 4000 youth leaders across the 22 hapters.”This is a large share of the 10000 volunteers mobilised across the country who help with campaigning and fundraising in addition to 32 full-time employees.“As an organisation we want to focus on youth development” Qasim says. “We believe this is the age when compassion is on the rise and they can take ownership of their own communities and change society.”The support from SIL was also critical especially the way it ingrained the idea of business modelling.“The model we created was to set up social enterprise incubators and youth and women centres that provide experiential learning – learning by doing” says Maryam Mohiuddin. “That’s something we strongly believe especially for entrepreneurship that you can’t teach in the classroom.”The second aspect the model involved was using “pedagogy that borrowed from our South Asian culture its wisdom traditions and religious traditions”.She said there is a deliberate attempt to depart from the standard economic ideas of linear and exponential growth and think along the lines of a circular economic model incorporating lots of “regenerative design” into their work an idea which has been taken up globally by the Talloires Network of Engaged Universities Mohiuddin says.She believes universities “can be great centres of social change if they choose to be” but “one of the things they need to start doing and really focus on – which we push with all partners – is giving space to indigenous and local religious traditions. We have given up and replaced our traditional wisdom practices with a lot of Global North pedagogies that are good but incomplete”.“The Western approach is to take data convert it into information and use it to create knowledge. Indigenous pedagogies go further because they ask you to connect knowledge with the higher purpose of life so the next step is wisdom. In our model we have a dialogue of wisdoms” she says.She points to the three Rizq founders “deeply grounding their work in the Isalmic Sufi tradition in which it is a shame if even one member of the community goes hungry so it is the duty of the leader or even the community leader to ensure that no one goes to sleep hungry at night. That is what inspired those boys” said Mohiuddin.University World News

In a unique twist the CDL had the franchises participate in a group selection show to draft each team into their pool for the first stage of the competition.

For Stage One the Dallas Empire were automatically placed into Group A after being crowned the 2020 Call of Duty League champions in August. The Atlanta FaZe on the other hand were put in Group B. Dallas was given the first pick of the selection show to draft a team to go into Group B and Atlanta then responded by picking a franchise for Group A. This reverse snake draft process continued until all 12 teams were separated into two groups.

Here are the groups for Stage One of the 2021 Call of Duty League season.

Group A

Dallas Empire

Los Angeles Thieves

Minnesota RØKKR

London Royal Ravens

New York Subliners

Seattle Surge

Group B

“Tournament seeding will be determined by head-to-head group play matches over the course of three Home Series weeks leading up to each Major” the CDL said. “During each stage all teams will compete in five group play matches to determine their seed in each Major.”

We had no option as due to the restrictions we couldn’t organize any tournament. However now permission has been granted by the authorities to conduct the tournaments and so we have decided to go ahead. It’s a relief for us as well as the players” a VCA source told TOI.All the leading players are available for this tournament which is expected to provide the much-needed match practice. The tournament will be played on four grounds including three belonging to the VCA. The players would be briefed about various Covid protocols before the match.While there’s no doubt about the restrictions a former player feels that VCA could have handled the situation in a better manner.“The shortest format of the game doesn’t give you time and that’s why Vidarbha specifically needed Twenty20 practice matches. Twenty20 requires specialization in both batting and bowling. You need to know what you do in powerplay as a batsman and bowler. You need to be specific in the middle and death overs"" the former player said.""There’s no point in doing just nets. I won’t blame the players. They could have prepared in a better manner when they started practice in November. There was still some time to go for the tournament.”VCA could have organized some practice matches before the Mushtaq Ali Trophy as well he added. While VCA always cited restrictions from local authorities the former player said organizing matches wouldn’t have affected Covid protocols.“First of all cricket isn’t a direct-contact sport. The only contact here is between bat and ball. You have more players on the field during practice than in a match. It’s only 15 persons including umpires on the field. There’s no breach of Covid protocol. Vidarbha players were just doing fielding and fitness sessions for more than a month. Even the net sessions started much later. It clearly affected their performance” said the ex-Vidarbha player.The former player also criticized the selectors for sending such an inexperienced side in a “highly competitive tournament”.“You need to have a good blend of youth and experience. At least three or four experienced players should have been there when you had the luxury of choosing 22. Even if you decide to play youngsters the presence of seniors in the dressing room would have helped the team. Barring Ganesh Satish and Akshay Wakhare the team lacked experience” he said."

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RydW1wLWJpZGVuLW1jY29ybWljay1jYXNleS1zZW5hdGUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXByaW1hcnktMTI0ODRlNjVhNjhmNDM2NGZlYzUxZWM1ZDQ2MGU1MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey and McCormick to face each other as nominees in Pennsylvania's high-stakes US Senate contest,"HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate contest this fall as Tuesday’s primary election put the men on track for a race that is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and help decide control of the Senate next year.

Casey and McCormick won their respective party primary contests after they were uncontested and now enter what is likely to be a grueling expensive and hard-fought 2024 general election campaign that culminates in the Nov. 5 vote.

Casey seeking his fourth term is perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician and a stalwart of the presidential swing state’s Democratic Party — the son of a former two-term governor and Pennsylvania’s longest-ever serving Democrat in the Senate.

McCormick is a two-time Senate challenger a former hedge fund CEO and a Pennsylvania native who spent $14 million of his own money only to lose narrowly to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s seven-way GOP primary. Oz then lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in a pivotal Senate contest.

This time around McCormick has consolidated the party around his candidacy and is backed by a super PAC that’s already reported raising more than $20 million much of it from securities-trading billionaires.

What to know about the 2024 Election

Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020. More challenges lie ahead in 2024.

The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election.

McCormick’s candidacy is shaping up as the strongest challenge to Casey in his three reelection bids. McCormick has worked to shore up support in the GOP base and on Tuesday night hammered his message at his election night gathering in Pittsburgh that Casey is a do-nothing senator.

“We’re now turning to the general election and here’s the truth: Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey You deserve better” McCormick said. “Bob Casey’s defining achievement in his political life 30 years in political office has been to be the son of Bob Casey Sr. That is what defines his political career.”

Casey in Washington on Tuesday to cast votes in favor of $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan said on social media that “there are 196 days until the general election and we’re going to win.” Meanwhile the state Democratic Party unveiled a minute-long digital ad slamming McCormick as a “millionaire hedge fund executive who is lying to Pennsylvanians.”

The Senate candidates will share a ticket with candidates for president in a state that is critical to whether Democrats can maintain control of the White House and the Senate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swing-state Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.

Of note however could be the number of “ uncommitted ” write-in votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

In the Senate contest Democrats have attacked McCormick’s opposition to abortion rights his frequent trips to Connecticut’s ritzy “Gold Coast ” where he keeps a family home and the focus on investing in China during his dozen years as an executive at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates including as CEO.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking “greedflation” — a blunt term for corporations that jack up prices and rip off shoppers to maximize profits — as fast-rising prices over the past three years have opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats. Indications that the U.S. economy avoided a recession amid efforts to manage inflation have yet to translate into voter enthusiasm for Biden.

McCormick meanwhile has accused Casey of rubber-stamping harmful immigration economic energy and national security policies of Biden and made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border and arguing that Biden hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Casey is one of Biden’s strongest allies in Congress. McCormick and Trump have endorsed each other but are an awkward duo atop the GOP’s ticket after Trump savaged McCormick in 2022’s primary in a successful bid to lift Oz to his primary win.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map that requires them to defend incumbents in the red states of Montana and Ohio and fight for open seats with new candidates in Michigan and West Virginia.

A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

Elsewhere on the ballot Tuesday Pennsylvanians decided nominees for an open attorney general’s office and two other statewide offices — treasurer and auditor general — plus all 17 of the state’s U.S. House seats.

For attorney general Republicans nominated Dave Sunday York County’s district attorney in a two-way race while Democrats nominated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale of Pittsburgh in a five-person primary field.

Democrats also nominated Erin McClelland a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity and they nominated state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge Republican state Auditor General Tim DeFoor. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.

For Congress 44 candidates were on ballots including all 17 incumbents. All three incumbents facing primary challengers — Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia and Democratic Reps. Dwight Evans in Philadelphia and Summer Lee in a Pittsburgh-based district — won their races.

Lee’s primary against challenger Bhavini Patel has shaped up as an early test of whether Israel’s war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how it has been handled.

Republicans nominated state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in a three-way race to challenge Democratic Rep. Susan Wild whose Allentown-based district is closely politically divided while Democrats nominated former TV news personality Janelle Stelson from among six candidates to challenge Republican Rep. Scott Perry in a Republican-leaning district in southern Pennsylvania.

Perry has become a national figure for heading up the ultra-right House Freedom Caucus during a speakership battle and his efforts to help Trump stay in power after losing the 2020 presidential election.

In each edition we give you the background on a condiment that should be in your pantry and how you could be using it to spice up your meals (often literally). This week we turn our attention to McDonald’s Szechuan Sauce.

What is McDonald's Szechuan Sauce?

McDonald's Szechuan Sauce was a condiment from 1998 that developed a cult following after being referenced in a 2017 episode of ""Rick and Morty."" It was a dark brown sauce that had a touch of acid from the addition of apple cider vinegar and a little nuttiness from roasted sesame oil. (This distinguished it from the chain's OG sweet and sour McNugget dipping sauce.) It does not contain Szechuan (or Sichuan) pepper which is commonly used in actual Sichuan cuisine.

Packets of the original sauce are still floating around online where you can read the full ingredient list.

How did McDonald's Szechuan Sauce make a comeback?

Adam Chandler the author of ""Drive-Thru Dreams: A Journey through the Heart of America's Fast-Food Kingdom"" remembers when McDonald's launched its Szechuan Sauce a limited-edition menu item that was part of a promotion for the 1998 animated Disney movie ""Mulan."" He was a teenager living in Texas who was a touch too old to see ""Mulan""in theaters—""Though my friends tell me it's for all ages"" he joked over the phone—but he hit the drive-thru just the same.

""You know maybe it was because I was a teenager but I think it was pretty well understood that when McDonald's put out a new McNuggets dipping sauce you had to try it out"" Chandler said. ""And I think I liked it. It felt innovative even though it was just you know a lot of corn syrup a fair bit of sugar and something that just tastes a little bit different.""

Almost 20 years later after McDonald's announced they would bring the sauce back for a one-day promotion police were called in to control a crowd that had physically pushed its way into a packed Los Angeles McDonald's chanting ""When I say 'Szechuan' you say 'sauce.'"" Similar scenes played out across the country: Groups camped out overnight to secure a place in line customers traveled down from Canada fist fights broke out and a stabbing was also reported.

Some people began selling packets of the limited-issue sauce for more than $200 a pack on eBay where months prior an original packet of Szechuan Sauce from the '90s was sold for $14000.

Running parallel to Szechuan Sauce's delayed ascension to unexpected ""cult condiment"" status are narratives about the complicated nature of the Americanization of ""global"" flavors as well as fast food's cyclical ability to dictate and be dictated by pop culture even while serving as a benchmark for mainstream tastes.

In 1983 McDonald's introduced the McNugget alongside four signature sauces: BBQ honey hot mustard and sweet and sour. The chain's sweet and sour dipping sauce was a clear imitation of the sweet and sour sauces found in Chinese American restaurants across the U.S. which — according to writer and food tour guide Michael Lin — was unsurprising.

""Considering that a large portion of Chinese immigrants opened restaurants to make a living upon their arrival to the country and that Chinese Americans spread all throughout the vast country (even in small towns and rural areas) Chinese American cuisine has deep and widespread roots here"" Lin wrote via email.

Lin continued ""Chinese American food has had a long history and it has been significantly impacted by local ingredients and Americans' tastes and preferences. So many supposedly Chinese dishes have actually been created here in the U.S. by American born Chinese descendants.""

As such McDonald's sweet and sour sauce would have felt familiar to Americans though it's worth noting that it's distinct from traditional Chinese ""sweet and sour"" sauces that rely on a mixture of light vinegar and sugar. For many Chinese American restaurant owners it was ""it was accommodate or bust"" Lin wrote in his email.

Americans anecdotally have a preference for thicker sauces — barbecue sauce ketchup mayonnaise and salad dressings — and enjoy things that veer more sweet than bitter. ""To cater or accommodate to Americans' preferences the very traditionally lighter (and thinner) sweet and sour sauce was changed to this thicker texture that we are more used to today"" Lin wrote.

That consistency also makes for a more convenient nugget dipping sauce considering that it will likely be overwhelmingly eaten inside a moving car. The sweet and sour seems to have been the base from which McDonald's eventually developed its Szechuan Sauce 15 years later. (Rumors still persist that the dipping sauce was simply a mixture of the chain's sweet and sour and BBQ sauces which if you compare the ingredient lists isn't the case).

I'm not sure that the company could have envisioned the decades-long tail Szechuan Sauce would have. Looking back at how Szechuan Sauce was marketed in the '90s it's obvious that ad execs relied on tired stereotypes to signal to viewers ""Hey this tastes uh . . . Asian."" As Entertainment Weekly's Suna Chang reported at the time where Disney's ""Mulan"" drew positive reviews from Asian American critics for its cultural sensitivity and historical accuracy the McDonald's spots generated charges of ethnic stereotyping.

""Among other things the spots feature a headband-wearing Ronald McDonald karate-chopping the company's logo and patronizing isn't-that-cute jokes about such Asian customs as sitting on the floor to eat"" Chang added. ""Meanwhile Chicken McNugget containers are emblazoned with the cringe-worthy puns 'Run don't wok . . .' and 'McNuggets are Chinamite!' Says Paul Leung a Chinese-American student at Cornell University who started an E-mail protest campaign 'You don't even have to be Chinese to be offended.'""

Jeff Yang who was the founding editor of the Asian-American publication A. Magazine said the campaign was ""the equivalent of a drive-by mooning.""

""Here is such a clear contrast between the clearly thoughtful efforts of Disney and the far more cartoonish and offensive caricatures in the promotional campaign"" he told Chang.

""Cartoonish"" is actually a great way to describe the original Szechuan Sauce itself. One dictionary definition of the word indicates that it serves as a descriptor for things that are ""unrealistically simplified."" To that point so many restaurants lapse into a trap of invoking a country or region's cuisine by relying on a single ingredient according to food writer Su-Jit Lin.

""They'll call anything with soy sauce 'Asian' anything with sweet chili 'Thai' anything with gochujang 'Korean' and on and on"" she said. ""Like imagine if folks started putting ketchup on stuff and calling it 'Italian' just because it has tomatoes in it. That's how ludicrous it is and ignorant of the culture when mass market and even local restaurants do this.""

""Just because it's a strong presence doesn't mean that it's their one single note [or] culinary contribution nor a representation of an entire country much less a continent"" she continued.

It's perhaps a tricky endeavor to demand nuance or authenticity from a fast-food restaurant tasked with feeding 62 million people a day. For some fast food can emerge as a specific marker of blended cultural heritage and childhood as John DeVore wrote in his achingly beautiful essay ""Finding Home in Taco Bell.""

Additionally there's something to be said for introducing people to new-to-them flavors in a way where there is a low barrier to entry but the point remains that there was nothing particularly ""Szechuan"" about McDonald's sauce. It was a sweet and sticky mixture with just enough spice and umami — from the tiny (less than 2% per the packet) additions of soy sesame seed oil and ginger — to differentiate it from the chain's sweet and sour and BBQ dipping sauces. Pleasant enough but no one rioted when the sauce exited menus after about a month coinciding with the end of the ""Mulan"" promotion.

The world moved on chomping on Kardashian-endorsed Mandarin Chicken salads — another Americanized invention Su-Jit Lin said as salad is a ""distinctly non-Chinese"" food — and Sriracha (which ""Saucy"" will inevitably dig into) went on to reign supreme in the realm of condiments.

But then the third season of the adult animated show ""Rick and Morty"" debuted in April 2017. In the first episode ""The Rickshank Redemption"" one of the series' main protagonists Rick Sanchez revisits a memory of going to a McDonald's drive-thru and ordering chicken McNuggets with Szechuan sauce. By the end of the episode Rick reveals that his only goal in life is to find more of the sauce. He's not motivated by saving the world or his family — or well anything other than ""that McNugget sauce. I want that 'Mulan' McNugget sauce Morty. That's my series arc Morty! If it takes nine seasons!""

It's a really funny moment in the series because as mentioned above Szechuan Sauce wasn't overwhelmingly popular upon its initial release. All things considered it was out for such a short period of time that opportunities to even try it were pretty limited. Here's a character that will obsessively bend space and time to get his hands on a dipping sauce that was just . . . fine.

But our culture's collective nostalgia machine which had already been primed by ""Stranger Things"" and ""the second coming of Lisa Frank"" kicked into high-gear. A lot of people in the ""Rick and Morty"" target demographic had hazy memories of Szechuan Sauce. Maybe it was better than they remembered? Or a culinary key to unlocking simpler better times that mimicked the feeling of opening a Happy Meal?

Fans took to Twitter and began requesting McDonald's to bring back Szechuan Sauce. Mickey D's acknowledged them by sending a ""Ricky and Morty"" creator Justin Roiland a four-pound jug of Szechuan Sauce found in ""Dimension C-1998M is a dimension where it's always 1998. 1998 every day. No smartphones no social media. It's a weird scary place. But they've got Szechuan Sauce on the regular menu.""

Meanwhile a Change.org petition asked McDonald's to bring back the sauce. ""McDonald's Szechuan sauce is the best sauce known to man"" wrote petition founder Josh Mingle. ""It would be a tragedy for it to not come back to McDonald's.""

McDonald's officially announced it would revive the sauce for a one-day promotion with a limited supply. It would took place on Oct. 7 2017 and it was an unmitigated disaster. As Eater described some locations were only armed — in the face of hundreds of customers — with 20 sauce packets 10 posters and a raffle system. Chaos broke out as ""Rick and Morty"" fans clamored to get a slot in line. Police were called and there were a lot of angry customers.

The company soon released a public apology admitting that its super-limited though well-intentioned batch clearly wasn't near enough to meet the demand of eager fans.

""So we're gonna make this right"" the statement read. ""In the last 24 hours we've worked to open any portal necessary. And it worked. Szechuan Sauce is coming back once again this winter. And instead of being a one-day-only and limited to select restaurants we're bringing more – a lot more – so that any fan who's willing to do whatever it takes for Szechuan Sauce will only have to ask for it at a nearby McDonald's.""

In February 2018 McDonald's officially revived the sauce with an estimated 20 million portions distributed to locations across the U.S. But the reviews of the sauce were mixed. Eater described it as tasting ""mainly like corn syrup with maybe a tiny bit of Worcestershire thrown in"" while Business Insider said it was like ""if you took a classic suburban American Chinese restaurant's sweet-and-sour chicken and mixed it with some soy sauce and maybe a hint of sesame.""

Some fans reported being disappointed that the sauce didn't measure up to how they remembered — or live up to the hype. ""Ultimately Szechuan sauce was about 'Rick and Morty'— not the taste of the sauce itself"" as Business Insider pointed out.

This points to one of the most fascinating elements of the condiment. It's part of the McDonald's mythos and it stems from an American institution that can both drive and be driven by pop culture. But fast food has a hard time grappling with trendiness. As Adam Chandler put it fast food restaurants so often serve as an indicator of what constitutes ""mainstream"" at a given time.

""Fast food is not cutting edge. It will never be cutting edge"" he said. ""I like to describe it as having a kind of 20/30 vision. When something ends up in a fast food restaurant that is when it has appeared in several places before; it's been tested and vetted.""

McDonald's Szechuan Sauce was never going to be truly ground-breaking nor was it likely ever really meant to be. It's a sticky-sweet culinary meme with a complicated past and an unexpectedly long shelf-life — one that's rivaled by the literal shelf-life of Szechuan Sauce itself. After all packets from the '90s still occasionally pop up on eBay.

What's a good at-home substitute for McDonald's Szechuan sauce?

OK so let's say you (reasonably) don't want to shell out hundreds of dollars for a little packet of eBay Szechuan Sauce. You have a couple of options including one of the most popular at-home copycat recipes came from Reddit user Xeropoint. He cautions that it's ""not identical to McD's version it's more of a tribute."" But it took off online and was even featured in an episode of a viral episode of the YouTube cooking program ""Binging with Babish.""

I tried it out and it's pretty good (if more flavorful than the actual stuff from McDonald's).

***

Recipe: Xeropoint's Copycat Szechuan Sauce

Approximately 1/4 cup of sauce

6 cloves of garlic minced

4 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar

Soy sauce to taste (I use 2 tablespoons)

2 tablespoons of plum sake

3 1/2 tablespoons Sriracha

2 tablespoons of brown sugar

Red pepper flakes to taste

Minced ginger to taste (I use 1 tablespoon)

1. Place all the ingredients in a small saucepan and stir over medium heat until the brown sugar is fully dissolved and the sauce has thickened slightly. Remove from heat and allow it to cool. This sauce is good for up to two weeks stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

If home cooks want to really experiment with Szechuan flavors at home Lydia Chang the chief of business development Q by Peter Chang a Bethesda-based Szechuan restaurant would actually recommend a dry seasoning.

""Mala spice being spicy or five spice which is mild"" Chang said. ""Mala spice uses ingredients such as numbing peppercorn red chili powder chili oil cilantro scallion. The five spice seasoning has white pepper Chinese cinnamon sugar salt mushroom powder and more.""

""If someone likes something saucy Kung Pao is a great pairing and easy to make at home"" she added. ""We typically make Kung Pao sauce with Maggi Chinese vinegar dark soy sugar shaoxing wine white pepper and sugar with chopped peanuts to finish.""

Zack Ren is the marketing manager at New York City's Crop Circle a restaurant that focuses on Szechuan Guokui. He would also encourage home cooks to purchase Red Chili Oil (which like Sriracha deserves a column all its own).

""Red Chili Oil is a universal sauce used in Chinese restaurants and families"" Ren said. ""We use house-made chili and our secret is to pour hot oil over Szechuan crushed chili flakes which stimulates extra aromatics. It has a magical ability to elevate everything. At home I usually have a jar of Lao Gan Ma chili oil in my fridge.""

It's one suggestion which McDonald's has already implemented. Earlier this month many of the company's Chinese locations launched a ""spicy chilli oil ice cream sundae"" which is exactly what it sounds like: vanilla-flavored soft serve doused generously with chilli oil. As Adam Chandler noted once something reaches McDonald's it's already pretty mainstream: In 2018 dessert shops in Sichuan starting posting images of creamy white ice cream flecked with deep red chili oil.

It's a limited-edition menu item that hasn't reached stateside McDonald's but you can make your own version at home. Pull up to the McDonald's drive-thru and order a vanilla soft-serve. Then pull some chili oil out of your purse — I like Fly By Jing's Sichuan Chili Crisp — and give it a drizzle. You won't miss the Szechuan Sauce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNub3Blcy5jb20vZmFjdC1jaGVjay9yZXRyby1tY2RvbmFsZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yes This 'Retro' McDonald's in Oregon Is Real,"Claim: A McDonald's in Oregon hasn't been renovated since the 1980s.

On Jan. 6 2021 a Reddit post about a ""retro"" McDonald's made the website's front page. Its title on the r/mildlyinteresting subreddit read: ""This McDonalds hasn't been renovated since the 80's/90's.""

Photo via u/carbonbasedcat (Reddit)

The post achieved an upvote score of 94% and a whopping 60300 points. For those unfamiliar with Reddit this percentage and number of points meant that it was upvoted tens of thousands of times and was extremely popular.

Reddit user u/carbonbasedcat who created the post told us that the photographs were captured the same day that the Reddit post was made. Social-distancing stickers were visible on the floor and a clear barrier was present at a cash register. Tables and chairs were also chained off. This was all due to safety measures and dine-in restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One Reddit user said: ""The amber colored glass ashtrays is all that’s missing."" Another person asked: ""Is this inside a museum?""

In fact the photographs showed a real McDonald's restaurant located in Beaverton Oregon. The state of Oregon has no shortage of nostalgic tourist stops whether it be filming locations for the 1985 classic ""The Goonies"" or the last Blockbluster video.

The ""retro"" look of the old McDonald's included swivel chair seats and a pink and blue color scheme. The front of the restaurant also had curved atrium windows.

Reddit users commented that perhaps the McDonald's location used to be a Taco Bell Burger King or Wendy's. However McDonald's USA employee Lindsay Kirsh-Rainey told us that McDonald's had operated at 9475 S.W. Beaverton Hillsdale Highway since August 1961. Kirsh-Rainey is the company's field brand reputation manager in the Pacific Northwest.

The month and year of August 1961 placed its opening around two decades after the company was first launched in the 1940s.

Kirsh-Rainey provided more details about the history of the Beaverton restaurant. The Reddit post that claimed the restaurant had a look that appeared to be from the 1980s or 1990s was correct. She confirmed that the lobby and atrium were redone in the mid-1980s. However there have been some changes since that time. She told us that the current owner Don Armstrong bought the restaurant in 2003. Wallpaper and pictures were redone in 2006. As for the exterior of the building ""the old brown roof was removed and replaced with the metal roof around 2010.""

We found one more detail about the history of the building: In 2013 the Portland Tribune reported on a birthday party with around 80 people that occurred at the same McDonald's restaurant. The article mentioned the incorrect opening date but the rest of the story told of a gathering for 95-year-old Ardith Tall:

Living in a nearby neighborhood for decades Tall an accomplished artist and retired employee of Portland’s Emmet Travel School has visited the restaurant every morning for at least the past 10 years. She’s been a regular patron since the restaurant — one of Oregon’s first McDonald’s — first opened in 1963. To reward the Idaho native's longtime loyalty and good humor the restaurant's management — with the encouragement of Tall's friend Cynthia Richards — decided to throw a birthday party with nearly as many guests as years Tall has been on the planet. They provided a birthday cake party favors and a birthday card for Tall containing a $50 ""Arch Card"" for her to use at subsequent visits. ""This is our first big party here"" said Linda Sarrazin a McDonald's swing-shift manager who lives in Aloha. ""Ardith has been coming in for a very long time. We like her great smile her youthfulness. When she said she was turning 95 I said 'No you can’t be 95!' Her personality and her smile it rubs off on everyone."" Commandeering her favorite window seat which was lined with about 15 of her striking nature and scenery paintings Tall enjoyed a breakfast burrito chatted with friends and relatives and accepted gifts throughout the three-hour gathering.

Tall lived two more years. According to Legacy.com she died in 2015. Her favorite window seat still remained in the restaurant in 2021 as did much of the restaurant location's nearly 60 years of history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9rYXlsYXlhbmRvbGkvbWNkb25hbGRzLWVtcGxveWVlLXNlY3JldHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Employee Stories And Secrets,"7.

""When someone orders extra dipping sauce you either push the 'Extra Sauce' button and the sauce they want or just push the normal sauce button. When I worked the drive-thru if a customer was polite and wanted extra sauce I would just enter what sauce they wanted and 'forget' to charge it.

The limited-edition unique dessert was announced last week and is only found on its members-only “creative” menu. Unavailable in Beijing Hebei and Liaoning provinces the Spicy Chili Oil Sundae is free for McDonald’s China members to redeem for free with a coupon on January 25 only.

It is interesting to note that chili oil on ice cream is not really a new concept in China as the fiery pairing went viral on the Internet in the Sichuan region of Chongqing and Chengdu back in 2018.

Officially named the “Youpo Lazi Sundae” the sweet unusual menu item is inspired by Shaanxi Province’s beloved thick spicy youpo noodles. The Spicy Chili Oil Sundae is served in a cup with vanilla soft serve topped generously with a chili crisp infused oil complete with bits of peppers onion garlic and seasonings.

The Spicy Chili Oil Sundae is just the first offering to be revealed from McDonald’s China’s year-long members-only “creative” menu so we can expect more interesting pairings to come.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

(AP) — Online sports betting and casino games will start in Michigan at noon Friday an expansion of options for gamblers who now wager through offshore sites.

State regulators have authorized licenses for all three Detroit casinos and seven of the dozen tribes with “Class III” casinos. Additional operator and platform provider licenses are expected to be approved in coming weeks.

Michigan Gaming Control Board Executive Director Richard Kalm this week called the launch a “new era” saying it will give casinos an additional way to engage with customers and provide state and local governments with extra tax revenue.

Large players in the U.S. mobile gambling market such as DraftKings FanDuel and BetMGM are launching apps and enticing people age 21 and older with deals to sign up. Big sporting events this weekend including the AFC and NFC championship games and a UFC bout featuring start Conor McGregor.

Sports and internet gambling were legalized under a law enacted more than a year ago before the coronavirus pandemic struck. Casinos began accepting in-person sports wagers in March but had to wait for the creation of a licensing system for online operations which have taken on increased significance amid state-ordered shutdowns or capacity restrictions at casinos to curb COVID-19.

“It’s clear to us that there’s incredible demand among Michiganders for at least sports betting. But my expectation is that online casino and in due course poker will be equally popular” said BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt. His company’s app — previously launched in 10 states — is connected to MGM Resorts including the Detroit casino and hotel.

Greenblatt said the state’s 8.4% online sports betting tax is “very sensible” allowing licensed operators to compete with offshore sites.

“You’ve got a group of players who have long been betting offshore. We would like to see them bring their play back on shore” he said. He said there will be minimal if any “cannibalization” of business from players who typically visit casinos but instead will play on the internet.

“We see an expansion of the market — so new players coming in to enjoy our product” Greenblatt said adding that MGM like other casinos will incentivize online gamblers to redeem rewards points by visiting onsite.

Casinos offering online games like blackjack will pay a tax of between 20% and 28% depending on their amount of adjusted gross receipts. Net new annual revenues to the state and Detroit which has commercial casinos are projected to total $18.6 million and $13.7 million respectively according to the Michigan Department of Treasury.

The money will go to the state’s school aid fund which covers public schools. It also will be earmarked to a state fund that compensates first responders for lost wages and medical benefits if they get cancer from fighting fires.

Municipalities with tribal casinos will receive a portion of tax revenues too.

Noting of flurry of internet gambling and sports betting ads in recent weeks state Attorney General Dana Nessel urged potential online gamblers to read the fine print before signing up.

“In some instances site users may be required to spend or deposit a certain amount of money into an account before receiving their free play credits and users should make themselves aware of such conditions so they are not taken off guard” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc3BsYXNobWFncy5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwLzIwMjEvMDEvc3VwZXItYm93bC1sdi1sYXMtdmVnYXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Super Bowl LV Las Vegas – Splash Magazines,"Spread the love

The new SmartIOC 2200 series is a cache-less controller option. For the higher-end Microchip has the SmartROC 3200 series. We should note these are the chips/ controllers not necessarily the actual boards one will purchase to put into servers. As we move into 2021 and more PCIe Gen4 servers this is a technology many will be looking for.

Microchip SmartIOC 2200

The Microchip SmartIOC 2200 is effectively what we would consider more of a low-end RAID/ HBA controller. This can handle SATA III SAS-4 and PCIe Gen4 NVMe with either x8 or x16 lanes to the host CPU and 8-32 lanes for devices.

As a cache-less option this supports RAID 0 1 5 and 10 and is the lower cost option. Still for those wondering how they can get RAID 1/ 10 for boot drives in VMware and Windows this is a good example of how one can get some of that functionality with new PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSDs like the Kioxia CD6-L.

Microchip SmartROC 3200

The MicroChip SmartROC 3200 series is the higher-end unit that supports features such as DDR4-3200 memory as cache. Also with the Microchip Switchtec PCIe switch IP these controllers feature an embedded PCIe switch which helps lower latency for NVMe drives. A concern with NVMe controllers is that adding another bump in the wire means higher latency than NVMe drives directly connected to the CPU.

Like the SmartIOC this also supports SAS-4 which we will start to see roll-out more in 2021. With fast DRAM cache we get access to higher RAID levels that require cache to maintain performance. Aside from the RAID modes these chips can also be used as HBAs which is important since that is how many more modern storage stacks such as Ceph expect to have drives exposed. Much of the work over the past several years has been to remove traditional expensive RAID controllers from hardware stacks while HBAs that do not introduce that logic have become more useful. As such it is important that RAID controllers have HBA modes.

Final Words

With the Intel Ice Lake Xeon‘s final stepping now in production we are pegging a launch in Q2 although we do not know if those new final stepping chips will be ready for launch. Still with Ice Lake Xeons Intel will finally join AMD’s 2019 Rome and 2021 Milan architectures IBM POWER9 and Arm servers such as the Ampere Altra and AWS Graviton2 among others as PCIe Gen4 servers. That will greatly increase the demand for these parts which is why we are seeing announcements now.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Developers Asobo shared a little about the update in a post on the game's site while also noting a slight delay on its originally intended January 26th release.

This massive update contains new aerials new DEM over 70 POIs 5 airports two landing challenges and will also introduce 5 brand-new photogrammetry cities for your enjoyment. Unfortunately these new cities are causing a slight delay… it’s a new process and data source for us and the tools have to be updated for these cities to integrate seamlessly into the sim. The Bing Maps team is working hard to make this happen and the data provider Bluesky is helping as well. We believe that the remaining issues will be resolved within a few days so we are targeting the release one week later than originally planned.

The update also came with a couple more screenshots showing castles Blarney and Windsor.

These are interesting ""points of interest"" but the highlight is surely going to be those mentioned new photogrammetry cities. Photogrammetry is the process by which Flight Simulator builds cities based on satellite imagery creating accurate 3D models with a density that's impractical to recreate by hand. Previous updates have introduced similar revamps to Japan and the United States with great results but Flight Sim is at its best when you're exploring places you've been in real life. We know one of the cities they're revamping is London so I'm assuming the other four are Glasgow Edinburgh Kirkcaldy and Hamilton.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20veW91ci1taWNyb3NvZnQtYWNjb3VudC10aGluZ3Mtd2luZG93cy11c2VyLXNob3VsZC1rbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your Microsoft Account: 5 Things Every Windows User Should Know,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20veW91ci1taWNyb3NvZnQtYWNjb3VudC10aGluZ3Mtd2luZG93cy11c2VyLXNob3VsZC1rbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhdWx0YXNzaS8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L3doYXQtd2FzLW1pY3Jvc29mdC10cnlpbmctdG8tcHVsbC13aXRoLWl0cy1pbnN0YS1raWxsZWQteGJveC1saXZlLWdvbGQtcHJpY2UtaGlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Was Microsoft Trying To Pull With Its Insta-Killed Xbox Live Gold Price Hike?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/01/24/what-was-microsoft-trying-to-pull-with-its-insta-killed-xbox-live-gold-price-hike/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3BhdWx0YXNzaS8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L3doYXQtd2FzLW1pY3Jvc29mdC10cnlpbmctdG8tcHVsbC13aXRoLWl0cy1pbnN0YS1raWxsZWQteGJveC1saXZlLWdvbGQtcHJpY2UtaGlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2ZW50aHVicy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2phbi8yMy9taWNyb3NvZnQteGJveC1nb2xkLXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft announces big hike in Xbox Live Gold prices before quickly reversing course following internet backlash,"Now you'll be able to play free-to-play games without Gold now too

Microsoft essentially set the stage for paying to play console games online in the Xbox 360 generation and the company was eyeing a move to increase that toll much higher than ever before.

The massive corporation announced yesterday that Xbox Live Gold memberships would be doubling in price for a year's worth of time but that decision didn't even last a day.

This proposed hike would have seen a 12-month membership go from $60 USD to $120 with 1-month increasing by $1 and $5 for three months.

A move like that of course quickly caught the attention and the ire of the online gaming community that is already probably feeling a bit stretched thin between subscriptions games and trying to acquire the new consoles.

Many pointed out that this would make Xbox Live twice as expensive as its closest competitor in PlayStation Plus while others threatened to leave Xbox behind and move to the PlayStation 5 or PC.

Microsoft bowed to the mounting pressure and released a new statement saying they had ""messed up"" and consumers were ""right to let us know.""

Prices will now be staying the same across the board with an added ""perk"" for those who don't want to pay anything for a few select titles.

Today was not great. We always try to do our best for you and today we missed the mark.



We hear you and we’re reversing our Xbox Live Gold pricing updates. — Xbox (@Xbox) January 23 2021

Free-to-play games will no longer require a Xbox Live Gold membership to play online which is something that Sony has been doing for some time already.

Why Microsoft would choose to hike up the prices now isn't really known but it's easy to speculate that perhaps they wanted to make Xbox Game Pass more enticing to the wider audience.

In this shot down model Game Pass Ultimate would have only cost users $18 more than just Xbox Live since new users would get the first three months for $1 — at full price one year is $180.

Xbox has been playing catch up for the past seven years since the PS4 became one of the best-selling consoles of all time which forced the company to try new initiatives to try and make the Xbox Series X|S more enticing.

The latest consoles are now backwards compatible with pretty much everything from the past Xbox consoles while also introducing Game Pass as an easy way to play any Microsoft first party title.

Their more recent moves have come via acquiring big studios like Bethesda and Obsidian though we don't really know how much of an impact its had between the PS5 and XSX.

It's certainly not the first time they've chased this tactic either considering they once tried to buy Nintendo but were essentially laughed out of the room.

You can read Microsoft's full apology statement below.

Microsoft's reversal decision on Xbox Live price hike

We messed up today and you were right to let us know. Connecting and playing with friends is a vital part of gaming and we failed to meet the expectations of players who count on it every day. As a result we have decided not to change Xbox Live Gold pricing.

We’re turning this moment into an opportunity to bring Xbox Live more in line with how we see the player at the center of their experience. For free-to-play games you will no longer need an Xbox Live Gold membership to play those games on Xbox. We are working hard to deliver this change as soon as possible in the coming months.

If you are an Xbox Live Gold member already you stay at your current price for renewal. New and existing members can continue to enjoy Xbox Live Gold for the same prices they pay today. In the U.S. $9.99 for 1-month $24.99 for 3-months $39.99 for 6-months and $59.99 for retail 12-months.

Thank you.

The reasoning is mostly around the Surface's dual tablet/laptop nature and the use of Windows which makes sense since this was the niche the Surface Pro line popularised after the release of Windows 8. We can't deny that the inclusion of a touch screen and pen input adds value to how users interact with the device. There is also logic in the argument that the Surface Pro 7 can ""run your favourite apps"" since the x86 processor and Windows OS gives access to a vast library of modern and legacy software.



Where the advert veers off into murky territory is the claim that it's a much better gaming device presumably because of the massive catalogue of Windows games. This is also where the point Microsoft is making starts to fall apart too. Yes the Surface Pro 7 has enough power to play older or lighter games but its CPU and GPU performance is outclassed by the ARM-powered MacBook Pro 13 against which Microsoft is comparing it.



This gets us wondering whether Microsoft is even making the right comparison. The recent price drop shows that Microsoft is focusing on selling the Surface Pro 7 right now but can they rightly compare a laptop to a 2-in-1 and then penalise the laptop for not having tablet features? We can't help but think that Microsoft is avoiding the iPad Air 4 or iPad Pro 2020 with Magic Keyboard because they share characteristics such as the touchscreen and pen/pencil input. The iPad is also an arguably better tablet gaming experience as long as you aren't trying to play the latest console/PC releases. The Surface Pro 7 and the iPad Pro are both creators devices so Microsoft would have only had the operating system to promote as the main point of difference.



Perhaps the Surface Laptop 3 would have been a more appropriate comparison.

Between Dec. 21 and Jan. 10 more than 4.04 million people were given Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine but only 10 developed a serious potentially life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. That works out to be around 2.5 cases of anaphylaxis per 1 million people vaccinated according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .

It's not yet clear what's causing the severe allergies but nine out of 10 of these cases occurred among patients with previously known allergies (five previously had anaphylaxis). Most had

allergies to various medicines such as penicillin  but one had environmental and food allergies and another didn't have any prior known allergies according to the report.

Nine out of 10 of the patients developed symptoms — such as vomiting nausea wheezing tongue swelling and rash — within 13 minutes of getting the vaccine and one developed symptoms within 45 minutes.

All 10 patients were treated with epinephrine — a hormone also known as adrenaline that is the key ingredient in EpiPens and similar autoinjectors; four were treated in an emergency department and six were hospitalized with four requiring intubation. But all 10 patients recovered according to the report.

""Based on this early monitoring anaphylaxis after receipt of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine appears to be a rare event"" the authors wrote in the report. But because there's not yet widespread data on COVID-19 vaccines it's difficult to compare the risk of anaphylaxis with non-COVID-19 vaccines they wrote. In a previous Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report  published on Jan. 15 researchers estimated that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine causes anaphylaxis in about 11.1 cases per million doses (0.001% chance); that estimate was based on early data.

Still both the anaphylaxis associated with both Pfizer's and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines seems to be above the average number of anaphylaxis cases found for previous vaccines. In 2015 researchers calculated that the chance of developing a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine is about 1.31 in 1 million according to a 2015 study published in the Journal of Allergy Clinical Immunology . ""True allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare"" Dr. Purvi Parikh allergist and immunologist at NYU Langone Health previously told Live Science . ""Statistically you're more likely to be hit by lightning than have a true anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine."" Though the cases are extremely rare — and should not dissuade people from getting the vaccine — experts are working on identifying what could be causing the allergies.

People who have had an allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine should not receive the second dose the authors wrote. Vaccine centers should have all the necessary supplies and trained staff to treat anaphylaxis they wrote. The CDC also recommends that people who receive COVID-19 vaccines should also be monitored for about 15 minutes or 30 minutes if they have a history of allergies or anaphylaxis.

Amid growing reports of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines regulators are warning people with a history of such reactions to take precautions before they get their shots.

Experts say the number one suspect for these reactions is an ingredient commonly found in cosmetics other medicine and laxatives called polyethylene glycol or PEG. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the reactions are still rare and investigations are ongoing.

The ingredient in question is used to stabilize current COVID-19 vaccines. But PEG has caused anaphylaxis severe allergic reactions in the past said Ayrn O'Connor a Banner Health physician.

""It's pervasive"" O'Connor said. ""Because it's a common ingredient ... that's the one that's the most suspicious but we don't have 100% confirmation.""

PEG is in both Pfizer's and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines which are currently the only ones with emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.

The rate of severe allergic reactions to the vaccines so far is a little higher than that of past vaccines though that number could change in coming weeks.

The rate at about 11 cases for every 1 million patients is still well below 1% and means the vaccine is considered safe O'Connor said.

Most of the other ingredients in the vaccine some as common as table salt and sugar are also found in a variety of other medications foods or vaccines.

Another possible culprit behind anaphylaxis could be ingredients called lipids. Lipids don't dissolve in water and can include fats waxes and oils. Certain lipids are sometimes used as ingredients in vitamin supplements to help the body absorb the nutrients.

Rick Kennedy co-director of the Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group describes lipids as drops of oil that encase the mRNA or genetic material inside both vaccines. They protect the mRNA and help it slip through a cell membrane into a cell.

PEG is one type of lipid but both vaccines also contain others. And while ingredients like sugar and salt are commonly found in other vaccines lipids are not and experience using them may be limited.

""These lipids their purpose is really to get the mRNA into a cell and we've never had mRNA vaccines"" Kennedy said. ""It's unlikely that anybody's allergic to the salts or the sugars but it could be any of these other lipids.""

Most people won't have reactions to these lipids but they may experience some side effects to the vaccine. Commonly reported side effects such as fatigue muscle aches or fever are not usually signs of an allergic reaction according to medical experts but are actually signs the immune system is fighting off the novel coronavirus and the vaccine is working.

Risk factors for severe allergic reaction

If people have had allergic reactions to other vaccines in the past health care experts recommend they talk with a doctor before getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

""It doesn't mean that they can't have it"" O'Connor said. ""It means that they should probably have precautions taken.""

When someone has a severe allergic reaction it is often linked to a type of antibody made by the immune system called an IgE antibody according to Miriam Anand an allergist and president-elect of the Arizona Medical Association.

The first time the immune system encounters something foreign it learns how to fight it using different types of antibodies. But if it creates too many IgE antibodies it can cause an immune system overreaction.

IgE antibodies are usually found in low levels in the blood and can have powerful downstream effects. They can trigger other types of immune cells that act as ""bombers"" against a foreign substance. One example is a mast cell which Kennedy described as ""chock full of cytokines"" or proteins that can trigger inflammation.

Allergic inflammatory responses can cause rashes swelling hives and discomfort. But in severe cases these immune system overreactions can cause blood pressure to drop systemic inflammation throat swelling and other life-threatening symptoms.

Since PEG is a fairly large molecule Kennedy said the immune system can recognize it and create antibodies against it further strengthening suspicion that PEG could be the problematic ingredient in COVID-19 vaccines.

If someone has had a past reaction to PEG they're likely to react to PEG again in the future. The same rule applies to molecules that aren't PEG but that look similar.

One type of molecule that looks similar are polysorbates oily liquids often found in pharmaceutical products cosmetics and foods such as ice cream. Anand said many vaccines such as the seasonal influenza vaccine contain polysorbates.

""So if they already had an anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine that contained polysorbates that means they're already making antibodies against that and therefore they could be at higher risk"" Anand said.

People with a history of reactions to medications or vaccines should review COVID-19 vaccine ingredients with an allergist or doctor to determine their risks she added.

Allergists can test directly for ingredient reactions by pricking a patient's skin with the vaccine itself or with certain ingredients to see if hives form. It's hard to test with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine due to short supply and cold storage requirements but Anand said doctors could test laxatives containing PEG on a patient's skin to check for allergies.

People with a history of food or seasonal allergies are still considered to be at low-risk for an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine Anand said.

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines don't contain other ingredients that can cause allergic reactions such as eggs gelatin or latex but it's still unclear what ingredients will be in future COVID-19 vaccines currently under development by companies like Johnson & Johnson and Novavax. The AstraZeneca vaccine does contain polysorbate.

Younger patients may be more likely to experience anaphylaxis. The average age of those who have experienced severe allergic reactions so far is 40 according to a recent report by the CDC. This is because they have stronger more robust immune systems O'Connor said and means younger patients are more likely to experience non-allergic side effects as well.

mRNA causes common side effects.

All vaccines work by stimulating the immune system and training it to recognize and fight a particular substance again in the future. There are two stages of an immune system response: the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response.

The innate immune response is the body's immediate reaction when it recognizes something foreign. Certain receptors on cells can spot common structural patterns found in bacterias and viruses which is what triggers the innate immune response.

As part of its innate response the immune system uses cytokines to trigger inflammation raise body temperature or cause blood to leak more easily out of blood vessels.

Typically these are good responses because they help fight foreign substances but it's important not to over-stimulate the innate immune system response. The risk Kennedy said is more severe side effects.

In the case of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines the body recognizes mRNA as foreign. mRNA is the active ingredient in the vaccine and gives cells a blueprint to make the spikes on the outside of the virus. The virus uses the spikes to enter and infect cells and immune system antibodies neutralize the virus by binding to the spikes.

Kennedy said the mRNA in the vaccines has been slightly modified probably ""so that it does not provoke an immediate innate immune response.""

The body then has more time to learn what the spikes on the virus look like and can mount a better immune response in the future. Otherwise the body might destroy the mRNA before creating long-lasting antibodies for the spike.

Kennedy said the modifications likely helped blunt side effects from that innate response to avoid immune system overreactions as well.

Typically side effects from the first COVID-19 vaccine shot are minimal most commonly including a sore arm but after the second shot when the body is exposed to even more mRNA and spikes it mounts a stronger innate response.

Side effects usually kick in about 12 hours after the shot according to O'Connor but fade within 24 to 36 hours. The side effects are usually mild and transient.

A sore arm at the injection site is the most common side effect from the vaccines. Symptoms of either headaches or fatigue occur in roughly half of patients body aches are less common and fewer than 14 percent of vaccine recipients experience fever according to O'Connor.

""It’s a sign the immune system is doing what it’s supposed to do mounting a response"" she said.

A lack of side effects doesn't mean the innate immune response isn't working and why some people show reactions and some don't is still a mystery.

The stronger a person's innate immune response is the stronger their adaptive or long term immune response will be. Adaptive immune responses use specialized cells and antibodies trained to target specific substances — in this case the novel coronavirus spikes.

But training these cells and antibodies can take longer meaning the lasting COVID-19 protection provided by the adaptive immune response doesn't kick in right away. That's why full protection from the COVID-19 vaccines doesn't start until about one or two weeks after receiving the second booster shot.

Vaccine unlikely to have long term effects

Some people are concerned about COVID-19 vaccines due to their fast-paced development but experts say they aren't worried. The vaccine safety data looks good ingredients in the vaccines are commonly found in other medications or food and long-term vaccine side effects are rare.

""Vaccines ... have the greatest safety track record of any medical intervention in the history of medicine"" O'Connor said. ""They are the safest therapeutic option of any medication out there.""

The mRNA doesn't last long in the body and is typically destroyed within minutes or hours Kennedy said so he believes that there should be no long term vaccine side effects.

Though health care professionals didn't see any reasons to be worried about long term side effects they acknowledged it's not possible to be absolutely certain at this point which is why experts are continuously tracking vaccine data.

The other unclear aspect is how long protection against COVID-19 will last. Health care professionals said patients who have already had COVID-19 should still get vaccinated because there's a possibility they could get reinfected. Reinfections are rare but the immune protection against COVID-19 may wane over time.

O'Connor cautioned that patients should ensure they are no longer actively sick with COVID-19 before getting vaccinated.

""Our immune system is already pretty busy and we don't want to overload it"" she said.

She recommended that anyone with an active or recent COVID-19 infection and those with long lasting symptoms should talk with their doctors.

Once vaccinated patients should continue to take public health precautions like wearing a mask and staying six feet apart because there's no data yet on whether vaccines can prevent a person from spreading the virus to others.

This will likely be less of an issue once a population reaches herd immunity which is established once enough people have been vaccinated. Even with side effects and allergic responses O'Connor believes the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks.

""“I hope it’s the beginning of the end of the pandemic but we all have to get vaccinated"" she said. ""You couldn’t get a shot in my arm fast enough.”

Two weeks after receiving the Moderna vaccine Antonietta Pollice was given a dose of the Pfizer-Bio-NTech vaccine said her daughter Patrizia Di Biase.

Pollice who has dementia did not understand what vaccine she was receiving Di Biase said. The mix-up has left the daughter livid.

""Shocked. I was upset"" she said. ""How can that happen? 'Mistakes happen' well it's not a small mistake.""

Di Biase said Pollice received a dose of the Moderna vaccine on Jan. 7 at CHSLD Herron.

With the owners of the private seniors' home deciding to close the facility Pollice was transferred temporarily to CHSLD Joseph-François-Perrault on Jan. 11.

Di Biase said staff at the CHSLD called her on Friday to inform her that Pollice had accidentally been given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

She says she was in shock and had staff repeat the information twice before she hung up because she couldn't process the news.

""It's unacceptable. They have to do something about it"" Di Biase said.

""I don't want this to happen again. It's happened now we can't go back for my mom but we need to go forward and have everybody know.""

Pollice's family is concerned about how receiving vaccine doses from both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will impact her. Public health experts say there is not enough data to know for sure but the family should not panic. (Submitted by Patrizia Di Biase)

Quebec Premier François Legault made the decision earlier this month to delay all second doses of the vaccine in favour of inoculating more people with a first dose instead. The government has said that everyone who received the first dose so far will get the second after 90 days.

Di Biase said she has reached out to Quebec Public Health seeking answers.

A spokesperson for the regional health authority in charge of CHSLD Joseph-François-Perrault said the situation has been brought to its attention and it is currently investigating.

The CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Île-de-Montréal wouldn't give further details citing confidentiality.

But spokesperson Valérie Lafleur said that if this happened a rigorous review would be put in place involving the medical team public health and a team from infection prevention and control.

Mixing COVID-19 vaccines

Most concerning to Di Biase is the effect of inoculating her mother with two different vaccines.

The Public Health Agency of Canada says Canadians should receive the same COVID-19 vaccine for both shots — except in very specific and unlikely situations.

According to the public health agency's recommendations on the use of the vaccine ""no data exist on the interchangeability of COVID-19 vaccines.""

Both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Public Health England share those same recommendations.

Infectious disease specialist and microbiologist Dr. Donald Vinh who is also an adviser to the federal government's COVID-19 task force said each individual's situation is different but that the jury is still out on mixing vaccines.

""The short answer is that we don't know anything"" he said.

""There is no data to determine whether or not that's efficacious. There is simply an experience or more of a gut feeling among people who have vaccine and immunology experience that it is probably acceptable to use different mRNA-based vaccines.""

WATCH | Montreal woman says vaccine mix-up 'not a small mistake':

Montreal woman 'shocked' to learn her mother received doses of 2 different vaccines Duration 2:03 Two weeks after receiving the Moderna vaccine Antonietta Pollice was given a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine said her daughter Patrizia Di Biase. Pollice who has dementia did not understand what vaccine she was receiving Di Biase said.

Jörg Fritz an associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at McGill University in Montreal agrees.

Still despite the lack of data he said mixing the two vaccines should not be immediate cause for alarm.

""I wouldn't be too worried because both vaccines were approved they went through rigorous testing"" Fritz said.

""It shouldn't happen a mix-up like that but I don't think it'll have any negative consequences. There is no scientific reason to believe there are any negative consequences.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljd29ybGQuY29tL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvdXMvbW9kZXJuYXMtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS1yYXJlbHktdHJpZ2dlcnMtYWxsZXJnaWMtcmVhY3Rpb25zLWZpbmRzLXVzLXN0dWR5L9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljd29ybGQuY29tL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvdXMvbW9kZXJuYXMtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS1yYXJlbHktdHJpZ2dlcnMtYWxsZXJnaWMtcmVhY3Rpb25zLWZpbmRzLXVzLXN0dWR5Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine rarely triggers allergic reactions finds US study,"Advertisement

A study conducted in the United States has found that severe allergic reactions are rare among recipients of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention only 10 cases of severe allergic reactions were detected in Moderna COVID-19 vaccine recipients after more than 4 million received the first shot between December 21 and January 10. The CDC said only 10 cases of anaphylaxis were detected in recipients which is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination. Meanwhile zero deaths were reported among Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine recipients. CDC said that nine out of the 10 allergic reactions were reported immediately after the vaccine was administered within 15 minutes of inoculation.

Moderna received an emergency use authorisation certificate for its COVID-19 vaccine from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 18. The vaccine is a two-dose drug that requires to be administered 28 days apart from one another. As of January 10 the US government had inoculated more than 4 million first doses across the country. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) received 1266 reports of adverse events after receipt of the Moderna vaccine of which 108 were identified for further review as possible cases of a severe allergic reaction including anaphylaxis. According to the CDC only 10 cases were identified as anaphylaxis among the 108 cases of possible severe reactions reported by VAERS. Among these 10 cases nine persons had a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions five of whom had a previous history of anaphylaxis.

US CDC changes guidelines

The US CDC recently changed its vaccination guidelines allowing authorities to administer the second dose 42 days after the first jab which it had earlier refused to tweak citing a lack of data regarding the same. ""The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be scheduled for administration up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose"" CDC said. The United States is the world affected nation with more than 24 million COVID-19 cases and over 400000 deaths. As of January 23 the US has administered over 19 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines which is the most in the world.

Also the overall sentiment got a boost after new president Joe Biden took office.

The resurgence of coronavirus cases and the deepening economic uncertainty continue to take a toll on the US labor market. Last week jobless claims stayed elevated around 900000 but it was slightly below economists’ prediction. The dismal employment scenario and continuing lay-offs show that the new president has a tough task at hand.

On the M&A front tech firms Lumentum Holdings and Coherent Inc. agreed for a merger last week. The $5.7-billion deal is expected to create one of the largest photonics and laser companies in the world. Elsewhere Boston Scientific signed a pact to acquire privately-held mobile health solutions company Preventive Solutions. In another tech buyout Cognizant agreed to acquire software company Magnetic Solutions to strengthen its digital engineering capabilities.

Some of the major Wall Street firms reported earnings this week which was shortened by the holiday with Bank of America Goldman Sachs and Netflix reporting their results on Tuesday. UnitedHealth Group and Morgan Stanley were the important company’s that published earnings on Wednesday while Intel and IBM reported on the next day.

Wall Street is headed into a busy earnings week with the likes of Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson preparing for their quarterly announcements on January 26. Apple’s first-quarter report a much-awaited event is expected on January 27. On the same day AT&T and Facebook will be unveiling their latest numbers. Airlines companies like JetBlue Southwest and American will dominate the earnings scene on January 28.

Pepsi,"Comb through the annual reports of Coca-Cola and Pepsi and you will see the two rivals list one another as their main competition. White both are giants in the beverage field there is one key difference which could be the reason to pick one over the other.

About Coca-Cola: Sparkling soft drink brands for Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) include Coca-Cola Diet Coke Sprite and Fanta. The company also has a growing portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks that includes Powerade Vitaminwater Minute Maid Costa Coffee Fuse and Gold Peak.

Coca-Cola also owns a stake in energy drink maker Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and helps distribute the brand. The company owns a stake in growing sports drink company BodyArmor.

Sparkling soft drinks made up 69% of unit case volume for Coca-Cola in fiscal 2019. The company’s portfolio includes four of the top five non-alcoholic sparkling beverages with Coke Diet Coke Fanta and Sprite.

About Pepsi: Sparkling soft drink brands for PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: PEP) include Pepsi Diet Pepsi Mountain Dew and Mug Root Beer. The company’s portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks includes Gatorade bubbly Pure Leaf and Tropicana.

The Key Difference: The big difference between the two beverage giants is the huge portfolio of food brands owned by PepsiCo.

Under its Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats divisions Pepsi owns brands like Lay’s Doritos Quaker Oats Sabra Cheetos Fritos Tostitos Cap’N Crunch and Aunt Jemima.

Pepsi got 54% of its revenue from food in fiscal 2019 making its beverage division the smaller segment. The Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods North America segments made up 25% and 4% of overall fiscal 2019 revenue respectively.

Frito-Lay North America made up 45% of the operating profit for PepsiCo in fiscal 2019. This high margin segment has been a key to the financial success of the company over the years.

Stock Action: Shares of Coca-Cola have fallen 14% over the last year. The stock is up 18% in the last five years and up 56% in the last 10 years.

Shares of Pepsi are down 2% over the last year. Shares are up 48% over the last five years and up 112% over the last 10 years.

What’s Next: Coca-Cola has made several acquisitions over the years to grow its non-sparkling soft drink segment. This could be a continued focus by the company.

Coca-Cola is also phasing out underperforming brands like Zico and Tab. A national launch of the company’s Topo Chico hard seltzer is happening in the first half of 2021 with distribution partner Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE: TAP).

Pepsi has been acquiring food brands to boost its more profitable business segment. Acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery will help strengthen the company in Africa and China respectively.

Benzinga's Take: Coca-Cola has a strong brand and international presence. The company has the higher dividend yield of the two beverage giants.

But the growing food portfolio of PepsiCo and the consecutive years of revenue growth could make the food and beverage giant the winner in this battle.

Something went wrong please try again later.

With pubs and bars still closed for the forseeable many people in the UK are looking for ways to replicate the Wetherspoons experience at home.

But trying to make some of the nation's favourite drinks hasn't been as easy as we thought - until now that is.

One woman posting under the username @youlikejazzzzz on TikTok has been so kind as to share a number of Wetherspoon's most iconic cocktails recipes including Purple Rain Ginberry Fizz Blue Lagoon and Ultra Violet.

To make the Purple Rain pitcher she says to fill a jug three-quarters of the way with ice then add 50ml of cherry Sourz 50ml Blue Curaçao before topping it off with enough lemonade to cover the ice and mixing.

According to a fellow Spoons employee the only ingredients she forgot to add were fruit and lime but other viewers said she needed to add vodka too.

To make the Blue Lagoon cocktail fill a jug with plenty of ice add 50ml Smirnoff vodka 50ml Blue Curaçao two dashes of lime cordial then top with lemonade.

Spoons' Blue Lagoon pitcher was highly requested by viewers after her Purple Rain recipe received more than 2 million views.

To make Ginberry Fizz fill your jug three-quarters of the way with ice add 50ml Chambord 50ml of pink gin and top with lemonade.

As for the chain's Ultra Violet inspired pitcher she suggests adding 100ml parma violet gin and two cans of Monster Ultra energy drink to a jug filled three-quarters of the way with ice.

For the real deal apparently Spoons employees use smaller cans of Monster than the ones she used they also claim to use the sweet violet gin by Zymurgorium - which gives it that light purple colour - and also top the drink with lemonade.

The recipes have gone down a storm with TikTok viewers with thousands of people praising her in the comments.

One said: ""YOU'RE A GODSEND I've missed this drink so much!""

Another said: ""As someone who works for Spoons this isn't that bad.""

""You've just completed my life"" wrote a third.

People in the comments begged her to make more cocktails such as a Godfather Mango Monster Mash Long Island Ice Tea and a Very Cherry.",,,,,,,,,

Gone are the bewildering days of the Coronavirus Pandemic when executives’ salaries and bonuses felt the shocking tinge of the ensuing economic downtown. Now a number of American companies including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase acknowledge that stressed-out executives cannot reinstate the business to its pre-Pandemic glory days for partial pay.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman’s pay in 2020 was $33 million for steering the Wall Street firm without axing jobs despite the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Gorman’s salary is a phenomenal 22% raise for a year in which the investment bank generated record revenue announced two megabillion dollar acquisitions and successfully avoided one of the worst pandemic-led recession.

James Gorman gets 22% salary raise in 2020

Here’s how much James Gorman made in total compensation during fiscal year 2020 according to a securities filing on Friday. James Gorman’s salary ($33 million) is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a deferred equity award of $7.875 million; a cash bonus of $7.845 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $15.75 million.

Two-thirds of Gorman’s stock award is tied to how well he steers through the pandemic-recession over the next few years.

The Morgan Stanley executive was paid $27 million for his work in 2019.

Morgan Stanley’s directors based Gorman’s pay raise on the investment firm’s record financial performance in 2020 and Gorman’s progress in implementing the bank’s long-term strategy it said.

Bank’s profit crushes pandemic gloom

Under his leadership Morgan Stanley produced full-year net revenue of $48.2 billion compared with $41.4 billion a year ago. It largely benefited from the market’s swift recovery from the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

“The firm produced a very strong quarter and record full-year results with excellent performance across all three businesses and geographies” CEO James Gorman said in a statement adding that the bank’s long-term strategy with the acquisitions of E*Trade and Eaton Vance “serve us well.

Unlike other American banks Morgan Stanley was an active name in M&A activity throughout the year. Gorman negotiated two back-to-back deals to acquire E*Trade Financial Corp. and Eaton Vance Corp. strengthening the firm’s presence in retail stock trading and investment management respectively.

Early in 2020 the bank announced it would buy E*Trade for $13 billion launching Morgan Stanley into the low-cost brokerage space and adding 5 million new customers. This was the largest acquisition deal made by a bank since the financial crisis.

In October Gorman announced a $7 billion acquisition of Eaton Vance making Morgan Stanley one of the world’s biggest asset managers almost doubling its assets under management to an astounding $1.2 trillion.

Shares of Morgan Stanley rose by 34% in 2020 and are up another 8% so far in 2021 outpacing the S&P 500 Index on both counts.

James Gorman’s salary in 2020 was $1.5 million more than that of rival JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon who has been the highest-paid bank executive for past several years.

In fact the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 120.4%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way.

A Big Run: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has had a bumpy ride since 2016. But despite lots of struggles along the way Intel investors have gotten some decent overall returns.

The rise of smartphones online gaming cloud computing cryptocurrency and other innovations created a boom in semiconductor demand over the past decade. Unfortunately for Intel innovation missteps and production delays led to missed opportunities for company in the past five years.

Throughout 2018 and 2019 Intel was unable to produce enough CPUs to supply its customers essentially turning over market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and others for free. In 2020 Intel said chip manufacturing issues would once again be delaying production of its 7-nanometer chips and the company may be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers for the first time.

At the beginning of 2016 Intel shares were trading at around $34. The stock hit its low point of the past five years in mid-2016 dipping down to $24.87.

From that point the stock steadily churned higher over the next several years reaching $50 in early 2018 and $60 for the first time in early 2020.

Intel In 2021 Beyond: Intel peaked at $59.29 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic sell-off which pushed the stock back down to $43.63 in March. Intel revisited its 2020 lows again in late October but skyrocketed back up to above $57 per share in January after the company announced a new CEO Pat Gelsinger.

Investors who had no knowledge of the massive gains from semiconductor peers like AMD in the past five years would be fairly satisfied with their Intel returns.

Intel investors that bought and held on through a volatile five-year period turned a significant profit. In fact $1000 worth of Intel stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $2408 today assuming reinvested dividends.

Looking ahead analysts expect Intel to grind higher in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 33 analysts covering the stock is $60 suggesting only 4.5% upside from current levels.

Also the overall sentiment got a boost after new president Joe Biden took office.

The resurgence of coronavirus cases and the deepening economic uncertainty continue to take a toll on the US labor market. Last week jobless claims stayed elevated around 900000 but it was slightly below economists’ prediction. The dismal employment scenario and continuing lay-offs show that the new president has a tough task at hand.

On the M&A front tech firms Lumentum Holdings and Coherent Inc. agreed for a merger last week. The $5.7-billion deal is expected to create one of the largest photonics and laser companies in the world.

The stock is up 176% since its late-September market debut.

Palantir came to market with a reputation for technological prowess and some well-regarded backers and investors are understandably excited about the company's prospects. But at this point it would be natural to question whether the share price has gotten ahead of the business projections.

What's an investor to think about Palantir shares today? Here's a look at the company and whether the stock is overvalued right now.

A history of success

Palantir is a data analytics company that has served U.S. government customers -- and in particular its clandestine spy agencies -- for nearly two decades. The company was co-founded by Peter Thiel the sometimes controversial venture capitalist best known as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in both Facebook and LinkedIn. Thiel is now chairman of Palantir's board but has no day-to-day role at the company.

Until it prepared to go public last year Palantir was mostly shrouded in secrecy. But its exploits are the stuff of Silicon Valley legend including its well-reported (but never officially confirmed) role in finding Osama bin Laden.

Today it works with a large number of military and civilian federal agencies as well as a growing roster of commercial customers. In 2020 an unnamed aerospace customer signed the largest commercial deal in Palantir's history -- a five-year $300 million contract. It also has made inroads into the pharmaceutical and logistics industries among others.

A tale of two valuations

Palantir has not yet released full-year results but the company said in November that it expects to generate $1.07 billion to $1.072 billion in revenue in 2020. Assuming that forecast bears out the market is currently valuing the company at about 45 times sales.

Is that too high? It depends on what measuring stick you use. If you compare its valuation to other IT-focused government contractors such as Booz Allen Hamilton ManTech International and Leidos Holdings Palantir looks way overvalued.

None of those companies have exactly comparable tech to Palantir but arguably Palantir doesn't have anything near their breadth of technology or diversity of revenue sources.

Palantir bulls would argue that the company's growing commercial business justifies a higher multiple. Indeed software companies that sell to the commercial sector rather than to governments tend to attract higher valuations because they can attract a wider range of customers and don't face the same budget scrutiny.

Palantir's valuation looks more reasonable when compared to two commercial database specialists MongoDB and Datadog. But it is worth noting that for much of Palantir's history it has relied heavily on government sales and in its third-quarter release said that the U.S. government sector ""remains a primary area of focus for our business.""

Indeed prior to going public Palantir was perhaps best known for its controversial contracts with various intelligence agencies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement work that it has defended despite a great deal of scrutiny.

So is Palantir overvalued?

It may be too simplistic to categorize Palantir as just a defense contractor but it would also be wrong to dismiss the connection. Government customers provided 56% of its total revenue in the third quarter and the government business grew nearly twice as much in the quarter on a year-over-year basis as its commercial business.

Among defense IT companies Palantir has technology and expertise that few can match but its tech is arguably more specialized and tougher to sell to a broader set of customers. The company has been around since 2003 and although its growth has accelerated in recent years it took it until 2020 to hit $1 billion in annual sales.

Palantir has amazing and unique tech and has the potential to grow into a much larger business. But given the pace of government contracting and the slow rollout of its commercial offerings it will take years for Palantir's business to justify its current lofty multiple.

The stock is overvalued right now. For those interested in Palantir best to leave it on your watch list in anticipation of better opportunities to buy in over the months to come.

This acronym is used by traders to refer to stocks of seven of the biggest tech companies in the world.

The combined market capitalization of these stocks is about $7.9 trillion which is roughly 25% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 companies. To put things in perspective the combined market cap of these seven stocks is more than the GDP of Japan Germany or India which are the third fourth and fifth largest economies of the world respectively.

The Constituents

The stocks in the FANGMAN group are:

Facebook Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB)

Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX)

Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)

Buoying S&P 500 Performance: 2020 was a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to economic contraction worldwide due to disruptions to businesses and other activities. The stock market given its forward-looking approach weathered the setback and ended the year with gains.

For instance the S&P 500 Index ended 2020 at a record high and in the process generated a return of 16.2% for the year. The FANGMAN stocks played a big role int that as they outperformed the broader gauge:

Facebook: 33%

Amazon: 76.3%

Netflix: 67.1%

Alphabet: 30.9%

Microsoft: 42.5%

Apple: 82.3%

Nvidia: 129.3%

FANGMAN A Predictor of Stock Market Moves? Given the outsized weighting in different indices it is logical to view FANGMAN stocks as a good predictor of which way the broader market is headed.

FANGMAN Invariably Outperforms Market: For those investors who are looking for above-market returns or ""high-alpha"" stocks FANGMAN could be the better bet. These stocks outperform the broader market thanks to their transformational business models high growth and financial might among other things.

FANGMAN In Bubble Territory? From the perspective of topline growth earnings potential and prospects it is evident that the lofty valuations are justified. Higher P/E multiples of some of these stocks imply investors are willing to pay a premium to partake in their growth.

Investors see them as compelling as they are most levered to the digital transformation that is picking up pace.

But the stretched valuations of these stocks could conjure up fears of a deep correction.

One of the biggest risks faced by these companies is regulatory scrutiny. Analysts see the changing of the guard at the White House as a slight negative for these high-flying names.

Story continues

""To be blunt it's a clear negative for Big Tech as ultimately with a Senate now likely controlled by Democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around FAANG names with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a Jan. 6 note.

That said the analyst remains bullish on tech stocks for 2021 but sees the tech rally will be more tame until the Street gets a better sense of the legislative agenda under President Joe Biden.

Then You'll Love These 3 Dividend Stocks,"It's easy to love a sector when it returns 14 times the market. That's exactly what happened in 2020 when the average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEMKT: TAN) surged over 230% compared to the market's 16% return. However many of the pure-play solar stocks responsible for the ETF's meteoric rise are now trading at high valuations -- making now the perfect time to think outside the box.

We asked some of our contributors for their best solar stocks to buy now. They identified three dividend stocks: utility giant NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) copper mining kingpin Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE: SCCO) and renewable energy operator Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN) (NYSE: CWEN-A). Here's why these three dividend stocks are a good way to invest in solar energy right now.

Generating solar and wind energy on a massive scale

Daniel Foelber (NextEra Energy): Increasing revenue and earnings. A stable and growing dividend. Industry tailwinds. NextEra Energy has it all. The world's largest supplier of solar and wind energy has been ramping its renewable spending. Its current renewable capacity is 28 gigawatts (GW) -- including its signed backlog. The company is allocating as much as $28 billion toward new renewable projects between 2019 and 2022. The result has been over 6.5 million new solar panels in the last three years and 30 million planned panel installations by 2030. But that's not all. NextEra is a huge player in wind energy as well. In fact new wind energy projects comprise over half of the company's renewable backlog. They accounted for over 80% of its renewable contracts in 2019 and 2020 (as of the end of the third quarter of 2020).

Despite record-high spending NextEra continues to deliver impressive results. The company's main two businesses are Florida Power & Light (FPL) and Gulf Power. They generated over 70% of NextEra's revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30 2020. NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) is the company's clean energy segment and is investing in solar and wind projects across America. Between the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2024 NEER's renewable investments are expected to top $8 billion. But around 80% of this spending is expected to occur by the end of 2021. Being the largest utility in Florida is expensive. But this year NextEra plans on spending more money on renewables than it costs to maintain Florida Power & Light's existing assets. Lower spending from 2022 to 2024 should help drive earnings. NextEra is forecasting 2021 earnings per share of around $2.47 and then growing earnings at 6% to 8% per year in 2022 and 2023.

Even during this period of high spending NextEra has consistently raised its dividend. The company is now a Dividend Aristocrat a distinguished achievement given to members of the S&P 500 that have increased their annual dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. In sum NextEra Energy is a balanced way to invest in the long-term growth of solar and wind energy while collecting quarterly dividends.

More renewable energy means more copper

Lee Samaha (Southern Copper Corporation): If you like renewable energy and in particular solar power then chances are you will like copper too. Widely known as the most economically sensitive commodity copper is used across the industrial economy but it's the 27% of demand that comes from electrical networking that is interesting here.

Simply put more electricity generation from wind and solar power means more demand for copper for use in the transmission distribution and storage of electricity. Moreover new renewable energy projects will need copper wiring in order to connect to the grid. According to the Copper Development Association generating electricity from renewable energy ""has a copper usage intensity that is typically four to six times higher than it is for fossil fuels.""

That's music to the ears of a copper miner like Southern Copper and also good news for investors attracted to its current 2.9% dividend yield. To be clear Southern Copper's dividend payout isn't set in stone; instead it's a function of the company's cash position and cash generation. In other words it's likely to go up and down largely in concert with the price of copper.

As such buying the stock for its dividend is basically taking a view on higher copper prices and demand in the future. That might a good thing in a world increasingly willing to invest in renewable energy.

Here comes the sun-centric stock you've been waiting for

Scott Levine (Clearway Energy): It's little surprise that investors are turning their attention to solar stocks these days considering how the market embraced them in 2020. Moreover with the favorable treatment that the solar industry received in the recent stimulus bill and President Joe Biden making good on his promise to rejoin the Paris Agreement this week there appears to be widespread enthusiasm for renewable energy. Thus many people believe solar stocks are poised for even greater gains in the coming years. Pair this belief with the knowledge that dividend-paying stocks often outperform non-dividend-paying stocks and it appears that Clearway Energy is an ideal choice for investors looking to grab some yield while waiting for the solar industry to flourish.

While Clearway Energy's portfolio includes a variety of asset types solar power stands out. It represents 1.32 GW of capacity or 21% of the company's overall capacity as of the end of Q3 2020. And it seems that solar will occupy an increasingly important role in the future. Of the 9.4 GW of projects in the company's pipeline solar projects (including distributed and utility scale) represent about 4.4 GW or 47%.

In response to the PG&E bankruptcy and the associated risks to Clearway Energy the company reduced its dividend in February 2019 in order to ensure its financial health.

Over the past year however Clearway has returned its focus to rewarding shareholders. Most recently the company had raised its quarterly payout 1.8% to $0.318 per share for the fourth quarter and forecasting a sunny 2021 management noted on the Q3 2020 conference call that it ""continues to see dividend per share growth at the upper end of our 5% to 8% long-term growth rate through 2021.""

The extension of tax credits from the recent stimulus bill and President Biden's rejoining of the Paris Agreement are merely two factors contributing to the belief that the solar industry is poised for significant growth -- something from which Clearway Energy and its investors could surely prosper.

Companies that were highly anticipated to go public in the early part of 2020 — Airbnb DoorDash and Asana — paused plans amid COVID-19 concerns.

That all changed in early summer. The market turned and a goldrush of IPOs followed including the three aforementioned companies.

By the end of December 480 companies went public a 106 percent increase over 2019’s tallies.

Additionally more IPOs last year doubled in value during their opening days than any year since 1999. In September Snowflake made history clocking in the largest software IPO of all time and Airbnb continued its trend as a tech darling raising $3.5 billion in its public debut.

As experts look to what is likely to be another marquee year for tech IPOs in 2021 — see Roblox Nextdoor and Instacart among others — Built In reflects on 2020’s notable tech IPO wins.

Lupin: Part 2 will be released later this year.

As adaptations go Netflix’s Lupin has taken an unusual journey to the screen. The series is based on the fantastical stories about “gentleman thief” Arsène Lupin the early 20th-century French literary character created by Maurice Leblanc though it exists in an ostensibly real-world setting. Its protagonist Assane Diop (Omar Sy) functions as both a deconstruction of the gentleman swindler — a wealthy rogue who steals for the thrill of it — as well as a loving homage to the character since Leblanc’s novels exist within the series’ fiction and serve as Diop’s in-universe inspiration (The show’s full title Lupin: dans l'ombre d'Arsène translates to “In the shadow of Arsène”).

It’s by no means the first series to act as both a remake and a descendant. Fans of anime and manga are likely familiar with Lupin the Third the long-running franchise about Arsène Lupin’s French-Japanese grandson Lupin III which began in 1967 and is still going strong. However by taking this meta-fictional approach (a la Steven Moffat’s Jekyll show DC’s Silver Age Flash comic or Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2) the Netflix series lends itself to readings that may not have been possible in a traditional adaptation. Assane Diop is hardly a monocle-wearing top-hat-sporting aristocrat; as the son of working-class Senegalese immigrants he exists forever on the outskirts of Paris’ upper echelons. The original Lupin was a master of disguise a skill Diop has taught himself over the years but there’s only so much a Black man can do to blend in with a white bourgeoisie.

The show consists of ten episodes five of which have been released in “Part 1” (with “Part 2” set to arrive later this year). Thus far it’s admittedly uneven bookended by a pair of great stories with its middle three chapters feeling various degrees of extraneous. But by the time it gets to where it’s going in chapter 5 — entitled “Étretat” after the Normandy cliffs featured in Leblanc’s “The Hollow Needle” — the wait feels mostly worthwhile.

Unlike the crime-of-the-week Lupin books and novellas the show has an overarching plotline concerning a conspiracy from Diop’s past but each episode also features a central heist from Leblanc’s most famous stories. These are for the most part exciting to watch between the revelation of each ploy’s inner-workings after the fact and Omar Sy’s innate charm which makes him a smooth-as-hell Lupin analogue. However when it comes to Sy’s actual character Assane Diop the show often feels half-baked. Sy has proven to be a tremendous performer in the past but he’s saddled with the kind of role he usually gets in Hollywood films (like Inferno and X-Men: Days of Future Past) wherein he has an incontestable physical presence but his function is limited to the mechanics of the plot.

That sums up most of the series’ problems. Everything from childhood flashbacks to secondary characters rarely extends beyond its plot function; rare are the moments in episodes 2 through 4 where it feels like a character-centric story in a visual medium told with the help of an ensemble; it’s all information no vibes! Take for instance the cops on Diop’s tail who slowly begin to piece together his crimes by referring to Leblanc’s work: they have no interiority as human beings and their scenes usually begin and end with whatever new discoveries they’ve made.

There are a few exceptions of course like Diop’s ex-wife Claire (Ludivine Sagnier) and a disgraced journalist he later befriends (Anne Benoît) but there are just as many characters — like Diop’s childhood friend Benjamin (Antoine Gouy) an accomplice in his schemes — who feel like they cease to exist once Diop leaves the room. Dramatically the show is a bit of a drag which is especially unfortunate since the plot is kicked into motion by the sudden resurgence of a valuable necklace from Diop’s past which in turn unearths a story of betrayal and of breadcrumbs left behind by Diop’s father Bakar (Fargass Assandé). The answers to each question while technically “unexpected” since they reveal new information aren’t “surprising” in a narrative sense since these payoffs rarely stem from existing hints or setups. The series’ mysteries are zags without the zigs.

However while Lupin often fumbles its emotional reveals the series is at its best when following Diop enacting his plans and when revealing each one from a different vantage making us privy to every moving part like a magician revealing his secrets. The show captures the momentum of a clockwork heist the tension of sudden obstacles and the ingenuity of improvised responses with thrilling precision (especially in “Chapter 1 - Le Collier de la reine” directed by Now You See Me’s Louis Leterrier).

Lupin is also politically incisive when it wants to be; it brings to mind Ladj Ly’s Oscar-nominated 2019 film Les Misérables which adapted the broad strokes of Victor Hugo’s novel about the 1832 Paris Rebellion and modernized the story by focusing on the police brutality faced by non-white Parisians. Lupin opens with Diop disguised as cleaning staff and entering the Louvre after-hours alongside dozens of forgotten anonymous non-white workers as they pass by “La Liberté guidant le people” Eugène Delacroix’s famous painting of the July Revolution of 1830 which replaced France’s hereditary rule with popular sovereignty. Before any semblance of plot or character Lupin centers broken ideals and promises unkept (without giving too much away the show’s primary villain has much more nationalistic view of French culture and history). The rest of the episode is about valuable jewels once owned by Marie Antionette — one of the most recognizable symbols of wealth and extravagance in times of extreme poverty — which are put up for auction and bid on by wealthy collectors with bottomless purses and no sense of irony.

Granted beyond this auction subplot explorations of race and class are largely limited to individual interactions but the show continues to refer back to (and implicitly comment on) its source material in ways that wink at the audience. An elderly unassuming target of Diop’s schemes seems like an unlikely victim at first — Diop though he acts in his own self-interest usually displays a moral compass — until this victim reveals the colonial origins of her wealth immediately re-contextualizing the ethics of the situation in a manner that Leblanc’s stories did not. (The show is yet to apply this lens to Arsène Lupin himself who Diop treats with reverence but that’s a secondary concern since Lupin is entirely fictional in-world).

Barring some nagging structural problems — like cutting to flashbacks when things are getting exciting or epilogues that feel ten minutes too long — Lupin mostly works. It plants a few personal seeds early on which it keeps hinting at without fully addressing (the story of Diop being torn between his job and his family feels like wheel-spinning rather than emotional intrigue) but by the time its scattered elements come into focus the show finally figures out how to weave them together and delivers a mid-season cliffhanger that renders many of these flaws irrelevant."

No doubt McInnes was thrilled he’d busted out of Victoria for a Queensland holiday - but it became clearer the next day just why he was looking quite so pleased with himself when Premier owner Solly Lew announced his retail wunderkid McInnes was walking away from the business with a multimillion-dollar golden handshake (which covers a 12-month notice period and two years’ gardening leave). Also lunching at Season was Graham ‘Skroo’ Turner seated with his wife Jude one table over from the McInnes clan. The couple were fresh out of a fortnight’s hotel quarantine in Brisbane (no rich lister quarantine exemption for them!) after a Christmas visit to London to see their daughter Jo and her family. Despite travel restrictions taking an enormous toll on Turner’s Flight Centre business he looked uber-chipper as he and McInnes enjoyed a post-luncheon chat. Turn the page Loading

It’s early in the new year but Bill Shorten has raced out of the barrier in his eternal quest to regain the Labor leadership and right the badly listing good ship Labor from captain Anthony Albanese. While not exactly having the gee whiz factor of the revelation that his former deputy Tanya Plibersek can count on conservative broadcaster Alan Jones as her number one fanboy. Shorten didn’t mince his words when he addressed St Kilda’s Readings bookshop on Sunday. The former Labor leader appeared at the Melbourne store to launch the Labor Right essay collection The Write Stuff which includes entries from a slew of Right factional allies including Jim Chalmers Clare O’Neil and ALP deputy leader Richard Marles. Perhaps unsurprisingly the Maribyrnong MP couldn’t resist the opportunity to take a thinly veiled swipe at Albo by taking aim at the party’s “tiny” policy agenda even as he publicly declared his support for the leader. Well kind of. Albanese is doing “a good solid job in a time of pandemic where the unity of the national moment naturally favours incumbents” Shorten told an audience which counted Senator Kimberley Kitching former Labor MP Theo Theophanous and former Rio Tinto executive Ken MacPherson - who also served as Shorten’s former chief of staff during his term as Opposition Leader. Getting the gang back together perhaps? Or is it a case of putting the finishing touches on a new team hopeful of a Labor federal election victory. Whatever the case there’s more work to be done by Shorten apparently. Sportsbet’s Labor Leadership odds put Plibersek at 2.10 while Shorten languishes in sixth place at 15.00. Maybe that will change after the book’s wider release. Mail on Post

The owners of the former Globies sports bar in Mitchell Street Justin Coleman and Steve Dugan applied to transfer their old liquor licence to the proposed new Breezes retail precinct including a bar and bistro last February.

But the proposal attracted objections from 256 people businesses and community organisations by far the most received by the commission.

The commission heard the objectors feared the “destruction” of the quiet amenity of the neighbourhood the risk of increased anti-social behaviour and an increase in poker machines as well as the financial impact on the nearby Cas Club and Tracy Village Sports Club.

In his evidence to the commission Mr Coleman said the new “family friendly” venue “would not be a typical Mitchell Street bar” and would include a dedicated fully enclosed children’s playroom.

“It was therefore apparent from the evidence that although what was being proposed was to substitute a licence that had previously been related to a premises that was a late night venue in Darwin city’s most popular night-time entertainment strip the Breezes proposed venue in the northern suburbs was going to be very different and have a clear focus on families” the ruling reads.

“The proposed premises are impressive and clearly are geared to cater to a market of ‘families’ in the local community area.”

Mr Coleman told the commission the tavern was the “cornerstone” of a larger $25m development that would “not stack up” without it as the liquor and gaming licences would effectively subsidise a proposed childcare centre and other businesses.

NEE,NextEra Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzIzLzMtZW5lcmd5LXN0b2Nrcy1wb3NpdGlvbmVkLXRvLXdpbi1pbi1hLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1wL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Energy Stocks Positioned to Win in a Renewable Power World,"These companies are focused on the future of the energy market.

The global economy has been slowly shifting toward cleaner fuel sources over the years. This transition will likely take several more decades to complete. However what has become clear is that the world is moving toward a renewable energy-powered future.

Many companies are taking early steps to participate in the energy transition. Three energy companies positioning themselves to win are Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B) Xcel Energy (XEL 1.21%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 0.98%). Here's why investors won't want to miss this trio.

The royal treatment

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Royal Dutch Shell): Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend in 2020 in the face of low energy prices. That's not good. But it would be a mistake to count this nearly 200-year-old energy giant out given its long history of adjusting its business along with the world around it.

Today that means pulling back in the carbon-heavy oil space investing more heavily in transition businesses (like liquified natural gas which is often paired with renewable power to ensure energy reliability) and increasingly focusing on the future of energy (such as renewable power which the company calls a ""growth"" business). The dividend cut while unfortunate helps free up cash to fund the transition of its business with Shell planning to invest as much as $20 billion a year to meet the world's changing energy needs. The key however is that going forward only 35% to 40% of the capital spending budget is earmarked for oil. The rest is split between its transition and growth businesses. This is a fairly aggressive plan that will work out particularly well if the world makes a decided shift toward renewable power.

To be fair conservative dividend investors might prefer a more middle-of-the-road approach like the one Total is taking. But if you believe that the renewable power transition will happen quickly Shell appears to be in a better position to transition to the clean energy future while milking its cash cow oil business for as long as it can manage.

Investing in the future of energy

Matt DiLallo (Xcel Energy): Utility Xcel Energy has a bold goal. It aims to deliver 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. Fueling that plan is a steady transition to cleaner power sources. The company intends to retire all its coal power plans by 2030 and replace that capacity with cleaner natural gas and renewable energy. Meanwhile it's investing in emerging technologies like green hydrogen to achieve its ambitious multi-decade plan to produce emission-free energy.

In the near term Xcel Energy expects to invest as much as $24 billion through 2025 on expansion projects such as new renewable energy capacity. That's a $1.4 billion increase from its initial plan powered by incremental investments in new solar energy developments and wind repowering projects. In addition to that visible near-term growth the company sees significant future expansion opportunities in solar due to steadily falling costs and intriguing potential for using nuclear energy to produce emissions-free hydrogen that could eventually become a replacement for natural gas.

The company anticipates its investments over the next four years will power earnings-per-share growth of about 5% to 7% annually. That should give it the fuel to increase its 2.7%-yielding dividend by around that same yearly rate. Xcel's steadily rising earnings and dividends should produce attractive total returns for investors especially considering the company's low-risk profile. That combination of low risk and attractive reward potential makes Xcel a great way for investors to earn some green as the world goes green.

A win-win stock for all investors

Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): If you're looking to invest in renewables look no further than NextEra Energy. It is after all the world's largest producer of energy from solar and wind. But here's the real deal: The company which also owns the largest regulated utility in the U.S. Florida Power & Light Company is going all out to ensure it remains right at the top in coming years and that's precisely why investors could mint a lot of money from this stock.

NextEra had a solid year in 2020 beating COVID-19 pandemic blues and delivering where it matters. As the company's earnings grew so did its projections through 2023. NextEra foresees its adjusted earnings per share growing 6% to 8% in 2022 and 2023 off its projected 2021 base backed by an ever-growing renewables portfolio.

Through the first nine months of 2020 NextEra added nearly 4800 megawatts to its renewables backlog. With that its total backlog crossed 15000 megawatts by the third quarter surpassing the company's entire existing renewables capacity. Put another way NextEra's capacity to produce energy from wind and solar is set to grow exponentially in the near future. With the company also dabbling in battery storage and high-potential green hydrogen opportunities are numerous.

So you have an established utility here that's taking the renewable world by storm making NextEra Energy a no-brainer stock to play the renewable energy boom.

NextEra Energy has been one of the most unique growth stories in the renewable energy arena. As a regulated utility NextEra features the rare combination of growth from new investments and predictable inflows from existing infrastructure that support its dividend. This balance has allowed NextEra to allocate as much as $28 billion toward new projects between 2019 and 2022.

NextEra’s leading renewables portfolio is the result of over 20 years of investments. But the company has been ramping up renewable spending even more over the past few years. In the third quarter it added a record 2.2 gigawatts of signed contracts to its renewables backlog (1.44 GW of net new additions). This brings its total renewable backlog to over 15 GW which is more than its entire existing renewable portfolio.

Wind energy is NextEra’s largest renewable investment. As of the third quarter new wind energy projects and wind repowering (updating old wind farms) accounted for 80% of 2019 to 2020 renewable contracts.

NextEra Energy is one of the safest ways to invest in wind energy. As an established utility it has the funds to invest in large-scale regulated renewable energy investments that should return a steady stream of free cash flow. The company’s dividend recently yielded 1.9% and it has been increased for 26 consecutive years. (The Motley Fool has recommended NextEra Energy.)

Ask the Fool

From S.T. in Dover N.H: What does a “one-time charge” refer to on a company’s financial statement?

The Fool responds: It’s an accounting adjustment meant to reflect a nonrecurring unusual outflow (or inflow) unrelated to the company’s business operations. For example it may be tied to a lawsuit layoffs or a plant closing.

Advertisement

Some companies frequently include one-time charges in their reporting making them not so “nonrecurring.” Such accounting can be used to make a company’s performance look better than it was. According to the Corporate Finance Institute for example: “Airline companies are often involved in fuel hedging to control their costs. Sometimes hedging activities generate large profits. A company may decide to include such profits in their revenue numbers even though fuel hedging is not its core business.”

Beware of companies with too-frequent “one-time” charges and when you see one try to figure out whether it’s problematic.

From C.R. in Vineland Colo.: Are companies with low profit margins bad investments?

The Fool responds: Not necessarily. Fat profit margins are generally preferable as they often reflect competitive advantages (such as a strong brand that commands a higher price). Still you needn’t avoid lower-margin businesses. Instead look at the whole picture.

Advertisement

Imagine for example that the Laverne Brewery Inc. has a whopping net profit margin of 25% while Shirley Beer Co. has just a 2% margin. But if Laverne sells only three cases of beer a year while Shirley sells thousands Shirley is the better buy generating more total profit.

Some industries such as pharmaceuticals financial services and software often have high profit margins. Furniture stores and supermarkets typically have low ones — but if they have high sales volume they can still be good investments.

The Fool’s School

Have you heard of the “FIRE” movement? FIRE stands for “Financial Independence Retire Early” and it’s all about saving aggressively in order to retire early — sometimes as early as your 30s (or even your late 20s). It’s worth learning about it in case you want to work toward that goal — and even if you don’t you can probably benefit from adopting some FIRE strategies. You may not retire early but you might retire on time and be financially secure when you do.

Advertisement

Some FIRE strategies include saving 50% or more of your earnings increasing those earnings by taking on side jobs and cutting costs. Many FIRE enthusiasts live well below their means often unconventionally — such as by not having a car choosing a smaller home or apartment than they can afford and not eating out. All this may seem too extreme and unappealing to lots of us but for the many people who are way behind in saving for retirement such strategies are worth considering.

The FIRE movement does have some critics. Some worry that anyone retiring in their 20s or 30s might not have sufficient savings and investments to carry them for the next 60 or 70 years. Others suggest that an early retirement isn’t necessarily the best goal; if you have a job you enjoy you could do well to just keep working giving you more to spend along the way. Another knock against FIRE is that it involves a lot of sacrifice deferring many enjoyments until late in life.

Consider reading up on FIRE to see what you really think of it and whether some of its strategies could help you reach your financial goals. You’ll find many articles via an online search. You might also read the books Start Your F.I.R.E. by Dylin Redling and Tom Allison (Rockridge Press $14) and Playing With FIRE by Scott Rieckens (New World Library $17).

My Smartest Investment

From C.E. online: My smartest investment has been buying shares of companies such as Apple Google Disney and Nvidia for my kids in December 2018 and January 2019. They now think they are making money when they interact with these companies on a daily basis.

The Fool responds: That’s very smart indeed. Turning your kids into investors can set them up to be financially savvy and secure for the rest of their lives. And you can help build their interest by investing in companies they know like and use.

It’s never clear (and it’s not that important) how stocks will perform in the short run but if they do well it can generate excitement quickly. And since owning a share of stock in a company is an actual ownership stake (though admittedly a small one) your children really are contributing to the growth of their businesses when they patronize them.

Other companies that might interest young investors include Activision Blizzard Amazon.com Chipotle Mexican Grill Coca-Cola Facebook Hasbro McDonald’s Microsoft Netflix Nike PepsiCo Snap Spotify Technology Starbucks Target and Tesla. Make sure that they understand that some businesses they like are parts of other companies: Instagram is owned by Facebook for example.

Last week’s trivia answer: International Flavors & Fragrances",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbGlrZS1zb2xhci1lbmVyZ3ktdGhlbi15b3VsbC1sb3ZlLXRoZXNlLTMtZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2tzLTIwMjEtMDEtMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Like Solar Energy? Then You'll Love These 3 Dividend Stocks,"It's easy to love a sector when it returns 14 times the market. That's exactly what happened in 2020 when the average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEMKT: TAN) surged over 230% compared to the market's 16% return. However many of the pure-play solar stocks responsible for the ETF's meteoric rise are now trading at high valuations -- making now the perfect time to think outside the box.

We asked some of our contributors for their best solar stocks to buy now. They identified three dividend stocks: utility giant NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) copper mining kingpin Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE: SCCO) and renewable energy operator Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN) (NYSE: CWEN-A). Here's why these three dividend stocks are a good way to invest in solar energy right now.

Generating solar and wind energy on a massive scale

Daniel Foelber (NextEra Energy): Increasing revenue and earnings. A stable and growing dividend. Industry tailwinds. NextEra Energy has it all. The world's largest supplier of solar and wind energy has been ramping its renewable spending. Its current renewable capacity is 28 gigawatts (GW) -- including its signed backlog. The company is allocating as much as $28 billion toward new renewable projects between 2019 and 2022. The result has been over 6.5 million new solar panels in the last three years and 30 million planned panel installations by 2030. But that's not all. NextEra is a huge player in wind energy as well. In fact new wind energy projects comprise over half of the company's renewable backlog. They accounted for over 80% of its renewable contracts in 2019 and 2020 (as of the end of the third quarter of 2020).

Despite record-high spending NextEra continues to deliver impressive results. The company's main two businesses are Florida Power & Light (FPL) and Gulf Power. They generated over 70% of NextEra's revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30 2020. NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) is the company's clean energy segment and is investing in solar and wind projects across America. Between the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2024 NEER's renewable investments are expected to top $8 billion. But around 80% of this spending is expected to occur by the end of 2021. Being the largest utility in Florida is expensive. But this year NextEra plans on spending more money on renewables than it costs to maintain Florida Power & Light's existing assets. Lower spending from 2022 to 2024 should help drive earnings. NextEra is forecasting 2021 earnings per share of around $2.47 and then growing earnings at 6% to 8% per year in 2022 and 2023.

Even during this period of high spending NextEra has consistently raised its dividend. The company is now a Dividend Aristocrat a distinguished achievement given to members of the S&P 500 that have increased their annual dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. In sum NextEra Energy is a balanced way to invest in the long-term growth of solar and wind energy while collecting quarterly dividends.

More renewable energy means more copper

Lee Samaha (Southern Copper Corporation): If you like renewable energy and in particular solar power then chances are you will like copper too. Widely known as the most economically sensitive commodity copper is used across the industrial economy but it's the 27% of demand that comes from electrical networking that is interesting here.

Simply put more electricity generation from wind and solar power means more demand for copper for use in the transmission distribution and storage of electricity. Moreover new renewable energy projects will need copper wiring in order to connect to the grid. According to the Copper Development Association generating electricity from renewable energy ""has a copper usage intensity that is typically four to six times higher than it is for fossil fuels.""

That's music to the ears of a copper miner like Southern Copper and also good news for investors attracted to its current 2.9% dividend yield. To be clear Southern Copper's dividend payout isn't set in stone; instead it's a function of the company's cash position and cash generation. In other words it's likely to go up and down largely in concert with the price of copper.

As such buying the stock for its dividend is basically taking a view on higher copper prices and demand in the future. That might a good thing in a world increasingly willing to invest in renewable energy.

Here comes the sun-centric stock you've been waiting for

Scott Levine (Clearway Energy): It's little surprise that investors are turning their attention to solar stocks these days considering how the market embraced them in 2020. Moreover with the favorable treatment that the solar industry received in the recent stimulus bill and President Joe Biden making good on his promise to rejoin the Paris Agreement this week there appears to be widespread enthusiasm for renewable energy. Thus many people believe solar stocks are poised for even greater gains in the coming years. Pair this belief with the knowledge that dividend-paying stocks often outperform non-dividend-paying stocks and it appears that Clearway Energy is an ideal choice for investors looking to grab some yield while waiting for the solar industry to flourish.

While Clearway Energy's portfolio includes a variety of asset types solar power stands out. It represents 1.32 GW of capacity or 21% of the company's overall capacity as of the end of Q3 2020. And it seems that solar will occupy an increasingly important role in the future. Of the 9.4 GW of projects in the company's pipeline solar projects (including distributed and utility scale) represent about 4.4 GW or 47%.

In response to the PG&E bankruptcy and the associated risks to Clearway Energy the company reduced its dividend in February 2019 in order to ensure its financial health.

Over the past year however Clearway has returned its focus to rewarding shareholders. Most recently the company had raised its quarterly payout 1.8% to $0.318 per share for the fourth quarter and forecasting a sunny 2021 management noted on the Q3 2020 conference call that it ""continues to see dividend per share growth at the upper end of our 5% to 8% long-term growth rate through 2021.""

The extension of tax credits from the recent stimulus bill and President Biden's rejoining of the Paris Agreement are merely two factors contributing to the belief that the solar industry is poised for significant growth -- something from which Clearway Energy and its investors could surely prosper.

Spencer Davis Motorsports will field the #11 Toyota Tundra for all twenty-two races beginning at Daytona.

The team posted on Instagram “Spencer Davis Motorsports will be headed to @daytona in 3 weeks to take on the NextEra Energy 250!! Kicking off our FULL TIME 2021 season in our #11 @toyotaracing Tundra driven by @spencerdavis_29 !!!”

Davis had previously announced in December that the team would enter the first two races of the year at Daytona and on its road course. He has raced in the Truck Series on a part-time scale since 2018 finishing seventh in his series début in that year’s season opener for Kyle Busch Motorsports. Over the next two years he ran nine races with KBM Rette Jones Racing and Niece Motorsports during which he scored two top tens (eighth at Kentucky in 2018).

In 2020 he formed his own team from RJR’s #11 and ran the bulk of the season. However after contesting ten of the first eleven races he was forced to sit out the Michigan event after testing positive for COVID-19; he was one of four national series drivers to have a positive coronavirus test during the 2020 season along with the Cup Series‘ Jimmie Johnson Brendan Gaughan and Austin Dillon. Davis Dillon and Johnson all also missed a race due to their tests.

SDM’s maiden season ended with fourteen starts seven top twenties and a best finish of twelfth in their début at Las Vegas. The team is one of five confirmed full-time Truck organisations to use Toyota power alongside KBM Clay Greenfield Motorsports Halmar Friesen Racing Hattori Racing Enterprises and McAnally-Higemann Racing. ThorSport Racing is rumoured to be joining them after announcing their departure from Ford earlier in the week.

With the announcement Davis will run his first full national series schedule. In 2019 he finished fourth in the now-ARCA Menards Series East championship for RJR with a win at Gateway; he has two career victories in the series.",,,

Now the 1985 silhouette of the Dunk has made a very big return – and people want more.

Last year we saw a lot of play on colorful Dunks. This year Nike will still lean toward the colorful side while offering neutral tones as well. One of the biggest drops this year will feature the “University Blue” from UNC’s light blue colorway which made headlines when Sneaker News dropped a photo of the shoe. Baby blue has long been a favorite amongst sneakerheads especially after Virgil Abloh’s collaboration in his Off-White “University Blue” Jordan 1 release.

The expectations are high for Nike’s sneaker drops this year. The sneaker industry over the past few years has changed drastically due to resell culture. Dunks that normally retail for $150 have more than tripled their value on StockX a site that allows buyers to place bids on authentic shoes through local resellers. The crossover between streetwear and mainstream fashion has created a higher demand for sneakers making it extremely challenging for people to get their hands on a pair.

“Sneaker culture has definitely changed due to digital lines bots bidding sites like StockX and Goat” said Kassandra Ruvaclaba a sales employee at the DTLR sneaker store on North Kedzie. “Resellers are kind of messing up the shoe game just because they’re not letting everyone get the shoe they want they’re just trying to make a profit off of it.”

Just five years ago it was normal to camp outside of stores leading up to sneaker release dates. Sneaker culture has changed so much that in order to get a hot sneaker you have to try your luck on five different websites or apps just to get them for retail price.

Social media has also impacted the demand for sneakers in part due to celebrities like Travis Scott who has had multiple collaborations with Nike. Athletes are no longer the only people with sneaker deals; sneaker culture has evolved beyond that. Your favorite rappers and singers have collaborations too. The “Cactus Jack” SB Dunks were a favorite in 2020 from Scott’s line.

It’s no surprise that Nike sales have thrived during the pandemic thanks to the number of people who have begun working out at home. According to CNBC Nike’s digital sales went up 84 percent during this past quarter due to people wanting gear to stay healthy and active during the pandemic.

Aside from the spike in online sales retail stores are still hoping to recover from the past year’s struggles. Some sneaker stores in Chicago took a hard hit when some stores were looted during protests over the summer. Ruvaclaba said that DTLR has been very successful since its reopening.

“When we opened up we had all the releases so I would say business has been overly well our first day I think we made like $35000” she said.

DePaul students are no stranger to sneaker culture. Although it has been a while since on-campus classes have been available the Lincoln Park and Loop campuses both have different aesthetics.

“Classes in Lincoln Park have way more sneakers while classes in the Loop have more business casual shoes” said DePaul marketing student Max Segal. “I see a lot of Jordan 1’s and Yeezy 350’s.”

This difference in styles has everything to do with the environment and majors of students. Since the Loop campus is home to DePaul’s business school you see a lot of business casual outfits. And since Lincoln Park houses humanities colleges like the College of Education and the Theatre School the dress code is slightly more casual.

The emergence of athleisure wear in the fashion world has found great success in brands like Nike Adidas and Under Armour. Nike is the most successful sportswear brand in the world totaling $37.4 billion revenue in 2020 alone according to Nike News. Part of Nike’s marketing strategy is to capture everyday people who work out like one of their first ads featuring an 80-year-old marathon runner. The sportswear market is not tailored to athletes — it has expanded to everyday people who want to look and feel good while exercising.

“The brand is about realizing the potential that we all each of us have within us” said Ken Krimstein a professor of public relations and advertising at DePaul. “It’s a very empowering message that’s been incredibly consistent for 40 years now.”

Another ad that made headlines was Colin Kaepernick’s feature on a picture that read “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.”

DePaul students are familiar with protests and activism. If you’ve walked on the quad you’ve most likely run into a protest. Some aspects of their branding have started conversations across student bodies.

“The brand used to be totally in charge of its message.” Krimstein said. “Now really the consumer of the advertising has a very large part in creating the message through social media and retweeting and posting. They’re very empowered to talk about the brand so they’ve become kind of a collaborator in the brand message.”

The partnered relationship between advertising and consumers has created a bigger platform for sneaker lovers to keep voicing what they want more of from Nike. In the month of January alone Nike is releasing two different Dunks with a retail value no more than $150 but a resale value of twice that amount.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvbmlrZS1haXItbWF4LTk1LWFpcm1vamktcGF0Y2hlcy1yZWxlYXNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max 95 With Airmoji Patches,"Nike continues to release bold new takes on the perennial Air Max 95 silhouette.

The Airmojis feature smiling winking angry and mundane facial expressions. When it comes to the base design this AM95 is dressed in white black “Signal Blue” and “Cyber” tones across the uppers. Subtle reflective material is also observed in the lower wave-like panelling. Contrasting the crisp white midsoles are tonal black rubber outsoles with hits of light blue for a balanced look.

As far as specs are concerned the low-top runner is equipped with reinforced leather uppers and synthetic overlays. Breahtable mesh textile is also added to the overall design for ventilation.

And while there are a number of classic colorways and lists like these are always highly subjective it probably wouldn’t be too long before you land on “UNC.”

The Carolina blue and white colorway has been a mainstay in the Jordan line since 1985 when it debuted on a pair of Nike Air Jordan 1s reappearing on a number of other retro Jordans and mainline Nike sneakers since.

Jordan’s love for his alma mater and the legacy he left behind after three years in Chapel Hill have made the blue and white UNC colorway a favorite for Nike’s designers across generations. This year the colorway is expected to grace a pair for Nike Air Jordan 4s for the first time on a general release pair. The colorways was previously used on PE versions of the sneaker given out to UNC Chapel Hill basketball players and staff.

Because those fetch several thousand dollars on the resell market sneakerheads are hotly anticipating the general release version believed to be dropping during or before March Madness this year.

Ahead of that release we’ve put together a selection of some of the best UNC-inspired sneakers to have been released over the past few years. Check them out below.

Nike Air More Uptempo “UNC”

Nike Air Jordan 3 “UNC”

Nike Jordan 3 Retro UNC (2020) from $410 (Available at 2 Merchants) Where to shop

This Dunk Low is not technically UNC-inspired as the pops of yellow and its “Coast” name suggest that UCLA — a recent Jordan Brand-sponsored university — is the inspiration for this colorway. Still the blue and white is close enough to the original UNC hue that it counts. Note this sneaker has been released in Europe already and will see a US release soon.

Nike Air Jordan OG

Jordan OG — the brand’s first-ever women’s-focused sneaker that debuted in 1998 — was the subject of a collaboration with Melody Ehsani in 2020. That pair was done up in black and red another OG Jordan Brand color scheme. If you want something a little lighter the Jumpman also released the Jordan OG in white and blue.

• “The Class A No. 1218 steam locomotive built at the Norfolk and Western Railway’s Roanoke shops in June 1943 returned Wednesday. Owned now by Norfolk Southern the 1218 was used in its steam excursions before the program was discontinued in late 1994.”

• “There’s no more fudging using the old 703 area code for long distance calls in Western Virginia. Saturday the new 540 area code becomes compulsory. The 703 code will no longer work.”

• “Floyd County broke open a close game in the third quarter and went on to beat Roanoke Catholic 70-49 on Wednesday night in a non-district game on the Celtics’ floor.”

• “‘Whatever you’re doing now don’t stop’ Dr. Robert Keeley urged members of the Roanoke Area Drug Abuse Control Council (RADACC) in accepting the presidency of the organization at a meeting in the Roanoke Memorial Rehabilitation Center auditorium Monday. Keep working he said not only for the addicted that need help now but for those who may become addicted without help from RADACC.”

• “Norfolk and Western Railway net income dropped $9 million to $71.2 million in 1970-‘a rotten year for railroads’-John P. Fishwick N&W president said here Monday. But a major share of the decline was attributed to a pre-tax writeoff of $6.7 million in accounts receivable from bankrupt Penn Central and other railroads.”

• “A spoiled debut a lot of goals and not much excitement. That pretty much sums up the Roanoke Valley Rebels’ 7-4 victory over the Jersey Devils Sunday night. The loss spoiled Jim ‘Red Eye’ Hay’s debut as coach of the Devils.”

What purpose do joint security operations in the North West serve? Endless…

Why is insecurity in the North-West getting out of hand by the day? What purpose do joint security operations in the North West serve? Endless daily news of banditry kidnapping and illegal tax collection from innocent villagers raise these questions.

The deteriorating security situation in the North-West clearly points to the decay of Nigerian security system. The inefficiency of these operations and the hardship caused by bandits to the affected communities are obvious.

Why should the citizens who pay for the maintenance of the security agencies again live at the mercy of bandits who inflict unimaginable pains on them? Have the people not executed their part of the contract with government and sometimes going as far as providing security agencies with advance notice of attacks?

Government’s side of the contract is to protect lives and properties guarantee their own freedom of movement and provide them with social amenities. The 1999 Constitution summarised these as the “security and welfare of the people” which it tagged “the primary purpose of government.’’

Does the government really observe its own part of the agreement? Katsina State Governor Aminu Bello Masari recently said “I cannot look at the people in the face because we have failed to protect them contrary to our pledge to ensure the security of lives and property.” All the governors in the zone can say the same thing.

Many concerned Nigerians have advised a multi-pronged approach to tackle insecurity in the North-West. They also shed light on how government can invest strategically in the peace process. Most of them agreed that applying a holistic approach to the problem requires the massive involvement and participation of all stallholders.

No negotiation with bandits – Sheikh Gumi

According to Sheikh Ahmed Gumi there should be no negotiation with the bandits. “If you are talking about negotiation with Fulani bandits I will say no. This is because they are typically unorganised criminals. It is easier to negotiate with insurgents like Boko Haram to cease fire because they are somehow organised. I think the easiest way to end banditry is to train local people. Train the youth and give them weapons and allow them to fight’’ Gumi said.

Malam Mu’azu (not real name) is from Dan Sadau village of Zamfara State a place that suffered regular bandits’ attacks. He believes that bandits can be disarmed through mediation. He said “There is a need to form a peace committee of non-partisan people trusted by both sides. The committee can be chaired by a traditional ruler. Other members should include Ardo spiritual leaders leaders of Fulani socio-cultural groups top security officials and other well-meaning sons and daughters of the North-West zone” Mu’azu said.

Audu Sada is a 31-year-old man who lost his father and six siblings during an attack in April 2020 at Gurzar-Kuka village of Dan-Musa Local Government of Katsina State. He shared his experience with Daily Trust on Sunday.

The stories are heart-rending. Some of them cannot be with the gory details which case the anguish of the victims.

“When the bandits attacked our village my father did not run; he stood and fought back in defence of his family. He was killed in the process with my six siblings” Sada said.

He proffered solutions to the banditry. “To deal with this challenge government should stop the sources of arms to the bandits. Government should also engage traditional rulers especially from the district heads down to the Ardo. They know the criminals within their communities” he said.

Fairness for both only solution to kidnapping – MACBAN

Alhaji Uthman Baba Ngelzarma is the national secretary Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN).

He told Daily Trust on Sunday that to end banditry and kidnapping government needs to be fair to all sides. According to him the Fulani are the worst victims of the current insecurity in Nigeria.

“There are so many things that led to the current situation. Firstly the lingering farmers and herders’ clashes then issues of grazing areas access to water drug abuse spread of firearms and that of Burtali. But unfortunately government did not give them much attention. That is why we are saying there is a need to create a ministry for herdsmen activities. Just the way they created the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs.

“Herdsmen are suffering in silence. Imagine someone who went to bed rich with over 200 cattle only to wake up poor the following morning. And if he runs to the police station they will probably detain him and ask for money to bail himself” he said.

He said cattle ranching was a good idea that had not been taken seriously. He also wants government to reintroduce Jangali.

“Let other states copy from Adamawa where they reintroduced Jangali. It gives them an opportunity to know each herdsman living in their locality including the number of his livestock. That will also make it easier for them to fish out bad eggs living within” he added.

Senator Iroegbu a security expert explained that any effort to bring back peace to the North-West was useful because there was no approach that could solve the challenge entirely.

Iroegbu said “The mistake is to think that there is a single solution to the issue of banditry and kidnapping in the North-West. So there is a need to apply multiple solution approaches. But the suggestion of having traditional religious Fulani socio-cultural leaders led by government is a very solid one because government has all the instruments of power.

“Like Boko Haram banditry has taken an international dimension because some conflict merchants ISWAD and other terrorist groups in the Sahel region have hijacked it. That is why it is time to start using drones and other technologies to monitor our porous borders.

“The government also needs to address youth empowerment and climate change. Finally the engagement of the traditional rulers is very important. This is because they have the local and historical knowledge and the solutions.”

Fulani groups compromised – Bayeri

The national chairman of Miyetti Allah Gan Allah Alhaji Sale Bayari argued that setting a peace committee may not solve insecurity in the North-West. According to him some Fulani socio-cultural groups have already compromised.

He further accused them of collecting money from the Katsina State Government to settle bandits who recently kidnapped 334 students from a government school in Kankara.

“If it is true that Miyetti Allah collected money and paid the bandits for the release of those 344 Kankara boys then there is a problem. Having a direct contact with the bandits has given a bad name to the entire Fulani people in Nigeria. That is also one of the reasons I am doubting any peace process that may involve this kind of people” Bayari said.

Imam Dr Nuraini Ashafa co-director of the Interfaith Mediation Centre of the Muslim-Christian Dialogue in Kaduna explained that mediation could be an alternative way to address insecurity challenge in the North-West.

“Government’s efforts to fight insecurity in the North-West are failing because they have been politicised. Therefore there is a need to go back to the traditional and religious architecture and build up a solid security plan through mediation. This is what was done in Kenya between the Kalenjins who are herders and the Kikuyus and peace was restored” he said.

Traditional rulers’ peace initiatives

Alhaji Kabir a holder of the traditional title of Dan-Majen Daura while speaking to Daily Trust on Sunday on telephone suggested that a peace committee under the supervision of traditional rulers was the only way out of insecurity in the North-West.

He said “We are where we are today because the people in power are no longer listening to advice from traditional institutions which are connected with the grassroots. So if there should be a peace committee it should be under the same institutions.”

Mr John Bala Gora the chairman Atyap Chiefdom Peace and Security Partnership Committee of Southern Kaduna is for mediation in resolving ethno-religious conflict. “When we started it here some people resisted. But after dialogue they began to see the importance of unity.

“I am now happy that through dialogue we were able to restore peace and truth between the Fulani and some Zangon-Kataf communities. The same thing can be done to restore peace to the North-West” he said.

Government should stop giving excuses for its inability to perform its obligations as enshrined in the constitution. The approaches used in nine years to end this menace were inefficient and ineffective. Since both the government and the affected communities are not satisfied with the efforts so far it is time to act differently concertedly to arrest the slide of the North-West into more chaos. According to Aljazeera report bandits have killed over 8000 people since 2011 and forced more than 200000 to flee their homes.",,,,,,,,,

This prototype award was competitively solicited among awardees of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Phase IIA effort which was competitively awarded as a prototype other transaction pursuant to 10 U.S. Code § 2371b. Four proposals were received. Under this award the performer will provide the Missile Defense Agency’s Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor program with an on-orbit prototype demonstration culminating with launch and early orbit testing.



Northrop Grumman is developing a highly capable affordable survivable and extensible space-based sensing solution for hypersonic and ballistic missile defense. The company’s concept advances under the HBTSS ( Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor) Phase IIa program (Source: Northrop Grumman).



The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Space Development Agency (SDA) are currently developing elements of a hypersonic missile defense system to defend against hypersonic weapons and other emerging missile threats. These elements include the tracking and transport layers of the National Defense Space Architecture (NDSA and various interceptor programs.



In order to have global persistent tracking of an incoming hypersonic threat MDA (Missile Defense Agency) plans to develop specialized space-based sensors through its Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) program. MDA officials envision using new space-based sensors versus existing ground-based sensors due to the gap in coverage of detection and tracking as most ground-based radars track flight paths at much higher altitudes than a hypersonic interceptor flies.

Hypersonic weapons like ballistic missiles fly at speeds of at least Mach 5 or roughly 1 mile per second. Unlike ballistic missiles hypersonic weapons do not follow a ballistic trajectory and can maneuver en route to their target.

The maneuverability and low flight altitude of hypersonic weapons could challenge existing detection and defense systems. For example most terrestrial-based radars cannot detect hypersonic weapons until late in the weapon’s flight due to line-of-sight limitations of radar detection. This leaves minimal time for a defender to launch interceptors that could neutralize an inbound weapon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwOi8vZW4uYXZpYXRpb24tcmVwb3J0LmNvbS9ub3J0aHJvcC1ncnVtbWFuLXJlY2VudGx5LWluZHVjdGVkLWZpcnN0LXVzLWN1c3RvbXMtYW5kLWJvcmRlci1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLWNicC1wMy1vcmlvbi1haXJjcmFmdC1kZXBvdC1sZXZlbC1tYWludGVuYW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman recently inducted the first US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) P-3 Orion aircraft for depot ...,"Northrop Grumman Corporation announced it recently inducted the first U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft for depot level maintenance at its Aircraft Maintenance and Fabrication Center in Lake Charles.

Northrop Grumman was awarded a contract in June for aircraft maintenance and logistics services for the P-3 fleet. In addition to depot level maintenance the company will support daily operations of the 14 aircraft fleet operating primarily out of Jacksonville Florida and Corpus Christi Texas as well as domestic and international deployment locations. All 14 aircraft in the fleet will undergo depot inductions over the course of the contract.

The total estimated contract price is $896141311.00 which includes a 4-month Phase In; 12-month base period; nine 12-month option periods and a 6-month extension option. The initial funding amount is $3400000.00.

This contract action procures P-3 aircraft maintenance and logistical support services necessary to ensure that the Government has the numbers and types of properly configured aircraft available where and when required to meet operational commitments in support of Air and Marine Operations (AMO). This contract will allow AMO to keep its fleet of P-3 aircraft operational to accomplish its core competencies of interdiction investigation domain awareness contingency operations and national taskings.

CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) operates the P-3 LRT and Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft that perform a wide variety of operational missions especially those that require long station time overhead hemispheric range and missions throughout all weather and environmental conditions. The versatile P-3 also serves as a force multiplier in joint operations with local state and federal partners for National Special Security Events and consequence management efforts.

The P-3 Long Range Tracker (LRT) aircraft are high-endurance all-weather tactical turbo-prop aircraft primarily used to conduct long-range aerial patrols and surveillance missions along the U.S. borders and in drug transit zones in Central and South America. P-3 LRT aircraft often fly in tandem with the P-3 AEW. Deployed in this manner the P-3 AEW detects and tracks multiple targets and the accompanying P-3 LRT intercepts identifies and tracks those targets.

“Northrop Grumman’s expertise in aircraft maintenance logistics and sustainment have kept aircraft fleets mission ready for decades” said Michelle Scarpella sector vice president and general manager global sustainment and modernization Northrop Grumman. “We support operations of aircraft around the world and have delivered depot maintenance from our Aircraft Maintenance and Fabrication Center in Lake Charles for over 20 years.”

Northrop Grumman’s growing Aircraft Maintenance and Fabrication Center is home to 700 professionals who have performed over 15 million hours of direct maintenance work on numerous aircraft including the P-3 Orion E-8C E2-C Hawkeye C-2A Greyhound and the United Kingdom Royal Air Force’s E-3D.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmFtYmxlLm5sL21pbGl0YXJ5LW5ld3MvdXNhZi1lLTExYS1haXJjcmFmdC1hY2NpZGVudC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWJvYXJkLXJlcG9ydC1yZWxlYXNlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USAF E-11A Aircraft Accident Investigation Board Report released,"USAF E-11A Aircraft Accident Investigation Board Report released

Cummings Aerospace a Native American- and female-owned small business based in Huntsville Alabama is preparing to move into a new office on Tucson’s northeast side where it will focus on its growing defense work said Kelly Francis director of strategic development at Cummings and a former Raytheon engineering leader in Tucson.

The company plans to hire more than 20 full-time employees over the next 18 months said Francis who leads the Tucson site.

Founded in 2009 Cummings Aerospace offers capabilities including model-based systems engineering modeling and simulation software engineering mechanical and electrical design and advanced manufacturing.

The company employs about 100 people including at its headquarters office in Huntsville — a center of space tech known as “Rocket City” and home to a major Raytheon missile assembly plant — and at offices in Largo and Niceville Florida.

Besides Raytheon Cummings’ customers include other major defense prime contractors like Lockheed Martin Boeing and Northrop Grumman and the company also does contract work directly for the Defense Department Francis said.

Company President and CEO Sheila Cummings says the company plans to leverage its core competencies in aerospace system development and strategic partnerships with industry and academia to establish a corporate base in Tucson.

She cited the presence of the University of Arizona as a source of engineering talent the area’s relatively low cost of living local economic growth and the diversity of industries as draws to Tucson.

The natural beauty of the area is another big plus said Cummings who has visited Tucson many times through her work with Raytheon.

“It’s a beautiful location the desert environment the weather the views — it’s gorgeous” she said.

TIME FOR A CHANGE

Francis who spent 21 years in Tucson leading some of Raytheon’s biggest programs before retiring in July worked with Cummings for years as her company provided engineering services to Raytheon as a strategic supplier.

Francis said she didn’t intend to go back to work but when Cummings approached her she leapt at the chance to work part-time to help the company set up shop in Tucson.

“There’s a lot of opportunity to support the defense industry out here and having a footprint here allows us to be closer to multiple customers and really support the community” said Francis who managed cutting-edge programs including missile defense and hypersonic weapons at Raytheon.

Cummings’ new Tucson office a 3200-square foot building at 4713 E. Camp Lowell Drive now undergoing remodeling is eyeing an open house in March or April Francis said. The office will initially support the company’s missile defense Air Force and Navy programs.

Working at Cummings was a timely opportunity for Francis who said she had plenty of opportunities at Raytheon and was on an upward career trajectory but she wanted to spend more time with her 9-year-old son.

“To me it’s really exciting to work at a women-owned business and a small business” Francis said. “There’s such a unique opportunity for work/life balance here that I haven’t had before.”

Francis said she was also drawn by Cummings’ emphasis on community involvement.

ADVANCING STEM IN TUCSON

The company plans to work locally to advance STEM (science technology engineering and math) programs and work with veterans’ groups and nonprofits Francis said.

Initially Francis said Cummings may partner on STEM outreach with companies like Raytheon which runs several STEM programs including Math Moves U and supports programs like Girls Who Code.

She welcomes the chance to be a role model for girls to consider careers in engineering and other advanced technical fields noting that she used her degrees in math and computer science to get into engineering.

“To me it’s opening young girls’ minds to the fact that you can be problem solvers and use critical thinking and not to be afraid to try on all the areas of technology and math that are available to them today” said Francis a board member of the Arizona chapter of Women in Defense an affiliate of the National Defense Industrial Association.

In 2019 only 13.8% of aerospace engineers employed in the U.S. were women according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“I’d love to get that to more like 35% or 40%” said Cummings. “The aerospace field is hard obviously but I think if we start at the elementary level to really try and get students interested in that discipline of engineering we can be successful long term in raising that percentage.”

Cummings a member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina says she also wants to help support local tribes in Arizona.

For now Francis is focused on hiring systems software mechanical and electrical engineers as well as operations staff for the company’s Tucson office.

Cummings is looking for full-time employees and offers a comprehensive benefits package including an employee stock ownership plan.

It’s been a couple of difficult days for Ken Roczen. Despite putting in solid rides all week in Houston he’s leaving Texas with a bitter taste in his mouth after being penalized four points (for jumping on a waving red-cross flag which he claimed he did not see) following Tuesday’s race and then having a seemingly sure win pulled out from underneath him by a lapped rider. So it’s quite understandable why he’d want to punch a hole in a wall with his fist which he said he wanted to do from the podium after the third and final race at NRG Stadium in Houston Texas round three of the Monster Energy AMA Supercross Championship.

Roczen (Honda HRC) took the lead away from holeshotter Cooper Webb (Red Bull KTM) on the third lap and led the next 23 laps all the while holding Webb at bay. On the final go-around however a lapped rider Dean Wilson momentarily stalled Roczen’s progress through a couple of turns which almost caused Roczen to crash allowing the persistent Webb to get by Roczen and take the win moments later.

“It was a close race the whole time and Kenny rode a solid race with not many mistakes” Webb said. “The track was really tricky easy to over-ride and get impatient. The lappers there at the end was a bummer I felt like we were going to have a really good battle and obviously we did but the lappers were really tough tonight. I hung in there and I pounced on that last lap and made it happen.”

Webb crossed the finish line just 0.468 seconds ahead of Roczen to take his first win of the young season. A thoroughly disgusted and upset Roczen who was obviously not happy with Wilson took second.

“He [Wilson] said he didn’t hear me but I’m sure there were blue flags [too]” said Roczen. “I feel that if it wasn’t for the Dean incident the night would’ve been mine.”

After the race Wilson took to Instagram to apologize to Roczen: “First off I f’d up” he wrote. “I fully own this. I never knew it was the leaders behind me. Kenny I’m sorry and sincerely apologize. I ruined your race and I wish I could take it back. I know the fans are pissed and team which I would be too. I hate that I was that guy in the way and ruined a win and a race. I should have been more aware of who was behind me. I just got locked in on the guys ahead… I can’t apologize enough for pretty much being the idiot of the race. Once again I’m sorry. Sucks to be that guy…”

Roczen responded saying “Accepted. Also though put yourself in my shoes. It is extra big because these points are valuable and this win was mine if you weren’t in front of me for 3/4 of a lap three points here four points last weekend… I mean it’s starting to get kind of funny. Anyway I don’t want to hold grudges. Just be aware of your surroundings. Thank you.”

Roczen later said that he’s not going to dwell on the “Dean incident” or the penalty but instead focus on the next round coming up in Indianapolis.

Webb was happy that all his hard work paid off at the end and is now just one point out of first place in the championship with Roczen leading the way.

Adam Cianciarulo (Monster Energy Kawasaki) held third the whole way but didn’t have the pace of the two riders that were ahead of him. He crossed the finish line 14 seconds adrift Roczen in third.

Justin Barcia (TLD/Red Bull/GasGas) had the speed to win tonight but didn’t get the start he needed and a small get-off later in the race didn’t help. Barcia finished fourth approximately six seconds behind Cianciarulo.

Tuesday’s winner Eli Tomac (Monster Energy Kawasaki) the quickest rider in qualifying got bottled up off the start and completed the first lap in 10th place. He made passes but not quickly enough to be a factor for the podium. Tomac finished out the night in fifth.

Malcolm Stewart Aaron Plessinger Jason Anderson Zach Osborne and Justin Brayton rounded out the top 10 overall.

Dylan Ferrandis second on Tuesday was hampered by a bad start and finished 11th one spot ahead of Marvin Musquin who went down early in the race.

Roczen however will finally get to wear the red plate next Saturday at Indy as he holds a one-point advantage over both Webb and Barcia. Another five points back is Tomac followed by Cianciarulo Brayton and Stewart who are all close behind and tied on points.

Colt Nichols Gets First Win In Two Years

Colton Nichols reeled and passed his teammate Christian Craig to win the 250SX East main event.

In the 250SX East main Christian Craig couldn’t hold off his Monster Energy Star Racing Yamaha teammate Colt Nichols after leading the first 14 laps of the 20-lap race. Craig got out in front early and appeared to have things well under control but Nichols slowly chipped away at his lead as the race went along.

At one point Nichols passed Craig who fought back but Nichols was just too much for Craig or anyone else on this night for that matter. Nichols passed Craig again a lap later but he made it stick this time and Nichols took the win 3.4 seconds ahead of Craig. Nichols finished third in the opening Houston race second Tuesday and now first.

Third went to Tuesday’s winner Jett Lawrence (Honda HRC). The 17-year-old was dealing with a sore leg that he injured in qualifying yet he still won his heat race and finished out the night on the podium. Along the way however Lawrence took out Michael Mosiman (TLD/Red Bull/GasGas) in the main and had a visit from the AMA after the race. “I got a warning” he said. “A slap on the wrist.”

Jo Shimoda (Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki) had another strong performance finishing fourth while Mosiman ended up fifth.

Max Vohland (Red Bull KTM) who led much of his heat race finished sixth followed by Josh Osby (Phoenix Honda Racing) John Short (BarX/Chaparral/Ecstar/Suzuki) Kevin Moranz (Team TPJ/Fly Racing) and Thomas Do (Tech32/KTM Marseille).

Nichols and Craig are tied at the top of the championship leaderboard with 70 points apiece followed by Lawrence with 64 Shimoda with 56 and Mosiman with 53.

Austin Forkner did not race after injuring his arm in qualifying nor did RJ Hampshire after suffering a wrist injury in free practice. CN

QUALIFYING

Qualifying results from the Houston Supercross round three from NRG Stadium is complete and the biggest news comes out of the 250SX West class. Two of some of the class’ biggest stars were transported to the hospital and will not suit up for tonight’s program.

RJ Hampshire went down in free practice and will not race tonight. The Rockstar Energy Husqvarna Team rider returned to the pits under his own power after his fall but was transported to the hospital for evaluation for an undisclosed injury.

In the first timed 250SX East qualifying session Austin Forkner went down early and walked off the track holding his arm. Word from the Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki camp Forkner complained of pain in his shoulder and was taken to the hospital for evaluation.

Adding to the 250SX-class drama last Tuesday’s winner Jett Lawrence (Honda HRC) went down hard in the whoops and was slow getting back on his feet. He eventually rode back to the pits nursing his right thigh. However his crash came late in Q2 and he had already laid down a heater which put him second-fastest in the 250SX East class. Only Christian Craig (Monster Energy Star Racing Yamaha) was quicker.

Craig’s best time a 48.181 came in Q1 while Lawrence’s came in Q2 before he crashed.

Colt Nichols (Monster Energy Star Racing Yamaha) was third quickest followed by Michael Mosiman (Troy Lee Designs/Red Bull/GasGas) and Jo Shimoda (Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki).

Craig Tops 250SX East Houston 2 Qualifying

Christian Craig topped 250SX East qualifying.

In the premier class Eli Tomac (Monster Energy Kawasaki) picked up where he left off by ripping the quickest time of the day a 47.432 which came in Q2. Tuesday’s winner Tomac was nearly two-tenths quicker than the next-best rider Ken Roczen (Honda HRC).

The top six riders are all within a second of each other: Tomac Roczen Adam Cianciarulo Zach Osborne Justin Brayton and Cooper Webb.

Dean Wilson Justin Barcia Marvin Musquin and Aaron Plessinger round out the top 10.

Smartop/Bullfrog Spas/Motoconcepts Honda’s Vince Friese crashed at the end of the whoop section late in Q2 and was obviously shaken up. He was transported back to the pits. It is not yet known if he’ll suit up for tonight’s program. He officially qualified 17th.

Barcia winner of the opening round last Saturday hopes to bounce back from last Tuesday’s disaster after he broke off his bike’s shift lever when he clipped a Tuff Block and was stuck in first gear. However he’s slightly off the pace after the qualifiers.

Honda HRC’s Chase Sexton is sitting this one out after injuring his shoulder at round two on Tuesday.

However initial pricing for the GeForce RTX 3060 puts the card on par with GeForce RTX 3060 Ti prices. No retailer has officially revealed the prices of the GeForce RTX 3060 but CCL Computers is showing the cost of individual cards in the 'recently viewed' and 'similar products' panes on its website. We have included a selection of the prices below which vary between £457.12 and £513.86. CCL Computers has listed most at £499.99 though.

Those prices put the GeForce RTX 3060 at least £158.12 more expensive than NVIDIA's MSRP or 53% as a percentage. NVIDIA apparently does not plan to release a Founders Edition version of the GeForce RTX 3060 either so it remains to be seen which card will actually start at £299. Ultimately we suspect that prices of the GeForce RTX 3060 may not return to NVIDIA's MSRP until stock levels replenish. NVIDIA has indicated that this will be by May at the earliest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy83NzQ5MC9udmlkaWEtZXhwYW5kcy1nZWZvcmNlLW5vdy1pbnRvLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1hbmQtb3RoZXItY291bnRyaWVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA expands GeForce NOW into Australia and other countries,"NVIDIA will be expanding GeForce NOW game streaming service into Australia Saudi Arabia and Turkey sometime 'later this year'.

NVIDIA has just announced that it will be powering gamers in Australia Saudi Arabia and Turkey with GeForce NOW ""later this year"".

In an announcement on the official NVIDIA blog the company explained that it has signed new telcos into the GeForce NOW Alliance with Turkcell Zain KSA and Pentanet these new companies join current GeForce NOW Alliance members in Softbank KDDI LG Uplus Taiwan Mobile and GFN.RU.

NVIDIA reminds us that GeForce NOW brings real-time ray tracing to some of the biggest games in the market to underpowered PCs Macs Chromebooks Android and iOS devices. The company adds: ""It also offers an opportunity for the world's leading telecommunications firms to deliver high-quality low-latency PC gaming to nearly any device from the cloud. These partners form the GeForce NOW Alliance a partnership of operators using RTX Servers and NVIDIA cloud-gaming software to expand and improve cloud gaming globally"".

NVIDIA explained: ""By placing NVIDIA RTX Servers on the edge GeForce NOW Alliance partners deliver even lower latency gaming experiences. And this gives partners an opportunity to show the value of their broadband and 5G infrastructure to customers"".

""The newest GeForce NOW Alliance members join a growing group of telecommunications experts that includes Softbank KDDI LG Uplus Taiwan Mobile and GFN.RU"".

Now I will note as someone who lives in Australia that Perth is on the western side of the country and many thousands of miles away from any other major cities. This means that anyone else outside of Perth and Western Australia (the state in which Perth is) will receive more latency as the servers are thousands of miles away. If you're in Sydney then you're literally on the other side of the country -- almost coast-to-coast away as wide as the US. Think LA to NYC.

NVIDIA does add at the end: ""Stay tuned as we work with additional partners to bring cloud gaming to new regions throughout 2021 and beyond"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRzb2dhbWluZy5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMjA3MC1ncHUtdXBncmFkZWQtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC0xNmdiLW9mLXZyYW0tYnktcnVzc2lhbi1oYXJkd2FyZS1tb2RkZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU upgraded to support 16GB of VRAM by Russian hardware modder,"Hardware modding is not what an average gamer or end-user might be doing on a daily basis but that has never stopped anyone to experiment with it since some people have the knack for it. Meet Russian YouTuber VIK-on who recently modified and upgraded his Nvidia GPU.

VIK-on published a video in which he shows how he upgraded his Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 GPU which sports 8GB of VRAM to 16GB VRAM. The user modified his PALIT GPU and successfully removed the original Micron 8Gb modules and replaced them with Samsung 16Gb GDDR6 memory as listed in the PCB/board schematics provided to him.

VIK-on was sent a leaked diagram of the RTX 2070 16GB GPU variant which showed him how to configure the board to support the 16Gb memory modules. According to the leaked diagram the RTX 2070 can support both 1GB and 2GB GDDR6 chips from Samsung and the modder used 2GB chips to make 16GB of total VRAM capacity.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 graphics card came out in October 2018 and was based on the TU106 GPU core and was having a total of 8GB of GDDR6 memory. There was no 16GB SKU released by Nvidia though there were rumors that we might get 16GB cards with the SUPER lineup but that didn’t materialize either.

The user was able to purchase these Samsung memory chips from aliexpress.com website for roughly 15000 rubles which amounts to $202 USD.

Regarding the procedure Tom’s hardware explains

“To start the upgrade process VIK-on used a heatgun to detach the current Micron GDDR6 chips equipped on the RTX 2070. Next he moved some resistors on the back of the PCB (behind the GDDR6 chips) which allow the Samsung chips to be hardware compatible with the RTX 2070. Finally he grabbed eight 2GB Samsung GDDR6 modules and installed them onto the boar.”

“Next VIC-on was able to start the bootup process and the RTX 2070 posted perfectly with the Samsung chips installed.”

After the modding was over the graphics card was correctly recognized by the GPU-Z software and the user also ran a FurMark test on the GPU. Booting into Windows OS was also seamless. However the card was unstable during the test and full load which lead to system crashes black screen issues and erratic GPU clock behavior.

This could be due to some soldering and/or firmware issues.

The user however ran the 3DMark Time Spy test in which the card scored 6176 points in Time Spy Graphics which is just an average score but still decent for a user modified GPU.

Had the GPU not exhibited an abnormal behavior the procedure would have been almost fully successful but in any case this surely is an impressive feat in itself. The warranty of the GPU is obviously “void” now after this modification.

Back in September NVIDIA and SoftBank confirmed the chip giant's intentions to acquire Arm for $40 billion. In the intervening months since the announcement tech giants and governments alike have shown a range of reactions from hesitance to outright opposition to the transaction. Arm has a history of licensing its ISA to just about anyone leading to a huge variety of SoC makers crafting chips for all kinds of usage from smartphones to autonomous vehicles. That's why NVIDIA still faces so many questions from policy makers and regulatory agencies around the globe.A fresh report from Nikkei says that NVIDIA's plans to acquire Arm face big questions from governments worldwide and that still four months after the announcement there are still obstacles to overcome. NVIDIA competes directly with many companies who are current Arm customers including Qualcomm Samsung Intel AMD and Apple. Globally the report says many regulators are still concerned that these companies would face unfavorable changes in licensing or other issues that NVIDIA itself would not face because it would own the Arm ISA. These same questions have been circling for months and so far no government agency worldwide has been totally satisifed.In late December the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sent a ""second request"" to NVIDIA. This is a formal process by which the FTC expects NVIDIA to share additional details and documents related to anti-trust concerns including how it intends to keep Arm accessible in a way that does not hurt the company's rivals. This is a good sign that the U.S. is taking this acquisition seriously according to Japanese lawyer Takafumi Uematsu. ""The first hurdle [for the SoftBank-Nvidia deal] to clear is the FTC's investigation. The results of the U.S. investigation is likely to affect regulatory actions taken in the EU China and other markets"" said Uematsu.The Nikkei report also says China holds a key decision on whether NVIDIA can acquire Arm because Arm Holdings owns 49% of Arm China. The remaining 51% belongs to an equity firm linked to the Chinese government. As a result Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation will get to decide whether that can be transferred to NVIDIA. Last year SAMR did finally approve NVIDIA's purchase Mellanox Technologies after more than a year of investigation. Similar delays would not be a surprise here.Even weeks after the announcement SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said he was not concerned about the sale . At the time Arm co-founder Herman Hauser was less optimistic. More recently Hauser has set up a campaign to oppose the NVIDIA acquisition. That site includes an open letter directed to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in which he says that Arm is the only British company at the forefront of mobile phone technology and that the U.K. should block the deal.For its part NVIDIA has pushed forward with its goal of acquiring Arm. In a statement NVIDIA said ""With its proposed acquisition of Arm NVIDIA will be able to turn new AI possibilities into realities much faster."" The company also promised to continue to push Arm's open licensing model and maintain customer neutrality. The deal is still on pretty uncertain ground considering so much is at stake. We'll continue to monitor progress and report events as they happen."

Coming out of a dreadful year for vehicle sales (research points to a global double-digit percentage plunge for vehicles sold in 2020) the new year could mark a return to year-over-year growth for the auto industry. Plus ""connected car"" tech is in higher demand than ever before and electronic components -- now comprising some 40% of a car's cost -- are only expected to continue rising.

For auto suppliers like NXP Semiconductors (NXPI -0.38%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 1.27%) this potential dual tailwind would be great news. I think both are a solid bet on the auto industry long-term but one looks like the better buy right now.

NXP: Making personal transportation a connectivity hub

NXP is a specialist in connectivity semiconductors for a number of industries including for 5G mobile networks but the auto industry is by far its largest end market. Even in a bad year for its manufacturing partners revenue derived from automotive was well over 40% of NXP's total revenue.

Because of the decline in auto sales in the last year NXP's revenue was down 7% year over year through the first nine months of 2020. However top-line results are rallying quickly as economic activity gets back to normal and auto manufacturers are implementing more of NXP's tech -- everything from advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) for increased safety and vehicle autonomy to electric vehicle powertrain management to infotainment and mobile connectivity. And as sales recover free cash flow (basic profitability measured as revenue minus cash operating expenses and capital expenditures) is on its way to recovering too.

Coming out of a global economic crisis this chipmaker is in decent shape. Cash and equivalents totaled $3.57 billion and total debt $9.36 billion at the end of September 2020. Subsequent to its last quarterly update NXP redeemed some of this debt for $1.83 billion using cash on balance. As it continues to recover with the global economy NXP is set to become a leaner cash-generating machine paired with gradual growth potential from its portfolio of connectivity chips.

This could also be a solid income stock in the making. While a dividend currently yielding 0.9% a year isn't much to write home about now NXP just started doling out this payment in 2019. And the payout used up less than a third of free cash flow generated through the first nine months of 2020. There's thus plenty of room for NXP to grow its shareholder return over time. Trading for just under 29 times trailing 12-month free cash flow as of this writing this is a solid bet on a global auto industry rebound and vehicle technology and connectivity growth paired with a small side of dividend income.

Texas Instruments: The old stalwart in reliable income growth

While NXP is an emerging income stock Texas Instruments is an old reliable in this department. The company currently pays a 2.3% dividend yield and has raised the payout every year since 2004. With the dividend together with the company's share repurchase program TI has the goal of returning all of its free cash flow generated to its shareholders.

And like NXP it hasn't been an easy year for TI. It also had to deal with the slump in the auto industry and will benefit from a recovering global consumer rebound in the years ahead. Nevertheless even a bad year of financial performance for TI would be a banner one for many other firms. Revenue and free cash flow were down 6% and 15% respectively through the first nine months of 2020 compared with 2019 but free cash flow profit margin remained at an enviable 34%. This performance prompted a 13% dividend payout hike last autumn as TI's end markets make a comeback.

TI will also benefit long-term from new vehicle technology and electronics components comprising a greater share of production costs. It continuously invests in research and development of new chip designs -- similar to NXP with ADAS and powertrain components along with other semiconductors for the communications and consumer electronics industries. It also has a best-in-class manufacturing operation that has a long track record of getting more efficient over time. Free cash flow averaged an 11% per year increase from 2004 through 2019.

At the end of September 2020 TI had $5.52 billion in cash and short-term investments and only $6.80 billion in debt. As of this writing shares can be bought for 31 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. For a proven leader in chipmaking and shareholder return it's not a terribly unreasonable premium.

Which is the better buy?

Texas Instruments' stock currently trades for a premium to NXP Semiconductors' but the higher price tag is worth it in my book. TI has a proven track record of profitable growth. And while NXP gets my nod as a solid bet on a recovering auto industry and global consumer in general TI will also get a similar bump in the years ahead as the effects of the pandemic wear off. TI also has a stronger balance sheet to work with as it develops next-gen semiconductor tech and improves on its manufacturing processes. NXP is worth considering but Texas Instruments looks like the better buy to me at this juncture.",,,,,,,,,,,,

There may not be answers to the Christmas Day bombing in Nashville anytime soon.

""Bombing investigations can take years"" Darrell DeBusk an FBI spokesman based in Tennessee told The Tennessean.

As of Friday a motive in the bombing remained under investigation by the FBI the ATF and Metro Nashville police. So did the type of explosives used to detonate the blast.

Yet internet sleuths are searching for their own answers some looking at thin ties to conspiracy theories about the 2020 election as evidence of a broader plot.

A widely shared post on Facebook alleges that four days before the bombing a rumor circulated that AT&T was awarded a contract to audit Dominion's voting machines which were supposedly being sent to Nashville. It also claims the AT&T building that was affected by the bomb is where those machines were being stored.

""The loud speaker was to warn people that the bomb was going to go off.. 5:30a on Christmas morning was picked to ensure that nobody was around.. It wasn't meant to kill people but to destroy a building. The question is.. why?"" the post reads. The user who created the post did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.

Other posts on social media have gone a step further alleging that Dominion is tied to the bombing through ownership of the affected AT&T building.

""Coincidence? The ATT building in Nashville that was affected by the bomb was owned by Cerebus (sic) Capital. Owners of Dominion Voting Systems(the company many people are accusing of voter fraud) are former executives from Cerebus"" another post reads. That user did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment either.

What we know about the bombing

Early Christmas morning police in Nashville came across an RV parked on Second Avenue outside an AT&T transmission building while responding to reports of shots fired in the area Metro Nashville Police spokesperson Don Aaron told The Tennessean that day.

There was no evidence of a shooting but both officers and witnesses heard a warning blare from the RV: ""Evacuate now. There is a bomb. The bomb is in this vehicle and will explode."" The broadcast then began a 15-minute countdown before the RV exploded according to The Tennessean. The bomb squad was en route.

The bomber was later identified by U.S. Attorney Don Cochran as Anthony Warner 63 according to The Tennessean. DNA found at the scene matched Warner's according to an FBI press release.

""Anthony Warner is the bomber. He was present when the bomb went off and he perished in the bombing"" Cochran said.

The explosion disrupted AT&T wireless and internet services leading to widespread 911 issues in the Nashville area The Tennessean reported.

Posts mix up AT&T buildings

The posts on social media allege the bombing is tied to Dominion Voting Systems an election technology supplier that's been central to many right-wing QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. But to draw that connection a number of other groups are brought into the fold — and it doesn't add up.

First QAnon. At its core is the prediction that an alleged mass arrest of high-profile Democrats and celebrities would be carried out while now-former President Donald Trump secretly saved the world from a satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals. The conspiracy theory has grown into a movement that is promoted by right-wing extremists.

Now the alleged Dominion Voting Systems tie. Dominion was acquired by private equity firm Staple Street Capital co-founded by financiers Hootan Yaghoobzadeh and Stephen Owens in 2018. Both sit on Dominion's board.

Before starting Staple Street Capital Yaghoobzadeh worked as a senior vice president for private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. According to the post that firm owned the AT&T building outside of which the Christmas bombing occurred.

Cerberus Capital did briefly own an AT&T building but the post is wrong about which one.

More on Dominion:Fact check: Viral photo shows fake logo and slogan for Dominion Voting Systems

The Christmas morning bomb went off on Second Avenue outside an AT&T transmission building. Cerberus Capital previously owned the AT&T Building once known as the BellSouth Building where the company has operated its Tennessee headquarters since the building's erection in 1994. That building is located at 333 Commerce St. roughly a quarter mile from where the bomb went off.

The Batman-shaped skyscraper was first owned by Prefco XIV a limited partnership of Pitney Bowes which bought the building in 1994 for $100.8 million according to the building's deed. In 2006 Cerberus Capital acquired it according to a 2006 News Channel 5 Nashville report. The company put the building back on the market shortly thereafter; MetLife Inc. through subsidiary Prefco Fourteen now owns the building public records show. James Murphy a spokesperson for MetLife confirmed the company owns the building.

The AT&T building on Second Avenue is owned by BellSouth Telecommunications an operating company of AT&T according to local records.

Owens the other co-founder of Staple Street Capital did not work for Cerberus despite the post's claim. He has independently become part of the broader Dominion conspiracy theories though with some claiming he's Joe Biden's brother-in-law. That's false.

AT&T wasn't contracted to audit Dominion spokespeople confirm

AT&T was not contracted to audit Dominion Voting Systems' machines and no Dominion machines were being held in the building outside of which the bomb exploded spokespeople for both AT&T and Dominion confirmed.

""Dominion and AT&T have both called on the media and the public to reject the baseless rumors circulating on social media which suggest without evidence that there was some election-related connection to the Nashville explosion"" a spokesperson for Dominion told USA TODAY.

More:Fact check: No Joe Biden's brother-in-law does not own Dominion Voting Systems

Jim Greer a spokesperson for AT&T told USA TODAY the claims are ""not true.""

Both Snopes and AFP reached the same conclusion. Dominion told AFP the claim is ""another bizarre lie being spread by known conspiracy theorists.""

Dominion has played a central role in a number of unfounded conspiracy theories alleging election fraud from foreign ownership to switching votes from one candidate to another. The company recently threatened a number of groups repeating the claims with lawsuits including One America News Network Newsmax and Fox News.

Our ruling: False

We rate this claim as FALSE because it wasn't supported by our research. The AT&T building the posts likely refer to was not the one outside which the bomb exploded on Christmas morning. Both Dominion Voting Systems and AT&T confirmed the communications company was not contracted to audit Dominion's machines.

The Philadelphia Phillies are hiring Embry-Riddle baseball pitching coach Victor Diaz as their Gulf Coast League affiliate's pitching coach.

Diaz joined ERAU in the summer of 2018.

""Words cannot explain how thankful I am for the Embry-Riddle baseball program"" Diaz said. ""The players staff alumni and support of the program have made these past two-plus years memorable! Embry-Riddle will always hold a special place in my heart.""

A native of Perth Amboy New Jersey Diaz came to Embry-Riddle from Old Dominion and his efforts were immediately evident in the improvement of the ERAU pitching staff.

In his first season the staff ERA dropped by two runs per game and dramatically reduced opponent hits by three per contest. ERAU improved from 20-30 to 29-22 in 2019 en route to earning the program's first trip to the NCAA postseason.

The 2020 season was shaping up to be a continuation of the pitching success from Diaz's first year with the staff posting a 3.84 ERA the lowest team ERA in the ERAU NCAA era but the COVID-19 pandemic ended the promising season early.

Coming out of a dreadful year for vehicle sales (research points to a global double-digit percentage plunge for vehicles sold in 2020) the new year could mark a return to year-over-year growth for the auto industry. Plus ""connected car"" tech is in higher demand than ever before and electronic components -- now comprising some 40% of a car's cost -- are only expected to continue rising.

For auto suppliers like NXP Semiconductors (NXPI -0.38%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 1.27%) this potential dual tailwind would be great news. I think both are a solid bet on the auto industry long-term but one looks like the better buy right now.

NXP: Making personal transportation a connectivity hub

NXP is a specialist in connectivity semiconductors for a number of industries including for 5G mobile networks but the auto industry is by far its largest end market. Even in a bad year for its manufacturing partners revenue derived from automotive was well over 40% of NXP's total revenue.

It has been almost half a year in a blink of an eye since we launched this ""Customer Value of Automotive Business"" blog series. Through our introduction I believe that readers have a better understanding of Renesas' automotive semiconductor products solutions and activities for the automotive segment.

In this blog I would like to introduce the core values of Renesas Electronics' automotive business and what they will bring to customers during the COVID-19 time and after.

Due to the continued impact of COVID-19 pneumonia and the need to protect our climate whilst bringing new features to automotive the automotive market remains challenging.

However Renesas will continue to bring our core values to the market: open innovative and trusted. These values are not only a mere slogan but a promise we make to customers that is reflected in our decades of commitment to the global automotive market.

Let’s talk about the values.

Innovation continues to be in our DNA. Renesas has expanded its product portfolio of analog digital and power system solutions in the past years and is continuously investing in product development. We are providing solutions with the required power/performance balance at the same time ensuring functional safety and security which has an increasing importance with rising levels of automation and enhanced vehicle connectivity. We are constantly investing in R&D for products that make vehicles more comfortable safe and protect our climate with high efficiency. Another aspect is of course the level of integration and product and system level: each product integration and complete solution offering i.e. our winning combos makes the lives of our customers easier. This is part of our strive for innovation.

Image

Renesas offers open products and solutions including the R-Car consortium partnership program with more than 300 partners that allow customers to develop on their own or work with world-leading partners from our ecosystem to save time-to-market and resources.

At the same time in addition to providing open partners and transparent solutions Renesas is also committed to the formulation of industry standards. Renesas continues to participate in various standardization organizations such as for in-vehicle communication technologies and participates in essential standardization organizations for automotive software development. Simultaneously in response to the development and rise of autonomous driving in recent years Renesas has also joined consortia that drive new trends such as the ""Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium (AVCC)"". In the future we will continue to participate in the formulation of various industry standards actively and develop more partner projects communicate and cooperate with more companies with an open attitude.

Finally without the trust of customers our automotive business certainly cannot survive. Therefore being trusted has always been a point that we attach great importance to. Thanks to our customers' trust our automotive semiconductor business accounted for more than half of Renesas' entire company's turnover in 2019 and became one of Renesas' most essential businesses. This revenue is only possible because our automotive microcontrollers and SoCs also account for a high market share globally.

A shortage of semiconductor chips for cars is hampering German economic recovery officials from the country have said as they made pleas to Taiwanese manufacturers to help bump up supply to the auto sector.

According to a letter seen by news agency Reuters on Sunday Peter Altmaier the German economy minister asked his Taiwanese counterpart Wang Mei-hua to address the issue with suppliers.

He wrote: “I would be pleased if you could take on this matter and underline the importance of additional semiconductor capacities for the German automotive industry to TSMC.”

The country is home to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co which is the world’s largest contract supplier of semiconductor chips.

A number of factors have choked car supply chains in recent months and the delivery of semiconductors is high on the list. Legacy issues have come due to the former Trump administration’s actions against Chinese chip factories but more recent issues have come to light for the car industry due to supply chain issues caused by Brexit.

Chip manufacturing capacity has been stretched to its limit around the world as laptops fly off shelves for working from home and PCs and gaming consoles sell heavily. It has lead to chip firms such as Nvidia to warn of supply constraints.

Reuters reported that the shortage has put the breaks on production for Volkswagen (VOW.DE) Ford (F) Subaru (FUJHY) Toyota (TM) Nissan (NSANY) and Fiat Chrysler among other manufacturers.

The issues had also been reported earlier in January when Credit Suisse analysts said in a research note that the chip supply issues may limit near-term auto production for the industry. The note also said that industry officials said they are prioritising production of higher-profit vehicles.

Germany’s economy minister said he was looking to address issues for the short- and medium-term.

The Times-Herald received an email late Thursday from a citizen claiming that Six Flags is “eventually going to move out of its present location to Fresno” presumably because the park was dissatisfied with the alleged slow progress of Mare Island and the Solano County Fairgrounds’ 360 Project.

Vallejo City Manager Greg Nyhoff put his thumb down on any Vallejo-to-Fresno move.

“I have heard this baseless rumor about the park leaving Vallejo and according to park officials it sounds as if there is absolutely no truth to this report and the source reporting this is incorrect” Nyhoff said. “Councilmember (Pippin) Dew and Mayor (Robert) McConnell both spoke with the park manager about this rumor. The park manager informed them that she had spoken directly to the corporate office inquiring about the rumor and they verified that there was absolutely no truth to this story.”

“It is a false statement” Dew said.

With Six Flags owning the 135 acres its on — with an agreement to split parking revenue — “I wouldn’t imagine they’d be going anywhere. It’s a big investment” Dew said.

McConnell confirmed seeing the same “report” two weeks ago of the Six Flags-to-Fresno rumor and and he said that park management had also heard the rumor from a “trusted source.”

McConnell said he was told that the report “had no validity to it. At this point we understand that there is no move. There is no move planned.”

Six Flags spokesman Marc-Angelo Merino said it’s the park’s policy “that we don’t comment on rumors.”

Neither does Visit Vallejo the city’s tourist arm but “I can clarify that Visit Vallejo has not heard anything about Six Flags Discovery Kingdom moving to Fresno” said Visit Valljo president and CEO Michael Browne. “It is our understanding that they are happy here in Vallejo and look forward to making Vallejo their home for many years to come.

Six Flags is the No. 2 employer in Vallejo during non-pandemic summer seasons “and a welcome member of this community” Browne said. “It delivers significant tourism and economic development in the form of the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) to the City’s general fund and the Vallejo Tourism Business Improvement District (VTBID) assessment by the lodging community.”

Dew said Six Flags has been an important outlet for Vallejoans as much as tourists during COVID-19.

After a March pandemic shutdown Six Flags re-invented itself reverting to its animal showcase days in offering “The Marine World Experience” and adding a drive-up Holiday in the Park.

“I will say that I worked hard with the park and the county to get them open. It was all about being able to do it safely and give people that ability to go somewhere and experience something good for that mental well-being” Dew said.

“I think it really is a beacon of hope for the community and we will be able to get out to experience the rides at some point. We’ll have the animals in the meantime and still do the drive-through experience and provide that outlet for people” Dew said. “It breaks them from the daily grind of being stuck in the house.”

The originally-called Marine World Africa U.S.A. and its 500 animals outgrew its 62-acre home in Redwood City in 1985 after 17 years choosing Vallejo over Mountain View and Oakland.

Kramer was appointed to her new LA-based role leading ViacomCBS’s global licensing and marketing teams earlier this month following the departure of Barry Chamberlain and the company has now named the execs who will take on her previous remit that focused on Europe the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

Matt Downer SVP of sales in EMEA will add oversight of Benelux Southwest Europe (including Spain Portugal and Italian-speaking Europe) and the Middle East to his existing purview of the UK/Eire Greece Turkey and Russia.

Fellow SVP Philippe Renouard will add French-speaking Europe to his current remit which includes Nordics and Africa. He will also continue to work across activities at Miramax which ViacomCBS invested in last year as part of a $375m deal with Middle East giant beIN Media Group expanding his ‘content liaison’ role to other third-party content producers and special projects.

Bernie Schwab meanwhile now oversees German-speaking Central and Eastern Europe as well as expanding his work with the local Paramount Pictures and ViacomCBS divisions to increase revenue and create new business models.

Formats & Newspath

Michael Armstrong the ViacomCBS EVP who currently manages relationships with third-party studios will now also have responsibility across the international sales teams for formats as well as the CBS Newspath service.

Armstrong continues to report to former Paramount Pictures exec Dan Cohen while fellow Paramount alums Downer Renouard and Schwab report into Kramer who also worked for the Viacom-owned studio.

Cohen was named president of ViacomCBS Global Distribution Group last year and has a vast remit to monetise original content from CBS The CW and Showtime as well as shows coming out of Paramount Pictures Paramount Television Paramount Players Paramount Animation CBS Television Studios CBS News and the Viacom brands.

ViacomCBS has enacted a raft of changes over the past 12 months following its re-creation in 2019. Late last year Raffaele Annecchino replaced David Lynn to become president & CEO at its international division a move that followed a broader restructure of its worldwide business when ViacomCBS Networks International (VCNI) was broken into two brand divisions and three pan-regional management hubs.

Dr Muhebwa who oversaw the Project Management Unit (PMU) faces charges of causing a financial loss of over Shs108m to the Ministry of Health when he “deliberately sold off Global Fund dollars to DFCU bank in unfavorable rate than what Stanbic Bank had offered.”

Dr Muhebwa is indicted along with three others; Kampala City advocate Grace Kituuma Magala and two former DFCU bank staff Godfrey Lule the then head of treasury and Robert Katuntu the then managing director.

The suspects yesterday appeared before the Anti-Corruption Court to take their plea.

However their lawyers MacDosman Kabega Blaze Babigumira Fred Muwema Nsubuga Mubiru and Oscar Kahika raised objections and questioned the powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DDP) to prosecute them.

“This matter is up for plea taking but there are some pertinent legal and constitutional issues regarding the accused persons that need to be determined by the Constitutional Court before they can plead to the charges” Mr Kabega told the presiding Grade One Magistrate Sarah Langa.

Lawyer Babigumira submitted that Dr Muhebwa cannot enter plea as he is challenging the Ogoola Commission report findings before the High Court.

The Ogoola Commission which was headed by the former Principal Judge James Ogoola investigated the mismanagement of the Global Fund meant to fight HIV/Aids TB and malaria.

Commission findings

Among its findings the commission recommended that Dr Muhebwa be investigated and prosecuted for fraudulent foreign exchange transactions.

But according to Dr Muhebwa the commission was unfair to him because it did not accord him a fair hearing to give his side of the story which he states as unconstitutional.

Mr Kabega argued that the DPP cannot prosecute Mr Kituuma after DFCU bank entered into a consent judgment and signed a decree accepting that indeed it owed him money for the brokerage services he rendered to the bank before discharging him."

According to industry analyst SuperData  Cyberpunk 2077 sold a staggering 10.2 million copies in December 2020 giving it ""the biggest game launch of all time based on digital revenue and digital units sold (10.2 million)"".

""A successful marketing campaign and the reputation of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt provided the hype necessary for the CD Projekt Red title to break records despite issues including performance problems on consoles widespread glitches and the indefinite removal of the game from the PlayStation Store"" the company said.

The report went on to confirm that ""an extremely high share of digital sales (80 per cent) were on PC likely due to the delisting on PlayStation and overall state of the console versions"".

""Regardless of the short-term financial success the critical backlash means the developer will now have to invest significant resources fixing the game in order to rehabilitate its image before the launch of its next title"" the report added (thanks VGC ).

Talking of which – Cyberpunk 2077 customers who asked for refunds are reportedly not being asked to return the game .

According to a new report several customers who took developer CD Projekt Red up on its offer to refund Cyberpunk 2077 following its launch in December have received their money back but are still able to access the game. One person who bought the game's $250 collector's edition said that they ""still had everything"" including their physical copy of the game despite having received a Paypal transfer from CD Projekt Red that included the added sales tax.

Although a couple of weeks back during an emergency meeting CDPR president Adam Kiciński said that it was ""too early to judge"" what would happen to the game's DLC and multiplayer mode  free DLC is coming to Cyberpunk 2077 in ""early"" 2021 .

CD Projekt Red recently released a Cyberpunk 2077 update with a laundry list of bug fixes and stability improvements some of which were preventing players from making progress in the game. Though Patch 1.1 addresses a large variety of bugs and stability issues  CD Projekt says it's just the beginning of a series of updates that'll continue in the coming weeks with Patch 1.2 which the studio has described as ""larger"" and ""more significant"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3QucGgvc2hvcHBpbmcvdGhlLWxhdGVzdC1zaG9wcGluZy84NTAzMS9mbG93ZXItc2hvcHMtdGhhdC1kZWxpdmVyLW1hbmlsYS1hMzQ0MC0yMDIxMDEyNC1sZnJt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unique Flower Shops in Manila: Price Ranges Details,"(SPOT.ph) Valentine’s Day is right around the corner and we’re here to tell you that yes you should get that special someone a bouquet of fresh flowers—no ifs or buts.

Pepsi,"Comb through the annual reports of Coca-Cola and Pepsi and you will see the two rivals list one another as their main competition. White both are giants in the beverage field there is one key difference which could be the reason to pick one over the other.

About Coca-Cola: Sparkling soft drink brands for Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) include Coca-Cola Diet Coke Sprite and Fanta. The company also has a growing portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks that includes Powerade Vitaminwater Minute Maid Costa Coffee Fuse and Gold Peak.

Coca-Cola also owns a stake in energy drink maker Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and helps distribute the brand. The company owns a stake in growing sports drink company BodyArmor.

Sparkling soft drinks made up 69% of unit case volume for Coca-Cola in fiscal 2019. The company’s portfolio includes four of the top five non-alcoholic sparkling beverages with Coke Diet Coke Fanta and Sprite.

About Pepsi: Sparkling soft drink brands for PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: PEP) include Pepsi Diet Pepsi Mountain Dew and Mug Root Beer. The company’s portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks includes Gatorade bubbly Pure Leaf and Tropicana.

The Key Difference: The big difference between the two beverage giants is the huge portfolio of food brands owned by PepsiCo.

Under its Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats divisions Pepsi owns brands like Lay’s Doritos Quaker Oats Sabra Cheetos Fritos Tostitos Cap’N Crunch and Aunt Jemima.

Pepsi got 54% of its revenue from food in fiscal 2019 making its beverage division the smaller segment. The Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods North America segments made up 25% and 4% of overall fiscal 2019 revenue respectively.

Frito-Lay North America made up 45% of the operating profit for PepsiCo in fiscal 2019. This high margin segment has been a key to the financial success of the company over the years.

Financials: Coca-Cola has products in more than 200 countries. The company got 18% of its unit volume from the United States in fiscal 2019 with the rest coming from international markets.

Sales for Coca-Cola rose in fiscal 2019 but that came after three straight years of declining sales. Revenue was $37.3 billion in fiscal 2019. Net income for the company hit a five-year high of $8.9 billion in fiscal 2019.

Coca-Cola reported third-quarter revenue declined 9% year-over-year to $8.7 billion. Coca-Cola lost value share in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink segment.

Coca-Cola presently pays dividends of $1.60 per year equal to a 3.4% dividend yield. The company has raised its dividend 58 consecutive years.

Story continues

Pepsi got 58% of its revenue from the United States in fiscal 2019 and 42% from international territories. Revenue for PepsiCo was $67.2 billion in fiscal 2019 and was up year over year for the fourth consecutive year.

PepsiCo had revenue growth of 5.3% year over year in the third quarter to $18.09 billion.

The dividend yield for shares of Pepsi is 2.9%. Pepsi has raised its dividend 48 consecutive years.

Stock Action: Shares of Coca-Cola have fallen 14% over the last year. The stock is up 18% in the last five years and up 56% in the last 10 years.

Shares of Pepsi are down 2% over the last year. Shares are up 48% over the last five years and up 112% over the last 10 years.

What’s Next: Coca-Cola has made several acquisitions over the years to grow its non-sparkling soft drink segment. This could be a continued focus by the company.

Coca-Cola is also phasing out underperforming brands like Zico and Tab. A national launch of the company’s Topo Chico hard seltzer is happening in the first half of 2021 with distribution partner Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE: TAP).

Pepsi has been acquiring food brands to boost its more profitable business segment. Acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery will help strengthen the company in Africa and China respectively.

Benzinga's Take: Coca-Cola has a strong brand and international presence. The company has the higher dividend yield of the two beverage giants.

But the growing food portfolio of PepsiCo and the consecutive years of revenue growth could make the food and beverage giant the winner in this battle.

Currently patients wait about three months to get their second dose. Prof Chris Whitty the chief medical officer for England said this was a “public health decision” to get the first jab to more people across the country.

However Dr Chaand Nagpaul chair of the council of the British Medical Association (BMA) said the gap could reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. He said that while he understood the rationale behind the decision to delay the second dose the UK should follow “best practice” and reduce the wait time to six weeks.

Quick Guide How does the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine work? Show The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab is an mRNA vaccine. Essentially mRNA is a molecule used by living cells to turn the gene sequences in DNA into the proteins that are the building blocks of all their fundamental structures. A segment of DNA gets copied (“transcribed”) into a piece of mRNA which in turn gets “read” by the cell’s tools for synthesising proteins. In the case of an mRNA vaccine the virus’s mRNA is injected into the muscle and our own cells then read it and synthesise the viral protein. The immune system reacts to these proteins – which can’t by themselves cause disease – just as if they’d been carried in on the whole virus. This generates a protective response that studies suggest lasts for some time. The two first Covid-19 vaccines to announce phase 3 three trial results were mRNA-based. They were first off the blocks because as soon as the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 was known – it was published by the Chinese in January 2020 – companies that had been working on this technology were able to start producing the virus’s mRNA. Making conventional vaccines takes much longer. Adam Finn professor of paediatrics at the Bristol Children’s Vaccine Centre University of Bristol Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

While there is some evidence from trials of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that a late second dose up to 12 weeks does not interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine Pfizer has said there is no evidence from its trials.

Nagpaul pointed to analysis from the World Health Organization that said second doses of the Pfizer vaccine should only be delayed “in exceptional circumstances” and recommended a gap of four weeks between doses.

“Most nations in the world are facing challenges similar to the UK in having limited vaccine supply and also wanting to protect their population maximally. No other nation has adopted the UK’s approach” Nagpaul told BBC Breakfast on Saturday.

“Obviously the protection will not vanish after six weeks but what we do not know is what level of protection will be offered … we should not be extrapolating data where we don’t have it. I do understand the trade-off and the rationale but if that was the right thing to do then we would see other nations following suit.

“The concern we have … if the vaccine’s efficacy is reduced … then of course the risk is that we will see those who are exposed maximally to the virus may get infected” he added. “The other worry is that members of the population those who are at highest risk may not be protected.”

According to the government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation unpublished data suggests the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is still effective when the doses are administered 12 weeks apart. However Pfizer said it had only tested the vaccine’s efficacy when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart.

The BMA has written privately to Whitty to express its concern over the gap between doses. The letter seen by the BBC said the policy was “difficult to justify”.

“The absence of any international support for the UK’s approach is a cause of deep concern and risks undermining public and the profession’s trust in the vaccination programme” it said.

The letter also expressed concern that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine “does not produce sufficient neutralising antibodies and the potential to reduce transmission”.

The Public Health England medical director Prof Yvonne Doyle defended the decision to delay the vaccine saying it was based on “public health and scientific advice”.

“The more people that are protected against this virus the less opportunity it has to get the upper hand. Protecting more people is the right thing to do” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

“People will get their second dose. As supplies become available more people will be vaccinated. It is a reasonable scientific balance on the basis of both supply and also protecting the most people.”

The NHS originally planned to offer second shots of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks after the first in line with the procedure in the trials but the soaring infection rate forced a rethink in late December with the JCVI recommending first shots for as many people as possible in the highest-risk groups.

“This is highly likely to have a greater public health impact in the short term and reduce the number of preventable deaths from Covid-19” a JCVI statement said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vbm90LXN1cmUtYWJvdXQtdGhlLXBmaXplci12YWNjaW5lLW5vdy1pdHMtYmVlbi1hcHByb3ZlZC1pbi1hdXN0cmFsaWEteW91LWNhbi1zY3JhdGNoLXRoZXNlLTQtY29uY2VybnMtc3RyYWlnaHQtb2ZmLXlvdXItbGlzdC0xNTM3MTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Not sure about the Pfizer vaccine now it's been approved in Australia?

Two doses will be required at least three weeks apart. The vaccine can be given to people 16 years and older.

The Pfizer vaccine is based on mRNA technology a way of giving the body the genetic instructions it needs to make the coronavirus spike protein. The idea is to prime your immune system to mount a protective immune response if you encounter the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

As this is the first mRNA vaccine to be approved for humans some people have taken to social media to voice their concern. But you can strike these four myths about mRNA vaccines straight off your list.

Myth 1: they enter your DNA and change your genome

Our genome is the complete set of instructions for making all the molecules our cells need to function. Our genome is made of DNA a different type of molecule to the RNA in the mRNA vaccines. It’s generally not possible for RNA to become part of our genome.

The myth of mRNA vaccines modifying genomes may have surfaced as some types of RNA retroviruses such as HIV contain genes that make a protein called “reverse transcriptase”.

A retrovirus is a type of virus that inserts a copy of its RNA genome into the DNA of a host cell it invades therefore altering the genome of that cell. Taking the example of HIV reverse transcriptase can convert the HIV RNA into DNA so the HIV genes can enter our genome.

But SARS-CoV-2 is not a retrovirus and the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines don’t make reverse transcriptase. They only contain one gene: the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein.

So the only way the COVID-19 vaccine mRNA might enter your DNA is if you were unlucky enough to be infected at precisely the same time with HIV or another kind of retrovirus and this virus was active for the few short hours the vaccine mRNA was present in your cells. The chances of this happening are vanishingly small.

Unlike DNA mRNA doesn’t last long in our cells. The mRNA lasts just long enough to instruct the cell to make viral spike protein but will then break down like all the other thousands of mRNA molecules our cells make all the time.

Myth 2: they connect you to the internet

The Pfizer mRNA vaccine contains a piece of mRNA which is coated in a lipid (fatty) droplet. The lipid helps the vaccine enter our cells as the membrane holding our cells together is also made mostly of lipid. The vaccine and the membrane can fuse easily depositing the mRNA inside the cell.

Some other companies developing different mRNA vaccines are exploring mixing their vaccines with materials called “hydrogels”. The hydrogels might help disperse the vaccine slowly into our cells.

Bioengineers have used similar hydrogels for many years in different ways. For instance they’ve used them to help stem cells survive after being put inside our bodies.

The use of hydrogels for these stem cell (and other) implants has created a myth they’re needed for electronic implants which can be linked to the internet. Conspiracy theorists have jumped from implants to hydrogels to mRNA vaccines based on no evidence.

Since Pfizer’s COVID mRNA vaccines don’t include hydrogels as a component (nor do Moderna’s) this is not a concern. Though this wouldn’t be a valid concern even if these vaccines did use hydrogels.

Myth 3: they cause autoimmune disease

Autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis are chronic (long-term) illnesses where our immune systems attack our own cells.

It’s not entirely clear where this belief has come from but we don’t have any evidence to suggest mRNA vaccines can cause autoimmune diseases.

The fact mRNA is very short-lived inside our cells indicates this is highly unlikely because you would usually need a long-lived foreign agent to trigger a chronic autoimmune response.

Interestingly mRNA vaccines are now being designed and delivered to treat autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. However these are still at the early stage of development.

Myth 4: they make you infertile

Recent discussions on Twitter suggested antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might “cross-react” and also target a protein in the placenta. If the immune system attacks the placenta as the argument goes that could make women infertile.

The basis for this idea is that coronavirus spike proteins including that of SARS-CoV-2 have a very short region of similarity to a protein called syncitin-1 found in human placenta.

That amounts to a short stretch of five or six amino acids where three or four amino acids are identical between coronavirus spike proteins and syncitin-1. Proteins as long as the spike protein will always share tiny regions of similarity with other human proteins. Our immune system is trained to ignore this.

The chances of making antibodies that cross-react with syncitin-1 are very small.

There’s no evidence antibodies against any coronavirus cause infertility. If coronavirus spike proteins did lead the immune system to attack the placenta we’d see widespread infertility after common cold seasons which are caused by a range of viruses including coronaviruses.

It’s true pregnant women were not included in the clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine. Excluding this group from clinical trials is standard practice but many have argued more COVID vaccine trials should include pregnant women.

All technologies were new once

Of all the vaccine technologies being explored against COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have proved the most efficient in reducing the incidence of severe COVID disease.

However we still don’t fully understand their long-term safety as with all new medicines.

A major British doctors’ group says the United Kingdom should “urgently review” its decision to give people a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine up to 12 weeks after the first rather than the shorter gap recommended by the manufacturer and the World Health Organization.

The UK which has Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak adopted the policy in order to give as many people as possible the first dose of vaccine quickly.

So far almost 5.5 million people have received a shot of either a vaccine made by United States drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech or one developed by UK-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and Oxford University.

AstraZeneca has said it believes the first dose of its vaccine offers protection after 12 weeks but Pfizer says it has not tested the efficacy of its jab after such a long gap.

The British Medical Association (BMA) on Saturday urged England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty to “urgently review the UK’s current position of second doses after 12 weeks”.

In a statement the BMA said there was “growing concern from the medical profession regarding the delay of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as Britain’s strategy has become increasingly isolated from many other countries”.

“No other nation has adopted the UK’s approach” Chaand Nagpaul chairman of the BMA council told the BBC.

He said the WHO had recommended that the second Pfizer vaccine shot could be given up to six weeks after the first but only “in exceptional circumstances”.

“I do understand the trade-off and the rationale but if that was the right thing to do then we would see other nations following suit” Nagpaul said.

Yvonne Doyle medical director of Public Health England defended the decision as “a reasonable scientific balance on the basis of both supply and also protecting the most people”.

The doctors’ concerns came a day after government medical advisers said there was evidence that a new variant of the virus first identified in southeast England carries a greater risk of death than the original strain.

Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said on Friday “that there is evidence that there is an increased risk for those who have the new variant” which is also more transmissible than the original virus.

He said the new strain might be about 30 percent more deadly but stressed that “the evidence is not yet strong” and more research is needed.

Research by British scientists advising the government said although initial analyses suggested that the strain did not cause more severe disease several more recent ones suggest it might.

However the number of deaths is relatively small and fatality rates are affected by many things including the care that patients get and their age and health beyond having COVID-19.

The UK has recorded 97517 deaths among people who tested positive the highest confirmed virus toll in Europe.

The country is in a lockdown to try to slow the latest surge of the virus and the government says an end to the restrictions will not come soon.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

When John Beilein took over the Michigan basketball team in 2007 there was a lot of work to do. The Wolverines floundered in his first season but in his third year he caught lightning in a bottle. One big reason was former point guard Darius Morris.

Morris really took off in the 2010-11 season but in his freshman season (2009-10) he helped lead the team to an NCAA Tournament after having not made it in 11 years. He left after his sophomore campaign being drafted in the second round by the Los Angeles Lakers.

(KOLN) -The Nebraska men’s basketball program lost one of its legendary performers with the recent passing of James Buchanan. He died of natural causes at the age of 90 in Hudson. Fla.

Families struggling with their children's home learning have been given a helping hand by businesses and charitable groups.

Phillips 66 Humber Refinery at Killingholme has donated 100 laptops and software worth £45000 to local schools in support of pupils' home learning.

The donation came after Grimsby Live highlighted how some families with five children only had one device for virtual learning during the latest lockdown.

Other families who had no devices have been given support by Grimsby and Cleethorpes Liberal Democrats Les Bonner and Roy Horobin who have received scores of tablets iPads and phones to give to children.

They have been made available for use after being donated by Grimsby area businesses and generous individuals.

Phillips 66 said they wanted to help close the digital divide impacting young people whose education during the current pandemic is suffering from a lack of access of devices or the internet.

The laptops will be distributed among 14 primary and secondary schools in the Grimsby and Scunthorpe areas.

Darren Cunningham UK director and general manager of the Phillips 66 Humber said: “Children having access to devices at home for distanced-based learning is a national problem. With many households without access to a laptop tablet or PC many of our children are missing out on vital education. We are proud to be able to support some of our schools and help some children who otherwise would not be able to learn. Everyone has the right to an education.

""After the announcement of the latest lockdown it was revealed a quarter of UK students are unable to properly access online learning. Technology is something many take for granted but for those who do not have ready access this lockdown has widened this digital divide.""

There are around one million children without a device for home learning.

A recent report found that 25 per cent of UK students are unable to properly access online learning.

Mr Cunningham said Phillips 66 works to promote economic social and environmental advancement in the communities it calls home. The company is a long-term advocate of education and literacy which are at the core of the company’s philanthropy program.

Nina Stobart Phillips 66 public affairs lead added: “The Refinery Education and Charity team chose to support local students with their learning. These laptops will not just do that but also give those students back a feeling of belonging – being able to stay in touch with their friends and teachers – which will also benefit their wellbeing.

""When this pandemic is over we do not want a generation of children who through no fault of their own find themselves left behind. We are honoured to be able to support them.”

Joanne Woodhouse assistant principal at Havelock Academy in Grimsby said: “We are incredibly grateful to Phillips 66 and we know our students and their families will be too. Our online live learning offer is going from strength to strength and this will go to ensuring that more of our students can access our offer and continue with their learning.”

Jennifer Vincent director of employer engagement Scunthorpe said: “This level of support from Phillips 66 is phenomenal. Some of our students are in need of devices to enable them to continue their learning so these laptops will go straight out to support their learning journey.”

Also delighted is Sandra Fawn head teacher of Canon Peter Hall CofE Primary School in Immingham who said: “Our overwhelming thanks go to Phillips 66 for their generous donation of laptops to further support our pupils and families at Canon Peter Hall CofE primary school. This will enable more of our children to engage in their remote learning at home during the lockdown period and beyond.

""In addition it can never be overestimated how this will also support their wellbeing through online communication with their friends and staff in school. Thank you again on behalf of all our families at Canon Peter Hall.”",,,,,,,,,

Northwest Indiana missed the cut during this round of consolidation.

The Pittsburgh-based bank has branches in Munster Schererville Merrillville East Chicago Michigan City and LaPorte as well as multiple ATMs across Northwest Indiana.

PNC Bank is however closing a branch in Plymouth near South Bend which will be consolidated with a nearby branch on April 16.

""We constantly evaluate our branches together with our other available channels of banking to ensure that they are most effectively meeting our customers’ needs. As a result of these evaluations the decision was made to consolidate the Plymouth Branch with the Ireland Branch located at 4501 S. Michigan St. in South Bend"" Corporate Public Relations Director Marcey Zwiebel said.

Zwiebel said the need for brick-and-mortar branches wasn't as great since so many consumers have migrated online.

""There are more ways to bank with PNC than ever before via online mobile ATM phone etc. and we have continued to see our customers taking advantage of the investments we have made in these channels by altering the ways in which they have been banking with us"" Zwiebel said. ""Consider that approximately 77% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions during the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally during the fourth quarter deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels were 66% of total deposit transactions. These shifts in the way customers are conducting their banking transactions are important inputs that inform our branch consolidation decisions.""

PNC Bank won't say if any more branch closures are coming this year as it reevaluates its footprint.

""We typically communicate with our customers about planned consolidations 90 days in advance so we have not shared plans for any locations beyond April at this time"" Zwiebel said.

PNC Bank will soon be the fifth largest bank in the United States with $102 billion in assets once it completes its acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares Inc. for $11.6 billion.

Suspects nabbed in SUV: Crocker Road

Westlake police officers on Jan. 21 spotted a white GMC Yukon in the parking lot of the PNC bank on Crocker Road near Detroit. Police received information that the van was suspected of being involved in thefts from parked vehicles throughout Northeast Ohio.

As officers pulled up to the parked SUV a nearby back Volvo drove over a lawn and a curb to flee police who did not pursue it.

Police approached the Yukon which had four occupants inside and the driver backed into a Westlake Police Department vehicle several times while attempting to flee. It eventually drove headfirst into the PNC Bank building causing non-structural damage to the building.

Police took the four occupants of the Yukon into custody. One additional suspect was arrested inside the bank. The five suspects ranging in age from 29 to 39 listed addresses in Florida and Texas.

Several law enforcement agencies are investigating the group for break-ins of vehicles using stolen credit cards and passing fraudulent checks.

Westlake police filed charges for felony receiving stolen property against the five individuals: two women and three men. A 38-year-old Fort Lauderdale Fla. man one of the five was also charged with felony assault as he was the driver of the SUV that struck the police car and the bank building.

Other law enforcement agencies are expected to file additional charges.

The Volvo that fled a rental car from Florida was recovered Jan. 22 where it had been abandoned in Rocky River.

The decision to end Gambling Awareness Nova Scotia (GANS) is being criticized by a community group that received grants through the organization and which says there's now looming uncertainty about whether its work will be supported.

""In the middle of COVID ... isn't there more of a need to do this prevention work and community awareness work?"" said Bruce Dienes chair of Gambling Risk Informed Nova Scotia a non-profit that aims to reduce the community harms associated with gambling. ""This is the time when people are most vulnerable.""

Part of the funding for GANS according to the government's website was ""generated from a percentage of VLT revenues matched by the Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation.""

The province said in a statement that VLT retailers provide about $250000 annually to support mental health and addictions services.

The province did not say when the organization was dissolved but Dienes said he learned of it in the fall and GANS's regulations were changed in October.

He said he was told by the Department of Health and Wellness that because of ""new information"" it had come to realize there are comorbidities with gambling also associated with depression and anxiety which justified sharing the funds more widely.

""The idea that this is new information is ridiculous we've known this for decades"" he said.

VLTs are known to be the most addictive form of gambling due to the flashing lights neon colours and reward method of reinforcement. (John Woods/The Canadian Press)

Dienes believes the province made the move as a way to deal with the ""profound lack of funding for mental health in Nova Scotia.""

No one from the Department of Health and Wellness was available to speak to CBC for this story.

In a statement spokesperson Marla MacInnis confirmed that GANS will become part of the overall mental health and addictions budget — which is roughly $300 million annually — citing changes in the last two decades around gambling and how best to support it.

""Problem gambling often occurs with other mental health and addictions issues and due to the stigma people often initially seek help for other issues. It's best if people can access support that addresses these issues together"" MacInnis said.

One of the consequences of the pandemic has been the restrictions placed on gambling in Nova Scotia related to public health protocols.

There were no sports games to bet on and many casinos and bars were ordered to closed. In the height of the spring COVID-19 lockdown counselling therapist Elizabeth Stephen said some of her clients simply stopped gambling.

""It was like a gift to some people that have problems that never really get that break"" said Stephen who is based in Halifax. ""Of course that didn't last long.""

After a second shutdown late in 2020 the province reopened the Halifax and Sydney casinos video lottery terminals and First Nations gaming establishments on Jan. 8.

Igor Yakovenko an assistant professor at Dalhousie University said international data found that gambling decreased in all forms as things were closed globally.

When restrictions loosened in Nova Scotia Stephen said some of her clients returned to gambling but it varied case by case. In some instances she said people who hadn't gambled in a long time returned to VLTs because of the ""wearing-you-down kind of stress of COVID.""

Yakovenko who is a clinical psychologist said there are many barriers for people to get help including not knowing where to go in Nova Scotia. He said research suggests that harm reduction and prevention are the most effective ways to help people.

""We need services and public health resources that minimize problems from developing in the first place or if you're already gambling they prevent you from escalating that gambling"" he said.

Earlier this month CBC News reported that the Atlantic Lottery Corporation is preparing to expand its online casinos to Nova Scotia and P.E.I. which would allow for bigger bets than what is currently allowed on in-person VLTs.

The pandemic is believed to have made a significant dent in Atlantic Lottery's revenues .

Dienes said having VLTs available online goes against the province's VLT moratorium which removes the gaming devices if a bar shuts down instead of reallocating them.

""They call them the crack cocaine of gambling"" he said. ""To backtrack on that acknowledgement of the danger of VLTs and to be slowly getting rid of them and to move to amplifying that on the internet with essentially unlimited access is appalling. It's totally irresponsible.""

Atlantic Lotto launched an online casino for New Brunswick residents in August 2020. An online casino was approved in P.E.I. last month and is being proposed for Nova Scotia. (CBC)

According to the Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation's website there are 2012 VLTs in the province and 651 VLTs in Mi'Kmaw communities.

Both the Nova Scotia Department of Finance and Atlantic Lottery say the implementation of online casino-style games in Nova Scotia is still being evaluated. Neither provided a timeframe for when a decision will be made.

Greg Weston a spokesperson with Atlantic Lottery said they regularly consult with responsible gambling experts when developing new products. He also said he believes it's important to offer a regulated alternative to the 3000 offshore gambling websites available to Atlantic Canadians.

""One benefit would be to repatriate players now playing with illegal offshore providers and by doing so repatriating money being spent on offshore sites to help fund public services to benefit Atlantic Canadians"" he said in a statement.

Both Yakovenko and Stephen hope the province consults with experts in the area and uses current research in deciding whether Atlantic Lottery should be allowed to move to an online casino model.

""From my perspective the risks far outweigh the profits"" Stephen said. ""Someone has to lose in order for us to make money.""

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Key Metric: Prices

Procter & Gamble rode higher prices to increased revenue in its December quarter. But the upcoming earnings report could show the lowest price increases by the consumer goods seller since the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with analysts forecasting that P&G will hike prices by 2.75% in the quarter.

It could also be the first quarter in two years where the consumer giant reports positive annual growth in sales volumes with expectations for a 0.35% increase.

Business Spotlight

Procter & Gamble’s report comes after it detailed a $1.3 billion impairment charge for its subsidiary razor business Gillette forcing the company to reduce its 2024 full-year guidance for earnings per share (EPS). However the company said it was able to maintain its forecasts for 2024 revenue and it announced earlier this month that it would boost its quarterly dividend by 7%.

“We delivered strong results in the second quarter enabling us to raise our core EPS growth guidance and maintain our top-line outlook for the fiscal year” Procter & Gamble CEO Jon Moeller said after last quarter's results.

Analysts expect P&G to report its largest gains from its biggest segment with revenue from fabric and home care expected to jump about 3.6% year-over-year while its healthcare sales are also expected to increase across the same period. After beauty and personal care products helped pace P&G’s sales in fiscal 2023 revenue from that segment is expected to ease about 1%.

While this is valuable the intense focus on Biden as the lead actor in the drama distracts us from the Left’s own agency to shape the outcome of his presidency making us extras when for the first time in half a century we have the potential to be lead players. In the same way that Biden must radically evolve to govern effectively so must the rising progressive movement if we are going to play the change-making role that current events demand. Let me explain. In 1941 pioneering labor and civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph asked FDR what he could do to intervene against soul crushing racial oppression. ​“I agree with everything that you’ve said” FDR answered. ​“But I would ask one thing of you Mr. Randolph and that is go out and make me do it.” To forestall a march on Washington Roosevelt did take an important incremental step barring discrimination in war industries but Randolph was not in any position to create enough public pressure to force him to act more broadly. A political realist like Roosevelt was not going to blow off the segregationist leg of the Democratic governing stool. The most generous spin on Roosevelt’s deceptive answer: He was saying that the politics had to be workable because civil rights would otherwise undermine his power to govern. In this sense the challenge FDR put to Randolph is relevant for progressives in 2020: What would make the politics work for Biden? Progressives need a realistic view of the power dynamics at play. A toxic and mutually reinforcing mélange of ideology and pay-for-play politics makes placing progressives in key posts a heavier lift than making populist pronouncements and adding antiracist campaign planks. The huge corps of professionals that work as political consultants lobbyists staff Democratic campaigns presidential administrations and legislative offices are career-dependent on the plutocratic interests that fund the massive lobbying-campaign infrastructure. Imagine the panic from Wall Street to K Street had Biden named Elizabeth Warren Treasury Secretary rather than Janet Yellen who Robert Kuttner calls ​“basically a liberal who is respected by conservatives.” On the other hand Biden handed out top foreign policy posts to former Obama officials who became defense lobbyists and consultants after leaving government. The massive concentration of wealth has fueled an explosion of the influence industry: big money campaigns lobbying and strategic communications. As Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson document in their latest book Let Them Eat Tweets this is the natural result of a concentration of wealth without parallel in U.S. history or that of any liberal democracy. While extreme inequality has converted the Republican Party into a proto-fascist threat to democracy the Democrats have not escaped unscathed moving far less left than the Republicans have moved right on economic issues. Biden faces a perhaps inevitable conflict between the ascending progressives and the undiminished strength of the well-heeled shadow partners who put him in position to be President and will be a major source of his power. A big difference between 2020 and 1932 is that we can’t say as Roosevelt could in his First Inaugural speech ​“The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization.” Because of our rigged economic structure the money changers of 2020 have enjoyed a massive expansion of wealth at a time the bottom 50% of income earners are facing a depression. Can Progressives Meet the Moment? Progressives must also evolve if we are going to grow into a movement capable of holding up our end of the bargain. Secretary of the Labor Robert Reich’s memoir of the Clinton years makes no mention of organized progressives backing him from the outside and increasing his leverage he was largely on his own. Historically powerful and focused social movements have been indispensable to creating the conditions for reform presidencies. As Bob Master observes ​“a combination of crisis and mass movements transformed” some presidents ​“pushing them to enact far-reaching policies that were unimaginable at the beginning of their tenures.” We must up our game both in terms of raw organizing capacity and of governing philosophy if we are to push Biden in this direction. In a liberal democracy the only enduring counterbalance to organized money is organized people. Unless resources are channeled into movement building we will never reach the sustained scale needed to shift power from economic elites to average citizens and marginalized communities. Realistically a subset of the plutocracy needs to be on our side if we are to close the capacity gap with the radical right. While always the case for successful social movements in American history this inconvenient fact is usually scrubbed from collective memory and official histories. As Jesse Jackson was wont to say ​“The problem with tainted money is there ​’taint enough of it.” Despite the distorting influence of progressive-leaning foundations and the handful of progressive billionaires who can’t help but shift power away from organizers and leaders the resources they provide are indispensable if we are to compete with the concentrated economic arsenal of the right which claims a lion’s share of plutocratic support. Income inequality has built huge fortunes parked in foundations for tax purposes. The resurgence of organic activism on America’s streets in 2020 is a rare opportunity for social reckoning but this energy and inspiration must be translated into sustainable and long-term movement power to achieve its promise. The new mobilization methods made possible by social media digital engagement technologies and distributive organizing models also require external funding. While these techniques are critical to amplifying and bringing to scale the movement on the ground they will be co-opted by establishment forces if directed from on-high and not rooted in frontline communities experiencing the brunt of our unjust social and economic order. In contrast to the right wing infrastructure most progressive social justice groups are still working at a subsistence level on the brink of financial disaster and forced to dissipate a huge proportion of their energy competing with their peers to piece together narrow program grants in order to keep the lights on and pay living wages to professional organizers. The anarchic winner-takes-all structure of the nonprofit sector means large funders have trouble distinguishing between rooted organizers and pretenders who are skilled at self-promotion or who have privileged connections. Money is siphoned off by well branded national organizations who do not share them with community organizations. The biggest drain is political organizations run by well-connected operatives who want to do good but have no interest in structural transformation who burn through many hundreds of millions without leaving anything of value behind. The scale of base building needed to match overwhelming plutocratic power cannot be achieved without a reimagined and revitalized labor movement. The right and corporate America have done what they can to demolish unions because there is no precedent in any Western democracy for a progressive majority that is not backed up by a robust labor movement. Understandably many activists impatient for systemic change see elements of labor as allied to an oppressive establishment. The social justice movement must cultivate greater appreciation of the necessary role of organized labor. Restoring the right to join a union on a New Deal scale will diversify and radicalize both American politics and organized labor. The sectors ripe for organizing--retail fast food agriculture and food processing the gig economy low wage caregivers and paraprofessionals and the emerging green economy--have the potential to inject tens of millions organized workers of color into our movement and contribute more to economic and political equality than any governmental action within our reach. Hamilton Nolan writes that Biden has the most leftist labor platform of any nominee since the New Deal.”

The prospect of a progressive coalition with establishment Democrats raises the question of whether the Left has a workable governing philosophy. The progressive insurgency has grown primarily as a decentralized protest movement unaccustomed to holding a major share of power. As George Goehl executive director of People’s Action puts it: ​“We were outside throwing rocks for 30 years. Now we’re trying to move inside and it requires a whole different mindset whole new strategies.” Fortunately progressives are not starting from scratch. Professional organizers increasingly talk of co-governing and movement governing harbingers of a conceptual shift that could help build a more unified and effective American left. The emerging framework has roots in orthodox Alinskyism’s emphasis on power analysis and realistic roadmaps for winning concrete advances but radically departs from its narrow focus on hyperlocal demands and its notorious aversion to ideology. One of the leading advocates of this turn is Richard Healey who with colleagues at the Grassroots Policy Project adapted the three faces of power framework from political science for use as a radical organizer training tool refining it in practice with social justice networks such as People’s Action. This approach has gained so much traction that there are now a number of thought-leaders with closely related models for building incrementally towards structural reform including Demos President K. Sabeel Rahman and Harvard Political Scientist Archon Fong. These ideas echo in many ways democratic socialist Michael Harrington’s unheeded calls in the tumultuous 1960s and 1970s for ​“visionary gradualism” and ​“pragmatic radicalism” a road not taken by the American left of that era. Organizing in this style means building the capacity to achieve near-term advances that build movement capacity and power without which structural transformation is impossible. Veteran organizer David Hatch writes: ​“If we insist on an all-or-nothing approach that puts purity over progress we can snatch defeat from the jaws of our hard-won victory. This tension between principle and pragmatism lies at the core of co-governing and will always be there because the line between necessary and unacceptable compromise is never as clear as we’d like.” For example ​“defunding the police” sounds to many as complete abolition something the Left lacks the power and shared worldviews to accomplish anytime soon. A difficult but achievable near term stepping stone goal is shifting substantial resources to badly underfunded public services that improve public safety. The key is to coalesce around difficult but achievable demands that lead towards structural reform and build power rather than dissipating grassroots energy by taking on unwinable fights. This inherent dilemma has roots in the philosophy of prudence which was critical to the development of democracy in Britain and the United States. It is a stance for operating ethically under conditions of pluralism for sharing power with those with diverging values and objectives. A prudential frame of mind seeks a middle ground between rigid adherence to principle which is unworkable in pluralistic systems and pragmatism which can mean a surrender of core values to political expediency. A prudential frame of mind requires hard-headed and at times unsettling analysis of both the potential benefits and risks of a given compromise. Viewed in this way past compromises such as the structural racism of the New Deal Bill Clinton’s 1994 Crime Bill and bailing out the banks in 2008 rather than working people can be judged to have had long term consequences worse than their immediate benefits. It is also helpful to reconsider advances such as the celebrated Brown v. Board of Education decision. Derrick Bell one of the originators of critical race theory and a lawyer who was on the frontlines of implementation makes a brilliant prudential argument that the intractability of white racism made school integration a hopeless dream. As the Supreme Court’s decision was impossible to implement Bell argues that Black liberation would have been better served by the Supreme Court upholding ​“separate but equal” and finding that the education system unconstitutionally violated the equal component of the doctrine. In this sense Bell’s conclusion that racism is intractable if accepted has profound implications for devising a long term strategy.



Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) the newly elected chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus is reshaping the caucus into a more cohesive progressive force on Capitol HIll. Jayapal a longtime community organizer is shown here at a July 29 2020 Judiciary subcommittee hearing on whether online platforms like Amazon are violating antitrust law.

Such judgements are hard for leaders and activists and even harder for social movements. When Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Jayapal on behalf of the Sanders campaign compromised with the Biden team on health care she recognized the limits of what was possible but secured what she judged a major advance in the fight for a single payer system: ​“We knew we weren’t going to get Medicare-for-all. The question then for me was: How do we get some foundational pieces of Medicare-for-all even if the words ​‘Medicare-for-all’ aren’t there?” However having reached this fallback position for advancing a longer term goal with the full backing of the most influential progressive leader does not mean that activists across the country will accept it and mobilize at the level needed to push Biden to follow through and have a realistic chance of enacting it over ferocious opposition. An unfortunate all-or-nothing one might say absolutist mentality remains prevalent among many activists as was demonstrated in the primaries when Warren’s floated a pragmatic timeline for achieving Medicare for All for which she was promptly branded a sellout. Finding a cure for this condition and making it widely available should be a priority for the movement. A Model for Building National Progressive Power The most likely way to achieve this kind of strategic and tactical unity in 2021 is to erect temporary campaign structures within major issue areas. A promising model is the largest scale progressive grassroots lobbying effort in recent history: the Health Care for America Now Campaign (HCAN) campaign of 2008-2010 to pass the ACA. As is documented in a book by its campaign manager Richard Kirsch what makes HCAN a model for progressive governing power was its success in creating operational unity for thousands of grassroots groups and tens of thousands of activists. This held even as Obama’s advisors and a small band of neoliberal Senators weakened the bill eventually killing the public option its most galvanizing progressive feature which could have become an inroad into the corporate insurance monopoly. This unity also weathered a tense relationship with the Obama team which resented the campaign’s independence and froze it out of the decision-making loop. Importantly HCAN had unprecedented resources from foundations and organized labor to build out robust capacity raising around $60 million. Rather than creating expensive temporary infrastructure HCAN invested massively in existing state groups which already had organizing bases coalitions deep roots in communities local knowledge and other social capital. This sharing of resources promoted strategic alignment giving grassroots groups ownership in the campaign. When right-wing plutocrats unleashed the crazed ferocity of the Tea Party backlash which Rick Perlstein explained at the time was both manufactured and real the mainstream media and establishment Democrats found it incomprehensible. It was HCAN state partners who turned the tide out-organizing the radical right in the end. It is doubtful that ACA would have survived the onslaught without HCAN although this was never appreciated by an Obama administration that preferred astroturf campaigns run by Democratic operatives to independent progressive power. As there was no possibility of anything but a transactional relationship with Obama’s lieutenants HCAN did not approach anything like co-governing. The experience shows that even under difficult conditions progressives when organized to scale can be a major outside force on the defining issue of a presidency. Of course in 2021 we need exponentially bolder reform than the ACA in multiple fields which means multiple HCAN-scale campaigns. Our best chance for accomplishing anything like structural reform is a mobilized and aligned progressive base working with the Biden administration with enough progressives in key posts including hundreds of political appointments that will never reach the mainstream media to enable true inside-outside organizing strategies. This is not an all-or-nothing proposition but given the odds against the bold measures required it is hard to imagine the neo-liberal teams of the past three Democratic administrations rising to the historical occasion. The End Game: Meeting the Moment Carrots will not be enough progressive will also need bigger sticks. Given the backlash that anything remotely approaching a 21st Century New Deal would spark from Biden’s establishment shadow partners progressives in the field and in Congress will need strategic unity to block legislation and when necessary force their will on moderates. A handful of corporatist Democratic senators have done this for years and were able to force neoliberal health policy down the throats of the party during the process to pass the ACA. In the old Democratic coalition the southern party within a party had a veto power that it used to defend and further institutionalize structural racism. If progressives are going to take the next step towards building a proto party we likely need the leverage to impose core demands. The CPC has more than enough votes in the House to block any legislation more than double the size of the Freedom Caucus. The question is can the newly restructured CPC achieve enough internal unity and external alignment with the organized progressive grassroots to act so boldly? The difficulty of achieving anything like shared governance with Biden and establishment Democrats raises the question of whether progressives should even pursue it? Is there an alternative? With the surge of progressive opinion in the Democratic Party over the last two decades and an ongoing demographic transition in our favor would it be better to exercise influence where possible but largely stay on the outside continue to build a mass movement and play for a full progressive takeover of the Democrats in 2024? I don’t think so. I believe the historical turning point we now face imposes a profound moral obligation for progressives to immediately pursue a working coalition with moderates. There are three reasons a coalition with Biden’s establishment Democrats is the most likely path to timely structural reform. First there is no precedent for a complete takeover of American government by movement progressives or their rough equivalent but there is for center left alliances achieving structural reform. Past examples include the political antislavery movement that created the Republican Party in the 1850s that ended slavery and the Democrats of the 1960s who achieved civil rights voting rights Medicare Medicaid and other landmarks. The Progressive reformers who established the modern federal government in the first two decades of the 20th century and the New Dealers in the 1930s were led by establishment figures who believe their historical moments called for radical measures. FDR the leader Biden says he wants to emulate described himself as ​“a little to the left of center.” He told Frances Perkins that he agreed with the first stage of the socialist party’s agenda comparing it to his cousin Theodore’s 1912 ​“Bull Moose Party” platform but not their long term objectives.

Second for the foreseeable future the progressive and moderate wings of the party need each other to win elections and to govern. No matter which wing leads the top of the ticket neither is in a position to replicate the radical right takeover of the GOP. Given the surge in progressive opinion within the party the complete domination of Democratic administrations by moderates is no longer viable necessitating a coalition on much closer to equal terms than anything we have seen since the 1960s. The possible upsides are great. As E.J Dionne points out in Code Red a fusion of the capacity of progressives to mobilize and generate mass support for bold structural reforms with the moderate wing’s understanding of how power works in Washington has the potential to achieve a long term realignment of American politics. Third the national and global crossroads we face imposes a moral obligation not to roll the dice on a highly speculative progressive takeover in 2024. The failure of the Biden administration to markedly improve the lives of average Americans is more likely than not to produce a right-wing takeover perhaps led this time by a more effective authoritarian than Trump. We may dodge the first bullet because of Trump’s incompetence but may not escape a second. Now that American conservatism has evolved into an ultranationalist and antidemocratic movement bent on minority domination the stakes may well be as high as those faced by the political factions of Europe that failed to unify in opposition to fascism in the 1930s. Progressives must confront what Robert Penn Warren called the ​“awful responsibility of time.” To prevent the genocidal consequences of what will be unleashed by catastrophic climate change we need to cut greenhouse emissions nearly in half by 2030. It seems unlikely that a progressive president taking office in 2025 and having to work with moderates to pass legislation over ferocious opposition could pull that off in four years. Another right-wing presidency could seal the world’s fate. Nor can we wait another four years to reckon with the carnage of structural racism at every level of society dangerous and growing income inequality the murderous commodification of health and perhaps a working class depression. Theodore Roosevelt made the case that the takeover of the economy by massive corporations in the late 19th Century was so threatening that it required a revolution in governing philosophy to avert levels of inequality and domination that would tear democracy apart. He proclaimed during the epic 1912 campaign the first and only presidential election dominated by dueling progressives that ​“nine tenths of wisdom consists in being wise in time.” Now the two divergent wings of the Democratic Party face a challenge of even greater magnitude. The question is whether we can find the courage and moral fortitude to meet our moment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL2luZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1pcy10aGUtcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtc29sdXRpb24tdG8tdXMtY29sb25pYWxpc20taW4tcHVlcnRvLXJpY28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Independence Is the Progressive Solution to US Colonialism in Puerto Rico,"In his August 2020 eulogy to John Lewis Barack Obama characterized Puerto Rico and Washington D.C.’s lack of political representation on the federal level as a civil rights issue. The Democratic Party and some progressives have since called for statehood for Washington and Puerto Rico.

José López is the executive director of the Puerto Rican Cultural Center in Chicago. A long-time supporter of Puerto Rican independence he also worked to secure the release of successive generations of Puerto Rican political prisoners including his brother Oscar López Rivera. In this interview López refutes the idea that the 2020 plebiscite indicates majority support for statehood and explains why the solution to U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico is independence. He also argues Puerto Rico’s status is a human rights — not a civil rights — issue.

Margaret Power: How do you analyze the November 2020 elections in Puerto Rico?

José López: There were some very interesting outcomes to the 2020 general local territorial elections on the island. But first some background.

Local elections have been held in Puerto Rico since 1900 when the Foraker Act established a civilian government following the United States’ 1898 invasion of the archipelago. Since that time Puerto Rico has elected a resident commissioner to represent Puerto Rico in the U.S. Congress. However the commissioner lacks voting rights. Although Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens in 1917 they too lack voting rights as long as they live in Puerto Rico. They cannot vote for president senator or congressman. If they move to the United States they can vote in federal elections. In the November 2020 election Puerto Ricans cast their ballot for local and municipal officials in addition to a non-binding referendum on statehood (yes or no).

For decades there have been two large parties in Puerto Rico the pro-statehood Partido Nuevo Progresista (New Progressive Party or PNP) and the pro-Commonwealth Partido Demócrata Popular (People’s Democratic Party or PPD). Almost every four years they alternated as governors. After November 2020 this two-party system is literally gone because more than one-third of the electorate chose a third-party candidate. That hasn’t happened in decades probably not since the 1952 elections when the Partido Independentista Puertorriqueña (Puerto Rican Independence Party or PIP) got 19 percent of the vote.

It shows that when people went to the polls last November they were really thinking about possibilities. Alexandra Lúgaro who represented a new emerging party Movimiento Victoria Ciudanana (Citizen’s Victory Movement or MVC) ran for governor and [won] almost 14 percent of the vote. That is a huge amount. The PNP got 33 percent of the vote the PPD got 32 percent and the PIP got 14 percent; two other candidates received far fewer votes. That means that roughly 35 percent of the electorate did not vote for one of what had been the two major parties.

Five different parties now have representatives in the Puerto Rican House of Representatives and Senate. This is a major change. As a result there will have to be negotiations to determine who will be the leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

One other important change is the sizable number of women candidates especially at the levels of mayors and in the House of Representatives and the Senate. For example Ana Irma Rivera Lassén an Afro-descent lesbian from the MVC party was elected to the Senate. And three gay men from different parties also won seats. They really changed the makeup of a mostly a heterosexual and male-dominated House and Senate.

Many people have interpreted the non-binding referendum to be a vote for statehood. Do you agree?

It was a non-binding referendum that had no real merit and a single yes or no question “Should Puerto Rico be immediately admitted into the Union as a state?” That was the only option offered to voters. The statehood movement which received 623053 votes (or 52 percent of the vote) claimed it had won. But if you add up the real numbers you will see that that simply is not the case. Thousands turned in a blank vote on the referendum or didn’t vote in the referendum at all possibly because they did not recognize it as legitimate. Theirs was a protest vote. 1428075 people voted in the gubernatorial election but only 1190399 voted in the referendum. That means that over 237000 fewer people voted in the referendum than had cast their ballot for governor. If they were for statehood they would have voted. Compounding it all the voter turnout was lower than normal. Only about 32 percent of all eligible voters cast their ballot in the referendum making it the “lowest voter count in history.” So taking all these factors into consideration we can say statehood did not win.

But 44 percent of Puerto Ricans consciously voted for statehood. To explain this it’s very important to underscore the fact that the statehood movement put incredible resources into the movement. They launched a blitz that hit the whole island calling for statehood based on notions of equality civil rights and the idea that if Puerto Rico were a state then Puerto Ricans would get parity in federal funding for health education and welfare. The Puerto Rican people are desperate as a result of the 2017 Hurricane Maria and the continuous earthquakes that have plagued the island in the last year. In addition the non-elected Oversight Board (junta) created by the U.S. Congress to oversee Puerto Rico’s budget has imposed damaging austerity measures on the people. The real function of the junta has been to ensure the repayment of the unaudited debt to U.S. banks and financial sectors. It has done nothing to ensure the well-being of the Puerto Rican people. As a result Puerto Ricans are dependent on federal funds which are not dispersed equally in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is ruled under the doctrine of separate and unequal. A lot of people who are dependent on this funding said “Oh we are going to lose it unless we become a state.” The campaign for statehood appealed to a desperate population by telling people their livelihood was at stake. That was their prescription for getting approval.

The “no” vote had no physical presence anywhere. A group of people organized a grassroots movement but it had no access to the local media which boycotted it. So given that it’s impressive that statehood got only 48 percent of the vote.

The independence movement in Puerto Rico has a very long history. It is deeply rooted in the 19th-century fight against Spanish colonial domination. The movement seeks total sovereignty from the United States with a vision of providing social and economic justice for the people of the archipelago. The vote for independence went up?

Yes the vote for independence went up a great deal. If you measure it according to who had the highest individual vote in Puerto Rico it was María Lourdes Santiago. She’s vice president of the PIP and she won a Senate seat in a national election with votes from across Puerto Rico. She received 136679 votes while the two top vote getters from the PNP received only 81863 and 80139 votes respectively.

Why did more people vote for independence in this election?

The vote for independence was not at the level of the other two parties but the PIP did very well. And the at-large candidates from MVC had a very good showing. This all demonstrates opposition to the current administration and current politics in Puerto Rico. It demonstrates that new developments are taking place in Puerto Rican politics. This year the PIP had a young candidate Juan Dalmau for governor who articulated a clear vision for Puerto Rico. Exit polls and a large number of political commentators show he drew most of his votes from the young people of Puerto Rico.

You said that many of those who voted for statehood were people who felt that a vote against statehood threatened their livelihood. Who are these people specifically?

People from a variety of sectors support statehood including senior citizens and veterans. Puerto Rico has a huge veteran population. Puerto Ricans who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces don’t get equal treatment as compared to U.S. veterans. There is also an elderly population that sees its livelihood linked to the United States. The statehood movement tells them you will lose this money if you don’t vote for statehood. Their livelihood is put on the line and they don’t see other possibilities. They are a sizable number of the population.

The upper crust of the Puerto Rican elite is pro-statehood while many lower-income people depend on support from food stamps the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other U.S. agencies. But what Puerto Ricans are not told is that most of what they get back is what has been taken from them in taxes or profits. It’s not as if they are getting these resources or funds as a benevolent act of the U.S. government. Puerto Ricans pay Social Security and Medicare. We don’t get anything from the United States we don’t deserve and more importantly that we didn’t earn.

What is the connection between this vote and the protests that occurred in the summer of 2019?

The electoral outcomes and the political divisions show that people are looking critically at the political parties and corruption. The colonial situation of Puerto Rico is becoming more evident. It was very evident in the marches of July 2019 when literally one-third of the Puerto Rican population overthrew the governor. That’s one of the largest percentages of people in the world that have gone into the streets. The protests had a consciousness raising impact on the Puerto Rican electorate.

Some sectors in the Democratic Party have pushed for statehood recently. Who is pushing it and why?

In the last few years the Democratic Party has been beholden to very wealthy statehood sectors in Puerto Rico who have poured a lot of money into the Democratic Party. The election of Tom Perez as chairman of the Democratic Party was helped by money statehooders donated to support his bid against Keith Ellison of Minnesota. As people know there is a clear political division within the Democrats. Ellison represented supporters of Bernie Sanders and the progressive wing and Tom Perez represented the more conservative sectors. The wealthy statehooders who are very connected to people and lobbyists in Washington have donated a lot of money to the Democratic Party.

The other factor is the myth that if Puerto Rico became a state the Democrats would get two Democratic senators and maybe up to five Democratic Congressman and as a result Democrats would control both houses for years. This analysis fails to take into account that the pro-Trump candidate Jennifer Gonzalez who is a statehooder won for resident commissioner in Puerto Rico. Donald Trump poured money into her campaign.

Some Democrats support statehood because the issue is framed in terms of civil rights. At John Lewis’s funeral Barack Obama said the next step to be taken in terms of civil rights is to guarantee statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. But they are two separate cases. Of course I believe everyone should support statehood for Washington D.C. It’s an integral part of the United States and the people who live there have no representation in the legislative bodies. They should have the equal rights of any citizen.

Puerto Rico is different because it’s a struggle for human rights. We need to distinguish between civil rights and human rights. The United States government has only one responsibility and that is to support Puerto Rico’s right to self-determination. No political leader in the United States has the right to determine what is right for Puerto Rico. They can have an opinion but their responsibility is to resolve a historical problem that is informed by colonial relations.

We are a distinct people. A Caribbean/Latin American people. The United States does not treat us as even second- or even third-class citizens. In 1901 the Supreme Court ruled that Puerto Rico belongs to but is not a part of the United States. Puerto Ricans can never really hope to be full citizens. We are ruled by a doctrine of separate and unequal. The United States has used Puerto Rico as an experiment for so many of its policies: neoliberalism Operation Bootstrap reproduction. Puerto Rican women were experimented on and used as guinea pigs for the development of the birth control pill. The U.S. military used Puerto Rico as a military experiment station to practice bombings and conducted experiments in Agent Orange before it was used in Vietnam. When we look at all of these things I don’t know how anyone would want to be part of a country that has treated us like objects.

Some forces in the U.S. progressive movement support statehood for Puerto Rico. What do you think about that?

Europeans created colonialism 500-plus years ago to take people’s lands labor and resources. They justified colonialism through racism. When we talk about structural racism in many ways we are talking about colonialism. We need to move away from the idea that Obama and others are putting out in the Democratic Party and address the issue of colonialism and support the historical quest for self-determination.

What would constitute the settlement of the Puerto Rico national question?

Puerto Ricans’ ability to achieve full self-determination so we can self-realize as a fully functioning people on the face of the Earth so we can share this world with all peoples. The U.S. government needs to pay reparations for colonialism; this is true for Puerto Ricans just as it is true for Black people.

How are Puerto Rican elected officials responding to the push for statehood?

In August 2020 New York Congresswomen Nydia Velázquez and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez submitted a bill calling on the U.S. Congress to recognize the right of the Puerto Rican people to self-determination. This bill really begins to address the colonial situation of Puerto Rico and a campaign to build support for it is underway.

What are the obstacles facing independence?

The major one is the need for the independence movement to articulate a politics of self-actualization in Puerto Rico. We need to break with U.S. hegemony. As in all relations of subservience a major problem of colonialism is the problem of internalized colonialism. You have poor people in Puerto Rico getting food stamps Medicaid and Medicare. They see the check coming from the U.S. Treasury but they don’t see this money as resources that were taken from Puerto Rico and then returned. The U.S. empire has been hegemonic in Puerto Rico.

Do you see nationalism as a positive force?

Yes. The most reactionary social movement in Puerto Rico is the PNP. It’s homophobic racist misogynist. You heard all that in the Rossellógate the leaked chats between former Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and his cronies. They were full of profane homophobic and misogynistic comments and sparked the massive street protests in Puerto Rico in the summer of 2019.

The most progressive politics in Puerto Rico come from those who support independence or sovereignty. When we look at politics that dignify his her or their identities it’s the independence movement. My concept of nationalism validates all human relations and addresses issues of climate and environmentalism. If one understands human life as an expression of an ecosystem then all things in the ecosystem must be healthy and all of its members have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This means that all expressions of human sexuality all of the ecological responsibility and other forms of social justice define the nature of the ecosystem.

Well the corporate chieftains dodged that bullet only to find themselves now in the crosshairs of the next worst thing.

To say Gary Gensler — nominated as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission — is the favorite regulator of the business-hating Massachusetts senator isn’t an overstatement. Both he and Warren view the business of monitoring securities markets and regulating big business as more of a progressive holy war than matter of governance.

With that you can expect not just the usual flurry of enforcement activity out of the agency when Gensler comes to town. People who know Gensler tell me he is also intent on remaking the SEC in Warren’s image.

“Wall Street’s top cop” could soon become the left’s enforcer of social-justice and other progressive causes on big business if Gensler has his way these people say.

Warren became a hardened anti-business radical after years in academia. She is most famous for her annoying anti-bank rants in the Senate and before that creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a watchdog that has very little substance on its résumé to show it helps consumers. (It famously missed the Wells Fargo fake-account scandal which was uncovered by journalists).

Gensler’s sharp left turn has been more circuitous. He worked nearly two decades on Wall Street at the much-maligned Goldman Sachs no less doing stuff that would make Warren’s skin crawl: earning millions of dollars helping companies merge and acquire one another.

At one point he was the youngest person to be made partner at the firm — joining a rarified club at Goldman that puts you in line to make even more money.

In other words Gensler had fat cat written all over him until he went into government and his radicalization began I am told by people who worked with him. Gensler served under Treasury secretaries Bob Rubin and Larry Summers during the Clinton years and “when he first got there it was like dealing with a banker” said one prominent attorney who reps banks before government agencies and spoke on condition of anonymity.

“He was completely reasonable” the lawyer continued “but over time you can see him changing becoming more progressive and left-leaning in policy and temperament.”

Gensler didn’t return emails seeking comment but based on accounts from people who worked with him his progressivism truly began to manifest itself when he left the Clinton White House and joined the staff of Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes.

There he helped Sarbanes craft the ill-conceived Sarbanes-Oxley reform act that was supposed to stop corporate crimes after the Enron scandal but failed to rein in the biggest flaws in the financial system that led to the 2008 financial crisis.

That collapse and the Obama administration’s response to it — more heavy-handed regulation — gave Gensler another shot at reining in corporate abuse as head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The seemingly arcane-sounding agency is among the most powerful regulators of banks since it monitors the massive futures and derivative markets. It is there where Gensler fully earned his rep as Warren’s favorite former fat cat.

He embraced the role of regulator of a market that had little real responsibility for the 2008 crisis with a zeal that would lead you to think all those subprime loans that blew up the financial system were a function of futures trading.

Then came his crusade against banks for manipulating the London InterBank Offered Rate (Libor) an important interest rate on loans mainly between banks but also used in setting rates on mortgages and other loans. Here he was very “successful” — squeezing billions of dollars out of banks in settlements even if many of the alleged manipulations were legally dubious.

For all the headlines this scandal produced many of the traders charged were eventually acquitted particularly after evidence emerged that the manipulation was done often at the behest of central bankers looking to lower rates during the height of the financial crisis.

Like any good progressive Gensler got his card punched in academia. After leaving the Obama administration he became a professor at MIT teaching and conducting “research . . . on blockchain technology digital currencies financial technology and public policy” according to his biography.

Gensler’s academic interest in blockchain and technology I am told provides clues on some of his regulatory priorities. He is said to be interested in abuses involving cryptocurrencies and fintech — or Wall Street’s embrace of computer technology.

He will also delve into more opaque areas of the securities markets such as Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) which provide a low-cost method of taking companies public without relying on the traditional IPO process.

All of which is warranted to some degree. But the biggest change Gensler will likely bring to an agency designed to make sure average people can buy stocks without getting ripped off will be cultural. He will be looking for ways to make companies adhere to various left-leaning edicts involving diversity climate change and even making it difficult for corporations to make political contributions.

The last edict is something Warren has been pushing for years though she did not expand it to progressive power players like unions.

Luckily for the business community Warren was rebuffed by ­Obama SEC chief Mary Jo White who believed such moves are far outside the SEC’s mandate.

They are both football stars; they were both drafted by sluggish football teams with the hope that they could revive the struggling offenses. They’ve both made good on those promises too. On Jan. 17 Mahomes and Mayfield battled it out on the football field. Only one team emerged victorious advancing to the championship game. The Mahomes’ led Kansas City Chiefs may have won the game but is the Cheifs’ signal-caller the winner in the advertisement world? Fans are split on who is the better insurance pitchman.

Patrick Mahomes is a pitchman for State Farm

Mahomes might be a star on the field but he’s been busy off the field too. Aside from an impending marriage and fatherhood he’s got a ton of endorsements. His best-known partnership is State Farm. The insurance company linked up with Mahomes early on in his career and have shot a series of commercials that play on his on-the-field talent and relaxed personality.

Mahomes has filmed an entire series of commercials for State Farm with the most recent featuring actors getting the same haircut as Mahomes so they can get his very special State Farm pricing. The ad’s premise suggests that everyone gets the same pricing whether they are an average Joe or a future Hall of Famer.

Baker Mayfield gets goofy in commercials for Progressive

State Farm has played on Mahomes’ calm demeanor in their commercials but Progressive has gone a different direction with Mayfield’s partnership. Mayfield signed on to act as a pitchman for progressive in 2019 and the ads were a hit nearly instantly.

In the ads Mayfield treats FirstEnergy stadium as if it were his own home. In one spot he runs around frantically covering the stadium’s seats. In another he is alarmed to find out “company” is coming because he is unprepared. In each ad Mayfield is incredibly energetic and appears to be a touch well clueless. All-in-all it works but it works for a completely different reason than State Farms ad spots.

Which commercial series is better?

While Mahomes and Mayfield figured out who would be advancing in the playoffs the jury is still out on who the better pitchman is. Whether you prefer the cool calm demeanor of Mahome’s work with State Farm or the manic energy of Mayfield’s ad spots at the Browns’ home stadium one thing is for certain; people largely love the ads. According to CNBC ads featuring football stars outperform other ads shown during any given game. Mayfield is beloved by Progressive for his ability to turn on the charm and State Farm is devoted to the genre ever since their initial success with Aaron Rodgers. Which one you think is better all comes down to preference.

Ad industry insiders suggest that Mayfield might have the edge when it comes to commercials. His Progressive spots are original and seem to play off Mayfield’s personality. On the other hand Mahomes’ commercials appear to follow State Farm’s tried and true recipe. They’ve worked with sports stars before and in theory could use any high-end star to fill in for Mahomes. The same is not true for Progressive who appears to have built the commercials around Mayfield.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcGFsYXdhbi1uZXdzLmNvbS9zZWMtcm9xdWUta2lja3Mtb2ZmLXJpby10dWJhLW1pbmluZ3Mtam91cm5leS10by01LW1pbGxpb24tdHJlZXMtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roque kicks off Rio Tuba Mining's journey to 5 Million Trees,"Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said he wanted to see for himself if trees are really being planted in mined-out areas so he can report to President Rodrigo Duterte.

He said this as Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Corp. (RTN) a subsidiary of Nickel Asia Corp. (NAC) began the last stretch of the company’s goal to plant 5 Million trees in Barangay Rio Tuba Bataraza.

Roque graced the ceremonial planting of the first batch of the remaining 900000 trees RTN needs to complete its goal of 5 million trees planted.

Roque said he wanted to see for himself if trees are really being planted in the mining community and that he is “impressed” by what RTN is trying to do in Palawan planting trees all over the province.

He added it is important that he has seen mining in RTN personally to be able to present to President Duterte and the whole country that “not all mining is irresponsible that in Bataraza the environment is being cared for”.

“I will report to President Duterte what Rio Tuba Mining is doing in greening Palawan. We will tell the world since PTV media is here with us that in Rio Tuba in Bataraza there is no difference between the concept of job creation and the protection of the environment” Roque said.

To date RTN has a record of about 4.1 million surviving trees planted in various areas covered in its mine rehabilitation and reforestation programs.

Roque congratulated Nickel Asia the LGU of Bataraza and employees of the mining company for inviting him to Rio Tuba.

“I feel that I am personally accepted here to also act as a protector of the environment and this event is proof that the communities can well benefit from the economic contributions of mining while protecting and preserving nature” Roque says.

According to environmental planner Janice M. Tupas manager of the Mines Environmental Protection and Enhancement Dept. (MEPED) of RTN there is a mechanism that her team and the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) employ that actually monitors and counts the survival rates of the trees they plant.

“This year we will be more aggressive we will build hectares upon hectares of bamboo plantations we will engage the communities to turn their backyards into mini forests and we will have support from the Department to Environment and Natural Resources Department of Education (DepEd) in Palawan that I feel we will even surpass 5 million” Tupas said.

Engineer Cynthia E. Rosero resident mine manager for RTN said having Roque grace the important event helps showcase RTN’s environment protection programs and the mining company’s aggressive efforts to keep Palawan green.

“Planting 5 million trees is no easy feat for a mining company and we are proud of this” Rosero says.

RTN is one of the mining companies committed to achieving ecosystem restoration and reforestation in mined-out areas. Applying progressive rehabilitation strategies RTN in its more than 50 years of operation in Rio Tuba proves that an active mining company can create a forest in its path and can be the catalyst in the re-greening of a province like Palawan.

“RTN’s bold ambition is to plant 5 Million trees it can leave behind as a legacy. This year is the last stretch in achieving that ambition. With a balance of 900000 many are cheering us on and many are putting in their support and we are honored and grateful” added Tupas.

To date RTN has rehabilitated a total of 196.64 hectares of its mining area where it has planted 1205763 surviving trees of different species including narra ipil apitong agoho udling kupang batino tongkat ali amugis among others.

Some 663.08 hectares have been reforested with native tree species coffee mangroves botanical plant and some industrial trees in support of the government’s Green Philippine Highway Project; Adopt-a-Mountain Project; and the National Greening Program

RTN said it plants trees to fulfill the objective of mine rehabilitation to restore disturbed areas to a safe non-erodible condition establishing land use capability that is functional and back to the condition if not better before disturbance.

“Planting 5 million trees is not something ordinary organizations can easily do but RTN endeavors this for Palawan and in fact RTN intends to plant more in the years to come” said Tupas."

Companies that were highly anticipated to go public in the early part of 2020 — Airbnb DoorDash and Asana — paused plans amid COVID-19 concerns.

That all changed in early summer. The market turned and a goldrush of IPOs followed including the three aforementioned companies.

By the end of December 480 companies went public a 106 percent increase over 2019’s tallies.

Additionally more IPOs last year doubled in value during their opening days than any year since 1999. In September Snowflake made history clocking in the largest software IPO of all time and Airbnb continued its trend as a tech darling raising $3.5 billion in its public debut.

Airbnb

Airbnb’s IPO marked the largest of 2020 coming in at $3.5 billion raised. The global accommodations reservation platform includes 4 million hosts 800 million guests and locations available in 100000 cities. It’s the biggest of the short-term rental marketplaces.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest companies that use AWS.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a multinational technology company based in USA. It is known for its state of the art e-commerce digital streaming cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The e-commerce giant has been called one of the most influential companies in the world. It was founded by Jeff Bezos who is currently the richest man in the world even though he was temporarily dethroned by Elon Musk who for a while succeeded him as the richest man in the world.

Founded in 1994 the company started as an online buying and selling place for books but soon diversified into other fields like electronics software video games apparel furniture food toys and jewelry. In terms of revenue it is the largest internet based company in the entire world. The company launched its cloud platform called Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002. Initially consisting of a very limited set of tools the service expanded in 2004 and was launched for public usage.

The cloud platform has become a giant part of the e-commerce mammoth's portfolio. With over 150 companies many of them with the billion dollar tag Amazon Web Services is on its way to become one of the biggest and the most profitable cloud platforms in the business. As of February of 2020 according to Investopedia a few analysts reported that the service has already taken a hold of 32.4% of the market share leaving behind Azure and Google cloud at 17.6% and 6% respectively. In the beginning of 2020 the web service reported a revenue of $10 billion! This accounted for almost 14% of Amazon’s total revenue. It is also the only reason why Amazon has now become really profitable with its profits from its online retail business barely there.

Amazon is striving to move businesses away from the physical world of computing technology to the cloud world. Companies looking for large storage spaces for its unlimited and ever growing data generally turn towards cloud storage. Although a pricy deal it pays off as the company grows into the bought space. AWS has also generated a solution for companies that require great computing power owing to the surge of traffic during peak times. If a firm buys computing power ahead of time and it lays unused during times with low traffic it still costs the firm large sums of money. Amazon Web Services offers a solution in the shape of the pay per use principal. There are no upfront costs and no estimated usage requirement for building a storage system. This is why it tops the list of the biggest cloud computing companies in the world.

Because of the modified cost for users according to their needs the service is especially favorable for small businesses. It is also beneficial for startups as it provides tools for a business to build itself from the ground up with the cloud. It also provides a low cost transition service to already existing companies so that they can move their existing infrastructure seamlessly to the Amazon Web Services servers.

The service is made up of a host of different cloud computing products. It provides servers storage networking remote computing email mobile development and security to its customers. It offers three umbrellas of services:

EC2 (Virtual Machine service) Glacier (Cloud Storage service) S3 (Storage System)

The cloud service has divided its services in 76 availability zones where its servers are located. This allows users to set geographical limits on their products and services and also provides additional security by providing a host of different physical locations for the data. AWS currently offers its services to 245 countries and territories.

It also offers way more security as compared to a company’s own hosted website or storage. AWS has a hoard of different data centers scattered across the globe. The centers keep a continuous eye on the data and strictly maintain it. Because of the scattered across the globe aspect the data centers have added security; if a disaster strikes one of the regions it won’t cause a total date loss worldwide. The service has also given the visibility risk of these data centers some thought. The centers are in remote locations hidden away as much as possible with access only to essential personnel.

Because of its state of the art technology and its host of customizable services Amazon’s cloud service is a good choice for every type of company no matter how big or small. From a start up to a Fortune 500 company every business has the option to customize a spot for themselves on the cloud. Here we have a list of the 15 biggest companies that use Amazon Web Services.

The new Shimoni Core PTC was officially unveiled on Wednesday at Kitikifumba village Kira Town Council.

Both institutions were displaced in 2006 after the 15-acre piece of land they were occupying in the city centre was given to an investor.

Two months away...

Education Ministry Permanent Secretary Francis Lubanga who presided over the opening of the new college said the primary school structures will be covered under phase II of the Shimoni relocation.

“We are in the process of procuring a contractor and after two months we hope to embark on the second phase (of constructing a demonstration school)” he said.

Shimoni Core PTC has for the last four years been hosted by Nyondo PTC in Mbale while the primary section occupies the playground of Kololo Primary School in Kampala.

Ms Annet Mugisha the coordinator of the Shimoni Schools Relocation Project said Shs3.4 billion has been put aside for the demonstration school project.

“We are happy that phase I (constructing Shimoni PTC) has been successful and we hope that the contractor who will be picked to handle phase II will also exhibit excellent workmanship ” said Ms Mugisha.

However she added that part of the funds will be used to complete some works at the PTC and procure science kits and equipment.

Government earmarked Shs11.4 billion for the entire project which Education Minister Geraldine Namirembe Bitamazire describes as one of the largest government investments into a single institution.

Two months away...

“The new site is beautiful spacious and provides a conducive environment for learning” Ms Bitamazire said on Wednesday. “And I am optimistic that after completing the demonstration school Shimoni will rise again as a centre of excellence for primary teachers.”

The revelation follows emerging evidence that the government is admitting failures in the recently-released Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE) results to teach primary pupils.

Our analysis of scores of prospective new entrants at Primary Teachers’ Colleges across the country reveals that most of those admitted obtained low grades in the 2010 O-level examinations raising questions about their academic competence.

High Vs low

At Kitgum PTC the cut-off point for girls was Aggregate 55 in the best done eight subjects and Aggregate 50 for boys. Soroti PTC picked boys and girls that got Aggregate 52 slightly higher than Busubizi PTC’s 51.

Sancta Maria PTC stopped admitting at aggregate 53; Kapchorwa and John Bosco Nyonde (49) Kibuli (47) Kiyoora Kaliro and Buhungiro (45); Kisoro (47) Kabale (43) Kamurasi and Bwera (48) Bushenyi (41) and Shimoni Core PTC had Aggregate 46.

On the hand high schools admitted top performing students for A-level studies with some of them setting the cut-off at Aggregate 14 for best eight done O-level subjects.

However some students with bad scores in Division 4 (topping Aggregate 60) are being absorbed by some secondary schools to A-level under a government policy directive aimed at improving the transition rate under the free education scheme for the poor.

Uganda National Examinations Board (Uneb) the national examinations body issues certificates of completion only to candidates who obtain aggregates within Divisions one to four range although the latter border failures in the grading.

Experts say taking underperformers for a two-year training to become primary teachers will gradually erode the quality of teaching and learning since the instructors would not be academically well-grounded

Cream

“It is a challenge. I would think that teaching should take the cream of the students but people don’t want to join because the profession is looked at as an area for low [academic] performers” said Ms Margaret Rwabushaija the Uganda National Teachers’ Union (UNATU) chairperson.

“If it were possible we would get the best. However because there is a vacuum we can’t leave it there. Somebody must occupy it because we need teachers.”

Concerns about low remuneration and declining social status of teachers in the country contrasting their privileged and high esteem in the past has forced bright students to shun the profession observers say.

Until this financial year a primary teacher earned a monthly salary of Shs200000 – without allowance – although that gross pay has now marginally increased to Shs260000.

While the college principals shared their challenges with the ministry officials at the selection exercise last week it was noted that schools also lack essential teaching equipment and teachers.

Mr Gesa Kabasa Arua PTC principal said: “I don’t know who owns Arua PTC. It is embarrassing the college has opened but there are no tutors. Out of the 26 tutors we need we only have five. No classrooms. You have always promised to work on it. What do you expect?”

Ms Janet Florence Aguti the assistant commissioner of primary teacher education acknowledged that some institutions were operating without staff but said the ministry would work on the hiccups.

“I know that every college has staffing problems. Submit your categories and we shall work on them although it may not be immediate” Ms Aguti said. While Mr Richard Ssewakiryanga the Uwezo country director admits there is crisis in the education system he asked the government to invest more in the training of students so that their standard is improved.

Uwezo is a four-year initiative in East Africa which seeks to fill the gap in education and social change by generating household-based data on children’s literacy and numeracy that informs the public to demand for policy change.

Last year it released a report which indicated that majority of primary pupils had difficulties in numeracy and literary skills. “This is the unfortunate part of our education system. The paradox is that the worst join education while the best opt for other courses. For government to attract best brains in teaching they have to increase teachers’ salaries for then we will not see the best students going for law and medicine only” Mr Ssewakiryanga said.

Although Ms Vicky Owens an education psychiatrist and former lecturer at Makerere University believes that poor performance is dependent she says there is a possibility that a person may turn out to be a good teacher even when they had earlier not performed well.

“Some people may not have performed well but may make good teachers but it depends on many factors. However if they are not gifted academically it would not be good enough to have them as teachers” she said.

For years now the trend has been that the cream students in UCE examinations are picked to join A-level top schools. For instance St Mary’s College Kisubi and Mt St Mary’s Namagunga put their cut-off points at 11 while Gayaza High School’s admission is at 13.

While closing the two-day selection exercise on Friday Education Minister Geraldine Bitamazire said students lacked information on the available options rather than A-level and emphasised the need for teachers to promote technical education.

“There are other options like technical teacher and agriculture training which students can go for rather than A-level education. These options are of equal measure to any education options in terms of requirements and qualification yet they provide early employment opportunities” she said.

To many the question is who are these children who get good grades and join good schools which finally lead them to university education? Critics say the government is gradually creating a social gap which will in future be difficult to overcome.

A head teacher who preferred anonymity to speak freely said: “You can hardly find a minister’s child in a technical school or a PTC. Their children are in schools like Gayaza and Budo and are assured of government scholarship at university that even when it fails they are able to pay for them. A peasant’s child is the one who will be a technician. And who earns more a doctor or technician?”

However Ms Bitamazire insists: “For every engineer training at university we should have five technicians training at technical institutions. A doctor needs a set of nurses laboratory technicians radiologists and midwives. Begin putting emphasis on A-level alternatives not as a last resort but of equal importance for future development.”

‘Applaud govt’

Mr John Willy Arinaitwe the chairperson principals association said government’s free education and funding of the primary and technical institutions should be applauded.

He however said students who get Aggregate eight in eight subjects or nine in eight are children who study from ‘first class’ schools and belong to parents who can finance high school fees.",,,,,,

The proposal is one of several policies the governor outlined last week to try to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases linked to climate change.

A report recently released by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency said the state is not on track to meet its goals to cut overall greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels. Minnesota’s overall greenhouse gas emissions have declined just 8 percent since 2005.

The state’s electric utilities have made the most progress by reducing the use of fossil fuels such as coal-fired power plants in favor of cleaner energy sources such as wind and solar.

Other sectors including transportation and agriculture have been less successful in cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Walz and some DFL lawmakers want to speed up the electricity sector’s progress by setting a deadline for electric utilities to use zero-emission energy resources by 2040.

Two years ago Walz outlined a plan to make Minnesota’s electricity carbon-free by 2050 but it ran into opposition from Republican lawmakers.

A House bill authored by Rep. Jamie Long DFL-Minneapolis had its first committee hearing last Thursday. The bill would set benchmarks for the proportion of a utility’s retail electric sales that must be generated from renewable energy over the next two decades reaching 100 percent carbon-free in 2040.

Among those voicing support was Michael Noble director of the nonprofit Fresh Energy who said the price of clean energy including wind solar and battery storage has fallen dramatically.

""Because new carbon-free electricity technologies are lower cost than the legacy fossil fuel technologies that they're replacing we can do this in a way that saves money rather than increase consumer costs” Noble said.

The state's largest utility Xcel Energy pledged in 2018 to be carbon-free by 2050 in part by closing its coal-fired power plant in Becker Minn. by 2030.

Minnesota Power followed suit earlier this year announcing it would add wind and solar energy and stop burning coal at its last remaining coal-fired power plant in Cohasset Minn. by 2035.

Jessica Tritsch with the Sierra Club’s North Star Chapter called those efforts “positive steps” but not enough.

“That timeline is not what scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis” she said.

Utility representatives said they support the state's clean energy goals but also have a responsibility to meet customer expectations for reliability and cost.

Environmental groups have praised utilities for replacing aging coal-fired power plants with wind and solar. But they’ve also been critical of their use of natural gas-fueled plants which produce less emissions than coal but are not carbon free.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbmx1aXNvYmlzcG8uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvYXJ0aWNsZTI0ODYyMDcyNS5odG1s0gFKaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2FubHVpc29iaXNwby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9hcnRpY2xlMjQ4NjIwNzI1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More than 1700 acres of rolling SLO County ranchland now protected as wildlife preserve,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.sanluisobispo.com', port=443): Read timed out.

CBS 2 Investigator Dorothy Tucker discovered a solution that's been a well-kept secret for more than a decade. Now it's piqued the interest of one state lawmaker.

Just after Christmas on Dec. 27 2019 Chicago Police were called to a South Side parking lot.

Body camera video shows one officer walking up to a tow truck and yelling at the driver: ""Hey! You're being recorded. Can you put the window down please?"" The tow truck driver responds ""What?""

A heated exchange follows between Chicago Police and both men inside the tow truck.

The CPD officer tells the driver: ""You need to relax."" He adds ""Lower your voice dude.""

The tow truck driver responds: ""I'm a grown man. I can talk how I want to talk.""

""This is the lot"" says the woman who called police.

She wanted her Volkswagen Tiguan back from the tow company but it wanted a ridiculous amount of money to let her have it. $7000.

It's an outrageous bill but it's not rare in the state of Illinois particularly in Chicago. One of the CPD officers told the woman ""I've been here a couple of times where they've price-gouged people.""

CBS 2 through a public records request found that the Illinois Commerce Commission received 271 complaints over a two-year period in 2019 and 2020 including the one that brought CPD to that lot on 74th Street. Many drivers are angry about non-disclosure of fees in particular those staggering storage costs.

Here's how those rack up.

Once a crashed car is hooked up to the tow truck tow drivers are in complete control and they can take the vehicle wherever they want.

That's what happened to Daniel Cohen who described his ordeal as stressful.

He got into an accident on 82nd Street and Racine Avenue and told the tow truck driver who showed up on the scene to take his car to Euro Collision in the South Loop.

""But when I called Euro it wasn't there"" Cohen said.

He spent three days trying to find his car starting with the address on that towing company's business card.

""It wasn't there. I went to another location it wasn't there"" Cohen said.

While Cohen searched the storage fees added up.

By the time he found his car three days later and only after the towers called his insurance company he discovered the bill balance had ballooned.

""The bill went from $1000 to $5000"" Cohen said.

Illinois State Rep. Robyn Gabel (D-Evanston) who represents the 18th District north of Chicago calls that a problem. Her response is to fix it at the state level by introducing new legislation with a potential solution.

""This bill would provide for a public database where anyone who had their car towed could look it up"" Rep. Gabel said.

That public database would be managed by the ICC. Towers would be required to input the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) license plate number tow company name and most importantly the location of the towed car.

""It will at least make it easier to find your car to not have to pay for storage fees"" says Rep. Gabel.

Stand up: What a concept! But it's not original. We found one other state that has a similar database designed to help the public find their towed cars.

That state is 1400 miles away across the Rockies in Utah.

The Utah database was created 10 plus years ago"" said Chad Sheppick Director of the Motor Carrier Division of the Utah Department of Transportation.

In Utah a vehicle owner simply enters their VIN and license plate number and within seconds they have the exact location of their car.

""It does provide individuals quicker access to their vehicles which could contribute to a lower fee"" Sheppick said.

The Utah law even requires tow companies to report the information quickly within hours of the vehicle being towed.

State Rep. Gabel's bill would include the same requirement and the same penalty. -If tow companies disobey the rules they get hit where it hurts most.

""You couldn't charge for storage anytime earlier than the date that you put it in the database"" Gabel said.

As for that tow company using that lot on 74th Street? ICC has now revoked that company's Public Carrier Certificate and safety towing license.

As for Daniel Cohen's car? His insurance company eventually paid the rogue towers more than $3000 to get it back. So of course Cohen favors a public database that could have saved his insurer mountains of money and him many headaches.

""It would have allowed me not to go on a rat race or a crazy chase of three four days looking for my car"" Cohen said.

Rep. Gabel plans to introduce her towing bill soon.

The ICC told CBS 2 it can't comment on the bill until it's officially introduced:

""With the Gabel legislation yet to be introduced we cannot speak to its impact in either direction on the Commission's work. However there is another concerted effort to address towing related issues with the city ordinance introduced by Alderman Gil Villegas (36th). We believe this ordinance will go far toward ensuring that road safety is prioritized by towing companies and local officials as well as mitigate the post-towing costs experienced by some towing customers.""

While we researched this story we heard from other states interested in Utah's law and Rep. Gabel's bill."

Samsung Exynos 9611 vs Qualcomm Snapdragon 730g

Chipmakers Samsung and Qualcomm have been stuck in constant competition for years in the SoC business. They are constantly in a race to bring out high speed optimised SoCs for Android devices. Usually Qualcomm comes out on top but Samsung has a collection of good competing SoCs as well. With the large hold Samsung has over the smartphone market they get away with using their own Exynos SoC in their own devices and some other brands. Let's take a look at Samsung Exynos 9611 vs Qualcomm Snapdragon 730g.

The OnePlus 9 will come with 65W fast-charging and a bigger battery capacity

The OnePlus 8 Pro is so far the only device with wireless and reverses wireless charging. It’s a surprise to see that these features are coming for the vanilla flagship next year. After all the OnePlus 8T released in October didn’t pack any of these features. The OnePlus 9 series apparently represents a major step for the company. According to 91mobiles the OnePlus 9 will get a 65W fast-charging. This tech was presented with the OnePlus 8T and will be a standard for the next year’s flagships. Further the battery of the vanilla is getting a significant bump from the 4300mAh in the vanilla 8 to the 4500mAh battery in the OnePlus 9.

According to reports the OnePlus will release its devices in mid-March. Just like other companies OnePlus is bringing its yearly flagships a little bit earlier than usual. It’s curious to see how many leaks are popping out. After all we’re still three months away from a release. Based on this we expect more details to keep popping out in the coming months prior to the release.

The Lite variant will have a Snapdragon 865 SoC

Both the vanilla OnePlus9 and OnePlus9 Pro are set to come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. However a new report states that the OnePlus9 Lite will differ from a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865. That’s a strategy that Realme used this year with the release of the Realme X3 SuperZoom featuring last year’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+. For those unaware Realme is a sister brand. The OnePlus9 Lite with the Snapdragon 865 will probably be cheaper than the other two but probably will not be cheap as the OnePlus Nord. So in the end we’re curious to see how the Lite variant will perform in the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvcGFuYWNoZS9vcHBvLXJlbm8tNS1wcm8tNWctcmV2aWV3LWZ1dHVyZS1yZWFkeS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MDQzMTgwNi5jbXPSAXFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3BhbmFjaGUvb3Bwby1yZW5vLTUtcHJvLTVnLXJldmlldy1mdXR1cmUtcmVhZHkvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgwNDMxODA2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oppo Reno 5 Pro 5G review: Future ready,There is no certainty when we will be able to use 5G bandwidth in India but that has not stopped smartphone OEMs from launching 5G-ready handsets. Joining the bandwagon is Oppo with its first 5G-enabled smartphone — the Reno 5 Pro 5G. The device is powered by MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ SoC which is MediaTek’s flagship processor and is said to be in the same range as Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC. It comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. Thanks to the internals the performance is lag-free and smooth. The Reno 5 Pro 5G feels quite smooth courtesy the 90Hz refresh rate of the display.The smartphone offers a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screen with 2400×1080p resolution. The display offers a pleasant viewing experience with vivid colours and sharp image quality. The Android 11-based ColorOS 11.1 has a number of customisable settings — including that of the display. The Reno 5 Pro is a premium-looking handset. It is available in two colour options — Astral Blue and Starry Black. Our review unit in Astral Blue had a glittery back panel that some might feel as being a little rough — especially if you are used to smooth back panels. On the plus side this eliminates the issue of fingerprint smudges.With the Oppo Reno 5 Pro 5G users get a 4350mAh battery that offers more than the usual average screen time. The 65W fast charge support is impressive. One key highlight of the device is its camera that boasts of video capabilities and low-light photography. The cameras are able to capture good videos in dim light using its AI Highlight Video feature however the quality of the video is a bit over-processed. The device houses a 64MP main camera 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera 2MP macro camera and 2MP mono camera.The overall image quality turned out to be impressive as the photos appear rich in colour and didn’t lack any details. For Rs 35990 the Oppo Reno 5 Pro 5G offers lasting battery life premium looks and powerful processor — making it a good buy in the affordable premium segment.The writer is with gadgetsnow.com,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdml2by1zN3Qtc21hcnRwaG9uZS1tZWRpYXRlay1kaW1lbnNpdHktMTQyMjU2MjEyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vivo S7t Smartphone With MediaTek Dimensity 820 SoC Likely To Be Launched Soon,"Last year in August Vivo introduced a new Vivo S7 smartphone in the home market.

The 50-bed Gosnold Treatment Center an inpatient facility where patients detox for up to six days has had six staff members and seven patients test positive for the virus between March and January according to Kevin Ralph Gosnold’s chief development and external relations officer.

But employees say administrators have not been notifying them of positive cases among staff in a timely manner and have not been properly performing contact tracing. They also say that the center is not being properly sanitized and cleaned during the pandemic.

“We’re people that knowingly deal with people that are at the worst stages of their life every day” one employee said. “It’s just an awful feeling to know that you’re getting up and going to work every day and your employer isn’t taking even the most basic steps to keep employees and patients safe.”

Gosnold officials including president and CEO Richard Curcuru have denied these claims.

Employees who spoke for this story work in different roles at the treatment center. They requested that their names not be published out of fear of losing their jobs.

The claims regarding the Ter Heun Drive center came after Gosnold’s rehabilitation facility in Cataumet closed in December after a COVID-19 outbreak occurred. A day before it reopened on Jan. 15 two additional employees tested positive.

Family members of Gosnold’s Falmouth employees have also expressed concerns with one spouse saying that she also tested positive for COVID-19 after her husband brought the virus home.

In one case an employee who tested positive for COVID-19 texted a group of coworkers at 9:35 a.m. on Jan. 13 to inform them about their results and encouraged the other coworkers to get tested according to a screenshot of texts obtained by the Times. But emails between Curcuru and staff show that staff was not notified by email of the new positive case until just after 8 p.m. almost 11 hours later.

Some employees said they were locked out of their emails by Gosnold administrators after expressing their concerns with the organization’s COVID-19 protocols and the perceived lack of response to the positive cases.

Ralph said when a patient enters the Falmouth facility they are screened for symptoms and are briefed on the facility’s COVID-19 protocols. If a patient shows symptoms they are tested and if necessary quarantined he said. Patients coming into the facility from out of state are required to submit results of a COVID-19 test taken within the past 72 hours.

The state Department of Public Health’s Bureau of Substance Addiction Services tests all staff in Gosnold’s inpatient programs once every two weeks. If a positive case comes back from Quest Diagnostics a clinical laboratory contracted by the bureau to perform testing Gosnold’s Compliance Quality and Risk Management team handles contact tracing Ralph said.

But employees say that contact tracing has also been an issue at the facility.

In another case cited by employees a patient who had tested positive for COVID-19 was discharged from the facility on Jan. 5 but nurses who were in contact with the patient were not informed of the close contact by administrators and instead learned of the positive case among themselves. Meanwhile the patient’s roommate was not informed they were a close contact until more than 30 hours later employees say.

Michael F. Arrigo an expert on patient privacy who speaks as an expert witness on health care data regulations said that because the nurse was part of the treating clinical team she could be made aware of the patient’s condition without it violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act otherwise known as HIPAA.

“If there is a reasonable belief that another individual could be at risk of an infectious disease timeliness is important” Arrigo said. “The quicker you notify someone in the chain of contact the better for mitigating infection and mitigating an outbreak.”

Although the roommate was eventually informed they were a close contact one nurse said that Gosnold’s director of nursing John Flattery initially told a staff member that they could not inform the roommate that they were exposed to COVID-19 because it would be a violation of HIPAA.

In a phone interview Curcuru denied this saying that employees wanted to know the names of employees moving between other Gosnold sites and that they were prevented from giving out that information under HIPAA.

But Ryan Stark a HIPAA expert and managing partner at the firm Page Wolfberg & Wirth in Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania said the law does not prevent administrators from sharing the names of employees transferring between facilities but rather employee names and their medical conditions.

“It sounds like HIPAA might be thrown up as sort of a catch-all for refusal to release that information” Stark said.

Curcuru said that while Gosnold officials knew the patient had symptoms they did not get the positive test result back until Jan. 7 as the nonprofit does not conduct rapid testing. Upon receiving the positive result Curcuru ordered that staff and patients identified as close contacts get tested during which time the center suspended detox admissions with the goal of getting results back on Jan. 8.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requests that health care providers such as Gosnold disclose public health information electronically on an ongoing basis for all prior and current cases of patients exposed to COVID-19 even suspected cases according to HIPAA guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Falmouth Health Agent Scott McGann said the town has received some complaints alleging that Gosnold patients were being released while they were in isolation or quarantine and that the nonprofit was not doing enough contact tracing. The health department looks into complaints and can take action but in most cases it reports its findings to the state.

The Falmouth Board of Health recently received a complaint that someone was not wearing a mask inside the Gosnold building. A walk-through was conducted on Jan. 8 but no violations were found McGann said.

Employees also claim that the staff at the Falmouth facility are not sanitizing spaces and that some patients have refused to wear masks. Ralph denied those claims and reiterated that Gosnold has been following the proper protocols set by the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“We recognize that people are anxious and afraid and scared” he said. “We want to do the right thing and …. we don’t want to see anybody feeling unsafe or have a feeling of any type of insecurity. We’re going to keep working harder.”

Meanwhile employees say the center has been operating at full capacity with limited staff during the pandemic leaving employees to work with more patients than usual and work more overtime. One employee shared their pay stubs which showed they worked 40-hour weeks with overtime sometimes totaling 18 hours a week.

Ralph confirmed that the Falmouth facility is operating at full capacity. He said when Gosnold sees holes in staffing they find ways to address it.

“We know that this has been a difficult time for our employees and for everyone” Ralph said. “There is a lot of anxiety and stress.”

Curcuru said that employees at Gosnold’s Falmouth and Cataumet sites have been offered the COVID-19 vaccine.

RTX,RTX Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9zb21lLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNjAtbWF5LWVuZC11cC1jb3N0aW5nLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDYwLXRp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some RTX 3060 Cards Could Cost More Than RTX 3060 Tis,"The GeForce RTX 3060 (codename Ampere) will launch next month at $329. However early retailer pricing suggests that third-party GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card will likely cost a lot more than Nvidia's MSRP - maybe even as much as the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.

CCL Computers (via VideoCardz) has already listed a ton of GeForce RTX 3060 models from the different graphics cards manufacturers. The U.K. retailer didn't reveal the price tags for the graphics cards but VideoCardz discovered a bug in the vendor's system that accidentally exposes the pricing. Since we can't be certain if CCL Computers' prices are accurate we recommend you approach the pricing with a good bit of caution.

After analyzing all 15 custom GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards we've determined that only the Asus models are properly priced. The SKUs from Gigabyte Palit and Zotac all cost £499.99 which is highly unlikely. We suspect the pricing for those three vendors is a placeholder.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Pricing

Swipe to scroll horizontally Graphics Card U.S. Pricing excl VAT U.K. Pricing inc VAT Asus Dual GeForce RTX 3060 Ti OC Edition $627.06 £549.99 Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3060 OC Edition $585.86 £513.86 Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3060 $573.9 £503.36 Asus Dual GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Mini OC Edition $564.71 £495.30 Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 OC Edition $533.15 £467.62 Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 $512.18 £457.12

Since it's such a small sample size it's difficult to reach a general conclusion. If we focus primarily on the Asus models and CCL Computers' pricing there's a small price difference between the GeForce RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti in some cases. For example the Dual GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Mini OC Edition is only 5.9% more expensive than the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 OC Edition. If we look at it from another angle the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3060 and OC Editions cost more than the Dual GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Mini OC Edition itself.

GeForce RTX 3060 reviews aren't out yet so we don't know how it compares to the best graphics cards and have no clue about the margin between it and the RTX 3060 Ti. Specification-wise the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is equipped with 35.7% more CUDA cores than the non-Ti while also offering a 24.4% higher memory bandwidth. In the GeForce RTX 3060's defense it does come with an extra 4GB of GDDR6. But again it's difficult to estimate how much faster the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is in comparison to the non-Ti without a proper review.

The GeForce RTX 3060's pricing will determine the graphics card's success and as we already know every dollar counts in the mid-range market. Assuming that the price gap between a GeForce RTX 3060 and a RTX 3060 Ti is less than 10% it would make sense to grab the latter especially if it ends up offering considerably more performance. The problem is that with the ongoing graphics card shortage and the resurgence of cryptocurrency mining the odds of finding a GeForce RTX 3060 at $329 are going to be very slim if not impossible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L0Vhcmx5LUdlRm9yY2UtUlRYLTMwNjAtcHJpY2VzLXB1dC1OVklESUEtcy1HQTEwNi1jYXJkLWF0LW92ZXItMTUwLW9mLU1TUlAuNTE2NDE3LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Early GeForce RTX 3060 prices put NVIDIA's GA106 card at over 150% of MSRP,"None of this should surprise anyone who has been buying graphics cards for years though nor do manufacturers need to stick to a suggested retail price. However initial pricing for the GeForce RTX 3060 puts the card on par with GeForce RTX 3060 Ti prices. No retailer has officially revealed the prices of the GeForce RTX 3060 but CCL Computers is showing the cost of individual cards in the 'recently viewed' and 'similar products' panes on its website. We have included a selection of the prices below which vary between £457.12 and £513.86. CCL Computers has listed most at £499.99 though.

Those prices put the GeForce RTX 3060 at least £158.12 more expensive than NVIDIA's MSRP or 53% as a percentage. NVIDIA apparently does not plan to release a Founders Edition version of the GeForce RTX 3060 either so it remains to be seen which card will actually start at £299. Ultimately we suspect that prices of the GeForce RTX 3060 may not return to NVIDIA's MSRP until stock levels replenish. NVIDIA has indicated that this will be by May at the earliest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9nYWxheC1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDkwLWhvZi1wY2ItcGljdHVyZWQtd2l0aC1tb25zdHJvdXMtdnJtLWRlc2lnbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GALAX GeForce RTX 3090 HOF PCB pictured with monstrous VRM design,"GALAX preparing GeForce RTX 3090 HOF

We received pictures of the upcoming GALAX GeForce RTX 3090 flagship graphics card known as HOF.

Back in November Galax began teasing its HOF series through a virtual expo the manufacturer’s innovative attempt to showcase new products during the unfortunate times of a pandemic.

The photos allegedly show a prototype that is currently under evaluation. This is not a final product we are told but rather a card prepared for final testing before it goes into production.

GALAX GeFoce RTX 3090 HOF Source: VideoCardz

The RTX 3090 HOF appears to be using 26 phase VRMs so far the highest number of VRMs from any RTX 3090 graphics card we have seen. The photos weren’t good enough to determine which are used by Vcore (GPU) and Vmem (memory). The power stages are also hidden under a heatsink (which we are told will be changed for the final product).

From the photos we learn that GALAX RTX 3090 HOF will feature three 8-pin power connectors a special OC BIOS button voltage measure monitoring points for overclocking and much more.

The prototype graphics card is based on GA102-300 GPU features NVLink fingers and has 24 GDDR6 memory modules on each side of the PCB. This means that the card is based on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SKU but it seems possible that GALAX might launch an RTX 3080 or 3080 Ti model later. However we have not yet been able to confirm such plans.

The team responsible for this custom RTX 3090 design features many famous overclockers such as the TecLab team lead by Ronaldo Buassali or the HOF team lead by Mad Tse an overclocker working for Galax. As you might have guessed this graphics card is not meant for casual gamers but rather extreme overclocking with LN2. The HOF series are often used during GALAX sponsored overclocking events.

GALAX had already showcased the design of the upcoming RTX 3090 HOF last year. The 3D model did not show the 3-pin power connectors though. We did learn though that the card will be bundled with a big LCD panel which will display system information GPU metrics and even bitmaps. We have not been able to confirm whether it can work as a separate screen yet.

More details on the RTX 3090 HOF should be available soon the company is now planning to officially introduce the graphics card in February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNTU3NTU4MjDSATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTU1NzU1ODIwLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The great graphics card shortage of 2020 (and 2021),"""Part of my job is content creation so I'll go into the game and capture content - and obviously if you want to present that [publicly] you want it to look the best it can.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC1tZWRpYS1kcml2ZXItZ2V0cy1hbGRlci1sYWtlLXMtZ2VuMTItaW50ZWdyYXRlZC1ncHUtc3VwcG9ydNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Media Driver gets Alder Lake-S Gen12 integrated GPU support,"Intel Alder Lake Gen12 GPU: GT0.5 and GT1

We received a tip about a commit to Intel’s open-source Media Driver that took place back in December. It appears that Intel has already listed Alder Lake-S integrated GPUs in the Media Driver.

As we have mentioned before Intel Alder Lake is a hybrid architecture that will feature Gracemont and Golden Cove core designs on a single package. The series will be divided into three sub-series: the M-Series the P-Series and the S-Series. The first two are mobile series that we covered recently in this article. The S-Series are the next-gen desktop CPUs that will replace 11th Gen Rocket Lake-S which is now scheduled to launch in March. Interestingly according to recent rumors Alder Lake series might be announced just six months later.

The Media Driver commit revealed that Intel Alder Lake-S will sport either GT0.5 or GT1 integrated graphics which will be based on the same Gen12 architecture known as Xe-LP. The Tiger Lake Rocket Lake and Alder Lake are all listed in a single column indicating that there is little to no difference between those graphics architectures. There have been rumors that Alder Lake might be Gen12.2 while TGL and RKL are Gen12.1 however it is currently unknown if there are any changes to these subarchitectures.

The GT0.5 and GT1 codenames define the number of cores each CPU might have. Intel usually splits iGPus into GT1 or GT2 the latter being the full-fat iGPU. In this case the GT2 might be used by Alder Lake-M or P series while desktop ADP-S series do not need such a powerful iGPU as they will be paired with discrete GPUs such as GeForce RTX Radeon RX or in Intel’s case maybe even the upcoming Xe-HPG series.

The first leak that listed GT1 for the S-Series is dated back to March 2020:

The configurations of Alder Lake iGPU have already leaked back in August thanks to Coreboot listings. The list did not feature GT0.5 graphics though.

Intel Media Driver already lists official Alder Lake-S video encoding and decoding capabilities. The company does not differentiate between Tiger Lake (TGL) Rocket Lake (RKL) and Alder Lake-S (ADL-S) they are all listed as a single family of products. As noted by Intel only Tiger Lake supports VP8 decoding though.

Shares of Pepsi are down 2% over the last year. Shares are up 48% over the last five years and up 112% over the last 10 years.

What’s Next: Coca-Cola has made several acquisitions over the years to grow its non-sparkling soft drink segment. This could be a continued focus by the company.

Coca-Cola is also phasing out underperforming brands like Zico and Tab. A national launch of the company’s Topo Chico hard seltzer is happening in the first half of 2021 with distribution partner Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE: TAP).

Pepsi has been acquiring food brands to boost its more profitable business segment. Acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery will help strengthen the company in Africa and China respectively.

Benzinga's Take: Coca-Cola has a strong brand and international presence. The company has the higher dividend yield of the two beverage giants.

But the growing food portfolio of PepsiCo and the consecutive years of revenue growth could make the food and beverage giant the winner in this battle.

Amazon is selling the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Air and 11-inch iPad Pro (no Pencil included) for $199 a full $100 below the usual price. The version for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has received a slight discount as well to $330 but it’s clear the smaller model is the star.

Buy Magic Keyboard for iPad Air/11-inch iPad Pro at Amazon - $199

Buy Magic Keyboard for 12.9-inch iPad Pro at Amazon - $330

The Magic Keyboard isn’t the only viable iPad keyboard available but it’s arguably one of the best. The keyboard and trackpad feel great to use and that unusual ‘floating’ design lets you quickly grab your tablet for a drawing session or TV marathon. This is also one of those precious iPad keyboards you can use on your lap in some situations. It’s a good complement to the iPad Air and smaller iPad Pro if you’d rather not buy a laptop.

There are drawbacks. The limited range of motion won’t make it an ideal keyboard for lazing on the couch and the USB-C port is only for charging. You may want to look at alternatives like Logitech’s Folio Touch if you want more versatility. However this sale eliminates our main concern about the cost. Although $199 is still at the higher end of iPad keyboard pricing it’s easier to justify if your Apple slate serves as a productivity machine.

New Delhi: Business conglomerate Shapoorji Pallonji 's real estate platform Joyville will invest around Rs 400 crore to develop the third phase of its housing project in Gurugram as demand for residential properties has recovered from June last year a senior company official said on Sunday.In an interview Joyville Shapoorji Housing Managing Director Sriram Mahadevan said the housing sales were hit badly during the April-June quarter of this fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic but demand has improved significantly thereafter.Joyville is a USD 200 million mid-income housing platform established by Shapoorji Pallonji ADB IFC and Actis.In January 2019 the company had launched the first phase of the 18-acre project 'Joyville Gurugram' on Dwarka Expressway in Gurugram Haryana. The second phase was launched in June 2019.""We have launched the third and the last phase of our housing project in Gurugram. We will develop more than 400 units in this phase"" Mahadevan told in an interview.Mahadevan said there had been price appreciation in this project over the last two years. In contrast the first phase was launched at Rs 5800 per sq ft the unit in the third phase costs around Rs 7200 per sq ft.Asked about the investment Mahadevan said the project cost for the third phase would be around Rs 400 crore.The Joyville platform is developing around 1500 units in all three phases of the project with a total investment of Rs 1200 crore. It bought the land parcel from another real estate developer BPTP Ltd.""There is a clear cut shift of customers towards quality. They are relying more on brands. Millennials are looking at residential properties for buying. There is also a renewed interest of homeownership"" he observed when asked about the demand scenario during this pandemic.So far six projects have been launched under the Joyville platform of which three are in Pune and one each in Mumbai Kolkata and Gurugram.""During this pandemic we launched two projects in Pune and have got a good response from the customers"" Mahadevan said adding that the company has adopted digital tools in a big way to reach out to potential buyers.In December last year the company launched a new housing project ''Sensorium'' in Hinjawadi West Pune spread over 10-acre and comprising over 1100 flats with an investment of about Rs 700 crore. Before that in October a 21-acre housing project ""Joyville Hadapsar Annexe'' was launched in East Pune comprising more than 2700 units.""Across six projects we have launched around 5200 units so far and out of that 75-80 per cent are already sold. There is development potential for about 4000 units more in these six projects"" Mahadevan said.The platform has started the handover process of Phase 1 at Joyville Howrah (near Kolkata) as per the timeline and is planning to begin the handover process of Phase 1 at Joyville Virar (near Mumbai).

The Republic is careful not to colonize inhabited planets but also eager to bring other civilizations into the fold. They’re expanding out into the Outer Rim the region of space that contains some familiar out-of-the-way planets like Tatooin but hyperspace lanes so far away from the Republic capitol are still poorly mapped and potentially dangerous. In fact control of hyperspace lanes in this part of space is a major element of The High Republic story as a whole.

One interesting detail about this era of expansion is that it’s led to new scientific discoveries including a familiar substance with incredible healing properties. Bacta is the Star Wars universe’s medical miracle gel responsible for Luke Skywalker’s survival after being attacked by the Wampa in The Empire Strikes Back and countless other acts of all-purpose healing. In the High Republic era we learn that bacta is one of the exports of the planet Hetzal and that scientists have only recently discovered its medical use. Bacta is “supposed to revolutionize medicine if they could ever figure out how to farm it in volume.”

The chancellor of the Republic in this era is Lina Soh an optimistic true believer in the democracy of the galactic government. During her term she has created an initiative of Great Works including the Starlight Beacon a space station and cultural center that serves as a symbol of the Republic and as a guide for starships navigating uncharted parts of the Outer Rim. This is a chancellor long before the corrupt times of Palpatine and she does not as far as we can see have any Sith Lord whispering in her ear. Instead she has a pair of alien lions as pets and a deep sense of commitment and duty.

The creative team behind the High Republic have compared this era to the Kennedy era and the optimism of the space race and to its namesake King Arthur’s Camelot.

Familiar Jedi But New Force Powers

Like in the Prequel era the Jedi Order is led by a High Council of Grand Masters. Despite the 200-year jump back in time you’ll undoubtedly recognize some of these council members — Yoda and Yarael Poof are already leading the Order and their presence is felt far beyond the halls of the temple on Coruscant. In fact the High Republic Jedi have multiple temples spread across the galaxy including one at the Starlight Beacon. Some Jedi even serve as “marshals” upholders of a mixture of local and Republic law in the far reaches of the galaxy.

The Jedi of this era also experience and connect to the Force in vastly different ways. One Jedi can experience the Force as music while another feels the energy field as an ocean. These personal visualizations of what the Force is seems to have totally died out by the time of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Or perhaps The High Republic is just striving to go much deeper into individual Force experiences than past stories.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS93b3JsZC9iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXRyaS1zZXJ2aWNlLWNvbnRpbmdlbnQtdG8tbGVhZC1maXJzdC0xMC1yb3dzLW9mLXJlcHVibGljLWRheS1wYXJhZGUtaW4tZGVsaGnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bangladesh tri-service contingent to lead first 10 rows of Republic Day parade in Delhi - The Sunday Guardian Live,"New Delhi [India] January 23 (ANI): A Bangladeshi tri-service contingent will lead the first ten rows of the Republic Day parade in New Delhi.

It's easy and will only take a moment.

James Taylor who is complaining about the graveyard flooding at Easter Logie Cemetery. Picture: Callum Mackay

RESIDENTS of a Ross-shire community are concerned about the long-term effect of flooding on its local cemetery.

The problem centres on Logie Easter Cemetery near Milton.

Highland Council which manages the cemetery has said it will be watching the area around the graveyard and car park for any signs of flooding.

Shopkeeper James Taylor (66) who has family members buried in the cemetery said although his loved ones' graves are high up and not at risk he has serious concerns for other families who do not live locally.

Mr Taylor who runs Milton Stores in Kildary said: ""Somebody has got to stand up and speak for all the relatives that do not live here and are not able to visit here at the moment. Anyone visiting the graveyard in the last few days will have been horrified at what they have seen.""

In the last year it is understood that one family has paid to have their loved one exhumed and moved to a new cemetery elsewhere so distraught were they over the state of flooding.

It is understood that they raised the issue with the council at the time of the exhumation.

Mr Taylor continued: ""The flooding has been very bad. The car park flooding makes it almost impossible to get into the car park and I believe that some of the graves nearer to the bottom of the cemetery are already flooded.

""It has happened before about a year ago. The council came and tried to deal with it. They put in new earth and stones and it seemed to work for the last year.

""But this year it seems to be worse and we need help to improve it. There needs to be a trench that all the water can go into and be taken away from the area.""

He continued: ""Anyone passing on the A9 can see it. It is in a terrible state.""

A Highland Council spokesman said: “We have inspected the area and due to the recent rain and thaw the ground is slightly waterlogged however this should drain away as soon as the weather improves.""

It said it is working with partner agencies to alleviate a possible drainage problem nearby.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor.

The questions may be slightly different for each sales team but most of them will sound familiar to any SDR: How big is your company? How much funding do you have? Are you a decision-maker? And so on.

They’re part of the popular BANT lead qualification process which involves assessing a customer’s budget authority need and timeline for the product to determine whether they’re a fit for your company. But in today’s information-rich buying process the questions come off as irrelevant and impersonal said Coleman who is VP of revenue growth and enablement at Clari.

“They’re not asking questions that have anything to do with the solution and the value that I may realize from this product.”

“It just doesn’t seem organic” Coleman said. “It doesn’t seem like they actually care about what I’m trying to make happen. They’re not asking questions that have anything to do with the solution and the value that I may realize from this product.”

Lead qualification is still an important part of the sales process. It’s how reps can ensure they’re bringing on the right customers leading to lower rates of churn and higher lifetime value. However Coleman believes the traditional process is broken.

It doesn’t make sense to put the onus on the customer to meet a specified criteria. A better approach would be to start with an in-depth understanding of the customer serving as a consultant and helping the buyer determine whether your product is or isn’t a fit for them.

It’s about lead education Coleman said.

“It shows your prospects that you really care about them that you understand them and that you want to help them” Coleman said. “You’re setting the stage early for a more consultative sales cycle.”

Here’s how to pull it off:

Tips for Modern Lead Qualification Define your target addressable market with data. Tracking customer intent and interest allows reps to focus on prequalified prospects.

Tracking customer intent and interest allows reps to focus on prequalified prospects. Provide SDRs with the tools they need to have consultative conversations. They need a firm grasp on the buyer the product and the marketing material.

Prequalify Your Leads Through Data

As Go Nimbly’s CRO Troy Conquer is charged with helping the sales team identify the companies that could benefit most from its product. The problem is almost every company could use the revenue operations support services it offers he said.

That’s why a key part of Conquer’s lead qualification strategy is to equip the sales team with a defined target addressable market. The first step in that process is to gather as much information as possible about existing customers prioritizing the biggest revenue drivers.

Go Nimbly’s ideal customers are B2B SaaS companies at 150 employees and above Conquer said. They typically have a sales and customer success team of 40 people or more bring in $10 million in revenue a year and use Salesforce and a suite of sales automation tools. Those benchmarks informed an algorithm in Salesforce that by pulling information from ClearBit and Crunchbase provided its five-person sales team with a narrow list of customers to focus on.

“Hopefully we can open a conversation with the ones at the top of that list.”

But not all of those companies need revenue operation services. So the next layer in the strategy is to determine which customers are showing interest in RevOps Conquer said. Go Nimbly gathers that information using Bombora a software tool that tracks what B2B customers are searching for and engaging with online.

“Bombora will tell us if employees at a company like Outreach are searching for sales operations sales strategy or other terms we’ve identified as high-value to us” Conquer said. “We’ll get that information in our CRM once a week.”

The final prequalification step is to figure out which customers are interested in Go Nimbly specifically. Through marketing software they can track those who spend time on its website or click on its marketing material and move them to the top of the list.

Through that information-gathering process Go Nimbly’s reps are able to check off many of the questions they would typically ask to qualify a customer. They can instead spend their time having more informed engaging conversations to match the product to the customer’s needs.

“When I’m thinking about qualifying that’s the part of the customer journey we focus on and all of the attributes we use to understand who to focus our time on” Conquer said. “Hopefully we can open a conversation with the ones at the top of that list.”

Equip SDRs With the Tools They Need to Have Consultative Conversations

Once an SDR gets on the phone with a prospect the goal in a “lead education” strategy is for them to serve as a consultant. It’s about putting the customer’s issues first and then working backward to see if the product is a fit to solve it.

“The education component is all about understanding what is holding a customer back and talking about it in an informed way to show them that you have this conversation all the time” Coleman said.

It’s a long way from following a checklist of qualification questions. That’s why the strategy needs to start with sales leaders making education a priority in both training and its enablement strategy.

“The education component is all about understanding what is holding a customer back and talking about it in an informed way to show them that you have this conversation all of the time.”

There are three main buckets of knowledge that an SDR needs to have effective consultative conversations — an understanding of the customer the product and the marketing content. A rep needs to understand the responsibilities and pain points of each of their buyer personas in order to have a strategic conversation that’s relevant to them. They need to understand who their own competitors are and what they do that’s better and worse so that they can accurately assess their own product’s fit for a company. And they need to know how to weave use-cases and marketing content into a conversation to provide additional information that the buyer can’t just find online.

“If you can do those three things and hammer them home in onboarding and training that’s how you guarantee that they will be continually educating the people that they’re talking to” Coleman said.

As an internal bonus it also prepares the SDRs for future roles in the company.

“That type of training that you give them that’s really a foundation of knowledge that they can build on whatever they go and pursue in the future” Coleman said.

Establish Benchmarks to Track Engagement

Still it takes time for an SDR to build trust and understand a buyer’s issues. Sometimes it can happen in just one conversation but often a rep might be in contact with a prospect for months before they’re ready to buy.

That’s why Clari has built momentum benchmarks or “Managed by Objectives” into the SDR compensation plan to incentivize making in-roads on an account. Those goals might be to talk to two frontline sales managers five individual salespeople and get five people to come to a virtual event. If a rep checks those boxes they’ll receive partial commission.

“The outcome of this relationship that you build in this educational cadence that you have with content and conversation is a really in-depth understanding of their use case.”

In the process they’ll have created more awareness about the product within a company and developed a better understanding of what issues matter most to their buyer.

That way once the SDR speaks to a decision-maker they can make the conversation all about them. They can speak to their pain points where the product fits and determine whether that aligns with their strategy. It may take more work upfront but that information can help speed up the rest of the sales cycle Coleman said.

“The outcome of this relationship that you build in this educational cadence that you have with content and conversation is a really in-depth understanding of their use case” Coleman said. “That’s what you’re qualifying around.”

Helping Customers Come to Their Own Conclusion

Not every customer that goes through the prequalification process and the relationship-building phase is going to be a fit.

Customers often come to Go Nimbly wanting RevOps consulting but they don’t know what that service entails. Asking prospects what their pain points are and citing examples of how other customers have used their services helps the customer get a better picture of their services.

Through that conversation a customer might tell them they’re looking to outsource an entire RevOps team at a price competitive to what they might be able to hire offshore Conquer said. If that’s the case it’s on the rep to help the buyer understand where Go Nimbly can help — and the price point that they should expect.

If it’s not a fit then the customer will often come to their own conclusion during the course of that conversation Conquer said.

Transfer the Relationship to the AE

For customers that are a fit the last phase is a transfer of knowledge. While the customer’s information is ideally logged in the company’s CRM the rep has just spent a lot of time building a relationship with that buyer.

“We really want them to have the takeaway of thinking about whether we are a fit for what they’re trying to make happen.”

To pass that forward in the sales cycle Clari’s SDRs send an email to the AE with the prospect CC’d detailing everything that the customer is trying to make happen. At the end of it they’ll offer the buyer an opportunity to add anything to the conversation.

Ultimately a successful lead qualification strategy today is all about building a value-based relationship. It’s what sales teams owe the buyer Coleman said.

“We don’t want to only be qualifying them to see if they’re a fit for us” Coleman said. “We really want them to have the takeaway of thinking about whether we are a fit for what they’re trying to make happen.”

By Rajendra Prasad Sharma The pandemic challenged personal selling due to travel restrictions and social distancing norms forcing the sales organizations to eliminate (or minimize) in-person meetings. The working from home salespeople floundered during the transition of a substantial part of the sales process to virtual selling . Physically reaching out to the customers and connecting personally during each stage of the selling process became very challenging. The global slowdown has been pressuring the sales managers to evaluate and enhance sales productivity and up-skill the salesforce to sail smoothly through the shift. There is tremendous scope for improvement in deploying and exploiting the technology in accelerating the sales performance.Before COVID19 the salespeople used technology only to ease off the burden of routine tasks. Emails video calls social media and customer relationship management (CRM) tools from Salesforce SAP HubSpot Zoho and others have been in high demand among the sales organizations due to their increasing impact on the customer lifetime value. During the pandemic prospecting and pre-sale research have nicely moved online. LinkedIn for professional networking ZoomInfo Bloomberg and other databases have facilitated pre-sale research. Emails came in handy to respond to the formal customer requests for proposals (RFPs) requests for quotations (RFQs); the pandemic witnessed sharing in-mail videos as an influential trend. Voice calling remained inexpensive; however to propose the product discuss pricing and close deals the salespeople needed to migrate to video calling or conferencing since body language cues provide a valuable context to the sales conversation.Most salespeople being extroverts fueling up energy by being in touch with people; much of the discussion got lost during virtual selling. Only selling over the telephone emails and video calls they have started feeling demotivated. Zoom witnessed an exponential growth of virtual meetings over technology platforms viz. Cisco WebEx GoToMeeting and others. The features like screen sharing and various backgrounds helped salespeople make calls from their homes without hesitation. However embracing advanced technologies e.g. artificial intelligence machine learning  augmented reality virtual reality rapid prototyping and others will make selling personable.Though video calls are superior to audio calls and emails the high-tech augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can enhance user experience during product demonstrations since customers can get product pre-views before buying. AR/VR can enhance the buyer visits to the seller’s manufacturing plants virtual events and exhibitions saving significantly on the time effort and cost of traveling. Sales processes use big data analytics to understand customer behavior and machine learning (ML) algorithms to target the right customers rather than rely on gut-feel. However artificial intelligence (AI) will not be that sentient to replace personal selling. Some AIML applications e.g. chatbots and rapid prototyping can augment and accelerate virtual sales.Chatbots offer instant messaging using natural language processing (NLP)for deriving the meaning and intent from the written text supporting salespeople in answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) explaining complex products to potential customers and progressing the deal. Applying three-dimensional (3D) printing salespeople can create a photo-realistic model of the objects. These AI-backed systems can now be deployed from the cloud so that even smaller organizations with limited resources also can avail themselves of these cutting-edge presentation technologies.Customers use social media for information search comparing products and establishing relationships with salespeople. For instance blog posts are a powerful tool to engage decision-makers in discussions and listening to them. Success stories solving customer problems can present the value propositions persuasively. In essence the active use of social media can help salespeople communicate with customers. LinkedIn networking is a robust platform for salespeople to create share and exchange content to build stronger relationships. Sales professionals can easily measure and work towards improving their social selling skills for professional branding connecting with the right people engaging them with insights and building strong relationships on LinkedIn social selling index. White papers as case documents illustrating how the sales organization helps solve a customer problem in the B2B space can play a crucial role at the final stage as the arguments and data contained can help decision-makers conclude in the seller’s favor.Salespeople are still not using high-tech tools. They feel uneasy handling virtual video meetings. They cannot decipher buying signals from the passport-sized images of the buying team members. Virtual meetings keep them guessing what their prospects are thinking. Overuse of video conferences has also been resulting in fatigue for some.Salespeople need encouragement and guidance for improving their social selling skills. Sales enablement should focus on training the salespeople for using virtual selling methods. Training the salesforce on the intensive use of digitalized documents e.g. digital business cards digital quotations digitized sales brochures identifying the actionable points from the chatbot analytics dashboard can lead to higher conversion. Sales leaders need to equip their salesforce with excellent sales content like blogs case studies and white papers. AI/ML can facilitate the salesforce in accessing useful data-driven insights for decision making during the initial stages of the sales process i.e. targeting the right set of customers and tailoring the selling and buying processes. Documenting the industry insights future trends and smart infographics about customer solutions will create salespeople opportunities to present to the prospects with impact.The sales leaders must counsel their salespeople to tackle the motivational issues during the transition phase. To ensure the adoption of virtual selling activity quotas for embracing technology can help. Once the sales executives understand explore and become proficient they would love to combine the in-person and virtual selling methods in the post-pandemic era. Remote selling inevitably reduces travel time and cost. Also it promises to enhance the actual buyer-seller interface and customer experience. There is much scope for sales automation and technology-enablement in sales management functions.During the pandemic and beyond every facet of sales management salesforce recruitment onboarding training coaching counseling supervision and sales reviews can move online. It will be useful and productive to ensure that virtual selling incorporates in-person meetings. Organizations adopting virtual selling and overcoming technological limitations will better realize their top-line and bottom-line goals. The sales professionals adept at virtual selling will be in high demand and remain gainfully employed.The author is an associate professor Indian Institute of Foreign Trade Delhi and Kolkata.

They registered the startup as ﻿Xeno﻿.





While the startup was able to generate $300000 revenue by 2018 “We struggled to further scale it” Pranav tells YourStory.





The founders then decided to work around the business model. They spoke to more than 100 large enterprises and retailers to figure out the market gaps.

“Everyone told us the same story. Once a retailer had a few lakh customers they wanted to better understand customer behaviour in order to run more relevant campaigns” he adds. Retailers wanted to maximise revenue from their existing customer base.

Thus in 2018 Xeno pivoted to a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. The Delhi-based startup enables retailers to maximise revenue from their customers by enabling them to build deep customer understanding. This in turn helps retailers use the insights to create relevant campaigns across SMS emails and social media platforms.





Using Xeno “On an average retailers generate a 12 percent increase in repeat sales” Pranav tells YourStory.

How does it work?

Xeno is offered in a product plus consultancy model. It provides its CRM technology along with its expertise in building next-gen CRM processes. Each retailer or client has an assigned customer success manager a marketing strategist and a data scientist who works along with the client to ensure maximum revenue from the customer base.

According to the startup it targets retailers with a customer base of more than 50000 revenue higher than Rs 50 crore and a brand that is digital or ecommerce focussed.

Xeno also enables retailers to maximise the ROI from their loyal customer base. It’s artificial intelligence (AI) driven CRM enables retailers to get a deeper customer understanding.

“Xeno relies heavily on LinkedIn to reach retailers” Pranav says.

The startup has strong partnerships with PoS providers like PoSist and LogicERP which in turn serves as a key channel to reach retailers. It also creates awareness about its service offerings through the events of RAI (Retailers Association of India).





Xeno works with retailers as partners charging performance-based pricing with the base price being Rs 150000. “Performance-based pricing enables retailers to try out our services without a big upfront investment. It guarantees results and ensures Xeno makes the solution work for their brand” Pranav explains.





As of now the startup serves more than 100 retailers including brands like GAP Forest Essentials Nando’s Taco Bell Dunkin Donut Forever New Raymond and ﻿Nykaa﻿ among others. Its active client base grew by 400 percent in the last six months.





Tushar Mehta AVP Marketing Taco Bell says “Xeno’s data scientists are on the ball every single time. They all consider Taco Bell as their own brand.”

Pranav and Ayushmaan initially invested Rs 20 lakh in the startup. “Since then we have built the business using customer revenues” he says. The startup has raised 120000 euros from Techstars and METRO as part of the METRO Accelerator powered by Techstars in 2018.





In 2019 Xeno joined the Extreme Entrepreneur Programme by Lightspeed Venture Partners and was selected as the top 10 Lightspeed Extreme Entrepreneurs.

Market overview

Retailers across the globe use CRM to increase repeat sales. The process starts with retailers initiating a loyalty programme and CRM programme and then scaling the CRM programme to a few lakh customers. However what most retailers want to achieve is a better understanding of their customers’ behaviour. According to American market research company Forrester 72 percent of marketers say that customer experience is a top priority for them.





Xeno competes with global marketing clouds such as Adobe and Salesforce and is competing with Indian startups like ﻿Capillary﻿. The startup differentiates itself in the sense that it is a next-gen CRM built specifically for retailers to market on digital ad channels.





“Our data cleaning engine enables markets to make their product data marketing ready in minutes instead of months” Pranav says.

“If I want to turn around a campaign for a particular product or category I can do it in 10 minutes with Xeno compared to one or two days with others” says Nikhilendra Pratap CRM Manager at GAP.

Going ahead Xeno plans to further scale in India and expand to South-East Asia Middle-East and Australia. “We are already in talks with more than 10 retailers in those markets” Pranav adds.

But that’s exactly what happened when they fully renovated their three-bedroom 4200-square-foot French-style home in Brendonshire. Throughout the early portion of the 10-week renovation the couple stopped by and chatted with contractor Miguel Gonzalez and interior designer Chazzmin Jones. But a few weeks before completion Jones suggested a dramatic TV-style reveal. He’d never done one and the Bankses who were staying with Dionne’s mother were game. They didn’t want to get in the way and slow down Jones anyway. And they trusted him.

Dionne found Jones senior designer for Jones Design Group by searching Houzz for someone based in Indianapolis with experience blending contemporary and traditional styles. They wanted a designer who could unite Marcus’s aesthetic (elevated neutrals) with Dionne’s (a love of color). “It’s hard to manage two different styles when you’re part of the couple” Dionne says. “So we thought it would be good to have that designer experience and not have to argue with each other about what we wanted.”

From their first meeting the couple and Jones vibed. It turned out that both Dionne and Jones wanted to do a green kitchen. Dionne was thinking something along the lines of bright-but-not-highlighter-bright green. Marcus was keen on mint and Jones wanted to give it a try. (“Green is a color that is going to be in for 2021” he says.) The Bankses had one request: They didn’t want an overly trendy color they would have to change in five or 10 years. To get that perfect shade though they had to go back to the drawing board several times. When they finally found “Cilantro” by Sherwin-Williams the Bankses gave the kitchen the green light.

In the dining room they let loose with color even more. The look starts with alternating yellow and butterfly-patterned chairs which Dionne had purchased before the renovation. The deep blue color on the walls was taken from the butterfly fabric. And the geometrical wallpaper on the ceiling? Jones had seen it trending in Dallas and Dionne thought it was worth bringing here.

Because of all the bold choices the dining room was the room Dionne was most excited to see and the one Marcus was most hesitant about. “I was nervous about the dark color on the wall and how it would complement the kitchen but I think it worked well” he says. “I thought Maybe Chazz knows how it’s going to play better than I would.”

It’s true: Visualization can be hard. Sharing creative control is hard too. In those instances Dionne offers this reminder: “If you’re going to hire somebody be willing to trust them. Because that’s the whole reason you hired them.” For the Bankses that meant swapping extra space in the guest room for a larger master bathroom. Jones also had some fun with 4-year-old son Malachi’s room. He went with a “seek adventure” theme that includes a tent a bed that resembles a tent a campfire-inspired rug and road signs from the place where his parents met. “We got those from a thrift store in Arkansas and I originally planned them for the basement” says Marcus. “But I like them better up here.” At the reveal Malachi was ecstatic. He loved the rug the tent the colors. Mission accomplished.

Dionne learned a few other things from the remodel: Stick to your budget. Know your must-haves. Plan on having interruptions. Be open to compromise. And again let the experts be experts. “Part of the joy of hiring a designer is that you don’t have to think about the project all the time” says Dionne. An interior designer can be a friend a confidant a psychologist. It’s not just about the aesthetic; it’s also about trust and compatibility. “These days Pinterest and HGTV make it hard for a designer to really spread his wings with some clients” says Jones. “I was really thankful that Marcus and Dionne gave me a lot of creative freedom.”

On the day of the reveal Jones lit candles and brought in fresh flowers which gave the place a welcome-home vibe. “We walked from room to room and I got a chance to show them everything” he says. “A lot of my clients don’t get that because they’re there throughout the entire process. So it was really rewarding to see their natural reactions and have that moment with them.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

SJM,JM Smucker Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzY2FsbC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8yNC9zbXVja2Vycy1wbGFudC1yYW1wcy11cC1leHBhbnNpb24tYm9vc3RpbmctbG9uZ21vbnRzLWVjb25vbXktb24tdGhlLXdheS_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc2NhbGwuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjQvc211Y2tlcnMtcGxhbnQtcmFtcHMtdXAtZXhwYW5zaW9uLWJvb3N0aW5nLWxvbmdtb250cy1lY29ub215LW9uLXRoZS13YXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smucker’s plant ramps up expansion boosting Longmont’s economy on the way,"Since the J.M. Smucker Co. facility in Longmont became operational in 2019 it has brought hundreds of direct and indirect jobs and a positive boost to the city’s economy. With its planned expansion the plant will nearly double its employment opportunities encouraging local spending by offering competitive wages.

The Longmont plant — located at 2900 Peak Ave. off of Colo. 119 — has been producing Smucker’s Uncrustables a line of premade sandwiches best-known for its fruit jelly and peanut butter option since June 2019 after opening in March 2019.

Smucker’s broke ground for its expansion in May 2020 and is scheduled to be fully operational by fall 2022. The established part of the Longmont Uncrustables plant is 400000 square feet and the extension will add another 240000 square feet along with an expected 240 jobs company spokesman Frank Cirillo said on top of the 255 people already employed. Some prioritized roles the company will fill include electrical and controls technicians and mechanical technicians Cirillo said.

Smucker’s announced its intention to build another plant for the Uncrustables brand in 2017 in addition to a facility in Scottsville Ky. eventually picking land in the Weld County part of Longmont near Colo. 119 and Fairview Street. Cirillo said Longmont clicked all of the company’s boxes for what it wanted for its new facility.

“As we looked for a site we really were focused on a few really key criteria in terms of where ingredients would come from where the product will be shipped to available workforce efficient land” Cirillo said. “And so we did an extensive review of areas. Four locations were identified for final consideration and Longmont was selected based on those criteria.”

Additionally Smucker’s received a $6.5 million economic-development incentive for rebates on taxes and permit fees from the city. Weld County also gave the company a tax rebate on equipment of up to 50% over a 10-year period.

One requirement of the negotiations included Smucker’s paying employees 105% of Weld County’s average annual wage or about $48977. The state agreed to a $1.1 million incentive grant for Smucker’s to pay the agreed-upon wages.

The addition of competitive-paying jobs usually results in more local spending said Jim Golden chief financial officer for the city.

“Those jobs of course can have an impact on our overall economy as usually with those type of jobs (there is) some sort of a roll off impact on spending within the community” Golden said.

Despite pressure on businesses from the pandemic last year’s sales-and-use-tax collection — one indicator for increased local spending — performed well he said. Though Smucker’s alone is not the sole reason for the uptick in sales tax collection in 2020 it possibly contributed from its employees spending in the community.

According to the most recent report on sales and use tax Longmont saw a 5.7% increase in sales and use tax when comparing the month of October 2020 at $6.9 million with October 2019’s $6.5 million. Sales tax collection increased by 8.5% but use tax collection decreased 17.7% according to the report.

Golden said that last year Longmont saw increased sales for internet services grocery stores and discount stores. He added that the pandemic put a focus on shopping locally.

“I think that’s all a result of the community having jobs still in place. And so a lot a good portion of our community is still able to make purchases and I think less of those take place outside the community under these conditions” Golden said.

Boulder County shares 5.3% of the state’s total initial claims new applications for unemployment benefits between March 15 last year and Dec. 19 according to Colorado Department of Labor and Employment reports. Weld County accounted for 5% of Colorado initial claims.

Part of the tax rebate incentive covers business personal property tax for Smucker’s equipment Golden added but he predicts it will still add to tax collections.

“There’s a bit of trade off there but at the same time that’s an ongoing effort they’ll always be investing in their equipment. So there will always be property tax and use tax impact for the city as well” Golden said.

Cirillo said that Uncrustables is one of Smucker’s fastest-growing brands. The company’s outlook for the Uncrustables brand’s net sales are an increased 16% year-over-year in our fiscal year 2021 second quarter Cirillo said. Smucker’s net sales for 2020 were $7.8 billion based on the company’s annual report.

The convenience of a frozen sandwich that’s made to thaw and eat is one factor in Uncrustables growing popularity.

“For us the convenience of Uncrustables from putting it in your child’s lunchbox to taking them to work to taking it to an exercise class to have afterward is one of the main we think main attractions to it” Cirillo said.

He added that the company is focused on increasing efficiency between its Colorado and Kentucky factories.

Though the brand is known for its PB&J sandwiches it also has other varieties including meat with cheese roll-ups and chocolate-flavored hazelnut spread sandwiches. Jessica Erickson president and CEO of Longmont Economic Development Partnership said the brand has potential for growth as it diversifies the product. She added that the presence of the Longmont plant allows Smucker’s to keep up with demand.

“I think kind of the sky’s the limit in terms of what the potential for the product is which in turn suggests long term viability and stability for this company and for those jobs within our community” Erickson said.

Benefits from the increased employment opportunities from Smucker’s Uncrustables plant trickles into other jobs that interact with the company she said. Erickson shared a 2017 economic analysis that the LEDP prepared from an Impact DataSource LLC application which showed there will be about 398.6 “spinoff” jobs over the first 10 years of the facility’s operations. The study was conducted early into the project and calculated from a predicted 472 direct jobs at the Longmont plant the amount of estimated jobs after final buildout. Based on Cirillo’s projections for an added 240 employees after the second phase of construction is complete there will be about 495 workers total.

Longmont’s economic development plan known as Longmont 2.0 recognizes four industry groups that have the potential to grow with food and beverage being one of the clusters. The Uncrustables factory falls in line with industry segments Longmont wants to engage with.

“Smucker’s contributes to the growth of that cluster which ultimately creates an opportunity for us to attract more like-type businesses to our community” Erickson said.

Erickson said that Smucker’s made Longmont its home and engages with the community. The company has provided “corporate support” to Feeding America the Red Cross Boys and Girls Clubs of America and Rescue Bank locally Cirillo said as well as events including Boulder County Fair and Parade Longmont Unity in the Community and Longmont Rhythm on the River. The company was considered a gold sponsor for St. Vrain Valley annual Gala 2020.

“They’ve been very actively involved and invested in the community from a philanthropic and nonprofit support community support perspectives as well before they put a shovel into the ground and so they’ve really embraced Longmont as their home for this facility and have been great partners well beyond kind of just the the economic development story of the jobs that they’ve created and the wages that they pay” Erickson said.

For future incentives for companies from Longmont community engagement will be one determining factor beyond economic impact. According to Erickson Longmont is considering formalizing both social and environmental impacts by updating policies surrounding incentives. The LEDP began working with the city on the effort early last year she added and expects to finalize an updated policy sometime this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The former TOWIE star 33 said he hopes to 'get back to my very best' after battling an eating disorder for years and reaching 26 stone during lockdown.

He thanked his 774k followers for their support on his honest post after recently confessing he is scared to go outside during daylight hours in case people see him.

'My dream is to be as happy & healthy as I was in this photo I loved myself & felt confident! I appreciate you reaching out & giving me advice about weight loss surgery.'

The reality personality hopes to lose 12 stone by undergoing the surgery in order to save his life after doctors told him he was at risk of dying due to his weight.

Cheering him on: The reality star's celebrity pals showed their support including TOWIE's Tommy Mallet who penned: 'GO GET IT FAM! THEN START A ONLYFANS.. '

James admitted to The Sun on Saturday that he is embarrassed to see people out in daylight due to his weight gain.

He said: 'I am depressed about it. I don't want anyone to see me. If I need to do anything I wait until it's 4.30pm and it's dark outside.

'I see pictures of myself and it's too upsetting.'

James confessed that while he's now marking a year of sobriety after overcoming his drug addiction his weight has left him too embarrassed to leave the house and he spends hours alone comfort eating.

The reality star told the publication that the pounds piled on after the gyms closed during lockdown and he spent his spare time alone eating takeaways.

He said: 'I don't want to die. An op is the only way I can lose weight.'

The star is now deciding between a gastric bypass which sees part of the stomach stapled to make it smaller and sleeve gastrectomy which is a more permanent procedure which sees a large section of the stomach removed.

James said he's now agonising over which form of stomach surgery to have with both operations costing around £10000 each.

Both operations will dramatically reduced the amount of food James can eat meaning he will lose weight and the star said he's due to decide in the coming weeks which procedure he'll have.

James has faced a much-publicised battle with his weight which has drastically fluctuated since he rose to fame in 2010.

Transformed: In 2015 the star was the slimmest he'd ever been after losing four stone but has since seen his weight creep back up (left in 2015 and right in 2020)

In 2015 the star was the slimmest he'd ever been after losing four stone and transforming his physique.

But since then James' weight has crept back up and the star confessed he's now too ashamed to leave his home during the day and waits until it's dark to go out in the hope he won't be recognised.

He said that even his close friend Mark Wright has been moved to tears with concern about his size and finally convinced him to face it by stepping on the scales.

James admitted both he and Mark were stunned to see he weighed nearly 27 stone and warned him he needed to take his size seriously as it was having a serious effect on his health.

The reality star blamed his weight gain on the COVID-19 pandemic which closed gyms and swimming pools.

This comes despite the star saying in October he had made some progress with his weight loss by losing five stone.

Last year James entered a rehab facility in Thailand to kick his drug addiction and the star detailed how he used to hide his habit in his £1.3 million Essex home.

He then hit rock bottom when his family desperately attempted to get into his house after a three-day drug binge with his addiction ending his relationships with Gemma Collins and Lydia Bright as well as stalling his TV career.

Despite this James said he's now celebrating a year of sobriety free of drugs and alcohol and is now planning to document his weight loss journey with a TV documentary.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9uZXdzLzEzODMyNDk1L2NhbmRhY2Utb3dlbnMtZ2l2ZXMtYmlydGgtc2hhcmVzLXBpYy1uZXdib3JuLXNvbi10d2l0dGVyL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9uZXdzLzEzODMyNDk1L2NhbmRhY2Utb3dlbnMtZ2l2ZXMtYmlydGgtc2hhcmVzLXBpYy1uZXdib3JuLXNvbi10d2l0dGVyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Candace Owens gives birth to baby boy and shares adorable snap of newborn son on Twitter...,"CONSERVATIVE commentator Candace Owens had her firstborn child a week ago and finally shared an adorable photo of the newborn on Twitter today.

Another user said: ""Inspiring. Congratulations! you're going to be an incredible mother!""

She married Farmer an Englishman and Oxford graduate in August 2019.

The two got engaged after meeting just three weeks earlier and married a year after their engagement.

Farmer was previously the chairman of conservative group Turning Point UK and has been a vocal opponent of the EU calling it ""a toxic socialist genocidal superstate.""

“Today it’s become fashionable for narcissistic celebrities to perpetuate such brainwash amongst their fans.

“Like @mileycyrus posing half-naked with her tongue out over a cake that reads ‘abortion.'

“Like @jameelajamilofficial tweeting to scores of vulnerable young girls about how ‘proud’ she is of an earlier abortion from her teen years.

“Years ago I would have thought these women were heroic feminists. Today I know that they are anything but.”

Owens criticized Cardi B's WAP song calling it ""one of the biggest insults"" and adding that Cardi’s platform ""contributes to the disintegration of black culture and values.""

She previously said Cardi who has supported Bernie Sanders in the past was being used by Democrats. She also called Cardi ""illiterate.""

She said so after Cardi interviewed Joe Biden.

“You look at Cardi B’s Instagram and you see she has millions of followers and you think ‘OK this is an illiterate person and if I appeal to this illiterate person’ … ‘They think she’s cool she’s hip just by sitting here and taking this interview"" Owens said.

""It’s basically saying 'Black people you are stupid you are dumb and you’re so foolish.'""

It isn’t clear where Salma and her husband François-Henri Pinault are vacationing with their 13-year-old daughter Valentina Paloma Pinault right now — but it certainly is beautiful.

Of course the Grown Ups actress is no stranger to sharing a stunning vacation pic. Last summer she proved you don’t even need to getaway somewhere tropical in order to make the most of the warmer weather. While our favorite A-listers couldn’t bask in the sun in exotic locations amid the global coronavirus pandemic they instead stayed home and made use of their backyard pools. Salma took to Instagram on August 16 to give fans a glimpse at what she’s been up to. “#sundayvibes” she captioned the photo which showed her laying upside down on the edge of her pool.

Zara McDermott often promotes a healthy lifestyle online.

And as she posted a throwback snap on Saturday night several of her followers felt the urge to stop gorging on food in a bid to get a body like the Made In Chelsea star has.

Former Love Island personality Zara 24 took to her grid amid the national lockdown to reflect on the times when she was able to visit warmer climes and frolic around on the sand.

The envy-inducing throwback snaps showed the genetically-blessed beauty posing on a beach in a turquoise bikini that allowed her washboard abs and lean legs take centre stage.

Zara's tanned body boasted a golden tan and she smiled with a pink bandana atop of her ombre locks in the offerings captured in Fuerteventura over the summer.

She typed alongside the two snaps: ""summer 20 archives.""

The comments section below the stunning uploads was filled with compliments for Zara and some of her fans explained that her tight shape led to them rethinking their food choices.

One teased: ""Exactly why I should stop eating waffles and cakes.""

A second followed: ""Looking at this and munching on a massive roast dinner.""

Several of Zara's followers shared their hopes to be as fit as her by penning: ""Body goals"" below the picture.

Zara recently hit back after a troll skinny-shamed her on social media.

The bombshell had told she had lost three stone - sparking a backlash from an online troll.

One wrote: ""I read that she's 7st 7lbs and 5""6. If that's true she's underweight. Body admittedly looks great but deffo underweight."" (sic)

The starlet slammed the troll's claims she was only 7 stone 7lbs as she spilled her weight loss secrets.

Zara explained she lost the weight through healthy eating and working regular exercise into her routine.

She hit back: ""Sorry to keep having to explain myself on here but I am definitely not 7 stone 7lbs. I have learnt a lot about posting my exact before and after weight as it can be damaging and that's something I would never do now.

""Yes I have shared that I lost almost 3 stone (actually less than three stone) but no one is completely aware of my weight at my absolute heaviest and my current weight.

""It's entirely unfair for people to make statements saying I weight a certain amount when they have never ever heard that from me. There is nothing wrong with me at a size 10 and me at a size 6. I love myself in both pics.

""I just want to be helpful and motivate other people who are on the same path as me to lead a healthier lifestyle. It was never about weight loss. And it's not about weight loss.""

The dead zone as many locals refer to the area below Tidings will be a thing of the past once the tower is constructed. “The new tower will take care of the coverage gap between the Chattooga and Floyd County line” Elsberry said.

The tower is expected to take 4-6 weeks to complete. It will be 400 feet tall with a 10 foot lightning rod on the top. The tower will be on a leased 0.23 acre tract of land out of a larger 478 acre tract. The location of the tower will be 267 feet away from South Little Sand Mountain Road. “It is next to the last property in the county” said Elsberry.

The tower will be constructed by Southern Linc.

PSR is an operational tool that almost all of the Class I railroads deployed to streamline operations. Kansas City Southern (KCS) adopted PSR in 2019. Investors use OR to gauge the financial health of a company with a lower OR implying improved health. OR is a company’s operating expenses as a percentage of its revenue.

The first phase of KCS’ PSR was to increase network velocity in 2019 while the second phase sought to reduce train starts and lengthen trains. The third phase is to do a combination of both according to Sameh Fahmy executive vice president for PSR.

These efforts along with keeping a close eye on employee headcount and investing in capital infrastructure in 2021 and 2022 will enable KCS to work toward its goal of around 57.5% in 2021 and 55%-56% in 2022. KCS’ OR for 2020 as reported was 61.9%.

“We want to maintain the trains’ lengths. We want to even increase it by probably another 5%. And at the same time we want to regain the velocity that we have seen in Phase 1” Fahmy told investors during KCS’ fourth-quarter earnings call Friday. “And the way to do that is to remove the limitations that we have been facing in Q4 in particular because we have been essentially testing the limits and hitting the constraints.”

To do this KCS will be adding sidings to accommodate longer trains and it will look at yard configurations Fahmy said.

In Mexico KCS is conducting infrastructure work at its Sanchez terminal in the greater Monterrey area so that it can improve efficiency for arriving and departing cross-border trains and it is adding intermodal cranes and reconfiguring the yard lease in and out of the Salinas Victoria intermodal terminal according to KCS Chief Operating Officer Jeff Songer. The railroad is also modifying its infrastructure to improve network flow at its mainline in the Monterrey and San Luis Potosi areas.

KCS grappled with a number of headwinds in the fourth quarter which impacted fourth-quarter results. A 59-day teachers’ protest blocked trains from moving from the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas to the interior.





KCS also grappled with rising numbers of employees who’ve contracted the coronavirus. The railroad has seen about 650 cases of COVID-19 with about 5% of crews unavailable on a typical day because of COVID Fahmy said.

In addition to employees who are sick or in quarantine KCS has needed to adjust operations in Mexico. To combat the outbreak there the Mexican government has created work restrictions which have reduced the maximum time on duty for crews. KCS worked with local unions to adjust to the new mandate.

Other factors that influenced KCS’ operations in the fourth quarter included two hurricanes in October and a derailment in the Houston area that stopped the line there for two days.

As a result of all these factors average train speeds fell to 13.8 mph from 15.2 mph in the fourth quarter of 2019 while average dwell time rose to 25 hours from 19.9 hours over that same period.

To keep costs low KCS reduced train starts by 14% and lengthened trains by 14% which in turn increased fuel efficiency by 5% Fahmy said.

“We want to keep these to the gains that we made during the pandemic and at the same time absorb the revenue growth” Fahmy told investors Friday. Other ways to improve OR are to increase network velocity and invest in infrastructure that will eventually make KCS operations more efficient according to Fahmy.

KCS’ fourth-quarter financial results

KCS’ net profit for the fourth quarter of 2020 rose 30% over a year ago despite a 5% decline in revenue.

Fourth-quarter 2020 net income was $165.7 million or $1.80 per diluted share compared with $127.2 million or $1.30 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019.

KCS to develop logistics park in Wylie Texas

Prior to releasing its fourth-quarter results on Friday KCS announced a business development opportunity in Texas.

The railroad said Thursday that it has entered into a joint agreement with NorthPoint Development to develop the Wylie Logistics Park in Wylie Texas. The property is adjacent to KCS’ David L. Starling Wylie Intermodal Terminal.

The park offers 2.4 million square feet of potential building capacity for traditional warehousing and distribution; industrial grade amenities; dual feed electrical system with redundant power; as well as a heavy-haul road network comprising direct access to Highway 78 and the interstate system air and seaports and a state-of-the-art intermodal terminal KCS said.

“Wylie is part of the Dallas metro area the fourth fastest growing industrial market in the U.S. and Wylie offers a business-friendly environment low taxes and a double free port exemption” said Ginger Adamiak KCS vice president for chemical and energy products. Adamiak also leads the company’s industrial development team.

Rodrigo Flores KCS vice president for intermodal and automotive said “The Wylie Logistics Park is ideal for customers looking to combine logistics and real estate in one location. Locating in the park will provide tenants and customers significant cost savings by reducing drayage from ramp to facility and providing quick access to the regional interstate network. Customers will also enjoy the environmental benefits of intermodal transportation and connectivity to other intermodal and port facilities on KCS’ U.S. and Mexico rail network.”

The site is attractive from an e-commerce perspective and its location has a competitive labor pool NorthPoint said.

KCS’ adjacent Wylie Intermodal Terminal has track capacity of 19000 feet and an annual lift capacity of 342000.

The terminal opened in 2015 and was expanded in 2018.

The 806-acre site in southern Texas sits near SpaceX’s Starship facilities a sprawling testing ground for its methane-fueled Raptor rocket engine.

Tim George an attorney for the SpaceX subsidiary fighting for the land was quoted by Bloomberg News which first reported the legal despute as saying methane reserves from the land will be used “in connection with their rocket facility operations.”

In filings with a Texas energy regulator the SpaceX subsidiary Lone Star Mineral Development LLC demanded that Dallas Petroleum Group (DPG) LLC which claims ownership to wells on the land vacate the wells by the end of 2020. The filings allege that the oil firm doesn’t have the right to own them and that it “illegally trespassed and installed a lock on the entry gate to prevent Lone Star’s access to” the wells.

Public records show SpaceX leased the land from Mesquite Energy Inc. in June 2020. DPG says it maintains the right to the wells on the same plot of land and asked a judge to dismiss Lone Star’s claims.

None of the Lone Star or SpaceX attorneys involved in the case could be reached for comment. DPG attorneys likewise could not be reached for comment.

The case is currently before the Railroad Commission of Texas a state regulatory agency. The Commission’s three commissioners will vote on the outcome of the case once a judge issues a “proposal for decision” a spokesman for the agency said a process that could take several months.

SpaceX’s Raptor engines power the company’s heavy-lift Starship system a shiny rocket tailored for routine flights to Mars. SpaceX has been conducting test flights of early Starship prototypes in Boca Chica Texas a rural beachside area in Cameron County.

As a student in college and seminary then as a pastor in Texas Dwight McKissic has been affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention for more than 45 years. Now he’s pondering whether he and his congregation should break away.

“It would feel like a divorce” McKissic said. “That’s something I’ve never had but that’s what it would feel like.”

If he does he would be following in the footsteps of several other Black pastors who have recently exited in dismay over what they see as racial insensitivity from some leaders of the predominantly white SBC. Tensions are high after an election year in which racism was a central issue and after a provocative declaration by SBC seminary presidents in late 2020 that a fundamental concept in the struggle against racial injustice contravenes church doctrine.

A crucial moment for McKissic and other Black pastors could come in June at the SBC’s national meeting in Nashville Tennessee if delegates rebuff their views on systemic racism in the U.S. and if Rev. Albert Mohler a high-profile conservative who heads the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary is elected SBC president.

Last year even while announcing new scholarship funds for Black students Mohler declined to change the names of buildings at his seminary named after slaveholders. More recently he played a key role in the seminary presidents' repudiation of critical race theory — a broad term used in academic and activist circles to describe critiques of systemic racism

The presidents later apologized for not consulting Black pastors before issuing that repudiation but Mohler told The Associated Press the presidents would likely have reached the same decision in any case.

The seminary leaders' stance on critical race theory as well as Mohler's public support for Donald Trump in the 2020 election “should disqualify him from being SBC president” said McKissic who has become one of the SBC’s most prominent Black pastors since founding the Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington Texas in 1983.

Some of the pastors who cut ties with the SBC in recent months also share negative views of Mohler. The Rev. Ralph West whose Church Without Walls in Houston claims a weekly attendance of 9000 called him “a polarizing figure” who would worsen divisions within the SBC.

Mohler suggested his critics do not reflect the opinions of most Southern Baptists white or Black.

“I believe I represent the vast mainstream of conservative Southern Baptists on these issues” he said. “I think I am polarizing only at the extremes.”

Regarding Trump who had overwhelming backing from white evangelicals Mohler said he consistently pointed out the former president’s flaws but opted to endorse him based on his stances opposing abortion and defending religious liberties.

The SBC the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. was founded in an 1845 split with northern Baptists over slavery and became the church of Southern slaveholders. Its membership of about 14.5 million remains overwhelming white — its predominantly Black churches claim a combined membership of about 400000.

While the SBC formally apologized in 1995 for its pro-slavery past and later condemned white supremacy some tensions flared again after the Nov. 30 statement from six seminary presidents all of them white. They declared that critical race theory was “incompatible with” central tenets of the SBC’s Scripture-based theology.

The statement swiftly created friction far beyond the realm of SBC academia particularly due to the lack of Black involvement in its drafting.

Virginia pastor Marshal Ausberry president of the organization that represents the SBC’s Black pastors wrote to the presidents saying concepts such as critical race theory “help us to see and discover otherwise undetected systemic racism in institutions and in ourselves.”

“The optics of six Anglo brothers meeting to discuss racism and other related issues without having ethnic representation in the room in 2020 — at worst it looks like paternalism at best insensitivity” Ausberry first vice president of the SBC elaborated in an interview with Baptist Press the SBC’s official news agency.

The presidents apologized for not consulting Black pastors and met with some of them Jan. 6 but have not wavered in their rejection of critical race theory.

McKissic who was in the Jan. 6 meeting said the conversation was polite “but the outcome was not respectful to who Black people are in our history.”

He’s likely to remain in the SBC until the June meeting but is prepared to exit then if the delegates ratify the presidents’ stance on critical race theory as official policy.

“if they adopt that statement in June it would be the feeling to me that people you trusted hit you in the face with a baseball bat” McKissic said.

Another possible trigger for him would be if delegates rescind a 2019 resolution that included a positive reference to critical race theory suggesting it could be useful as an “analytical tool” as long as it was subordinate to Scripture.

The Rev. Charlie Dates of the Progressive Baptist Church in Chicago one of the pastors who have already severed ties said the November statement was “the last straw.”

“When did the theological architects of American slavery develop the moral character to tell the church how it should discuss and discern racism?” Dates wrote in an op-ed for Religion News Service. “The hard reality of the seminary presidents’ statement is that Black people will never gain full equality in the Southern Baptist Convention.”

Other Black pastors who have cut ties include the Rev. Seth Martin whose multiracial Brook Community Church in Minneapolis had been receiving financial support from the Southern Baptist association in Minnesota and the Rev. Joel Bowman who abandoned plans to move his Temple of Faith Baptist Church in Louisville Kentucky into the SBC fold.

“I genuinely believe the SBC is headed in the wrong direction” Bowman said. “White evangelicals have gotten in bed with the Republican Party.”

Some white SBC pastors are also troubled such as the Rev. Ed Litton of Mobile Alabama who is one of Mohler’s rivals for the SBC presidency. McKissic has endorsed Litton's candidacy.

Litton was a co-signer of a statement by a multiethnic group of Southern Baptists last month which asserted that “some recent events have left many brothers and sisters of color feeling betrayed and wondering if the SBC is committed to racial reconciliation.”

Special to The Post

Kushner Companies is seeking county approval to build a 1 million-square-foot Amazon-type distribution facility just west of the turnpike in unincorporated Delray Beach off West Atlantic Avenue.

If approved it would become the single largest commercial/industrial project built in the Agricultural Reserve a 20000-acre zone in southern Palm Beach County designed to preserve agriculture and prevent over-development.

The New York City-based real estate company has become increasingly active in South Florida. It was founded by Charles Kushner father of Jared Kushner former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law.

Charles Kushner was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison on 18 counts of tax evasion and witness tampering. Trump pardoned him Dec. 23 citing Kushner's charitable work.

“We are very bullish on Palm Beach County and will continue to look for opportunities” said Laurent Morali president of Kushner Companies. “We intend to develop this (the West Delray project) ourselves. We have received a lot of inbound inquiries from various parties interested in either teaming up with us or buying the site from us.”

The 51-acre tract has been a nursey for more than 50 years. It extends from Starkey Road east toward the turnpike on the north side of West Atlantic. The project is called Star Key.

Kushner Companies is expected to develop more detailed plans this year when it will appear before the Planning Commission to seek the zoning change from agricultural to industrial. Issues that it will have to overcome include the size of the distribution center and traffic congestion on West Atlantic Avenue.

Lori Vinikoor spokeswoman for the Alliance of Delray Residential Associations said the civic group cannot support the project as currently designed.

“They told us that the trucks will go west on Atlantic toward State Road 7” said Vinikoor. “We expect they would be making U-turns to get back to the turnpike entrance on Atlantic Avenue. We are concerned that they would be instead be turning left on Atlantic Avenue to get to the turnpike. That would be a nightmare.”

The alliance wants Kushner Companies to realign Starkey Road to move it farther west so it would align with Persimmon Avenue on the south side of Atlantic. That way she explained trucks could turn left with the aid of a traffic light. Vinikoor said the developer is negotiating with property owners to make that happen.

“We are willing to work with them to see if the project can be made acceptable” she said.

Also:Amazon advocate explains why distribution center beats alternative

The traffic consultant for Kushner Companies acknowledges in a report submitted to the county that West Atlantic Avenue is so congested that Kushner Companies will have to make a financial contribution toward the road improvements. The state and county have developed plans to widen and improve the road but those projects are years away from happening.

Morali said he's confident final plans for the project will be acceptable to the alliance and county officials noting that the site is an ideal location for a distribution center. There are no residential developments on that side of Atlantic Avenue. It offers direct access to Florida's Turnpike as well as convenient access to State Road 7 and Interstate 95 making it a prime location for industrial development he said.

In reports submitted to the county Kushner Companies maintains that the site is big enough to adequately develop an industrial warehouse/distribution operation “while providing appropriate buffering screening landscaping setbacks and other design features to increase the compatibility of the site with surrounding uses.”

The Ag Reserve has a cap on commercial development along with rules that restrict the density of residential development but there are no restrictions on industrial projects. The county is encouraging industrial development along West Atlantic.

Amazon the world’s biggest online retailer opened a delivery warehouse west of West Palm Beach in October. It is building a 1 million-square-foot fulfillment center west of Jupiter and plans to open a delivery station in Boca Raton later this year. The Post recently reported that Amazon filed plans with the Village of Golf to build another delivery facility.

It's not clear whether Amazon would be interested in yet another facility in Palm Beach County but Kelly Smallridge president of the county’s Business Development Board said there's a strong demand for distribution centers.

“They are needed to service the growing population” she said. “This is a way for them to get their product to the consumer.”

If not Amazon she said she expects other companies to be attracted to the west Delray site.

Southwest Airlines is moving into two new Californian cities this April and just announced five new routes as a housewarming gift.

Santa Barbara and Fresno will become the 12th and 13th cities in California served by Southwest once service begins later this year ramping up a rivalry between America's largest low-cost carrier and Alaska Airlines. Both are striving to become the unofficial airline of the West Coast with an ever-growing presence in California Oregon and Washington from San Diego to Seattle.

In California Alaska currently outnumbers Southwest in cities served by 15 to 11. Come April however that gap will narrow by two cities with the addition of Santa Barbara and Fresno.

Each airline has its own strengths that will help draw customers. Southwest can offer its fleet of mainline Boeing 737 aircraft and no shortage of connecting opportunities to cities to the east while Alaska has a growing network of international partners that now includes Qatar Airways and is preparing to join the Oneworld airline alliance.

The pandemic has forced Southwest to reexamine its route map and add new smaller cities including Sarasota Florida Jackson; Mississippi; and Colorado Springs Colorado to name just a few. And while traditionally avoiding them Southwest is also moving into major international airports like Chicago's O'Hare International Airport Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Miami International Airport.

Access to the cockpit is blocked while this is happening so prevent passengers from getting in. And a flight attendant goes into the cockpit so that the other pilot isn’t alone (a procedure adopted after the Germanwings crash where a pilot committed suicide locking the other pilot out of the cockpit).

The pilot didn’t go right back into the cockpit. He spent time chatting with a flight attendant. And the listener wanted to know whether there’s a time limit for how long a pilot can be out of the cockpit during a flight.

Former Spirit Airlines CEO Ben Baldanza relayed that he spoke with attorney Peter Petesch about the relevant Federal Aviation Regulations. FAR 121.543 requires pilots to be in the cockpit at all times except:



“Necessary for performance of duties” to check something in the aircaft



“In connection with physiological needs” using the lav



Crew rest when another pilot takes their place

There’s no time limit on these exceptions. So in Baldanza’s words “the only thing I could imagine this pilot would do is say his chatting with the flight attendant was meeting another physiological need.”

Several years ago on an American Airlines flight from Washington National to Dallas-Fort Worth my flight’s captain spent 20 minutes in the galley flirting as part of his lavatory trip.

This came right after the meal service and passengers up front were visibly squirming in their seats while a service cart in the aisle in coach meant it wasn’t possible for passengers to go to the lavatories in back either.

My view is that a few pleasantries as part of a bathroom trip is fine but that a pilot shouldn’t be out of the cockpit for 20 minutes on non-bathroom business while they’re on duty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtZnJlc25vLXNhbnRhLWJhcmJhcmEtbmV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Bets On California With New Routes,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtZnJlc25vLXNhbnRhLWJhcmJhcmEtbmV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwcGhvZW5peC5jb20vbmV3cy9jYW5keS1jb21wYW55LXBheWluZy0zMC1hbi1ob3VyLXRvLWVhdC1yZXZpZXctc3dlZXRz0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94MTBwaG9lbml4LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhbmR5LWNvbXBhbnktcGF5aW5nLTMwLWFuLWhvdXItdG8tZWF0LXJldmlldy1zd2VldHMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Candy company paying $30 an hour to eat review sweets,"Sweet gig.

SWK,Stanley Black & Decker,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHVzdHJ5d2Vlay5jb20vbGVhZGVyc2hpcC9jb21wYW5pZXMtZXhlY3V0aXZlcy9uZXdzLzU1MDM3OTM0L2Nlby1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1saWtlbHktdG8tc2VsbC1tb3JlLXVuaXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CEO: Stanley Black & Decker Likely to Sell More Units,"Tools and outdoor products manufacturer Stanley Black & Decker Inc. is likely to divest more of its holdings its president and CEO told analysts last week.

Speaking after Connecticut-based Stanley Black & Decker reported its first-quarter results Don Allan said the work his team has done in recent years to slim down—highlighted recently by the sale its attachment and handheld hydraulic tools business to Sweden’s Epiroc AB for $760 million—hasn’t necessarily been concluded. There’s no financial urgency to do more Allan said but some of the company’s smaller brands could be next to go the sale block.

That could include parts of Stanley Black & Decker’s tools-and-outdoor-gear group which accounted for 85% of the company’s Q1 sales. It is anchored by well-known brands such as DeWalt Craftsman and Stanley which are receiving the lion’s share of 2024 growth investments.

The division’s smaller brands—they include Lenox Troy-Bilt and Irwin—could eventually be brought to market though. And some parts of the company’s engineered fasteners business also are possibly in line for what Allan called “a little pruning.”

“We will continue to be active” he said. “I think we’ve demonstrated over the years that pruning the portfolio is something that is important to do. But you need to do it in a way that creates value for your shareholders.”

Allan’s comments and any future deals by Stanley Black & Decker are best placed in the context of the company’s broad cost-saving plan launched in mid-2022 that is seeking to generate a run rate of $2 billion annually in cost cuts by the end of 2025. That initiative has among other things focused on more efficiently working with suppliers and closing handfuls of plants around the world.

Portfolio culling of the kind Allan and his team have been doing—they also sold most of Stanley Black & Decker’s security businesses nearly two years ago for $3.2 billion—has been a driver of industrial M&A activity in recent quarters experts from PricewaterhouseCoopers said earlier this year. The need to devote cash to automation and other technology priorities is helping spur a rise in divestitures.

“Corporates are expected to continue to be advantaged due to their ability to use higher levels of equity and pay for to-be-realized synergies” the PwC team wrote. “Corporate divestitures are expected to accelerate as corporates seek to raise capital to fund growth.”

Stanley Black & Decker produced a net profit of $19.5 million in the first quarter reversing a large year-ago loss thanks to a jump of more than seven percentage points in the tools and outdoor group’s segment margin. Net sales slipped slightly to $3.87 billion.

Shares of Stanley Black & Decker (Ticker: SWK) were changing hands around $87.80 on the afternoon of May 7 up about 1% on the day.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 0.32%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

A popular Starbucks coffee shop next to city hall in Port Coquitlam is closing at the end of the month as the coffee giant looks to reorganize its retail stores over the coming months.

And while the approximately 20 staff have new posts at other Starbucks shops in the city one long-time employee expressed disappointment that the tiny store next to Veterans Park is shutting down.

“Our little home is closing” said Leah Whitmore who is transferring to another Starbucks at the Prairie Avenue and Coast Meridian location on the city’s north side.

The upcoming closure drew a range of comments on the Port Coquitlam community Facebook page recently with some mourning the closure of the long-time coffee shop and others noting that coffee can still be purchased in the city’s downtown including at Waves Coffee Shop and at Daniel Chocolates Cafe on Marpole Street.

The city’s mayor said the coffee shop will be missed especially by those frequenting city hall but said he hoped a new and “unique” business would move in that would be part of the city’s revitalization plan for the area.

Brad West said changes planned for McAllistair Avenue — which will transform the historic downtown street into a walkable tree-lined road — will draw people into the city centre.

The $4.5 million project is expected to start this year said the mayor and plans are in the works to upgrade Veterans Park where the cenotaph is located and nearby Leigh Square.

“It’s a cool opportunity. It’s a great location for a new and unique business to kind of get a front row seat on those things that are going to happen” West said.

But for staff who work at the Starbucks it’s been sad to say goodbye to some of the regular customers.

Whitmore who has worked at the shop for two years says she understands the company’s efforts to transform with more drive-thru options and a focus on grab-and-go. Still she said the city hall Starbucks had been a busy place until COVID-19 took its toll on the business.

“The community is sad a lot of people are regulars” she said.

In Seattle Wednesday hours after the swearing-in ceremony dozens of protesters marched demanding the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At least three people were arrested and broken windows were reported – including those at Starbucks' original Pike Place storefront.

On the same day Portland saw an anti-Biden Antifa protest in which rioters carrying stun guns pepper ball guns and fireworks scuffled with police and damaged an ICE building police said. Photographs show marchers carrying signs with phrases including ""We don’t want Biden – we want revenge!"" and ""We are ungovernable.""

WASHINGTON CITY'S MAYOR RUSHED TO SAFETY AFTER RIOTERS STORM CITY HALL

There was also damage to the state Democratic Party headquarters although some people who attended the protest later condemned the violence. At least 15 people were arrested.

In Denver protesters blasted both former President Donald Trump and Biden and allegedly burned an American flag. At least two people were arrested there.

""I remember the media and Democrats blaming all this Antifa violence on Donald Trump -- yet here we have Joe Biden in the White House and Antifa is still rampaging in the streets of Seattle and Portland and Denver"" Sen. Tom Cotton told ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday morning.

KIRO-TV reporter Deedee Sun tweeted video that appeared to show masked black-clad protesters taking down the American flag outside and carry it away. She said they also ""threw a hot drink"" on a different reporter and stole a microphone.

Rioters entered City Hall – but no one was hurt nothing was damaged and no one was arrested according to the local Bellingham Herald newspaper.

Whether caffeine makes it harder for you to get adequate sleep interacts with prescription medications that you're taking or you're just extra sensitive to it there are obvious benefits to making the switch to decaf coffee. However there are some negative side effects that can come with drinking too much decaf coffee as well.

First of all it's important to note that decaf coffee is not totally devoid of caffeine—it typically contains about 3 milligrams per cup versus 85 milligrams in a standard cup of regular coffee. According to a 2017 systematic review the composition of decaf coffee is highly similar to regular coffee which suggests that it may boast many of the same health benefits—like lowering your risk of skin liver prostate endometrial and oral cancer as well as leukemia. Not only that but studies have found a link between drinking decaf coffee and a reduced risk of premature death death from cardiovascular causes and type 2 diabetes.

According to Sean Allt nutrition coach at Innovative Fitness the question of whether decaf coffee is healthier depends on whether you have the ""fast"" or ""slow"" version of a particular gene: CYP1A2.

""This gene determines how effectively your body metabolizes caffeine"" he says. ""If you're a slow metabolizer of caffeine then decaf coffee (or tea) would be a healthier option for you. If you're a fast metabolizer then you're likely okay sticking to fully caffeinated coffee. And just because caffeine doesn't keep you up at night doesn't necessarily mean that you're a fast metabolizer of it. Its effects as a stimulant are based on how easily it binds to receptors in your nervous system whereas it is metabolized in your liver.""

So what are the potential consequences of downing too much decaf coffee? Here's what you should know and for more helpful tips be sure to check out our list of The 7 Healthiest Foods to Eat Right Now.

Your teeth might show signs of damage.

""Decaf coffee like its fully caffeinated counterpart can stain your teeth"" says Allt.

And that's not all—in addition to discoloring your pearly whites Allt also says it can cause more serious damage.

""Though less acidic than full-strength coffee decaf coffee is still acidic in nature which means that excessive consumption can erode the natural enamel of your teeth over time making them more sensitive and susceptible to cavities"" he adds.

Some dentists recommend drinking water in between cups of coffee in order to reduce the negative effects of so much acidity.

You may have to go to the bathroom—a lot.

Just like regular coffee decaf also increases the production of gastrin in the gut. Gastrin a handy little hormone that triggers the release of stomach acid helps the body to break down the proteins in the food you eat and absorb the vitamins in them more effectively. However an increase in gastrin can push your gut to move digestion along a little faster than it normally would. That means if you're pounding decaf coffee all morning and afternoon you'll probably end up running to the bathroom a lot. By the way—extremely high levels of gastrin can be dangerous—some of the milder side effects include diarrhea but more severe cases may lead to stomach and small intestinal ulcers.

It might be harder to lose weight.

If you're trying to shed some pounds drinking lots of decaf coffee may make that more difficult for several reasons—particularly the added sugars that are in your decaf coffee beverages.

""Coffee is a bit of a 'gateway caloric beverage' in that—depending on how you take it (amount of milk cream sugar etc.)—the calories can add up pretty quickly which can lead to weight gain and/or difficulty losing weight"" says Allt.

Of course if you drink your decaf coffee black or with a splash of milk then you don't have to worry about it sabotaging your efforts to slim down. However it may not help either. Regular coffee contains caffeine a stimulant that has been found to boost your metabolism as well as stimulate your body to break down fat cells. Since decaf only contains trace amounts of caffeine it's not likely to have this effect.

Your cholesterol may suffer.

A 2005 study discovered that participants who drank three to six cups of decaf coffee a day experienced an increase in LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol. Interestingly this effect was not observed in the group who drank regular caffeinated coffee. Decaf coffee was also found to increase levels of specific blood fat in the body that's associated with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of harmful heart disease risk factors.

Researchers noted that this effect is unlikely to happen if you only have one cup of decaf coffee a day—but they added that people concerned about their LDL cholesterol should think twice about drinking a lot of it.

You may develop an iron deficiency.

Both regular and decaf coffee contain polyphenols powerful micronutrients that can play a role in preventing a slew of diseases. But research has shown that these polyphenol compounds—specifically chlorogenic acid—can also inhibit your body's absorption of non-heme iron (the kind found in plant-based foods). An iron deficiency can cause brittle nails changes in taste hair loss and in more serious cases anemia. Fortunately it seems that polyphenols only latch on to iron if they're ingested simultaneously so you can avoid this by not drinking decaf coffee at the same time you're eating iron-containing food.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Here's What Happens To Your Body When You Drink Decaf Coffee.

You'll have a higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes swelling aching stiffness and tenderness in the joints and other parts of the body. The specific causes of this painful disease are not yet known but according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention some factors can increase the risk of developing it such as smoking or early-life exposure to smoke and obesity.

A large 2002 study of 31336 women ages 55 to 69 determined that those who drank four or more cups of decaf coffee a day had a higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis—and surprisingly caffeinated coffee did not pose this risk. Researchers still have not determined the reason for this link but if you already know you're at risk for rheumatoid arthritis you may want to limit your decaf coffee intake to two cups or less.

You could be ingesting a toxic chemical

You might want to take a closer look at the label on the decaf coffee you're buying. A 2020 investigation of 24 of the leading coffee brands conducted by the Clean Label Project found ""quantifiable amounts"" of a toxic chemical called methylene chloride which is commonly found in paint stripper in many of their decaf products. Methylene chloride which has been banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been linked to multiple cancers asphyxiation cognitive impairment and liver kidney and reproductive toxicity.

To make sure your decaf java is safe to drink check out the Clean Label Project's list of brands and products that were not detected to contain methylene chloride. You can also check the label for words like ""chemical-free"" ""Swiss-water"" or ""certified organic"" all of which indicate that the decaffeination process didn't involve harsh chemicals.

Ultimately when it comes to the potential side effects or risks that come with having decaf coffee it all depends on the quality of your current health—but even more so how much you're drinking on a daily basis. So to be on the safe side Allt suggests sticking to one to three cups.

""Most research that has shown the health benefits of coffee (whether fully caffeinated or decaf) has found the point of diminishing returns to be any intake above 2 to 3 cups per day"" Allt says. ""In fact many studies have found that anything above 3 cups can actually negate the benefits of more moderate consumption.""

Snacks cereal and frozen food sales soar as social distancing continues

Sales of snacks frozen food products and coffee beans have risen sharply as more people eat and drink at home during the prolonged coronavirus pandemic.Confectionery maker Orion said Thursday that its monthly sales last year peaked in December.Snack sales are normally highest during the summer as people look for something to eat while drinking beer on those long warm evenings. In fact Orion’s sales in August are normally about 20 percent higher than in December.Last year when social distancing guidelines increased in December sales exceeded August by 6 percent.“It is a very exceptional situation” said a spokesperson for Orion. “The biggest reason is the growing number of people who enjoy drinking at home amid the strengthened social distancing guidelines. The release of new products was also a driving force.”Sales of frozen food products coffee and cereals also increased.According to Emart24 sales of frozen food products in the second half of last year increased by 39 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. That’s over three times the year-on-year increase rate in 2019 compared to the previous year which was 12 percent.Coffee bean sales at Starbucks last year also soared by 33 percent from the previous year. In December when people were only allowed to order takeout coffee sales of coffee beans jumped 62 percent compared to the same month a year ago.Dongsuh Foods also saw its Post Granola cereal post 34 billion won ($30.8 million) in sales last year up 33 percent compared to a year before.“As people are more reluctant to go out and therefore spend more time at home frozen food products are gaining popularity from customers as they are very easy to keep in refrigerators for longer periods of time” said Lee Yu-jin a buyer at Emart24. “With the high demand of frozen food products it is expected that demand for frozen desserts will also increase further. Emart24 plans to strengthen our products lineup according to that.”BY LEE BYUNG-JUN [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]"

Despanie is joined on the first team by teammates junior offensive lineman Quinn Collins senior running back Traylon Prejean senior athlete Kendrell Williams and junior defensive lineman Rondre Charles.

Carencro’s Tony Courville was selected as the Coach of the Year after guiding the Golden Bears to their first state championship since 1992 and defeating four-time defending champion Edna Karr in the title game.

Edna Karr placed four players on the Class 4A team with wide receiver Destyn Hill offensive lineman Kenneth Bannister defensive lineman Tygee Hill and kick returner Aaron Anderson earning honors.

But subpar cameras and a short software life span hurt the One 5G Ace.” Pros Modern design

Excellent battery life

Solid display

Good performance Cons Subpar camera for the money

Only one software update guaranteed

Motorola recently unveiled the 2021 Moto G series which offers solid value for those who don’t want to spend more than $250. But alongside the Moto G the company also launched a new model in its higher-end One line: The Motorola One 5G Ace.

At first glance the Motorola One 5G Ace is a bit of a confusing launch (and an awkward name) but it’s important not to think of it as a replacement to last year’s Motorola One 5G. This device has a lower-end processor a worse display and other cutbacks — but it also comes in at $400 or $150 cheaper than the standard Motorola One 5G.

There’s no shortage of competition at this price range though. With the Pixel 4a and iPhone SE among its rivals does the Motorola One 5G Ace compete? We put it to the test to find out.

Design and display

Motorola has done well offering relatively modern-looking phones for the price and the One 5G Ace is no exception to that rule. It’s a tall phone with a large 6.7-inch display at a 20:9 aspect ratio and that makes it great for scrolling through Twitter seeing all your emails at a glance and simply being able to see more at any time. Of course there’s a trade-off: Don’t expect to be able to reach the top of the display without the help of a second hand.

While the original One 5G had a dual front-facing camera the Ace has a centered single cutout for the selfie cam. And there’s a small chin at the bottom of the display though it’s not too intrusive and you likely won’t notice it at all in day-to-day use.

At first glance the back of the phone looks metallic but you won’t be fooled for long. It feels like plastic. Now that’s not a huge deal for the price — it’s not as premium-feeling as a glass or metal device and its weightiness helps make it feel solid. Plastic will help make the phone more durable to typical bumps and scrapes which is usually a solid selling point for those buying a device on a budget. Also on the back is a fingerprint sensor which worked relatively quickly and accurately and a triple-sensor camera module.

Apart from the standard power button volume rocker and USB-C port around the edges you’ll also get a headphone jack. It’s nice that Motorola has stuck with the headphone jack for this long on its budget phones.

The display is a clear step up from the Moto G series thanks to its higher 1080p resolution. Unfortunately you won’t get the 90Hz refresh rate that you get on the standard Motorola One 5G but it still offers decently vivid colors and gets relatively bright. It’s a good-looking display for a phone in this price range.

Performance and battery

Under the hood the Motorola One 5G Ace is a clear step up from any Moto G device thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor coupled with 4GB or 6GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of storage. It’s a solid setup and the Qualcomm 7-series has really proven itself over the past year as a great way to get good performance without buying a flagship phone.

In day-to-day use the phone is more than capable. It rarely had any issues even when used for heavy multitasking mobile gaming and more. I have the 6GB RAM model and I never had any issues with apps closing in the background before I was done with them. It even handled some Call of Duty: Mobile and Asphalt 9: Legends with ease. Sure load times may be slightly longer than on the Snapdragon 765G-equipped Motorola One 5G and it may start to slow down sooner but in normal use at this point in time they feel almost identical.

The phone boasts a 5000mAh battery (yes the same as a Galaxy S21 Ultra) which is more than enough for a full day of heavy use. While it doesn’t last quite as long as that on the Moto G Power due to the higher resolution display most people will still be able to get two days of moderate use from it which is what Motorola advertises. If you’re good at keeping your phone charged up each day you’ll have nothing to worry about here. Unfortunately there’s no wireless charging which is a little disappointing. It’s still tolerable that a $400 phone wouldn’t offer it but it won’t be for long — and it would have been nice to see the One 5G Ace be ahead of the curve.

Having 5G on board is a win for a device in this lower price bracket but soon it won’t be all that remarkable as every phone will come with 5G. How well the One 5G Ace performs on the network will be determined more so by your carrier and 5G coverage but it’s great to know that when you have access to 5G your phone will be ready.

Cameras

As mentioned the Motorola One 5G Ace has a triple-camera system featuring one 48-megapixel main sensor with an f/1.7 aperture lens one 8MP ultrawide camera with an f/2.2 aperture and one 2MP macro camera. I still don’t believe that people really use macro lenses (more than just to review them anyway) but Motorola begs to differ arguing that in the era of COVID-19 more people than ever are taking photos of things up close at home. I would have preferred a telephoto to a macro.

The camera on the One 5G Ace is fine but not much better than fine. In good lighting conditions it’s able to produce a solid shot though colors aren’t very vivid and details aren’t as crisp as they could be.

In low light images are far worse. There’s little detail to speak of and a whole lot of noise — if you can actually lock focus and capture a nonblurry image in the first place. Highlights are often way overblown which is common among low-end phones in low light so while you’ll be able to tell what you’re taking a photo of most of the time don’t expect much more than that.

The same is more or less true on the front of the phone. The 16MP front-facing camera can take fine selfies but nothing that’s going to fool anyone into thinking you have a higher-end phone.

The Motorola One 5G Ace’s main issue in the camera department has more to do with competition than anything else. The fact is that excellent phone cameras are getting cheaper and that charge is led by Google. The Pixel 4a is $50 less but offers a camera that’s an order of magnitude better than that of the One 5G Ace. If you’re willing to jump ship to iOS the iPhone SE has a better camera too — though it’s not as good as the Pixel 4a’s. Lastly the OnePlus Nord may not have the best camera out there but it’s still better than the One 5G Ace’s.

Software and features

Motorola has offered near-stock software on its phones for years now and the Motorola One 5G Ace is no exception to that rule. The software is stripped-back easy to navigate and well-designed.

Motorola’s My UX offers a range of extra features and gestures too all of which can be enabled or disabled at will and all of which can help make using the device more natural. Things like pressing three fingers down to take a screenshot twisting your wrist to jump to the camera and more are all useful.

There are also mobile gaming settings that can be tweaked. My favorite thing about all these features is that they’re all contained in the Moto app not spread out through Android as other manufacturers tend to do. That means that if you don’t want to use or see them you can hide the Moto app and essentially use the phone as a stock Android device.

Motorola’s software update commitment is incredibly weak.

Well almost a stock Android device. While other stock Android phones like the Pixel series get quick updates for at least a few years the same cannot be said for the Motorola One 5G Ace. It ships with the already-dated Android 10 (Android 11 has been out for months now) and while Motorola has said that it will bring Android 11 to the Ace it hasn’t said exactly when. And that’ll likely be it for the phone. Motorola has promised “at least one” operating system update but I wouldn’t count on more than one — its track record is poor in this department. Thankfully you’ll get security updates for two years.

It’s really disappointing to see old software paired with a lack of updates. It’s more acceptable on a $150 Moto G Play but at $400 it’s tough to deal with and we really hope that Motorola steps up its game in the near future.

Price and availability

As mentioned the Motorola One 5G Ace comes in at $400 and it’s available now from Amazon. In the U.S. it comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

Our take

The Motorola One 5G Ace is a solid phone. It performs well has a nice display and a great battery life. But in 2021 sub-$500 phones still need to go that extra mile — and this one just doesn’t. The Pixel 4a‘s advantages are years of software updates and a flagship-quality camera. The iPhone SE gets flagship-level performance and even longer updates. The Motorola One 5G Ace on the other hand is “good” at pretty much everything but “great” at almost nothing — expect battery.

Of course we haven’t really mentioned the “5G” aspect of this phone but there’s not much to talk about there. I would caution against buying this phone for its 5G support — get the Pixel 4a instead deal with the lack of 5G and by the time you’re ready for your next phone getting something that’s 5G-capable will be more important. Alternatively get the Pixel 4a 5G — which offers an even better camera and improved performance for $60 more.

Is there a better alternative?

Yes. If $400 is a hard limit for your budget you can save $50 and get the excellent Google Pixel 4a. If you can stretch just a little bit and care about 5G and prefer a large display then go for the Google Pixel 4a 5G instead.

How long will it last?

The Motorola One 5G Ace has a plastic back so it should survive most drops — but it doesn’t have water resistance so you’ll want to keep away from anything wet. Given the lack of software updates past Android 11 you may find it dated in terms of features within a few years — but that hardly prevents it from actually working.

GTA Online's in-game microtransactions once again break the bank cementing GTA V as one of the best-earning games of all time.

GTA Online's new Cayo Perico heist helped GTA V make more money in December than any other period in the game's 7-year history. The news is from analyst firm SuperData who says December 2020 delivered record digital revenues for GTA Online that were higher than any other month since the mode's release.

The release of the Cayo Perico Heist for Grand Theft Auto V resulted in the game's highest monthly digital earnings ever. The update for the multiplayer Grand Theft Auto Online mode marked the first time the seven-year-old game received a new open-world area for players to explore. Player numbers also grew 46% from November levels but did not exceed totals achieved earlier in 2020.

GTA V is still an earnings monster that routinely rakes in hundreds of millions in revenues every year--sometimes over $1 billion--and has sold over 135 million copies across two console generations. GTA Online managed to make $1 billion in four years' time and pulled in over $500 million in 2019 alone.

We won't know how much GTA Online actually made in December until Take-Two announces its Q3'21 results on February 8 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2dyYW5kLXRoZWZ0LWF1dG8tb25saW5lLWNheW8tcGVyaWNvLWhlaXN0LXJlc3VsdHMtaGlnaGVzdC1tb250aGx5LWRpZ2l0YWwtZWFybmluZ3MteWV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grand Theft Auto Online Cayo Perico Heist Results in Highest Monthly Digital Earnings Yet,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2dyYW5kLXRoZWZ0LWF1dG8tb25saW5lLWNheW8tcGVyaWNvLWhlaXN0LXJlc3VsdHMtaGlnaGVzdC1tb250aGx5LWRpZ2l0YWwtZWFybmluZ3MteWV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2dhbWVyc29ubGluZS5jb20vZ2FtZXMvZXNwb3J0cy1ib3hpbmctY2x1Yi1zaG93cy1vZmYtZGVlcC1jaGFyYWN0ZXItY3JlYXRvci1tb2RlL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2dhbWVyc29ubGluZS5jb20vZ2FtZXMvZXNwb3J0cy1ib3hpbmctY2x1Yi1zaG93cy1vZmYtZGVlcC1jaGFyYWN0ZXItY3JlYXRvci1tb2RlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,eSports Boxing Club Shows Off Deep Character Creator Mode,"This week the folks at Steel City Interactive dropped a preview of the character creator for their upcoming boxing simulation game eSports Boxing Club. This is a game that’s been on our radar for the past few months. Steel City Interactive is trying to deliver on a big promise: a modern boxing game with an A+ experience. Each bit of info they release makes that promise look more achievable. Today’s developer video is no different.

Creative Director of eSports Boxing Club Ash Habib leads us through a deep dive on the current build of ESBC‘s character creator. Initially the character creator was not going to be part of ESBC‘s Early Access release on Steam. However the community has been pushing for it so they’ve added it to the pipeline. It’s worth pointing out at the start that the character creator being shown off is only Version 0.8. Habib clarifies immediately this is still a work in progress and that some elements still need work.

eSports Boxing Club Character Creator – The Basics

Page One of the character creator is pretty much what you’d expect. Your character’s name age height and weight are at the forefront as with most games with a character creator. The first page also has you choose your stance (as of v0.8 orthodox or southpaw) your hometown and your walk-in music. Your age in ESBC is gonna be important since it affects your retirement age (no one gets to box forever). In the video the created character does not actually scale with height and weight. Habib identifies this as something they’re still working on. The final game will have a collection of licensed music for fighters to walk in to.

Skin Tones and Sliders

Something Habib focuses on is skin tone. Depending on what skin color you choose the texture of your fighter’s skin changes as well. This means that lighter and darker skinned fighters will look more realistic and not just changes on an RGB scale. This is a great addition and an excellent detail to highlight in the video.

As Habib flips through the rest of the options we are treated to a number of juicy sliders. There are a lot of potential shapes and sizes possible already. Hopefully this will make the option to randomize your fighter a very fun experience as well. The creator will have a number of officially licensed options for boxing gloves boots and trunks as well as original designs exclusive to ESBC. Once your fighter is finished you’ll be able to upload them. Then others can download your fighter and vice versa.

eSports Boxing Club was originally scheduled to release on Early Access last December. However due to several factors the Early Access launch is delayed until a later date. After its initial release on PC eSports Boxing Club will eventually be available on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with a next-gen release on the Xbox Series X|S and the PlayStation 5 planned after.

We especially love the footage of electric cars towing camping trips and most of all seeing gorgeous parts of the U.S. (or the world) that we've never seen before.

We've shared a few videos with you from YouTube channel The Electric Roadtrip. Not to be confused with All Electric Family (they own and tow with a Tesla Model X) The Electric Roadtrip has a Model Y and a camper that they tow as they travel around the United States.

This family has taken the combination on several long road trips. Clearly they love the traveling the sights the family time etc. They are also happy overall with the Model Y's range charging space and towing. However they're willing to admit that things aren't always perfect.

Katie the mom of the family and the focal point in most of the videos has sort of a love/hate relationship with these Tesla Model Y road trips. However it's only really due to the sometimes lengthy Supercharging stops. At times it's nice to stop for a while take a load off have a meal and take in the beautiful sights. However chilling in a concrete jungle in some store parking lot for an hour or more at times can take a toll after several 1000+ mile journeys.

Nonetheless The Electric Roadtrip continues its fascinating excursions and shares them with the world. If all you get out of the videos is some range charging and EV road trip advice along with a better concept of the future of electric vehicles then they've succeeded in their efforts. However we give them huge Kudos for sharing the incredible experience and most of all the breathtaking scenery.

One of the more popular Tesla rumors that has made its way through the community is the possibility of a refreshed design of the Model S and Model X. The two cars have had very minor cosmetic adjustments since their introduction in 2012 and 2015. While they contribute to Tesla’s quarterly sales and delivery figures they are in essence sentimental vehicles. At least that is what Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a 2019 Tesla Earnings call. “To be totally frank we’re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else. They’re really of minor importance to the future” Musk said.

Which begs the question: Why is Tesla planning a refresh of the two vehicles now a year and a half after Musk called the S and X “sentimental” cars that had relatively minor importance to the future. While the Tesla community has certainly convinced itself that a newly designed Model S and Model X are on the way there is the possibility that it isn’t even going to happen.

It all started when Tesla shut down Model S and Model X production lines in late 2020. The catalyst to all the rumors was that the company was upgrading production lines to handle the redesigned vehicles and Tesla could agree upon the right modifications to make for the new models. It all makes sense of why many people jumped to “They’re refreshing the cars” right away. After all the Model 3 just had an update of its own and it was mostly cosmetic.

This is a preview from our weekly newsletter. Each week I go ‘Beyond the News’ and handcraft a special edition that includes my thoughts on the biggest stories why it matters and how it could impact the future.

However the S and X have been around for so many years with the only huge change being the nosecone modification. There have been many software updates and performance upgrades but those apply to every Tesla vehicle for the most part with very few exceptions included.

The Model S and Model X production lines being shut down led to me getting nosy and calling my local showroom. I decided to give them a call because they’re always willing to talk about Tesla and they’re so knowledgeable that it is nice to have a reasonable conversation with someone who knows what is going on within the community. According to who I spoke to they received emails stating that the lines were being shut down for efficiency reasons. There was no hint toward a redesign of the Model S and Model X. Of course Tesla isn’t going to tell the showroom associates and sales advisors this. It’s obviously going to stay among the company’s executives.

But if we dig into the efficiency of the Model S and Model X lines at Fremont it makes a lot of sense. The Model S and Model X only accounted for 18920 of the over 180000 vehicles that Tesla delivered in Q4 2020. The car was only delivered 57039 times for the full year while Tesla delivered just shy of half a million cars in total.

Does it make sense to have two production lines dedicated to cars making up only around 12-13% of the total output at Fremont? Could these lines be consolidated into one with the other line being converted to a 3/Y line? This would alleviate some of the supply constraints that Tesla has with Model 3 and Model Y production. It could enable faster deliveries as demand climbs and it could enable Tesla to be more efficient in its production of the S and X moving forward.

Musk has been a huge proponent of increasing manufacturing and production efficiency. It makes a lot of sense to me that Tesla would consider shutting down S/X lines to upgrade one line to a 3/Y line; the demand for S/X just isn’t great enough to dedicate two lines to the operation. 3/Y production is much more important.

This is all speculation and while I do think that Tesla will upgrade and update the S and X in some ways I don’t see how they can make major changes especially since the company has already announced and shown the Model S Plaid which is set to begin deliveries later this year. If Tesla were to refresh the S there would be a major cause for concern for those who already ordered the Plaid S because it would likely mean a new vehicle would be on its way that would look entirely different than the current Plaid Model S.

It just seems like IF Tesla is going to refresh the S they will widen the body style as the Plaid Model S has influenced. It will likely not have the rear diffuser or the spoiler. It may just be a wider body style.

Of course Tesla will also likely implement the 4680 battery cells in the cars which would revamp the battery pack with more life power and longevity. That is if Tesla has the supply for it because the company is still very early on in its battery manufacturing efforts at Kato Road. It is not unlikely that the S and X could be the first cars to use Tesla’s structural battery pack to increase safety and rigidity. Once again these are all speculation and only thoughts that make sense.

Of course there is always the possibility that Tesla could be attempting to rebirth the S/X with a complete revamp of its design and infrastructure. It could lead to a less expensive cost. Tesla having 4 vehicles that are mass-market instead of 2 could bring Tesla closer to price parity increasing the growth of the EV sector. How they will do this it likely depends on the batteries which make up so much of the vehicle’s cost. However the cars will likely need some kind of cosmetic update as well to appeal to customers moving forward. The 3 and Y seem to be more widely accepted not only because of price but because of look.

Tesla WARP Drive

While most automakers use commonly known enterprise software from third parties like SAP Tesla instead decided to build its own from scratch.

Tesla’s longtime chief information officer Jay Vijayan who quietly left in January 2016 is credited for leading the development of the system which Tesla calls “Warp.”

Vijayan discussed what pushed them to develop their “Warp” system in-house during an interview with CIO Insight in 2014:

Elon’s vision is to build a vertically integrated organization where information flow happens seamlessly across departments and where we have a closed feedback loop to our customers. By doing this we can provide the best possible product service and overall experience to our customers in the fastest way possible while also operating efficiently as a business to bring this vision to life we had to have simple and central business operations software that could connect all departments and enable information flow seamlessly across departments. Again we couldn’t find one software program in the market that satisfied this need.

Elon Musk has since pushed his companies to develop even more new enterprise engineering systems to be used across his multiple companies.

For example we previously reported on Tesla and SpaceX sharing some custom software platform developed for materials research.

WARP englobes a lot of important backend software that automates many processes for Tesla from purchasing to manufacturing to inventory.

Someone is trying to steal Tesla’s software

In a new case filed with the court of the Northern District of California Tesla claims that a recently hired software engineer Alex Khatilov has stolen its WARP Drive software.

Tesla writes in the lawsuit:

“Tesla hired Defendant as a software automation engineer on December 28 2020. Within three days he began stealing thousands of highly confidential software files from Tesla’s secure internal network transferring them to his personal cloud storage account on Dropbox to which Tesla has no access or visibility. The files consist of “scripts” of proprietary software code that Tesla has spent years of engineering time to build. These scripts when executed automate a broad range of functions throughout Tesla’s business. Only a select few Tesla employees even have access to these files; and as a member of that group Defendant took advantage of that access to downloaded files unrelated to his job.”

The automakers appears to have strong evidence that Khatilov innapropriately downloaded the scripts.

Tesla’s infosec team gained access to the engineer’s Dropbox account where they found the files that have no business being there:

“Tesla’s information security personnel detected Defendant’s unauthorized download on January 6 2021 and confronted Defendant that day and interviewed him. During this interview he repeatedly claimed that he had only transferred a couple personal administrative documents. After being prompted he gave Tesla investigators access to view his Dropbox account where they discovered Defendant’s claims were outright lies: the Tesla investigators found thousands and thousands of Tesla’s confidential computer scripts in his Dropbox. Defendant then claimed he somehow “forgot” about the thousands of other files he stole (almost certainly another lie). Even worse it became apparent that Defendant had brazenly attempted to destroy the evidence by hurriedly deleting the Dropbox client and other files during the beginning of the interview when investigators were attempting to remotely access his computer.”

Tesla employs a team of Quality Assurance Engineers who help identify business tasks to be automated based on input from Tesla’s business leaders. The engineers write computer scripts in Python (a computer programming language) to automate those tasks and test the automated processes to ensure they function properly. These scripts are unique to Tesla and run on WARP Drive the backend software for much of Tesla’s business. Developing this complex system is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla has spent roughly 200 man-years of work to develop the Quality Assurance scripts – the cumulative hours spent by the Quality Assurance Engineering team over the past twelve years. The engineers’ work is also guided by the business leaders in Tesla who identify what tasks need to be automated – another large and valuable investment of its time.

Tesla is looking for damages to be determined at trial and an injunction to block the defendant from sharing any information with other parties.

Here’s the full complaint filed with the court:

[scribd id=491839395 key=key-7nk3zyS7i1KTlwJFsXQo mode=scroll]

It’s not the first time that Tesla is turning to the court from protecting its trade secrets from former employees who allegedly stole important information.

Tesla sued employees that they claim stole the Autopilot source code and then went to Xpeng a Chinese EV automaker.

The automaker also sued Zoox and it is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with Rivian over similar claims of IP theft."
TXN,Texas Instruments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L2JldHRlci1idXktbnhwLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3JzLXZzLXRleGFzLWluc3RydW1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: NXP Semiconductors vs. Texas Instruments,"These two technologists have a lot to gain from an auto industry rebound and electrification of vehicles.

Coming out of a dreadful year for vehicle sales (research points to a global double-digit percentage plunge for vehicles sold in 2020) the new year could mark a return to year-over-year growth for the auto industry. Plus ""connected car"" tech is in higher demand than ever before and electronic components -- now comprising some 40% of a car's cost -- are only expected to continue rising.

For auto suppliers like NXP Semiconductors (NXPI -0.38%) and Texas Instruments (TXN 1.27%) this potential dual tailwind would be great news. I think both are a solid bet on the auto industry long-term but one looks like the better buy right now.

NXP: Making personal transportation a connectivity hub

NXP is a specialist in connectivity semiconductors for a number of industries including for 5G mobile networks but the auto industry is by far its largest end market. Even in a bad year for its manufacturing partners revenue derived from automotive was well over 40% of NXP's total revenue.

Because of the decline in auto sales in the last year NXP's revenue was down 7% year over year through the first nine months of 2020. However top-line results are rallying quickly as economic activity gets back to normal and auto manufacturers are implementing more of NXP's tech -- everything from advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) for increased safety and vehicle autonomy to electric vehicle powertrain management to infotainment and mobile connectivity. And as sales recover free cash flow (basic profitability measured as revenue minus cash operating expenses and capital expenditures) is on its way to recovering too.

Coming out of a global economic crisis this chipmaker is in decent shape. Cash and equivalents totaled $3.57 billion and total debt $9.36 billion at the end of September 2020. Subsequent to its last quarterly update NXP redeemed some of this debt for $1.83 billion using cash on balance. As it continues to recover with the global economy NXP is set to become a leaner cash-generating machine paired with gradual growth potential from its portfolio of connectivity chips.

This could also be a solid income stock in the making. While a dividend currently yielding 0.9% a year isn't much to write home about now NXP just started doling out this payment in 2019. And the payout used up less than a third of free cash flow generated through the first nine months of 2020. There's thus plenty of room for NXP to grow its shareholder return over time. Trading for just under 29 times trailing 12-month free cash flow as of this writing this is a solid bet on a global auto industry rebound and vehicle technology and connectivity growth paired with a small side of dividend income.

Texas Instruments: The old stalwart in reliable income growth

While NXP is an emerging income stock Texas Instruments is an old reliable in this department. The company currently pays a 2.3% dividend yield and has raised the payout every year since 2004. With the dividend together with the company's share repurchase program TI has the goal of returning all of its free cash flow generated to its shareholders.

And like NXP it hasn't been an easy year for TI. It also had to deal with the slump in the auto industry and will benefit from a recovering global consumer rebound in the years ahead. Nevertheless even a bad year of financial performance for TI would be a banner one for many other firms. Revenue and free cash flow were down 6% and 15% respectively through the first nine months of 2020 compared with 2019 but free cash flow profit margin remained at an enviable 34%. This performance prompted a 13% dividend payout hike last autumn as TI's end markets make a comeback.

TI will also benefit long-term from new vehicle technology and electronics components comprising a greater share of production costs. It continuously invests in research and development of new chip designs -- similar to NXP with ADAS and powertrain components along with other semiconductors for the communications and consumer electronics industries. It also has a best-in-class manufacturing operation that has a long track record of getting more efficient over time. Free cash flow averaged an 11% per year increase from 2004 through 2019.

At the end of September 2020 TI had $5.52 billion in cash and short-term investments and only $6.80 billion in debt. As of this writing shares can be bought for 31 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. For a proven leader in chipmaking and shareholder return it's not a terribly unreasonable premium.

Which is the better buy?

Texas Instruments' stock currently trades for a premium to NXP Semiconductors' but the higher price tag is worth it in my book. TI has a proven track record of profitable growth. And while NXP gets my nod as a solid bet on a recovering auto industry and global consumer in general TI will also get a similar bump in the years ahead as the effects of the pandemic wear off.

Because fighting the Cold War involved focused dedication secrets and emerging technology much history is unknown to the general public.

They often are not aware enough of the tech history of the Cold War to even wonder about it. Yet the technology of our world today was profoundly shaped by this war. And perhaps there are even a few lessons to be learned. That is old Cold War solutions and how they might apply to today’s problems.

Here is an example of something that many already know and more should: We owe our speed in getting personal computers to Cold War nuclear tipped rockets.

It was just an engineer’s dream for years. What if we could actually fit a digital computer into an aircraft or a missile?

In the 1950s computers filled rooms and engineers struggled with reliability and performance. In the 1960s performance improved but computers were still room-sized. It would take the revolution in mass-produced integrated circuits to change this. And this happened because of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. You see something was happening to push our 1960s engineers to dream up the modern micro-computer.

Analog computers were an option of course. And analog computers are not an ancient technology — unless I am ancient. When I studied control theory at the U.S. Air Force Academy from 1972 to 1976 we were using analog computers. There were still plenty in service and most control systems were still “designed in the s-plane” and realized with discrete circuits. (Remember that phrase you’ll see it later.) This is as opposed to today’s digital control systems using embedded computers.

I had my “spirule” and I learned the root-locus method for designing stable control systems. See the image at the top of the story.

Of course we also had digital computers at the Academy.



Well one digital computer. My programming classes and astronautical engineering classes used the Burroughs 6700. I spent many nights in the computer room programming it with a language much like FORTRAN … called ALGOL … using card decks. Above is an example card from a computer card deck. Look at the top left to see the line of code: “Z(I) = Y + W(I)”. Many lines make a computer program. And thus a deck of cards.

In the 1970s the dream was realized in mass-produced hardware and there were digital computers appearing on-board aircraft and missiles. The mass production started with the Minuteman II ICBM and its D37C computer. It was roughly the shape of a loaf of bread was about a half cubic foot in volume and weighed in at about 26 pounds. This was “micro” in the 1970s. It had a capacity of around 7000 11 or 24-bit words.



Why was the D-37C the first mass produced small computer? There’s a book here on my bookshelf to answer that question. If the history of placing computers in missiles and aircraft interests you you can still get an old copy on Amazon for around $40. See the picture abovefor details. Turning to page 93…

“… a change in requirements … made demands … that discrete circuits could not meet … a change in the U.S. strategic policy from massive retaliation to a flexible response. This meant a need to retarget and thus reprogram the missile up to the instant before launch.”

Each Minuteman II guidance system needed a couple thousand Texas Instruments integrated circuits and the initial production run included hundreds of missiles. Thus ICBMs gave us the first mass-produced computer. This drove TI production costs down and set the stage for the ubiquitous home computer industry.

My first assignment out of the Academy in 1976 was as a pilot. This was also the point in time that Zilog introduced the Z80 chip to the world. In that assignment fellow pilot Capt. Steve Brown and I helped introduce Strategic Air Command to small computers for the cockpit. See my July 1982 Combat Crew article “We Have the Technology” at https://archive.org/details/combatcrewstrate3271offu/page/16/mode/2up.



In 1982 I was posted to Los Angeles Air Force Station and the Air Force’s Space Division and was responsible for the flight software used on the IUS. The IUS was a kind of short Minuteman missile (both are Boeing products) that could fit in the back of the space shuttle and loft spy satellites to high orbits. During both those periods I was an avid home computer hobbyist. For instance I was programing my TRS80 computer (1977 to 1981) in Z80 assembly and machine language.

Well you had to program in machine language since the original TRS-80 only had 4KB of memory. I clearly recall the day I upgraded to 16KB. I really felt like I was somebody that day. But it didn’t afford me much more elbow room. Especially since the storage unit was a handheld tape recorder. Interestingly the tape recorder needed to be a cheap one with few filters since the digital data was recorded in the bandwidth of the noise.

The D37C on the other hand kept its data on a rotating disk. However the read and write heads were “nailed down” so the programmer had to know when the data was near the read or the write head. Programming occurred using “word times.”

Assembly language was a convenience a step up from machine language which programs the Z80 chip directly in its own internal code. But the TRS80 was so small I needed to resort to machine language to get certain efficiencies. This hobby got me “speaking chip” more fluently. I got comfortable with using storage registers that is where to put data and where to put instructions as an example. How to do binary math using “twos complement.”

Using the Z80 instruction set I could load data and computer programs into the TRS-80 memory. The registers and wiring on the chip helped that process.

It wasn’t a big stretch. My degree at the Academy was in Astronautical Engineering. But to compute those orbits and their perturbations we needed to be in the computer room most of the time. In fact the department was “The Department of Astronautics and Computer Science.” I took a lot of extra classes from the computer science professors since I was interested in that area. Before I got my appointment to the Air Force Academy I was signed up for CalPoly San Luis Obispo in a brand-new field called “Computer Science.” At CalPoly it was in their math department. OK. Maybe I am ancient.

When I left active duty Air Force and started work at TRW in 1985 I was told to “become an expert” in the Minuteman II D37C. And so I gathered up all the technical manuals I could and started studying.



On one end it had 33 cards mostly filled with NAND gates as shown above I learned that we practically owned Texas Instrument’s chip production line back in the 1960s as these were being built. On the other end was a spinning disk with fixed read and write heads. As mentioned before the software had to operate in “word times” to ensure read and write operations occurred when the heads were lined up with the data.

My “aha!” moment was when I realized that all those machine language instructions the Z80 instruction set I had learned for the tiny Z80 chip had their equivalents in those dozens and dozens of NAND gates spread across the bulk of the 33 modules. For instance Boeing’s book “D37C Logical Description” provides hundreds of pages of the NAND gate connectivity needed to do for instance twos complement math. And don’t get me started on their wiring diagrams!! I’ll ensure a damper on any raucous party.

I learned that chips that didn’t go into Minuteman II made their way into the Apollo Moon Shot. So ICBM engineers would often refer to “Apollo-era electronics” when discussing our Minuteman electronics even when discussing the more modern Minuteman III.

The Minuteman III ICBM sported the new and improved D37D computer which was an upgrade of the D37C but essentially the same. Minuteman II was retired in the 1990s; the last silo was imploded in 1997. All of the guidance electronic gear in the Minuteman III including the D37D computers were modernized (i.e. replaced) in 1999. A design challenge was to ensure the new computer could be just as “hard” to nuclear bomb radiation as the older version.

Now you know a tiny bit more of Cold War history and the rise of the personal/office/home computer.

Staley Road facility gets OK for tax incentive package

By Michael J. Billoni

An approval by the Erie County Industrial Development Agency’s (ECIDA) Board of Directors on Wednesday for a tax incentive package presented by Grand Island’s Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. should result in the life sciences company proceeding with plans to add an $85 million 69000-square-foot expansion to its research development and manufacturing facility at 3175 Staley Road. Thermo Fisher Scientific plays a key role in manufacturing products for pharmaceutical companies globally to use for COVID-19 vaccines.

In its application to the ECIDA Thermo Fisher Scientific is seeking exemptions from sales and real property taxes for the two-story expansion to the northeast corner of its existing 300000-square-foot building. The additional space will be used for the manufacture of Animal Origin Free (AOF) liquid media products that will allow it to “meet customer demand” including the manufacturing by pharmaceutical companies of the vaccines for COVID-19 AIDs cancer and other diseases. The company pledges to create 60 jobs through this expansion.

This will mark the second straight month ECIDA’s 19 board members will consider a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. proposal. Last month it approved tax breaks totaling $2.8 million for a Thermo Fisher expansion of 50000 square feet to its West R&D Center on Staley Road with a price tag of $90.2 million and the promise of 60 additional jobs. That project is underway and is slated to be completed by December 2022. These projects will bring the company’s workforce to over 1000 with 286 administrative positions located in the former Canon Design headquarters at 1870 Whitehaven Road that it moved into in 2019. The impressive building which faces the I-190 has a “Help Wanted” sign posted on its glass front.

The company’s explanation of why the ECIDA’s financial assistance is necessary said it will allow them to “serve our existing customers’ increasing demand for its products as well as compete in the expanding life sciences industry” to gain additional customers. It also stated the opportunity exists to build this expansion at its Miami or Greenville South Carolina facilities “where government agencies have provided assistance for similar projects.”

If it is unable to obtain financial assistance from the ECIDA the company stated in its application: “If the project moves out of Grand Island the county will lose the opportunity for job creation and its economic impacts.”

Local Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. officials including its legal counsel from Hodgson Russ LLP have not responded to numerous requests for comment from The Island Dispatch.

Charlotte A. McCormick corporate communications/public relations for Thermal Fisher Scientific Inc. said they would speak after Wednesday’s vote of which 10 positive votes are needed to pass. Speaking from its corporate headquarters in Waltham Massachusetts McCormick told The Island Dispatch on Wednesday: “We have significant involvement not just at the Grand Island site but globally in terms of cell cultured media and other products we are supplying to pharmaceutical companies to help them make their vaccines. We are involved in the production of products used in over 300 vaccines therapies and medications.”

She also provided a statement from Marc N. Casper chairman president and CEO of the publicly traded company with more than 75000 employees globally and annual revenues exceeding $25 billion: “We are quite proud in what we are able to accomplish in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus. This was something Thermo Fisher Scientific was built for and ready for and when it occurred we responded. Our employees globally are proud to be a part of this and having a role in mitigating this pandemic.”

According to its website Thermo Fisher is at the heart of the global response to COVID-19 and is working with government agencies and researchers to ensure priority access to instruments consumables safety supplies and other products to address the outbreak–particularly in analysis of the virus diagnosis and personal protection. Well before the pandemic Thermo Fisher committed more than $800 million of investments to transform its drug substance drug product and clinical supply capabilities that deliver on the increasing need for scalability flexibility and expertise. These global investments have enabled its clients to respond rapidly in the battle against COVID-19.

The Grand Island Town Board approved Thermo Fisher’s site plan for expansion of this project at its Sept. 21 2020 meeting and a height variance was approved by the Planning Board at its Dec. 21 meeting. “This project is good to go” said Town Engineer Robert H. Westfall P.E.

The ECIDA held a virtual public hearing about this application on Jan. 19. After a Thermal Fisher representative briefly outlined the project it was open to public comment of which there was none.

This project will have 54000 square feet dedicated to manufacturing and 14600 square feet for office and warehouse space. Of the $85 million $34.2 million will be used to build the two-story structure $36 million in equipment and $14.8 million in soft costs such as engineering architecture fees legal costs etc. The expansion is expected to begin this summer with a completion date of spring 2023.

Prior to 1962 when Grand Island Biological Co. (GIBCO) began the Staley Road site was a horse farm. In 2014 Thermo Fisher then known as Life Technologies purchased GIBCO.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzIyMTUwMTYxMjEwMDAzMTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Optimization of environmental DNA extraction and amplification methods for metabarcoding of deep-sea fish,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016121000315 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzIyMTUwMTYxMjEwMDAzMTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Farmer unions claimed that by Saturday evening as many as 50000 tractors had passed through Bathinda-Dabwali Khanauri-Jind Sardulgarh-Fatehabad Moonak-Fatehabad Shambhu-Ambala and Lalru-Guhla Cheeka borders between Punjab and Haryana. They added that more tractors will cross on Sunday.

Farmers said that they were prepared to face water cannons teargas shells and had even stocked ready-to-eat items in case of disruption of langar supply.

“We were determined to take out tractor parade with or without permission but it is good that finally police authorities have allowed it officially. Otherwise our people are prepared for every eventuality. We have told farmers to keep salt in small packets with them and lick it if they feel that their BP is going down amid heavy rush. We have told them that in case tear gas shells they should moisten the muslin cloth with them and rub it on their face and eyes. We are soldiers of the guru. We are ready for any eventuality” said Jagseer Singh Kothaguru a BKU (Ugrahan) leader.

He added “Assi faujian di tarah tayari kar ke jaa rahe haan (We are going to be prepared like soldiers).”

Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan general secretary of BKU (Ugrahan) said “We have told them to take ready-to-eat items along in case they get stuck in a rush or something happens and they are not even able to cook and langar availability is also not there”.

Balwant Singh Ghudani a farmer from Ghudani village of Ludhiana said “We are taking pinnis panjiri meethi and namkeen rotis methi di rotis pickle apart from biscuits rusk. Now that cops have granted permission we are sure to do this rally come what may. The number of tractors which have gone to Delhi it seems that our parade will not end even in four days.”

Tractors of 32 farmer unions of Punjab BKU (Ugrahan) and Kisan Mazdoor Sangrash Committee have left for Delhi.

On Friday Kulwant Singh Sandhu General Secretary of Jamhoori Kisan Sabha Punjab had said”I appeal to all the youngsters of Punjab to start moving from their villages make sufficient arrangements for their stay at the morcha. Jabar da muqabla sabar naal dena hai. (We have to give answer of atrocities with our patience). It will be our show of strength. Not even a single tractor should remain in Punjab.”

More tractors will be moving on January 24 as well there will be no tractor parade in any of the Punjab villages on January 26.

Women too are part of these convoys but only a few will be driving the tractors and the rest will be sitting in trolleys.

“It will be a mix of only tractors tractor-trolleys cars buses in this Kisan Republic day parade but majority of them will be tractors only” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala general secretary of BKU Dakaunda and also working committee member of All India Kisan Sangrash Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).

Tableaus of farmer with a plough bulls have been made by BKU (Ugrahan) committee with a message on implementation of Swaminathan report. Many other tableaus will be part of this parade.

“I am sure Delhi people and even the whole world will watch our parade it is for our rights. Teeno kanoon chaknachoor iss se kam kuchh nahi manzoor” said Rajinder Singh Deepsinghwala General Secretary of Kirti Kisan Union.",,,

Wearing a face mask will soon be federally mandated for interstate travelers in the United States according to an executive order signed by President Joe Biden on Thursday.

The travel order applies to airports and planes trains ferries intercity buses and public transportation.

The order is a directive to several agencies to take action to require masks be worn in compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

At this point it is unclear exactly how the requirement will be carried out. The Transportation Department referred questions about how the order will be implemented to the White House.

Welcomed news for flight attendants union

The move to mandate masks was immediately celebrated by a flight attendants union.

“What a difference leadership makes! We welcome President Biden’s nationwide approach to crushing the virus and lifting us out of this pandemic” said Sara Nelson Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International President in a statement.

Nelson said the mandate would provide “much needed back up” for flight attendants and other aviation workers on the “front lines.”

While major US airlines instituted their own mask requirements in spring 2020 in the absence of a federal rule enforcing mask policies has largely fallen on flight attendants some of whom have reported aggressive confrontations with passengers refusing to wear masks.

Airlines say they have made good on their pledges to bar passengers who do not comply from future flights. Industry group Airlines for America (A4A) says its members have banned thousands of passengers.

Delta Air Lines recently said it has restricted 880 passengers because of mask noncompliance.

FAA takes stricter approach

Earlier this month the Federal Aviation Administration announced a stricter approach to dealing with unruly passengers.

Passengers who assault threaten intimidate or interfere with airline crew members can face fines of as much as $35000 and even imprisonment according to the FAA.

In December the FAA proposed fines of $15000 and $7500 for two passengers “for allegedly interfering with and assaulting flight attendants who instructed them to wear face coverings.”

The flight attendants union AFA first called for a mask mandate on planes in April 2020 in a letter to then Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.

The Trump administration resisted calls from the industry and workers to develop a mask requirement. Chao said that she believed the issue could be better handled by companies and their employee unions.

“When the federal government gets involved we tend to be much more heavy handed we tend to be inflexible and once we put a rule in place it takes a long time to remove that rule if conditions change” she said last summer.

Airlines for America which represents major air carriers in the United States noted Thursday that US airlines have been enforcing face covering requirements since April 2020.

“U.S. airlines have been supportive of a federal mandate as an additional layer of support and welcome today’s Executive Order which will strengthen our flight crews’ ability to enforce face covering requirements for the duration of the pandemic said Nicholas E. Calio A4A’s president and CEO in a statement.

Beyond air travel the mandate will apply to trains and other means of interstate travel. Amtrak noted that it also has an existing requirement for customers and employees to wear face masks but welcomed the order.

“A federal directive that passengers are required to comply with would reinforce our current policy” Amtrak said in a statement.

In addition to the mask mandate Biden also ordered on Thursday that all travelers including US citizens will be required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test before entering the United States from abroad. The order underscores the CDC policy announced last week.

Biden also called for a requirement for travelers to comply with “CDC guidelines concerning international travel including recommended periods of self-quarantine or self-isolation after entry into the United States.”

Among those recommendations the CDC advises travelers to get tested and stay home for seven days after higher risk travel.

The executive order calls for a plan from various agencies for how quarantine and isolation rules could be implemented.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnduY3QuY29tL3RyYXZlbC90cmF2ZWxlcnMtYXQtcmR1LXNwZWFrLW91dC1hcy1mYWNlLW1hc2tzLW5vdy1yZXF1aXJlZC1hdC1haXJwb3J0cy1vbi1wbGFuZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travelers at RDU speak out as face masks now required at airports on planes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wnct.com/travel/travelers-at-rdu-speak-out-as-face-masks-now-required-at-airports-on-planes/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnduY3QuY29tL3RyYXZlbC90cmF2ZWxlcnMtYXQtcmR1LXNwZWFrLW91dC1hcy1mYWNlLW1hc2tzLW5vdy1yZXF1aXJlZC1hdC1haXJwb3J0cy1vbi1wbGFuZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYm9jYXJhdG9ub2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvZmVhdHVyZXMvb24tdGhlLXJvYWQtYWdhaW5fMS_SAUtodHRwczovL2JvY2FyYXRvbm9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9hcGkvYW1wL2N1bHR1cmUvZmVhdHVyZXMvb24tdGhlLXJvYWQtYWdhaW5fMS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On The Road Again,"This time last year road tripping across the country in a motorhome wasn’t the kind of vacation many families had in mind.

Summer adventures were already set for some including Dr. Joanna and Bryan Drowos of Boca Raton who couldn’t wait for their trip to Israel with their two children. Flights were booked and all other arrangements had been made.

But then the pandemic hit. Airplanes were grounded. Countries closed their borders. Cruise ships were docked. And families including the Drowos crew found themselves cooped up at home with quashed plans and eventually the yearning to get away. So they did what many others decided to do - they rented a recreational vehicle otherwise known as an RV and explored the good ole’ USA.

“Neither of us grew up camping. It was never on our radar” said Joanna a family medicine physician and associate dean for faculty affairs at FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine. “But it was a way where we could still do something nice for our family. For us there are all kinds of silver linings of the pandemic and this is one of them.”

When COVID-19 rocked the nation in March would-be travelers stayed home fearful of getting the virus and travel companies began to panic. Pandemic-related travel restrictions were enforced and people with booked vacations were flooding phone lines to cancel trips. RV rental companies such as Allstar Coaches in Fort Lauderdale were in limbo.

“It was dead for three months” said Rob Tischler president & CEO of Allstar Coaches a luxury Class A motorhome rental service with locations throughout the United States.

In May things began to look up for some places. State and national parks were allowed to reopen as long as they followed social distancing guidelines - and that was enough to trigger a surge in RV travel one that Tischler was relieved to welcome.

“It was like somebody hit a switch” he said. “Normally in the summer we average 50 calls a day. After May it was 500 a day. We were a bit overwhelmed.”

But in a good way.

While many businesses had to close their doors due to lack of customers RV rental bookings began to skyrocket.

Outdoorsy a global RV rental company experienced a whopping 90 percent cancellation rate the first few months of 2020 because of the pandemic. But even that didn’t keep them from having an amazing year. “Bookings surged in 2020 leading to the company’s best year on record with a more than 4500 percent increase in bookings throughout the course of the pandemic” said spokesperson April Cumming.

Nearly 90 percent of the customers were first-time RVers hoping for a vacation without hotel stays and restaurant meals.

Some of the calls into Tischler’s South Florida office were from customers whose parents were visiting Florida for the winter. Those snowbirds usually return to their northern homes in the spring and their families either didn’t want them to fly or flights couldn’t be booked. So for a fee Tischler provided drivers for his motorhomes so his older clients could relax.

Other clients were looking for an upscale apartment on wheels that they could take across the country.

‘No limit’ on options

Tischler’s fleet of motorhomes are all in the Class A category which means they provide many of the amenities of home and are great for long periods of travel. Many cater to families where bunk beds a bedroom a bathroom (sometimes two) and a washer and a dryer are at your disposal. Others cater to business clients with a more executive floor plan including desks and high-end furniture. Most of the RVs have tracking satellites and 24-hour phone access to technical support assistance.

“We’ve had clients who are billionaires who want to get in the coach with their family and just go and they don’t want any special services” Tischler said. “Others want an itinerary planned. We have requests for catering we can stock it up with everything they need. There’s really no limit.”

While there are plenty of options when it comes to renting an RV there are also plenty of choices when it comes to where to travel.

And one of the best ways to learn about amazing destinations is to ask experienced RV travelers such as the Drowos family.

Before 2020 this family may have scoffed at the suggestion of exploring the country in an RV. They liked the outdoors but they preferred to fly to destinations stay in hotels and enjoy the city life.

Fast forward to today and Joanna and Bryan can tell you just about anything you need to know when it comes to traveling in a motorhome with two children: theirs are 8 and 10 years old.

When they first decided to rent a motorhome they chose a 28-foot Class C RV. Bryan watched videos to learn how to drive and work the vehicle while Joanna planned the trip. Class C RVs have sleeping space above the cab and most also include a futon and a bed in the back. With the help of a Facebook group Joanna was not only able to create a detailed packing list she was also able to create the perfect itinerary.

The Drowos family spent three weeks last June on a road trip to Niagara Falls in upstate New York. They cooked most of their meals outside on their grill stopped at Walmart when they needed supplies and learned little tidbits about RV life for example that unbreakable dishes are a must and when you can’t get Wi-Fi access you can always get a signal from a hotel parking lot.

When they arrived at Niagara Falls it was bittersweet for Joanna because she grew up in Toronto and her family lives about an hour from the Canadian border. However she couldn’t visit them because the borders were closed due to the pandemic. So the family recorded and sent a video of themselves waving from the falls sending her Canadian family wishes of love.

“To be a couple hours away from my family and not to be able to cross was so weird” she said.

But that was one of the caveats of traveling during a pandemic. Other negatives included the temporary closing of some popular tourist spots the family avoiding dining in restaurants and having to wear masks outdoors.

But there were also some perks.

Because the number of people admitted to tourist spots that were open was significantly lower because of social-distancing guidelines the family was able to avoid crowds as they enjoyed sites like popular waterfalls.

“Most of the pictures when you look at them you think we’re the only people there” Joanna said.

From the Grand Canyon to the Florida Keys

The Drowos’ experience was such a memorable one that not long after they returned from their road trip they found themselves wanting to travel in an RV again. That prompted them to start shopping for a motorhome of their own and now they are the proud owners of a 40-foot Tiffin Allegro Class A RV complete with a laundry area and a fireplace.

Since their purchase they’ve traveled to Georgia and hiked in state parks. They’ve enjoyed the crystal blue water of the Florida Keys and spent weekends visiting the state’s west coast. But perhaps their most exciting trip was in October when they spent the month driving to the Grand Canyon.

Since both Joanna and her husband had the ability to work remotely and since their children were in virtual school it was the perfect situation. Joanna started researching again and found some magical campgrounds along the way their favorite being the Watchman Campground in Utah’s Zion National Park.

There are tons of things that Joanna and Bryan have learned about RV travel the past nine months but one thing that stands out is the kindness they’ve received from others. They’ve met families who live in their motorhome full-time retirees who spend half the year traveling the country and plenty of other experienced RVers most who are willing to help others.

“That’s very much the RV culture” Joanna said. “People are very thoughtful. They take care of each other.”

‘More travelers now than ever’

And that’s a good thing especially now that an influx of newbies are on the road all learning to navigate this travel lifestyle.

“We have more travelers now than ever” said Maddi Bourgerie a spokesperson for RVshare a nationwide RV rental marketplace. “People turn to RVs as a way to get out of the house but still social distance. Our demand has been so huge that we’ve been constrained on supply especially during the holiday weekends.”

Bourgerie predicts that RV travel will remain popular throughout 2021 because people like the Drowos family are showing others just how fun it can be.

Their adventures have influenced others to try camping in an RV as well and now Joanna watches her friends rent motorhomes all wanting to experience this different way of travel.

She recalls when she and her husband first began to talk about planning a road trip in an RV and it seemed liked a crazy idea at the time. But that one idea has made it possible for the Drowoses to make some amazing memories ones that they otherwise would never have had.

All thanks ironically to a global pandemic.

“I want our kids to look back on this time and remember how much fun we had” Joanna said. “I want them to remember ‘that was the year we camped.’”

BEIJING Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- China's railway operation mileage reached 146300 km by the end of last year with 37900 km of high-speed railways data from China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. showed.

The expanding high-speed rail network is offering unprecedented convenience and comfort to travelers and boosting local development as well.

Chinese companies have developed world-leading capabilities in building high-speed railways in extreme natural conditions. High-speed railway routes across China have been designed to suit its varying climate and geographical conditions.

The Harbin-Dalian high-speed railway travels through areas where the temperature drops to as low as 40 degree Celsius below zero in winter the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway passes through the savage Gobi Desert and the Hainan Island railway can withstand a battering from typhoons.

But for some travelers the most intriguing part on the railways is that they can go through some of China's best scenic tourist destinations. The train journeys provide not only beautiful sceneries at terminus cities but also charming views outside the trains' windows on the way.

Nacimiento-Fergusson Road California

Length

37 kilometres

Type

Fast flowing sweepers followed by first gear hairpins



California-based Sera Trimble is a professional driver working in film and TV. A demanding day job behind the wheel has done little to diminish her love of the open road however and at weekends she can frequently be found aboard her air-cooled 911 exploring the more remote corners of her adoptive state. A favourite getaway of Sera’s involves a group of like-minded classic car enthusiasts trunk loads of camping gear and Big Sur’s little-known Nacimiento-Fergusson Road.

“My first experience of this road was on a rally with about 18 other vintage 911 and 356 sports cars. The whole trip is about 1600 kilometres over one weekend. You leave on the Thursday or Friday and do about 450 to 650km a day depending. And we all camp out of our vintage Porsches.”

Sera Trimble inside her beloved G-Series 911

The Nacimiento-Fergusson Road starts inland in the beautiful wine country of Monterey County before climbing steeply over the Santa Lucia mountains towards the Pacific Ocean. At its highest point the road reaches 840 metres above sea-level as it winds through the Los Padres National Forest before plunging sharply to the coast and the Cabrillo Highway.

“You go through a whole bunch of different sections” Trimble says. “Over the course of the entire road the landscape changes completely three different times. The early part where it crossed the river near Mission Road is made up of these big billowing hills. It almost looks like you’re driving through fields of wheat and oak trees. It’s high speed and very beautiful.” Breaking you in gently this first section with its wide easy roads and open vistas is a complete contrast to what lies ahead. When the ascent begins so does the real challenge for both car and driver.

“You head steeply up into the mountain then and it gets tighter and tighter turning into a single lane road that just zigzags in first and second gear for almost all of the remaining route. It’s kind of gruelling and exhausting but it’s fun if you’re with a bunch of cars that are equal in terms of performance. Everyone’s going through the gears together and the exhaustion is collective! And the reward is the ocean at the end of it.”

The Nacimiento-Fergusson Road is not for the faint hearted with incredibly narrow sections carved between sheer rock faces and perilous drops into the wooded mountainside where an absence of guard rails acts as its own highly effective regulator of your speed. Although oncoming traffic is relatively scarce some caution must always be taken for the occasional heavy goods vehicle or camper van arriving unannounced around any of the dozens of blind bends that pepper its 37km route.

Trimble’s preferred drive for this and any road is her beloved G-Series 911 a semi-race prepared hot-rod she bought to use daily and uses hard. And she soon discovered that it was the perfect car for taking on the challenges of Nacimiento-Fergusson.

""I find the 911 one of the most impressive driving cars. I’ve never seen anything just chug along like a vintage Porsche does."" Sera Trimble

“I’ve done it in my 911 multiple years in a row now. I’ve never driven anything else at 4500rpm all day and not had a problem with it. For that reason alone I find it one of the most impressive driving cars. I’ve never seen anything just chug along like a vintage Porsche does. You can get in drive 1000km and it’s no big deal. When I got the 911 I wanted something that was imperfect enough that I wouldn’t be afraid to use it and enjoy it. It’s not some perfect butterfly that I’m ripping the wings off. Usability is key and I use it all the time.”

The Nacimiento-Fergusson road requires commitment caution and no small amount of forward planning. Make sure you have enough fuel to get back Trimble points out and despite the remoteness always be prepared for the possibility of meeting someone coming the other way. Oh and take a few friends along for the ride.

“There can be traffic because people will camp up there at the top of the mountain” she explains. “And there is the occasional truck but for the most part it’s pretty desolate which makes it so enjoyable. It’s one of my favourite experience roads but it’s really made that by the friends I’m with and the collection of cars we’re travelling in.”

For employees who suddenly faced indefinite telecommuting a short walk to the kitchen table replaced rivers of brake lights and speedometers stuck in the single digits. Those empty roads were one vivid reminder of the ways COVID-19 upended our lives. Of course in many others people with jobs they could do at home were lucky—thousands of essential workers like supermarket clerks Amazon delivery drivers nurses and doctors didn’t have that option and tens of thousands more in sectors like hospitality and entertainment have lost their jobs.

But as 2020 bitterly gave way to 2021 a question loomed for employers and office workers inured to endless rounds of Zoom calls: How long will all this last and what would come next?

The question has ramifications far beyond our commutes. Employers face questions with multimillion-dollar answers: How much office space do we build? How do we structure or restructure our workforce? Service-oriented businesses that depend on the daily flood of employees to uptown University City Ballantyne and other employment centers continue to live with potentially catastrophic drops in business—although as of this writing in early December only a few like La Belle Helene and Amelie’s uptown have closed permanently. A long-term mass shift to remote work could make Charlotte’s $12 billion transit and mobility plan a tougher sell.

For Charlotte—a city that’s grasped at “world-class” status for decades where boosters tout new skyscrapers and fete emissaries of prospective corporate relocators like royalty—the questions carry special significance. The city’s come a long way since The New York Times dubbed uptown a “somnolent streetscape of abandoned buildings and vacant lots” and “a Potemkin Village with a drawl” during the 1994 NCAA Men’s Basketball Championship. But last year brought back recollections of that embarrassing time with uptown empty of its 130000 daily workers and darkened office towers that loomed over vacant light rail trains. What’s the distinction between a world-class metropolis and a bedroom community if we all work from our spare bedrooms?

Clear answers don’t exist here or in any other American city and businesses will likely adopt a mix of telecommuting and in-office work that varies from company to company and industry to industry somewhere between the poles of “offices are extinct” and “back to business as usual.” Some employees love ditching their commutes and doing laundry between meetings. Others have to squeeze work projects and emails between caring for toddlers or all-day virtual school and supervision of children too young to type. Companies unaccustomed to employee autonomy wrestle with the need to supervise remote workforces. Can the boss trust that you’re not watching YouTube during the staff meeting behind the mask of your Zoom screen? Does in-person work and collaboration have distinct value and can remote work replicate or replace it?

To understand how large employers around Charlotte are thinking about those questions I interviewed executives at four companies in different industries. None envision a fully remote future—some like the Charlotte Hornets depend on packing arenas and others like Truist are building new offices and value in-person collaboration—but all expect lasting changes. Here’s what I learned.

TRUIST: Planting a flag uptown

When workers eventually return to their uptown offices they’ll see an unmistakable marker affixed to Charlotte’s newest bank on one of the city’s most striking buildings. In late November a helicopter flew the two-story-tall name and logo to the top of the Truist Center in the former Hearst Tower at 7th and Tryon streets which the company bought for $456 million. A product of the BB&T-SunTrust merger Truist employs 2000 in its new headquarters.

Before COVID individual teams might have had the flexibility to work off-site one day or so a week says Chief Human Resources Officer Kimberly Moore-Wright. But a “large percentage” of Truist employees worked in the office. The bank’s workforce except for a small contingent of employees who operate branches has worked remotely since March—a special challenge for a company in the midst of combining two competitors. “Just as we’re getting ready to go into the thick of that” Moore-Wright says “you overlay it with a pandemic no one could have expected.”

As the merged bank builds everything from business processes to physical offices Moore-Wright says executives don’t want to make dramatic changes like moving large numbers of employees to permanent telework based on conditions that may change soon.

“‘Normal’” Moore-Wright says “keeps changing as we get through this.” And Truist still needs to operate its branches physical locations with in-person customers who can’t do everything over Microsoft Teams or Slack.

But bank officials have found it easier to adopt new business practices—an unexpected benefit of throwing out the playbook. No one can protest “That’s the way we’ve always done it!” when everything has to be rewritten anyway. But as in many companies managers find workers increasingly fatigued by their homebound routines. “You’re in the guest bedroom. You may be working even longer just because you’re there at home” Moore-Wright says. “I think managers are becoming more attuned to that.”

Moore-Wright who speaks to me via video from her office is one of a small number of executives who work socially distant and with masks at headquarters. Heath Campbell president of the bank’s Metrolina region takes my call from a spare bedroom outfitted with a Truist banner that serves as a makeshift video background.

“Client-facing” bankers in his division have long had autonomy Campbell says. They might spend a day driving from Mooresville to SouthPark to Ballantyne to meet clients. Such meetings illustrate the double-edged sword remote work offers: Bankers can pack more meetings into a day without driving from one to the other. But do you really get the same connection with clients through a screen?

After the pandemic Campbell says Truist probably will allow some office workers more flexibility to work from home if their presence isn’t required. But the bank still will try to convince workers to choose the office. “If you’re going to explore more autonomy for our teammates to choose their work environment that means you’re giving them more decisions” he said. “What we’re trying to do is make sure with places like the Truist Center when it’s built out and designed … they’ll choose that place first.”

For now he misses the energy of in-person meetings sporting events restaurants and entertainment. “We’re not meant to be in isolation” Campbell says. “I’ve got a feeling once you’ve got the vaccine—I think we’ll get a resurgence.” Just how far off that resurgence is remains hard to predict. As of press time Truist had extended its telework policy from the end of January to at least March 1.

RED VENTURES: What happens to the beer taps?

The digital marketing and media company Red Ventures based just south of the state line in Indian Land S.C. built its image around a campus modeled after those of Silicon Valley tech firms. Employees enjoy beer taps a bowling alley and basketball court bistros a library and “The Arena” where the company hosts packed “RedTalks”—TED-style events with speakers from Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to University of Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari.

“We have prided ourselves on our culture. A cornerstone of that culture was the in-office collaboration” says Hallie Cornetta the company’s head of human capital. “Everything is now done via video chats” and Red Ventures is “erring on the highly conservative side” in assessing when to bring employees back.

So what does the future look like in a world where employees rifle through their own fridges for beer and snacks and crowded indoor gatherings are a wild fantasy? Cornetta says Red Ventures will use 2021 to explore a “hybrid working environment.” That might even mean employees who want to work elsewhere for weeks or months—an option previously unthinkable for a fast-expanding company that normally trains new workers via “osmosis” and in-person apprenticeships.

“The world’s changed and employees especially great talent want flexibility now more than ever” she says. “That means the ability to work from home or work from the beach for a month in the summer. Or work remotely entirely if that’s the way we can attract the best talent.”

Remote work has yielded both benefits and problems. Employees tend to burn out more quickly on Zoom where their own faces stare back from the screen all day. They have to schedule videoconferences to resolve questions once answered with a shout to the next desk. As employees move sometimes to other time zones they have to get up early or stay up late to make meetings.

Red Ventures has tried to manage burnout with selective long weekends and no-video or no-meeting days. They’ve modified internal newsletters and encouraged more communications from other managers the better to keep in touch with a workforce used to mass in-person gatherings with CEO Ric Elias.

Red Ventures could learn helpful lessons from teleworking. With the $500 million acquisition of CNET Media Group (whose brands include TVGuide and Gamespot) as well as travel guide company Lonely Planet less than half of Red Ventures’ employees now live in the Charlotte region. Still Cornetta doesn’t think an all-virtual future is in the cards for most workers.

“We know that some of our talent arguably the majority of our talent is still going to crave an in-office environment the majority of the time” she says. “Having the flexibility to work from home or other places will be there but we will absolutely continue to invest in our on-campus facilities and our amenities.”

Even for those who choose to work outside the office “remote work” might not be so remote: Red Ventures recently opened an apartment complex next to its campus called the Court at Redstone for employees who want to live next door to the office.

CHARLOTTE HORNETS: Getting back in the arena

Few businesses are more centered on in-person interactions than sports and entertainment which relies on packed arenas and stadiums and in-person league meetings player workouts and conference schmoozing.

The Charlotte Hornets organization which operates and plays in the 20000-seat Spectrum Center had its last 10 home games canceled; concerts from Michael Bublé to The Weeknd postponed; and the Republican National Convention relocated.

“We’ve basically been shut down from March 13 on” says Hornets President Fred Whitfield. The team’s 200-plus permanent employees have worked remotely since then. (The Hornets also employ more than 500 or so part-timers to work events and games.) Whitfield says he has a comfortable setup at home with his computer iPad and phone screens. Zoom has made it easier for him to attend departmental meetings he used to miss and serve on several pandemic-related task forces that meet virtually.

But he adds the personal aspects have been tough to replicate. “I really think there’s a value to be gained from in-person meetings and really being able to sit across the table from individuals whether it’s in New York at the NBA meeting or at the sales and marketing meeting down in Miami” he said. “In meetings now with our NBA counterparts and colleagues you don’t have that in-between break time that you can interact network share ideas and best practices what’s working what’s not. I miss those kinds of things and I think we all do.”

Although Whitfield said he and employees have adapted—they interviewed some potential players via Zoom for example then set up in the arena’s VIP area with masks and social distancing for the draft—the ultimate goal is to get back to the office. With a business that requires in-person attendance permanent remote work isn’t an option. He says it’s important for part-timers who work events from ushers to ticket-takers to feel comfortable when the arena reopens. If they don’t it will be harder to convince fans to come back.

As of mid-December the NBA planned to begin its 2020-21 season December 22 with 10 fewer games than usual and daily testing of players and staff. Teams will vary in the number of fans they allow for games; the Hornets began with none but hoped to welcome fans back later in the season. The team has invested in enhanced air filtration touchless tickets and cashless concessions; committed to more cleaning and disinfection; and obtained two third-party health and safety accreditations all with the goal of convincing fans and workers that the team and Spectrum Center can safely host mass gatherings again.

“We’ve got to make sure” Whitfield said “we’re completely buttoned up on every protocol we know how to operate.”

LOWE’S: Home improvement store in the home office era

Lowe’s named Janice Dupré Little executive vice president of human resources weeks before it sent its corporate workforce home in mid-March. “Like everyone else” Dupré Little says “we thought it would be for a couple of weeks.” The company had to figure out how to work remotely with more than 6500 corporate employees who were used to doing things in the office “face-to-face brick and mortar” at its massive Mooresville campus and uptown offices. And Lowe’s had to keep its 2200 stores open with an hourly-wage workforce that can’t do its jobs through video calls from home.

Demand for home-improvement products surged. Lowe’s scrambled to buy huge amounts of personal protective equipment install Plexiglas shields at registers and comply with shifting regulations as people stuck at home decided they couldn’t stare at their chipped paint or outdated kitchens anymore. Office workers abruptly left supervising children all day faced another set of challenges. With employees at work and home all the time Dupré Little says they confronted new levels of burnout.

“People were invigorated in the beginning” she said. “Now we’re all facing this fatigue. We don’t know how to separate and go eat lunch go have dinner. We have to continue to remind our associates: Take your vacation. Take that downtime.”

Lowe’s is building a new tech hub with 2000 workers in a 23-story tower in South End scheduled for completion in late 2021. The project was announced in mid-2019 before people questioned whether anyone especially tech workers who need only a computer would be in the office again. “No one has a crystal ball to know everything but at this point we’ve stayed on track” Dupré Little says. “We are still hiring. We are still very focused on the commitment that we made.”

As of early December Lowe’s was planning to continue remote work at least through July 2021. Dupré Little says she expects the company to retain some measure of flexibility with a greater recognition of the “human components” of workers’ lives: “You see dogs and kids flying by in the midst of a call and you’re more tolerant of that.”

To compensate in-store workers Lowe’s has distributed six rounds of bonuses—$300 each for full-time employees $150 for part-time—since March. The company also gave hourly workers a temporary $2-an-hour raise. Lowe’s has hired more than 155000 people in part due to the surging demand from stir-crazy customers. Lowe’s also held its annual women’s leadership summit and its vendor forum virtually this year a first for the company. Dupré Little says changes like those could persist after the pandemic.

“When you do things in person you’re limited by space capacity and resources” she says. “Once you have a virtual environment it gives you a reach you wouldn’t have before.”

But the new workplace template whatever it turns out to be is still a long way off. “I don’t feel like we’re going to come out of this pandemic just because a vaccine comes out” Dupré Little says. “It’s going to take time. We could be in this thing for a lot longer.”

""Hank Aaron is near the top of everyone's list of all-time great players"" Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. ""His monumental achievements as a player were surpassed only by his dignity and integrity as a person. Hank symbolized the very best of our game and his all-around excellence provided Americans and fans across the world with an example to which to aspire. His career demonstrates that a person who goes to work with humility every day can hammer his way into history -- and find a way to shine like no other.""

Aaron had worked in the Atlanta Braves' front office since retiring from his playing career in 1976. He most recently was a senior vice president a role he held since December 1989. The team said he died in his sleep.

""We are absolutely devastated by the passing of our beloved Hank"" a statement from Braves chairman Terry McGuirk began. ""He was a beacon for our organization first as a player then with player development and always with our community efforts. His incredible talent and resolve helped him achieve the highest accomplishments yet he never lost his humble nature. Henry Louis Aaron wasn't just our icon but one across Major League Baseball and around the world. His success on the diamond was matched only by his business accomplishments off the field and capped by his extraordinary philanthropic efforts.

""We are heartbroken and thinking of his wife Billye and their children Gaile Hank Jr. Lary Dorinda and Ceci and his grandchildren.""

The longtime Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves slugger held the record for most career home runs for more than three decades before Barry Bonds broke it in 2007. Aaron finished his 23-year career with 755 home runs including a 19-year stretch in which he hit at least 24 every season.

A 25-time All-Star and the 1957 National League MVP Aaron also won three Gold Gloves and still holds the all-time records for RBIs (2297) and total bases (6856). He ranks second in homers third in hits (3771) and fourth in runs scored (2174).

""Hammerin' Hank"" began his career in the Negro Leagues in 1951 with the Indianapolis Clowns before the Braves picked up his contract. He made his MLB debut in 1954 and spent the next 21 seasons with the Braves before ending his career with the Milwaukee Brewers (1975-76).

Aaron was in the news two weeks ago when he publicly received the first dose of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine with his wife Billye with the aim of easing doubts about the vaccine.

""I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this"" said Aaron at the time. ""It's just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.""

Aaron was elected to the Hall of Fame on his first ballot in 1982. Both the Braves and Brewers retired his No. 44.

""Hank Aaron's incredible talent on the baseball field was only matched by his dignity and character which shone brightly not only here in Cooperstown but with every step he took"" said Hall of Fame chairperson Jane Forbes Clark in a release.

""His courage while pursuing the game's all-time home run record served as an example for millions of people inside and outside of the sports world who were also aspiring to achieve their greatest dreams. His generosity of spirit and legendary accomplishments will live in Cooperstown forever. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire staff of the Hall of Fame we send our deepest sympathies to his wife Billye and his entire family.""

Aaron endured racist taunts and even death threats with stoic dignity as he chased Babe Ruth's iconic mark of 714 career home runs.

On April 8 1974 Aaron hit home run No. 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing to break the record.

Since 1999 -- the 25th anniversary of Aaron passing Ruth -- the Hank Aaron Award has been presented annually by Major League Baseball to the top hitters in each league. Atlanta's Freddie Freeman and Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox earned the prestigious honor in 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIvYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMvZmFucy10cmlidXRlLWF0bGFudGEtaGFuay1hYXJvbi84NS0xNjg4YjkwYi1jOGJmLTQ4MGMtYTI3Yy05MjVmNjJkZGQyYzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fan tributes to Hank Aaron,"Fans described a man who was a larger-than-life giant who found a way to be down-to-earth - someone they won't forget.

ATLANTA — Many fans and admirers took Saturday as an opportunity to pay their respects to a man who helped transform baseball and change hearts across Atlanta and the U.S.

Fans told 11Alive that they had different reasons for showing up to landmarks across the city to honor Hank Aaron. Some of course remembered him for his legendary baseball career. Others knew him for the work he did after putting down his bat.

""Sometimes you just think your heroes are going to live forever"" Demarcus Billings said.

He said being at Truist Park honoring Aaron - a giant he looked up to in life - was surreal.

""He did mean a lot"" Billings said. ""His impact reached farther than he probably even knows.""

Some like London Rivers who waited in line to see Hank Aaron's statue admired the legend for reasons other than baseball.

""I am a fan of people of color who have made a difference"" he said. ""So it's an inspiration to see how much he's done.""

It was a point shared by another fan David Toliver.

""You can't ignore the significance he had - not only with baseball but in the community"" he said. ""Especially at the time when he broke Babe Ruth's record.""

Others took opportunities to celebrate the baseball great's life in the town he was synonymous with in life.

City-wide celebration comes as no surprise to Billings who was born and raised in Atlanta.

""The people of Atlanta we definitely mourn his passing but we'll never forget his memory and what he's done"" he said.

Atlanta Technical College also honored Hank Aaron. He has a building at the college named after him. Even in retirement he continued to make donations and provide scholarships to students.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2FsbHRvdGhlcGVuLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzI0L2F0bGFudGEtYnJhdmVzLWNoYW5nZS1uYW1lLWhhbW1lcnMtaG9ub3ItaGFuay1hYXJvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Braves should change name to Hammers to honor Hank Aaron,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYXJvdW5kdGhlZm9naG9ybi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8yNC9zZi1naWFudHMtcGFibG8tc2FuZG92YWwtc2lnbnMtYnJhdmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SF Giants: Pablo Sandoval Re-Signs with Atlanta Braves,

The number of positive cases continues to rise dramatically.

We The People must hold these companies and the public officials who have failed to regulate them accountable.

What You Need to Know

Thousands of Nebraskan meatpacking plant workers have tested positive for COVID-19 causing some Nebraska counties to lead the nation in infection rates. As of May 18 eight deaths had been tied to Nebraska meatpacking plants. During the past few weeks the number of meatpacking plant workers infected by COVID-19 has increased by at least 160%.

Predictably Gov. Ricketts' strategy of directing health officials to make unenforceable recommendations to plant officials has failed to produce the safe work environment that's required by the law. For example we remain unaware of a single Nebraska plant spacing workers six feet apart on the processing floor even though this is the most fundamental method of preventing the spread of this disease recommended universally by health officials and incorporated into public health directives signed by executive officials all over the world.

President Trump and Gov. Ricketts have both said packing plants are essential infrastructure and have thereby recognized the workers as essential. Like other essential workers including frontline health workers meatpacking plant workers need essential protections. Yet despite rising rates of infection Nebraska’s meatpacking plants have not fully implemented the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and University of Nebraska Medical Center.

Instead of requiring these companies to step up safety measures Gov. Ricketts has tried to shift blame to workers' ""communities"" and their culture. He has surrendered regulatory authority to OSHA knowing the agency does not intend to exercise it. He has even encouraged local health departments to let plant owners decide whether they should report how many cases are associated with specific plants.

Companies' failures to protect workers are increasing existing health disparities. Essential workers in our state's meatpacking plants are disproportionately Nebraskans of color and immigrants. We are fighting for these workers to continue our tradition of promoting racial justice and equal protection of the law.



What the ACLU is Doing

We reject the false choice of either closing the plants altogether or risking the health and safety of workers. Plants can continue to operate and workers can simultaneously be protected but only if industry executives and plant leadership are required to follow at a minimum standards established by the CDC and OSHA. All we ask is that Gov. Ricketts direct his Department of Labor to fulfill their duty to enforce laws passed by the people to provide employees safe workplaces.

We joined community partners in sending a joint letter to Gov. Ricketts calling for key protections.

We are calling for local health department directors and Nebraska Department of Labor Commissioner John Albin to mandate increased protections for meatpacking plant workers - including a minimum of six feet distance on the processing floor and notification of health authorities and coworkers of any positive tests.

We are supporting solidarity drive-in vigils across the state by funding signage.

With the COVID Tracking Project we filed an open records request to seek statewide data on COVID-19 cases and deaths disaggregated by race and ethnicity. This data would show where resources are needed the most.



What You Can Do

Thank you for defending the rights of our friends family and neighbors who are working at these plants. We the People means all of us.

Sign our petition to send a clear message that essential workers deserve essential protections. More than 1300 Nebraskans have added their names.

Tell Gov. Ricketts to stop blaming workers and to start standing up to companies by mandating increased protections. Contact information is available online.

Keep this in the news and keep the pressure up. Write into your local newspaper to share what you think about the current situation and what should be done. We've put together helpful tips for writing a letter to the editor.

It will open Feb. 1 on the ground floor of the 15-story centerpiece building Falls Tower at Camperdown officials with the bank confirmed Friday.

It replaces the bank's ""Plaza"" branch that shut down at 101 North Main former site of the Charlotte-based bank's Greenville headquarters.

Bank manager Chip Spangler said he was excited about the new location. Standing at the branch’s South Main Street door Friday morning he gestured toward the sidewalk and estimated a thousand people walk by a day.

“This is going to be a really nice building” Spangler said. “Right next to Falls Park and with all the festivals.”

The bank's Upstate executive offices Merrill Lynch investment offices and mortgage department will be on the building's seventh and eighth floors.

Stacy Brandon the bank's Upstate South Carolina market president said in a statement that Bank of America has operated in the region for more than 100 years.

According to FDIC records Bank of America's $1.7 billion in deposits in Greenville County currently rank it fourth among banking institutions operating in the county. The county's biggest bank is Wells Fargo ($2.3 billion) followed by Truist ($2.2 billion) and TD Bank ($2.0 billion). Still Bank of America can boast the biggest Main Street presence with its name gleaming atop Falls Towers' southern and western facades.

""Our goal is to deliver a seamless experience for clients across all channels and this new location will ensure everyone living and working downtown has even greater access to our financial services"" Brandon said.

The banking industry has been in flux in the Upstate in recent years with CertusBank shutting down in 2015 BB&T and SunTrust completing their ""Truist"" merger last year and the nation's largest bank — Chase — entering the Greenville market for the first time with multiple branches at the close of 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAxLTI0L2NoaW5hLXMtZ3Jvd2luZy1wb3dlci1pcy1zY2FyaW5nLW9yZGluYXJ5LXNhdmVycy1vdXQtb2YtaG9uZy1rb25n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's Growing Power Is Scaring Ordinary Savers Out of Hong Kong,"It was the freezing of bank accounts that changed Dan’s mind.

If your residence before moving to Mexico is in a state that collects income taxes you will not be able to just wave your hands and declare that you are a resident of another state for state income tax purposes - you will have to really establish residency in another state and have the documentation to prove it to the satisfaction of your old taxing state. Virginia is notorious for being extremely ""sticky"" and doing their best to collect state taxes from ex-residents.



Many US companies (banks) will keep records of your last known residence and they won't update it unless you tell them specifically you are no longer a US resident in which case they may want to close your account. Retirement fund companies like Fidelity may if you tell them you are not a US resident limit your investment options and/or force you to switch to an international investment account.



Your cell phone carrier may require you to have a US mailing address in order to keep your US number and account open if you wish to do that. There are other ways to keep a US phone number however.



The point is maintaining a US mailing address can avoid awkward questions and issues. If you aren't going to have any US bank accounts or retirement accounts or try to keep a US phone number then it doesn't matter.



This whole issue is not connected to the issue of what your immigration status in Mexico is - the OP's question was a little confused on that point. It's perhaps helpful to keep a US mailing address regardless of whether you return every 180 days and live on a tourist visa or obtain mexican residency.

Third party food delivery apps will now be required to list an itemized cost breakdown of each transaction for customers.

Late last year some DoorDash customers started getting hit with a puzzling new fee on their order total just before checkout.

The extra roughly $1 to $2 charge was labeled by city. Some people got a ""Denver"" fee others a ""Chicago"" one.

Across the country people who ordered delivery through the service were charged more seemingly just for living in those places CNN reported.

RELATED: Chicago sets new rules for third-party food delivery apps amid COVID-19 pandemic

The actual reason for the new fees? In those cities local governments have passed temporary caps that limit how much third-party delivery platforms can charge restaurants to help struggling business. To try to recoup those losses DoorDash has put in new customer fees in cities that have enacted caps including Chicago Cleveland Denver Oakland Philadelphia Portland Seattle St. Louis and a handful of others. (Customers can find the explanation when they click on the fee line before placing their orders).

DoorDash isn't alone in adding fees. Uber Eats has had a similar customer fee in place since the summer in Portland where the cap is 10% per order.

And over the next few weeks Uber Eats plans to add fees in over a dozen markets including Chicago Minneapolis Boston Washington and Oregon. The fees are $2 on average.

As restaurants struggle to make it through the pandemic they're fighting back against high commissions charged by delivery platforms - either by looking for alternatives or with the help of legislation. But someone has to pay those fees. Increasingly it's the consumer.

Reckoning with high commission fees

Before the pandemic many restaurants shied away from third-party delivery services like DoorDash Uber Eats or Grubhub. Those platforms can charge commission fees as high as 30% per order which can leave restaurants in the red.

But now with dining rooms completely closed or open with limited capacity many restaurant operators feel they have to offer delivery or go out of business. With less money coming in the pain of those high commission fees is even greater.

In an effort to help restaurants a number of municipalities enacted commission fee caps. The temporary limits usually around 15% will expire eventually - in some cases after indoor dining has been fully reinstated for two or three months in other cases on a specific date. Some cities that enacted temporary fee caps have already extended them.

Delivery services have taken varying approaches to the caps

DoorDash argues that the fees it gets from restaurants cover its own costs. If they can't get them from restaurants they have to charge customers instead according to the company.

""Operating our platform paying and insuring Dashers and ensuring high-quality service can be expensive which is why in many markets where local governments have passed pricing regulations we have begun charging customers a small additional fee"" a DoorDash spokesperson told CNN Business in an emailed statement.

Uber echoed a similar sentiment.

""In order to maintain a reliable delivery marketplace we are instituting several temporary local fees in certain US markets"" an Uber Eats spokesperson said. ""Fees collected by Uber Eats from both merchants and consumers on transactions are what fund our services including maintenance of the app consumer support safety and - most importantly - pay for delivery people.""

Unlike its competitors Grubhub which merged with Seamless in 2013 is not adding explicit fees in cities that have put commission caps in place according to a company spokesperson. Instead it's using its rivals' actions to try to lure people to its monthly subscription service Grubhub+ which costs $9.99 per month. In December it said it would offer three months free to people who join the service in Chicago and New York City.

The cost of higher fees

Some restaurant advocates are afraid that the higher fees will drive customers away. ""We oppose any additional fees that could potentially dissuade diners from ordering in"" said Sam Toia president and CEO of the Illinois Restaurant Association.

There's good reason to be afraid.

""Consumers are really hesitant to incur any additional fees and costs"" on delivery said Jill Failla senior foodservice analyst at Mintel. ""Third-party companies need to be really aware of this barrier around consumer fees and need to be really careful about what they're trying to pass on to the consumer.""

That doesn't mean that they won't end up charging more for delivery she said.

Though the pandemic has given them a boost with online ordering surging many of these companies have struggled with profitability.

RELATED: Some restaurants ask customers to skip delivery apps like Grubhub Uber Eats

For now some restaurant operators are saying they haven't seen any slowdown in orders because of the new fees.

""I haven't seen a meaningful change in our third-party percentage sale"" said Ruth Jones chief financial officer at Maria Empanada a small Colorado-based empanada chain.

The commission caps have been helpful Jones said. But once they go away restaurants will once again face those higher commission fees. When that happens they might have to start charging customer fees themselves. ""You're seeing a lot of restaurants add delivery fees for using the third parties"" she said. ""We have to continue to try to make money as a business so we have to make choices that make the third party make sense.""

That's especially the case in an environment where restaurants are struggling to survive.

""Restaurants recovery is going to require above average revenue and margin growth for some time and unfortunately that will mean some higher prices for consumers"" said David Henkes senior principal at Technomic. ""Ordering delivery has and will continue to get more expensive.""

There’s a new scam target that appeared in our inboxes this week and one that we’ve not seen before as the scammers seemingly behind a recent Woolworths scam focus on Uber now too.

It felt like just yesterday we started seeing the Woolies scam appear and yet today there’s a different target. Presumably it seems there’s no specific day when scammers aren’t operating because ripping off people is an everyday thing. For everyone else — for anyone who could be the target of scammers — it means being vigilant and making sure you don’t click is also an everyday thing.

So let’s break down this scam bit by bit to stop you from clicking and to help you know that it’s safe to delete it ASAP.

What is this Uber email scam and how can you tell the signs?

The “Uber Shoppers” scam

We’re just going to call this the “Uber Shoppers” scam because of the bright red text sitting in the email which is very much like the “Woolworths Shoppers” email we saw the other day. It is almost identical suggesting the same creators because it is pretty much the same scam but with a new hat.

This Uber email scam is not complex and gives all the warning signs to not click but because it’s a new target it might be a little difficult to work out what’s going on.

Essentially it’s the same concept: click on the link and you’ll be redirected to a fake Uber site which acts as a phishing site waiting for you to enter details and potentially lose out big later on when the scammers decide to use them for something.

However because it’s a new target it might be easy to think this scam is real so we’ll break it down bit by bit. Remember that being about to do this comes down to how you identify a scam email and it’s always the same.

The Uber Shoppers scam email address

We’ll start with the most obvious telltale sign which is the email address. You can always expand the email address without clicking on a link because it’s always worth checking who sent you the email.

Scammers can’t use an email from the real company so they’ll often opt for one of two approaches: either use a similar website address they’ve purchased that you’ll think is similar such as ub3r.com or uberr.net.au  or they’ll use something outlandish hoping you’ll never look at the email address.

Call a scammer’s bluff and check the email address of the person that sent you because it’s here you can find the scam.

In the Uber Shoppers scam the email address in the “from” field is a Gmail address which seems out of kilter from an official Uber email hailing from uber.com . Remember scammers can’t use the official address so that’s a dead giveaway that this is a scam.

The subject lines are a little weird

It’s not just the email address but the subject lines too. The scammers in these emails are a little focused on telling you that you have a surprise and while they’re gradually getting better at saying it the whole thing still feels weird.

“We have a… surprise for UberUsers” feels like the sort of pause an evil genius would say right before the floor fell out from under you and you found yourself falling into a pool or piranhas only to look up and see the madman laughing. It’s a weird place to put an ellipsis for a pause the “…” in that subject.

There’s also the matter of “UberUsers” all thrown together which is likely the scammer’s attempt at getting its unofficial email past an inbox’s spam filters because it looks like “Uber” but it’s also not quite.

They’re obvious giveaways this Uber scam is a scam from where we sit but in case you want to compare it to the almost identical scam sent by the same criminals in the guise of Woolies take a look at how they sit in the inbox together.

The details of the Uber Shoppers email also read like a scam

We’ll never tell you to click on a scam but if you did the inside of the scam email can reveal how scammy it is.

Much like the Woolies one earlier in the week and like others we saw last year the text of the email is found behind a giant image advertising a free gift with a link that sits behind everything.

The text of the email is just an image and whether you were to touch the appropriated Uber logo the “Start now” button or even any of the fake unsubscribe links you’ll go to the same place a very un-Uber address of:

That clearly doesn’t look official and neither does the fact that there are two addresses in the text of the email: one in Florida and one in Dayton Ohio.

For a bit of further understanding Uber’s Australian emails seem to have an address at the bottom but it’s in Amsterdam. Also Uber has very specific colouring at the bottom of its emails with black backgrounds and white text.

What’s in the Uber Shoppers scam link

If you were to accidentally click on that clearly fake and dodgy Uber Shoppers scam link you’d be taken to a clearly fake Uber scam survey built in very much the same way as every other scam survey we’ve ever seen.

Some of the details here are pretty obvious and lead into the the same method for picking up a scammer: much like reading the email address read the website address. Often called a URL it’s something a scammer can’t fake.

A scammer can’t just pretend they’re from uber.com  so they’ll often go with something outlandish. In this instance it’s rewardpace.com . That address could change for you by the way as these sorts of scams tend to have several website names each about as fraudulent as the other.

Beyond the dodgy address some of the details can seem convincing such as fake reviews with similar date stamps and a “Shopping Survey” name with a check mark as if that some how makes it more authentic (it doesn’t). There’s even a weird survey that has some silly choices such as asking if your experience with Uber is “Correct” (we had a giggle on that one).

But it’s all a scam to get your name address and credit card details to ship you that special gift.

At the end there’s a scammy check system that does nothing more than animate some text on screen to make you think it’s really doing a security check and then an assortment of “free” phones that you apparently qualify for which if you click on take you to a new site where you’ll be asked to pick a colour enter your details and then you’ll be shipping the phone.

Except you won’t: the Uber Shoppers scam is the same scam we’ve seen forever with the target being your details and the scammer hoping you’ll believe them.

The Uber Shoppers scam is the same scam with a new design

If you were one of the people who saw the recent Woolworths email scam or even the JB HiFi SMS scam a week or so before that this is the same thing: it’s a fraudulent website hoping to ensnare details by looking legit and yet being anything but.

There’s no such thing as a free lunch and certainly not a free phone. Uber is not sending you an offer for a free phone and you should not follow through on this email.

Just delete the email like you would any other or report it as spam in your inbox and move on so as not to be caught in the hundreds of millions Australians lose to scams every year. There’ll be others like it we suspect and we’ll write about those too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZ3JpdGRhaWx5LmNvbS91YmVyLW9mZmljaWFsbHktb3ducy1wb3N0bWF0ZXMtbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Officially Owns Postmates Now,"You know Uber. You know Postmates. But now the popular ride-sharing company has officially acquired the delivery app.

Originally announced last July Uber Technologies set out to buy Postmates for $2.65 Billion in stock. At first the company worked to buy another food delivery rival GrubHub. However the deal fell through since they could not work to determine a break-up fee and Uber felt like GrubHub was stalling.

The deal closed in December and Uber now owns the San Francisco-based company saying that their new partnership will “create an even stronger delivery marketplace.”

But how does that work in regards to Postmates and Uber’s own food delivery service Uber Eats?

In a press release Uber explained that acquiring Postmates helps in the sense that it focuses on different geographical areas than Uber Eats does; additionally Postmates established good relationships with small and medium sized businesses as well as local restaurants.

The two apps will continue to operate independently from one another and focus on their own branding but they’ll merge some back-end operations such as drivers.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the two apps also share similar beliefs in terms of positive impact.

“Uber and Postmates have long shared a belief that platforms like ours can power much more than just food delivery” she said. “They can be a hugely important part of local commerce and communities all the more important during crises like COVID-19 … We’re thrilled to welcome Postmates to the Uber family as we innovate together to deliver better experiences for consumers delivery people and merchants across the country.

Looking at Numbers

At the time of the initial announcement Uber estimated that it would issue approximately 84 million shares of common stock for 100% of the fully diluted equity of Postmates.

Edison Trends reported that Uber Eats also trailed behind another food delivery service DoorDash. When it looked at all services from last June prior to the news DoorDash took 45 percent of all transactions; Uber Eats stood in second place at 28 percent. With Uber Eats and Postmates combined their combined market share would boost to around 35%.

The merge should help Uber a great deal especially as the service wants to bounce back from its losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When news of Uber buying Postmates first came around ride-share usage was down 80 percent from the previous year. But the company believes that as restaurants stay closed and limit those who want to dine-in more will turn to take-out and delivery.

With Postmates now part of the Uber family the company also plans to launch a “regional listening exercise” this year to help further connect with restaurants and merchants; this will serve as a time for them to ask questions and for Uber to hear out concerns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy91YmVyLWVhdHMtbG9uZy1pc2xhbmQtbDc5NDY30gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2RheS5jb20vYW1wL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy91YmVyLWVhdHMtbG9uZy1pc2xhbmQtbDc5NDY3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What it's like supporting a family as an Uber Eats driver on Long Island,"At about 9:30 one bitterly cold November morning Brad Herrschaft—in the car as usual—received a text from his wife Ria who couldn’t find one of their two- year-old son Jhett’s dinosaur slippers. ""It’s ... in ... the ... dryer"" he read aloud texting her back from a Wendy’s parking lot. ""Next she’ll be asking me ‘How’d he get it wet?’ ""

Sure enough.

""He ... jumped in ... the tub ... with ... his slippers on.""

Herrschaft quickly slipped his phone back into the cup holder reopened the Uber Eats app and got back to work. Somewhere Long Islanders were dreaming longingly of the lives they left behind all those evenings spent nodding off on the LIRR as the train made its way—at least in Herrschaft’s case—back to Lake Ronkonkoma from Manhattan where the 50-year-old worked in private security at the United Arab Emirates Consulate.

Like lots of Islanders he might still be consumed by his sudden furloughing in March or Ria’s sudden dismissal from her court reporting job the same month. Like other tall athletic fathers Herrschaft could regret not having played soccer more with his equally athletic six-year-old son Jase when he’d had the chance before the coronavirus canceled everything and father and son were forced to redirect from sports to spelling homework.

But Herrschaft seems capable of going in just one direction—forward—a very good trait to possess during a pandemic as it turns out. And anyway there was no time for nostalgia. Some guy named Zack in Centereach was waiting for a Breakfast Baconator and Maple Bacon Chicken Croissant and it was Herrschaft’s mission to deliver the goods.

""I get home at 5 and if Jase has some homework to finish up I’ll help him with that"" he said. Herrschaft has been working for Uber Eats since September.

Make a left turn on Firdale Street interrupted the GPS lady also with no time for nostalgia.

""The little guy usually needs to eat something so I’ll feed him then both of them have to get into the bath.""

Make a right turn on Holbrook Road.

""And now that Jhett is potty training I have to keep on checking him and putting him on the toilet"" Herrschaft sighed. ""Usually by 6:30 or 7 they’re done with everything so I let them play a little bit with their cars.""

In a half mile take a left turn onto Middle Country Road.

His new world is baffling destination-less yet Herrschaft keeps moving. By 9:45 the kids will usually be asleep and he’ll hit the sack too something he hates doing before Ria gets home—she just got a job working evenings in a UPS warehouse—but it can’t be helped. He has to be up and out the door by 7 the next morning when the action heats up and the orders come rolling in from Portion Road a stretch that includes McDonald’s the IHOP the Island Lake Diner. If Herrschaft is to make his goal of $160 or $180 before it’s time to head home at 4:30 Portion will have to do its part. And he will need to hustle.

To the public Uber is still primarily a ride-sharing service but it’s food delivery that has accounted for the largest share of the company’s overall revenue at least since last summer. It’s a fiercely competitive business what with Grubhub DoorDash and all the other apps out there but consumers have also embraced restaurant delivery in unprecedented numbers during the pandemic. Accordingly Uber Eats has gone on a hiring binge and Long Islanders have answered the call. According to the company more than 10000 of us have signed up to be delivery drivers just since April many motivated like Herrschaft by the promise of quick money and a flexible work-when-you-want schedule. There are other perks too.

""I enjoy seeing neighborhoods and streets that in general I would never have any need to go to"" said the Holbrook native cruising down Main Street to the Starbucks in Sayville. Once upon a time Herrschaft did indeed need to go to Sayville. He and his father used to take Candee Avenue to the shoreline so the pair could sail the family boat to Fire Island. But that was a million years ago when young Brad still wanted to be an astronaut before he wanted to be a phys-ed teacher and then an NYPD officer which is what he became. Herrschaft was deployed to Precinct 81 in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn and retired in 2011 after 20 years on the force partly to collect his pension. He was going through a divorce at the time and needed to pay off a mortgage so he could support his two daughters Savannah and Tiana now 22 and 20. His own father is gone now his 74-year-old mother moved in with him over the summer.

""She got diagnosed with the beginning stages of dementia and so I was like ‘Mom why don’t you just move in before this progresses and gets worse and you don’t know where you are?’ "" It was yet another unexpected turn of events in a season full of them a predicament that has made Herrschaft and many others peculiarly vulnerable to the allure of gig work even as that work brings vulnerabilities of its own—no health benefits say.

""She just had physical therapy yesterday so I took an hour and took her to physical therapy. If the wife has a doctor’s appointment and I need to watch the baby I watch the baby. Those are all benefits of working for Uber.""

Make a right turn then a left turn.

One of the other benefits admittedly minor of an Uber Eats job is the glimpse it provides of Long Islanders’ eating habits. At 10:30 a.m. for instance Herrschaft found himself delivering French toast and two milkshakes to a silhouetted figure behind a curtain in Nesconset. That or a disembodied hand reaching around the door is what passes for human interaction in a job like this. About 90 percent of his customers opt for contactless delivery Herrschaft said. ""For the most part they don’t want to see you they don’t want to deal with you.""

But that’s OK things move faster that way a plus when you’re committed to making 20 to 30 dollars an hour five or six days a week. ""When it’s busy it’s one right after the other. And even if it’s not you’re only waiting about 10 minutes for an order."" Herrschaft likes accepting jobs in Uber’s hot zones which pay more and are identified by various shades of orange on the app’s map like storms on Doppler radar. After setting an order on someone’s stoop or welcome mat he takes a photo to prove he did so texts ""enjoy your food"" to the customer then trots back to his car for the next delivery. Only twice has a bag gone unclaimed. After he and Uber tried and failed to locate the source of a recent Outback Steakhouse order the company told him to discard the food. ""Which means eat the food"" he laughed. ""I called my wife and said ‘Ria I’m bringing home steaks!’ ""

Making a thousand dollars a week for picking up food and dropping off food and having the flexibility—that gives you a whole new perspective. Brad Herrschaft

Usually though she fixes dinner for the family before going to work. The Herrschafts rarely order takeout and haven’t eaten indoors at a restaurant since the pandemic began.

Proceed straight on Clinton Avenue.

""Some people are so set in their ways when something disrupts that it’s a major issue"" said Herrschaft who began this day like most rubbing down the interior of his 2011 liquid silver metallic Mazda 2 with disinfectant wipes per Uber regulations. The disruptions started almost immediately. When he turned the ignition of his car which has 125000 miles on it he noticed a headlight out (""good thing I drive during the day"") and a low-tire-pressure exclamation point glowing from the dashboard (""maybe it’s the cold""). Already this morning Herrschaft had been forced to borrow his wife’s debit card to pay for the $15 in gas he typically uses in a day. His own had just been canceled after being targeted by fraudsters. ""You have to figure out how to be flexible.""

Make a slight right turn on Entrance Road.

Herrschaft wheeled into the sprawling campus at Stony Brook University with someone’s iced peppermint mocha in tow. ""I never thought I’d be doing this"" he admitted adding that initially he was worried what his friends and family might think. ""I would be lying if I didn’t say it crossed my mind. I’m really going to be delivering food? This is what I’m stooping to? But I don’t care. You have to do what’s best for yourself and for your family. And making a thousand dollars a week for picking up food and dropping off food and having the flexibility—that gives you a whole new perspective. And you’re providing a service to the community.""

On the AM radio station he listens to while driving a morning show host reminded his audience to dress properly for the freezing weather outside. Later he told listeners that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was ""a certified lunatic.""

""I don’t really know how we got here as a country"" Herrschaft said although the media which ""demonizes people for their beliefs"" came in for a large share of the blame. ""There are some people now who won’t date somebody because of their political affliation. To me all of that stuff is crazy it’s just bizarre.""

""How did we get here?"" he said again a few minutes later although this time he was trying to find his way out of Stony Brook. ""Now I’m getting lost too much talking"" he laughed grabbing his phone and checking the map.

The day goes fast. A Sausage McMuffn for Barbara Amber’s bagel sandwich Madison’s doughnuts Andy’s Santa Fe quesadillas and boom it’s 2 p.m. After yet another Sayville delivery Herrschaft decided he had time for a detour down Candee Avenue the same road he and his dad took all those years ago. The Victorian houses were the same too and the road still ended at the beach. Stopping his car on the sand he craned his neck out the window for a view of Great South Bay. That too was the same but also different. November’s spray was chilly the water a roiled gray. Fire Island sat on the horizon as always but today it seemed even farther away than usual almost as distant as summer.

But Herrschaft predictably saw something else. ""I love it here it’s beautiful"" he said simply making a U-turn and heading back to work."

Monday Haircare is launching in all doors at Target as well as target.com and subsequently at Ulta Beauty. The line which includes four shampoos and respective conditioners — named Smooth Repair Sensitive and Volume — ranges in price from $6.99 to $15.99. The product is cruelty-free and formulated without parabens and SLS and the packaging is made of recycled plastic.

More from WWD

The brand made headlines in 2018 when it launched in its native New Zealand having sold out of six months’ supply in six weeks. “We took 25.6 percent market share in 14 days at our leading supermarket [retailer]. We sold six months’ worth of stock in six weeks. You couldn’t have gotten a bigger launch and the way we’re going to try to replicate that here” said Jaimee Lupton founder of Monday Haircare.

Industry sources expect lightning to strike twice saying the expansion could add $40 million in retail sales to the business putting the brand at $55 million in global retail sales for its first 12 months in the U.S. market. Sources added that pending expansion into the U.K. and Canada retail sales could reach $100 million by the end of 2022.

The brand which Lupton conceived after her own trials and errors with various beauty brands brings a straightforward approach to formulation focusing on what’s in the bottle as much as what’s left out. “What we’ve really achieved is taking everything from a luxury item and offering it at that mass price. The Ordinary for example has been able to do that in skin care but in hair care it hasn’t really been done before. Consumers want salon-quality hair care. It should be formulated without costing a week’s salary” Lupton said.

Given the brand’s minimal pastel-pink packaging gives it all the more street cred on social media. “Everything on the hair-care shelf is screaming and we wanted this to whisper” Lupton said. “As for the name we kept coming back to the idea that it seemed silly to keep your rituals just for special occasions or for the weekend.”

Bubblegum pink packaging aside Lupton said part of catering to Generation Z is resonating with its values. “More broadly we’re harnessing what’s taking place with the Generation Z consumer. They want a fair price they want products to feel good they want sustainability and they’re looking for sulfate- and paraben-free” she said. “We want to run deeper than a normal beauty brand.”

From there choosing retail partners was an organic process. “Target really saw that gap in the market with affordable hair-care brands. And Ulta is such an authority in the beauty space. Both attract a really strong Generation Z shopper” Lupton said.

Quick Thoughts

This is an mPerks Rewards offer rather than a digital coupon which means this is already loaded to your mPerks account. That means all you need to do is spend $50 on Happy gift cards in order to get the $10 Reward loaded to your account.

It can take a couple of hours for the Reward to be loaded but I’ve found that these types of offers sometimes get credited to your account sooner than that. If you’re planning on doing a large grocery shop you could buy a $50 Happy gift card when you first arrive at the store and potentially have the $10 ready to go by the time you check out later on with your groceries.

Getting 20% back on a Happy gift card is a decent offer due to the wide range of retailers and restaurants they can be redeemed at. In case you’re not familiar with Happy gift cards there’s a wide range of Happy brands with each card being eligible at 5-10 different places.

Also the overall sentiment got a boost after new president Joe Biden took office.

The resurgence of coronavirus cases and the deepening economic uncertainty continue to take a toll on the US labor market. Last week jobless claims stayed elevated around 900000 but it was slightly below economists’ prediction. The dismal employment scenario and continuing lay-offs show that the new president has a tough task at hand.

On the M&A front tech firms Lumentum Holdings and Coherent Inc. agreed for a merger last week. The $5.7-billion deal is expected to create one of the largest photonics and laser companies in the world. Elsewhere Boston Scientific signed a pact to acquire privately-held mobile health solutions company Preventive Solutions. In another tech buyout Cognizant agreed to acquire software company Magnetic Solutions to strengthen its digital engineering capabilities.

Some of the major Wall Street firms reported earnings this week which was shortened by the holiday with Bank of America Goldman Sachs and Netflix reporting their results on Tuesday. UnitedHealth Group and Morgan Stanley were the important company’s that published earnings on Wednesday while Intel and IBM reported on the next day.

UPS,United Parcel Service,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbWFuZG8uY29tL3NlY3VyaXR5L3Vwcy1waGlzaGluZy1zY2FtLzc3NDQ5OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This UPS survey is a scam in disguise - How to spot the signs,"If you receive a confirmation email from UPS watch out. It could be a trick. Scammers are posing as the United Parcel Service shooting out fraudulent emails to trick you into clicking malicious links.

If you thought postal service scams were over in 2020 think again. Since the pandemic’s not over people are still ordering packages more than ever before which means we see all kinds of new shipping scams. Tap or click to see five of the most recent viral scams.

This newest scam sends you what looks like an official UPS email. You’ll see official titles logos and colors that make it look authentic. The subject line says “confirmation email.”

Notice the improper capitalization. That’s the first sign of a scam

When you tap on the subject line you’re taken to an email that looks like this:

Notice how the body of the email doesn’t match the subject. Although the scam draws you in with the mention of confirmation the email never mentions what it’s confirming.

There’s a specific reason why. The scammers are manipulating your emotions trying to make you feel nervous. “Why am I getting a confirmation email?” they want you to wonder. “I didn’t buy anything!”

The tricksters want to throw you off-balance so you’ll be more susceptible to clicking the link. Whenever you get an email that looks official always take a deep breath before you proceed. Electronic messages like this email often have malicious hyperlinks leading to malware.

Malware can infect your devices in numerous ways but one of the most common is through spam emails. Once you click on a malicious link inside a spam email it’s game over. Your device is infected.

Sometimes that malware can even turn your email address into a malware superspreader. Thankfully there’s now a simple way to find out. Tap or click here to find out if your email is being used for spam.

Unsure if you’re seeing a malicious email? Always check the sender

Take a look at the email address that reached out to you. There are two crystal clear signs of fraudulence in this fake UPS email. Can you spot them?

Firstly the email address is a random seemingly nonsensical combination of letters and numbers. No company would reach out from a sloppy email address like this. They’re dedicated to customer service so they would use an address you can easily remember.

Secondly check out the domain. UPS officials would never reach out from a Gmail account. That’s because the service uses its own domain. For example the email address you’d use to contact UPS about this scam is [email protected].

Think about it this way: Scammers want to work quickly and cheaply. Creating a whole new domain to masquerade as UPS would be costly. Instead they’ll use free email services — like AOL Yahoo or Gmail — to send malicious emails.

There’s another sign of fraudulence that gives away a spam email. Whether or not you recognize it depends on your tech expertise. If you don’t know how email inboxes work this final giveaway of a malicious email may fly under your radar.

Here’s the tech trick to see if a scam is targeting you

So you’ve opened an email. You’re not sure if it’s a scam or not. Take a look at the address line: When this person tried to reach you what email address did they enter?

Take this UPS scam for example.

First look at the email address the scammer reached out to: [email protected]. The same address pops up in the Cc field which is used to send a copy of this email to any address of your choice. (Usually people fill in the Cc field to keep someone in the loop like if you’re making plans with Person A and want Person B to be in the know.)

There’s just one problem. Somehow this email wound up in the email inbox for [email protected]. How could this happen?

There’s only one reason why: The sender used the Bcc field. If you don’t know what that is here’s a quick refresher.

Sometimes you want to send a message to a huge group of people. Maybe you don’t want the people who receive the email to see the complete list of recipients. Using the Bcc field you can send a mass email to dozens of people without letting them see who else is getting it.

When you’re sending out an email the Bcc and Cc entries pop up underneath the main address like this:

Now back to the scam giveaway. You’ve opened a potential scam email and you looked at the email address they used to reach out to you. Maybe it looks legitimate.

Before you decide to trust the email and click the links double-check the “To” field. Is the field filled with your email address? Or is it a completely different address you don’t have access to?

That means they entered your true address under the Bcc line which you can’t see. Ask yourself what their motivation could be. If they’re hiding the list of recipients they’re probably sending this message out to countless people — and scammers are always playing the numbers game.

Moving forward take these steps

When you see an email with a subject that makes you nervous that’s a potential sign of manipulation. Scammers play on your emotions to make you vulnerable.

When you get an email from UPS analyze it before you click any links. Make sure to keep these tips in mind too:

UPS does not request financial or personal information. It won’t send out unsolicited emails or calls asking for your account number ID or password.

Never click links in an email you’re unsure about. It’s better to be safe than sorry so take a screenshot of the email and forward it to [email protected] . They’ll confirm whether the email is legitimate or not.

. They’ll confirm whether the email is legitimate or not. Watch out for grammar and spelling errors. A legitimate company like UPS will have the money to hire people with strong writing skills. A scammer has far fewer resources.

Pay close attention to what the email asks you to do. Does it say there was a security problem with your account? Does it say you need to click a button to log in? That’s a classic phishing technique.

It’s easy to fall for malicious emails when you don’t know what to look for. By taking these steps you’re one step closer to a safe digital life.

Another great way to stop falling for malicious scams is to stay aware of the latest trends. After all online criminals are always coming up with new techniques to trick you and snatch your data.

It could be a scam,"CNN Business —

Most people who buy things online just have to worry about their deliveries being delayed or never arriving. But some people are dealing with a different problem altogether: getting weird stuff like hair clippers face creams and sunglasses they never even ordered at all.

The Federal Trade Commission and cyber experts have been warning consumers about these deliveries which can be part of something known as “brushing” scams.

Here’s how these scams work: Third-party sellers on Amazon eBay and other online marketplaces pay people to write fake positive reviews about their products or do it themselves. To be able to post the reviews these so-called “brushers” need to trick the site into making it appear that a legitimate transaction took place. So they’ll use a fake account to place gift orders and address them to a random person whose name and address they find online. Then instead of actually mailing the item for which they want to post a review the brushers will send a cheap often lightweight item that costs less to ship.

Sending an item (even the wrong one) creates a tracking number and when the package is delivered it enables brushers to write a verified review. If you’re on the receiving end you usually aren’t charged for the purchase and your real account isn’t hacked — but you are left in the dark as to who is repeatedly sending the mystery packages. In many cases there’s no return address. You don’t need to worry that anything bad has happened to you or will happen to you if you get a package that might be part of a brushing scam experts say. But we all need to be concerned about the scams affecting reviews we rely on when buying products.

Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” Jen Blinn

Brushing scams reportedly took off on e-commerce sites in China around five years ago. They resurfaced in headlines last summer when all 50 states issued warnings about mysterious unsolicited packages of seeds that people across the nation received in the mail.

But it’s not just seeds. Unsuspecting recipients have also found boxes with goods ranging from dog pooper-scoopers to power cords to soap dispensers on their doorsteps.

Jen Blinn of Thousand Oaks California told CNN Business she has been receiving random packages since June including most recently a briefcase a backpack a hair straightener and a coffee-cup warmer.

“Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” she said. Blinn notified Amazon of the issue but a customer service agent “didn’t really understand what I was saying. She obviously didn’t know about it” she said. The agent looked at Blinn’s account and found nothing wrong with it.

Jen Blinn holds up some of the unusual items she received in Amazon packages. She didn't order these goods and doesn't know who sent them to her. CNN

It’s not illegal to send customers unordered merchandise. But “the [Federal Trade Commission] has long gone after marketers that use fake reviews” said David Vladeck a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and a law professor at Georgetown University.

Amazon says its policy prohibits sellers sending unsolicited merchandise to customers and that sellers can be removed from the site for doing so.

“Third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and we take action on those who violate our policies including withholding payments suspending or removing selling privileges or working with law enforcement” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Amazon would not say how how many brushing scams have been found on the site or how many sellers have been removed due to these scams.

An eBay spokesperson said in an email that brushing schemes “do not appear to be highly prevalent” on the site. It violates eBay policy to send unsolicited merchandise to customers or falsify reviews and can result in eBay restricting sellers’ accounts or suspending them from the site.

Experts also say it’s difficult to quantify the frequency of such scams because it can be hard for companies to know whether reviews are fake and scams often go unreported by consumers.

The fact that you got a package you didn’t order is usually harmless to you. The harm is to people who rely on reviews when deciding on a purchase said Chris McCabe a former policy enforcement investigator at Amazon tasked with stopping scams and fraud. He is now a consultant to sellers on the site.

The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews” Chris McCabe consultant and former Amazon policy enforcement investigator

“The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews because they might see 100 positive reviews and then there may only be 60 or 70 of them that are legitimate” he said.

The likelihood that a consumer will buy a product that has five reviews is 270% higher than the likelihood they will buy a product with zero reviews according to a 2017 report by Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center.

Some fake reviews are also being driven by Facebook groups where sellers offer buyers money if they write positive product reviews said McCabe. Amazon and Facebook should work together to crack down on these groups he said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company analyzes more than 10 million reviews every week to try to keep fake ones from being published and that it provides details of its investigations to social media companies “so they can stop these bad actors from abusing their platforms.”

A Facebook spokesperson said in an email that when the company is told of groups that may encourage fake reviews it reviews them and removes them if they violate its policies.

Unwanted sheets and Shiatsu massagers

For consumers the unexpected deliveries can be jarring. The packages Ashanté Nicole never ordered started arriving at her home in Fort Lauderdale Florida in 2019.

iPhone and portable car chargers. An iPad case. A heated shiatsu massage. A nail cleaning brush and a blow dryer. Sheets. A mattress cover. A floppy fish toy.

They didn’t have return addresses so Nicole wasn’t sure who was sending the packages. She reached out to Amazon to try to stop them from coming but they still keep arriving at her doorstep.

“It was just kind of a little bit concerning because I don’t know who has my information” she said. “I don’t know what they’re going to send me. Like they could send something illegal and then I’m in trouble because I didn’t know whoever that person was or what they were sending me.”

If you get merchandise you didn’t order it could mean that scammers have created an account in your name or taken over your account an FTC spokesperson said in an email. Scammers may have even created new accounts in other names tied to your address allowing them to post lots of seemingly-real reviews.

“We recommend keeping an eye on your online shopping accounts. If you spot activity that isn’t yours report it to the site right away and think about changing your password for that site” the spokesperson said.

There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” Ashanté Nicole

Nicole feels she has done all she can by alerting Amazon each time unsolicited packages from the retailer arrive at her doorstep.

“There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” she said.

Amazon declined to comment directly on Nicole and Blinn’s accounts but said if a customer receives a package that was unsolicited they should contact Amazon’s customer service team.

Nicole said she hopes Amazon will do more to stop brushing and ban sellers who participate in the scams.

“I just think they need to be a little bit more concerned with shutting those stores down and making sure those sellers can’t use the platform.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8xOTcwcy1kZWNhZGUtc3RyaWtlLXdvcmtlcnMtbGFib3ItaGlzdG9yedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 1970s: Decade of the Rank and File,"The US Bureau of Labor Statistics in its accounting of the year 1970 revealed an extraordinary statistic: there had been in that year alone 5716 strikes involving 3 million workers. The year 1970 saw strikes in almost every employment category. Many seen from the outside were inconsequential affairs; others shook the nation. In Chicago a truckers’ strike — “a revolt against the union leadership” according to the New York Times — spread nationwide including to Los Angeles and Cleveland where roving pickets fought with police and national guardsmen. The Times reported that in Cleveland Strikers have set up a roving patrol system that they say can muster 300 men within an hour to stop any truck moving goods in the area. The strikers are allowing trucks carrying food drugs and beer to continue but they have become outraged when they have found food trucks carrying other cargo. There has been rock throwing windshields have been smashed tires slashed and air hoses cut. The United Press reckoned that 500000 people were out of work as a result of the strike. In New York City postal workers kicked off the year with a national wildcat strike which was against federal law. Rank-and-file workers organized the strike and no mail moved in the nations’ major cities. The strike lasted eight days in New York despite the deployment of 30000 national guardsmen. In total some 200000 workers participated in the largest wildcat strike ever. New York according to the Economist became “the city of strikes.” Telephone workers struck for eight months. City workers shut down the bridges that connected the boroughs with Manhattan in what came to be known as the “drawbridge strike.” This was just the beginning. In the decade that followed — or the “long seventies” lasting from 1965 to 1981 — the United States experienced a strike wave like few others. Uniquely the ’70s strikes were often led by “restless” young workers whose grievances went far beyond the bread-and-butter disputes typical of the postwar decades. These disputes included the entire range of strikes: wildcats and sit-downs grievance strikes as well as contract rejections and contested local union elections often initiated by a rank and file. The strikes taken together were reflective of the rebellious movements of the era. The 1972 strike at the General Motors colossal plant at Lordstown Ohio was led by long-haired unshaven workers. The president of the local was Gary Bryner then twenty-nine years old. Lordstown wrote Studs Terkel “was the Woodstock of the working man.” Ed Sadlowski just thirty-four when he challenged the leadership of the United Steelworkers in District 31 (Chicago-Gary 128000 members) spoke for a generation: I consider democracy within the union to be the most important single issue. If the steelworkers had been consulted they never would have agreed to an International Executive Board which excluded blacks Latinos and women. If the steelworkers were consulted they would insist on their right to vote on union contracts in the same manner other unions do. They rightfully feel they are not running their own affairs and are not being represented on the district level. The Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) electrified black workers as well as the Left. Its origins and that of the black caucus movement that followed were in ranks of the workers recruited in the late ’60s: young black workers often Vietnam veterans with little tolerance for racist foremen. Paul Dietsch a spokesperson for the Fraternal Association of Steel Haulers (FASH) suggested that the steel haulers were the “Black Panthers of the Working Class.” Terkel called the workers’ rebellion the “new new left.” In the auto plants workers struck to “humanize working conditions”; coal miners fought for an end to chronic poverty in Appalachia; black workers demanded access integration and equality; truckers called for union democracy; UPS workers rebelled against “being treated like machines”; millions of workers clearly wanted something better in life. Black workers Latinos women and young workers brought their movements into the workplace. With their demand for democracy in their unions workers sought to make these institutions their own recalling the students’ demand for self-government or “participatory democracy.” The strikes taken together were reflective of the rebellious movements of the era. That is they fought for control of their jobs. And as their signs so often said they fought for “dignity” a central demand of course of the southern civil rights movement. Commonly they called themselves “radicals;” they were defiant and courageous advocates of direct action to change their world. Importantly they did this in the context of a general challenge to authority and they did this in the shadow of the great spectacle of radical conflict: the Tet Offensive the Paris Spring the Black Panthers Kent State Jackson State Attica.

“The Strike Movement Continued Uninterrupted” This then was not the labor movement of the 1950 and ’60s though those decades too had been at times places of workplace turmoil. Nevertheless in 1956 George Meany president of the AFL-CIO for twenty-four years (1955–79) speaking to the convention of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) reassured the delegates assembled there: I never went on strike in my life never ordered anyone else to run a strike never had anything to do with a picket line . . . there is not a great difference between the things I stand for and the things that NAM leaders stand for. I stand for the profit system. I believe in the profit system. I believe in the free enterprise system completely. In another setting Walter Reuther president of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) complained that “these hundreds of thousands of young workers . . . They don’t know where they came from. They don’t know where they’re going.” The working class that emerged in the late ’60s had been transformed by technology by demographics and by a cultural revolution. In its vanguard were teachers whose wildcat strikes had swept through districts large and small north and south and into the West in the new spirit of rebellion. They were far from alone but the sight wrote the historian David Montgomery “of school teachers hospital workers and garbage men going off to jail for violating injunctions is becoming routine. And the teachers are demonstrating that arbitrary authority is as common and as intolerable in education as it is in the factories.” Their ranks had been swollen by the great expansion of higher education in the ’60s. They with the explosion of the baby boomers argued Montgomery represented the basis of a “new unionism.” With their demand for democracy in their unions workers sought to make these institutions their own. There had been strikes in the 1950s and ’60s; some including the 1959 strike of steelworkers were massive. There were in fact many strikes certainly by today’s standards yet these were often routine affairs; picket lines were frequently token. Workers went hunting repaired the house or just had a vacation. The union officers were left to settle disputes behind closed doors in smoked-filled rooms. The trade union leaders had become increasingly wedded to collaboration with the employers in a sort of modus vivendi. The unions one-party organizations typically were led by old men or bland bureaucrats sometimes by gangsters nearly all lifers (honorable exceptions aside). They dominated the internal life of “the machines” and looked to the Democrats and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for remediation. Dave Beck the Teamsters’ leader declared that “Unions are big business.” These leaders offered peace to the employers above all on the shop floor and in return workers expected (and often got) steadily rising wages plus expanding benefit packages — improvements they could count on. In return the employers got peace — sometimes enforced by the union itself as shop stewards often appointed became policemen on the beat — and the promise of uninterrupted production in a period of high profitability. At the same time whatever the merits of this system these were restricted to a core of union members skilled workers and the inheritors of the industrial wars of the ’30s. The majority of workers were excluded — women people of color farmworkers and service workers. In truth this system sometimes referred to as the “New Deal system” never fully worked; the truce between labor and capital was always partial and temporary; it always favored the employers. In addition it was based on a steadily expanding economy of the postwar boom — the years of prosperity fueled by war and war production — which came to an end in the late-’60s crisis of profitability and the employers’ response to it. The Vietnam War too had fueled economic expansion but by the end of the ’60s its costs were sending prices soaring. The working class that emerged in the late ’60s had been transformed by technology by demographics and by a cultural revolution. In these changing conditions collaboration gave way to conflict and an employers’ offensive marked by their resistance to wage and benefit demands to stubborn opposition to organizing and perhaps above all on the “shop floor” to the speedup typified by line speed in the assembly plants and the United Parcel supervisors with their time and motion stopwatch mania. In 1971 hard-pressed by the shippers West Coast longshoremen defied the flag wavers with a strike that threatened the flow of military goods and personnel to Vietnam. Richard Nixon asserting that the strike undermined the war effort invoked an anti-strike Taft-Hartley injunction though this failed to deter longshoremen from conducting the longest waterfront strike in US history. The strike organized in opposition to the union’s leadership was the first coastwide strike since 1934. The number of strikes remained high throughout the decade — they amounted to tens of thousands and only fell off dramatically in 1982. The strike wave continued in “good” times and bad. The strike count in 1974 nearly matched that of 1970 yet it took place amid the worst recession since the 1930s clearly signaling that the postwar economic boom was over. Long lines at unemployment offices became the norm as did free food distribution in industrial centers. In addition this recession was accompanied by inflation — hence the term “stagflation” — and with it increasing pressure on workers to resist. In 1975 the economy expanded again but millions of jobs had been lost. Instability gave rise to insecurity; Merle Haggard’s 1974 “If We Make It Through December” topped the charts at Akron’s radio WSLR. In boom and bust the strike movement continued uninterrupted if unpredictably. The coal miners exemplified this — the ability of workers to win great victories yet also alas the limitations of trade unionism. On November 12 1974 negotiations stalled and 120000 miners walked off their jobs honoring their tradition of “no contract no work.” The United Mine Workers (UMWA) had long been the backbone of American labor; as the largest union in the ’30s it had bankrolled the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Its great battles were legendary — Ludlow Blair Mountain Harlan County. In the 1960s however it was a shadow of its former self. In 1950 there were 416000 working miners; in 1959 just 180000 remained at work in the coalfields. John L. Lewis the autocratic leader of the union for half the century had in the ’50s negotiated away the miners’ jobs accepting as inevitable the mechanization of mining while receiving next to nothing for miners in return. In 1963 Tony Boyle a nonentity from Montana handpicked by Lewis inherited the leadership of the union. The result was an embattled rank and file seething under the iron hand of management in the mines. Discontent was near universal in the face of the slow-motion inevitability of the deadly black lung disease and in the stunning horror of each recurrent coal mine catastrophe. In November 1968 seventy-eight miners lost their lives in the explosion at Consolidation Coal’s No. 9 mine in Farmington West Virginia. In total one hundred thousand coal miners were believed to have been killed in the mines in the twentieth century. In 1969 Jock Yablonski a union officer in Clarksville Pennsylvania challenged Boyle but lost in an election mired in fraud. Yablonski filed suit with the Department of Labor. In response Boyle had him murdered. On New Year’s Eve three petty criminals hired in a Cleveland bar shot and fatally killed Yablonski his wife and his daughter in their beds. The Miners for Democracy (MFD) was founded at the Yablonskis’ funerals. In 1972 the US district court in Washington DC responding in part to an outraged rank and file ordered a new election. Arnold Miller a partially disabled West Virginia miner running on the slate of the MFD defeated Boyle — Boyle himself would be charged and convicted of ordering the murders. In 1974 he received three life sentences. The MFD identified itself as a rank-and-file miners’ movement. It brought together the various oppositional currents within the union uniting them with a mission of not just defeating Boyle but also of transforming the union top to bottom. In 1973 in Pittsburgh the MFD led its first UMW convention. Miners there rewrote the union’s constitution guaranteeing rank-and-file rights. In an atmosphere of jubilation they increased district autonomy and reorganized the union’s dues structure in favor of the districts and the locals. The rank and file won the right to ratify contracts. Thus inspired rank-and-file miners then set out to transform formal democracy into practical democracy and coal miners embarked upon a campaign to transform relations in the mines themselves. One result was the national strike of 1974 and 1978 as well as literally thousands of wildcat strikes. The MFD would become a model for radicals and union reformers — in many ways it still is.

Industries Hit by Recession Elsewhere the impact of recession in 1974 was devastating above all in the auto industry. The recession’s origins were in large part structural and in that sense long overdue but matters were made worse by OPEC’s (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) 1973 oil embargo in response to the Arab-Israeli War. As a result the price of oil rose by 300 percent. The recession raced through US industry. Construction unemployment reached 15 percent. The auto industry was hit hardest; unemployment in the six-county Detroit area topped 20 percent. Plants were shut down in New Jersey and California in Cleveland and St. Louis. The Ford Motor Company shut down 22 of its 66 plants in the United States idling 55 percent of its hourly paid work force of 155000. The industry would never fully recover. Closures became permanent. Rolling back the clock a chorus of employers introduced demands for deep concessions from its workers. Chrysler threatened bankruptcy. UAW president Douglas Fraser responded with this prophetic retort: “I believe the leaders of business community with few exceptions have chosen to wage a one-sided class war today in this country.” Indeed they had. In 1979 the federal government stepped in to save Chrysler bailing out the company; concessions layoffs and plant closures followed. Gas prices provoked “political” walkouts in West Virginia; striking miners demanded that the governor roll back the cost of fuel complaining they could not afford the cost of their commutes to work. Then totally unexpectedly truckers — who were independent operators — emerged in an astonishing movement that challenged the Nixon administration’s energy policies. The truckers began shutting down the nation’s highways snarling traffic and disrupting the distribution of goods and services. With CB (citizen’s band) radios and “handles” to obscure their identities they formed convoys and organized slowdowns and blockades. Thousands of tractor trailers jammed the turnpikes in Ohio and Pennsylvania. They choked off the New York–Washington DC corridor at the Delaware Bridge. The truckers’ movement was a striking example of the creativity of workers and their capacity to organize and fight. Industry already hemorrhaging was hit again. Within hours GM management was forced to close its Lordstown plant. In Toledo factory workers left their jobs to join truckers at the interchange of I-75 and the Ohio Turnpike. Exhausted by gas lines a weary public applauded. The response of the authorities including the White House was fierce; state troopers hated by the truckers waded in whenever they assembled. In Ohio the National Guard was deployed and trucks were commandeered and towed away. Interestingly interviews with truckers near Cleveland invariably turned to the Kent State killings by these same guardsmen. Ultimately the blockaders failed. Their movement however was a striking example of the creativity of workers and their capacity to organize and fight — their blockages were in certain ways analogous with the sit-down strikes of another era. They took control of their workplaces: the highways. That same year in March four Service Employees International Union (SEIU) locals representing hospital clerical maintenance and social workers rejected a wage offer from San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors and struck. They were joined by teachers who honored picket lines set up at the schools. The Municipal Railway’s mostly black motormen and conductors joined in as did transit drivers. Farmworkers joined substitute teachers to shut down school bus barns. Governor Ronald Reagan threatened to send in the National Guard but the strike continued to spread. Only an early settlement by the SEIU leaders prevented a much wider strike. In August 1974 “Everywhere you turn” wrote one reporter “someone is on strike: airline mechanics bus drivers copper miners sanitation workers firemen hospital workers painters steelworkers telephone workers. The American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) voted to shut down the state of Ohio.” The miners with their new leadership struck for twenty-eight days winning a package valued above 40 percent. The rank and file accepted this though only barely — nearly half voted to stay out longer. By the middle of 1975 employment was nearly back to pre-recession levels and the workers’ insurgency remained very much alive above all in the coalfields. In the summers of 1975 1976 and 1977 there were nationwide wildcat strikes. The first was in 1975 when 80000 miners struck for the right to strike. Then in 1976 120000 (virtually the entire workforce in the East) walked out against injunctions imposed on striking miners. The extent of the solidarity of the miners was such that a single “stranger” picket could shut down an entire shift. The strikes continued into the summer of 1977 when in anticipation of a national strike 85000 miners struck. In 1976 the number of major strikes — 5648 — nearly matched that of 1970 — 5716 — though the number of strikers was not so high. In the years between 1976 and 1979 there were again strikes nearly everywhere — that is in every sector and throughout the country. The teachers in wave after wave of strikes confounded school boards local authorities and even teachers’ unions striking and winning. By the mid-1970s according to historian Michael Honey the Southern civil rights movement had spilled over into industry so that “after decades of painful effort . . . black workers in a core of unionized factory jobs had torn down most Jim Crow barriers within their workplaces and unions.” In addition “Black Power” had migrated north; in industry it represented a tactic to force both the employers and the unions to recognize the rights and demands of black workers. The companies had recruited thousands of new young workers and a large proportion of these workers were in Detroit. The majority of the new recruits worked in unskilled often dangerous jobs performing the monotonous nerve-racking tasks that led to the high turnover and absentee rates for which the auto industry was notorious. The majority of the new recruits worked in unskilled often dangerous jobs performing the monotonous nerve-racking tasks that led to the high turnover and absentee rates for which the industry was notorious. The origins of the black caucus movement were in these conditions. In the automobile industry this movement began in wildcat strikes and the development of a revolutionary union movement spearheaded by DRUM (Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement) at Chrysler’s Dodge Main plant in Detroit. Other black autoworkers followed establishing revolutionary union movements at Eldon Road (ELRUM) Ford’s River Rouge plant (FRUM); at Chrysler’s Jefferson Avenue Assembly plant (JARUM). Workers in other industries also joined in; hospital workers organized HRUM newspaper workers NEWRU United Parcel workers UPRUM together leading to the creation of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. The revolt of black workers inspired many including white workers. It did not however lead to the unity that many hoped for certainly not in the automobile industry. When black autoworkers fighting the speed-p staged sit-in strikes in the summer of 1973 in Detroit at the Jefferson Assembly Eldon Road and Mack Avenue plants they were not for the most part supported by whites a few radicals excepted. The results for tens of thousands of workers were devastating. This alliance that did not happen together with the 1974 crash in automobile production resulted in the end of the movement in auto dashing the perspectives of two generations of radicals who had banked everything on a rebellion in auto. The steel industry once dominated US industry its scale gigantic. In the Pittsburgh region alone a dozen great mills lined the banks of the Monongahela River. Nationally hundreds of thousands worked in basic steel. In the ’70s however steelworkers were losing jobs; they faced stagnant and declining real incomes and witnessed increasing numbers of plant closings. The industry and the union blamed foreign competition but just as important was overcapacity in an aging capital-intensive industry. The steel companies used the crisis to combine jobs intensify “discipline” and increase productivity at the same time replacing older facilities with new technology. In 1973 the union agreed to the Experimental Negotiating Agreement (ENA) a national no-strike pledge that exchanged the right to strike in national bargaining for cash bonuses cost-of living adjustments and widened access to arbitration. Steelworkers retained the right to strike on local issues and in 1977 there were more than one hundred strike votes compared to just seven in 1974. All this produced a rebellion within the union first and foremost in District 31 the United Steel Workers’ (USW) largest where Sadlowski defeated the incumbent for the position of district director. The steel companies used the crisis to combine jobs intensify “discipline” and increase productivity. The insurgents proposed to end the 1973 ENA; they demanded the right to ratify contracts and sought to elect a new national leadership to mobilize the rank and file. In 1975 these workers and local militants throughout the union formed Steelworkers Fight Back a national network of oppositionists. The decision was made to run Sadlowski for USW president with Fight Back as the campaign organization. The 1976–77 campaign developed a crusading spirit focusing on issues like the ENA opposition to a dues increase and the right to ratify contracts. This spirit was deepened by the fact that Sadlowski himself had been outspoken on broader social issues such as the Vietnam War and civil rights. In the end Sadlowski lost though he received 43 percent of the votes including a majority in the largest locals which were mostly in basic steel. The industry however was on the verge of a precipitous decline and the beginnings of a new brutal phase of deindustrialization; predicted by few it moved to center stage. Domestic steel production plummeted sharply following 1979 as steel corporations carried out drastic rationalizations. A full 200000 steelworkers lost their jobs. In early 1980 steelworkers in Youngstown Ohio occupied the district headquarters of U.S. Steel in a bold but desperate attempt to stave off shutting down their mill. It was hoped that the sit-in might be the spark to ignite a resistance movement. Instead to the dismay of hundreds of workers and supporters involved it was quickly abandoned on orders from the local union officers and their advisers.

The Right to Organize The major breakthrough for workers in the postwar system was winning the right to organize by local state and federal government workers and the subsequent organization of millions of these workers into trade unions. “The growth of US public sector unions” in the ’50s and ’60s was according to Mark Maier “analogous to the expansion of private sector unions during the 1930s.” Women entered the service and public-sector sections of the labor force in millions; they became the backbone of the new teachers’ movements in particular of the NEA now transformed into a union. In the 1970s public employee unions grew four times as fast as total union membership and women made up a very large proportion of these new members. The Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW) founded in 1974 in Chicago was born in a moment of great enthusiasm and embodied a potential movement to support working women and their struggles. The new union women joined office workers telephone workers nurses and health care workers garment workers and factory workers. Three thousand trade union women attended its founding convention; nearly a third in attendance were reported to be young radicals. CLUW seemed an ideal vehicle for uniting women’s liberation with a movement of working-class women one capable of speaking for the vast increase in the numbers of working women the great majority unorganized. Within two years however CLUW was essentially dead undermined by the women of the bureaucracy themselves as often as not second-class citizens in their own unions. Nevertheless for working women the struggle continued. In September 1976 in Seattle 2500 nurses were on strike a strike that lasted sixty-five days the longest nurses’ strike ever at that point reflecting according to the New York Times “the new militancy of registered nurses here and elsewhere.” The issues were wages staffing and the agency shop. But there was also an “emotional issue” according to one doctor. It used to be nurses could be yelled at and their opinions ignored . . . Now they will challenge doctors and sometimes even substitute their judgments for his . . . This is the issue of parity brought by the smart young nurses who have recently graduated and sparked by the women’s movement that is making it hard to end this strike. The service workers public-sector workers and women workers set the foundations of public-sector and service-sector unionism that are with us still today. These unions forecast the future for much of labor developing in the midst of the transition from an industrial working class to one based on the public and service sectors. They represented large numbers of women and workers of color. Two movements in the Teamsters also illustrate that the rebellion continued. In 1976 Frank Fitzsimmons Teamsters president called an official strike nationwide of truckers in the freight industry under pressure from the rank and file including the new organization Teamsters for a Decent Contract (TDC). The following October TDC became Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU). The same spring the Teamsters struck UPS in the central states this time pressured by UPSurge the organization of the UPS rank and file. The settlement in freight was met with a wildcat strike in Detroit. UPSurge responded to the UPS settlement with wildcat strikes in eight Midwestern cities. The service workers public-sector workers and women workers set the foundations of public-sector and service-sector unionism that are with us still today. In the Teamsters then the largest industrial union in the country the TDU set out to build a national rank-and-file movement within the union a corrupt union often with close ties to the mob (the gangsters who cut deals with the union’s officers national and local and sought ways to slice up the union’s highly lucrative pension fund). TDU quickly grew to a movement of thousands; its mission was to transform a powerful union into a force for progressive change. It became active in contract negotiations promoted solidarity in strikes and among jurisdictions sponsored bylaw reforms and exposed corruption and criminality. Its greatest achievement came in 1991 when it played a key role in the victory of Ron Carey the UPS workers’ leader in his successful contest for the union’s presidency. UPSurge the rank-and-file UPS workers’ organization founded in Cleveland in 1975 was allied with the TDU but differed in that it was first of all organized to fight the company. Its initial focus was preparation for the 1976 central states’ contract negotiations. UPSurge was built on an informal shop stewards network with roots in decades of militant activity. In the ’60s and ’70s there were continuous conflicts — strikes official and unofficial including in 1973 the Pittsburgh wildcat strike with roving pickets that shut down UPS operations in Western Pennsylvania and much of Ohio. In this period UPS became the largest employer of Teamsters as well as the largest transportation company in the world. It became well known even internationally for brown trucks its military-style uniforms and its ubiquitous supervisors armed with clipboards and stopwatches. In an industry still dominated by small and medium-size firms UPS became an innovator — it specialized in “Taylorism” a form of scientific management that took control of every detail in work producing in Harry Braverman’s words “the disassociation of the labor process from the skills of the worker.” UPS introduced new technologies added airfreight and brought in students and young workers as part-timers. The conflict at UPS revealed the depth of rank-and-file unrest in this country this time in a powerful national highly profitable company. The founding “convention” of UPSurge was held in Indianapolis on January 31 1976. It was astonishing; 650 UPSurgers gathered in a Holiday Inn in the eastern suburbs of the city. The meeting was part business part protest rally part celebration — and it was certainly unparalleled in UPS history. Workers came from as far as Portland Oregon and Boston Massachusetts though overwhelmingly from the central states. Ten contract demands were chosen; they focused on the following areas: part-timers appearance standards; supervisors working unsafe equipment sick days holidays and radios. The conflict at UPS revealed the depth of rank-and-file unrest in this country this time in a powerful national highly profitable company. The UPSurge steering committee was in essence a shop stewards’ movement in the classic sense; that is nearly every member was a working elected recallable shop-floor leader. In 1980 UPSurge joined forces with TDU and today UPS workers represent its single largest section — in addition they numerically dominate the Teamsters union itself. TDU remarkably has weathered the storms of more than forty years. It continues to stand out as a voice for rank-and-file Teamsters and a model for the kind of rank-and-file movement we still need.

The End of the Long Seventies In the late 1970s strikes continued to be the order of the day. The example of successful United Farm Workers (UFW) strikes and boycotts of grapes and lettuce in the ’60s was followed by strikes and consumer boycotts in clothing and textiles at the Farah Company and J. P. Stevens as well as at Coors Brewing. These boycotts involved considerable numbers of supporters and other workers as well as the general public. In September 1976 workers in the tomato fields of northeastern Ohio and cannery workers near Toledo struck and occupied the Morgan Packing Company facilities. The strikers erected barricades held off the authorities and won in a crucial early victory for the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC). FLOC was founded by former student activist Baldemar Velásquez. In Seattle 17000 Boeing machinists struck. In bitter strikes of miners at Stearns Kentucky and factory workers in Elwood Indiana strikers were beaten shot at and arrested. That same year firefighters struck in Memphis a wildcat strike as well as in Normal Illinois and Dayton Ohio. In September 1978 20000 members of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) walked off their jobs in Philadelphia. Safeway was shut down in Northern California in a bitter confrontation with Teamsters — in August a picketing striker was killed. The final conflict of the decade of rank-and file insurgency came in the 1977–78 strike in coalfields. Railroad workers in defiance of federal interventions turned an eighty-one-day dispute with the Norfolk Western into a national railroad strike. And 15000 pulp and paper workers used mass action and traveling pickets in a near general strike in the Pacific Northwest. In 1979 there was a wildcat strike of steel haulers in Youngstown. Car haulers wildcatted in Linwood New Jersey and Lordstown Ohio as well as postal workers at the Richmond California bulk mail center. Nuclear workers walked out at Goodyear’s Piketon Ohio plant. Steelworkers won recognition in the shipyards at Newport News following a two-year strike. Faculty struck at Boston University and the University of Cincinnati and again schoolteachers. There were 199 teachers’ strikes in 1979 matching the previous high in 1975–76. Teachers struck for more money reduced class size additional preparation time and in some places student discipline. Finally there was the 1979 strike of California farm workers. The final conflict of the decade of rank-and file insurgency came in the 1977–78 strike in coalfields. The strike of 160000 miners lasted 110 days continuing despite the Taft-Hartley injunction issued by President Jimmy Carter. Twice rank-and-file miners defied UMW leaders and rejected concessionary contracts. The operators wanted what miners called a “1930s-style contract” with the right to fire strikers big health deductibles and punitive absentee controls. Critics contended the union called the strike in the worst possible circumstances; there were months of coal stockpiles on the ground. Critics also insisted that the union leadership had no intention of winning the strike. Nevertheless the rank-and-file miners did and they fought the companies — all subsidiaries of giant energy corporations — to a bloody standstill. They also fought state troopers national guardsmen in Indiana and thousands of company guards and goons. Three miners were shot and killed on picket lines hundreds were arrested and thousands were fined. There was widespread sympathy for the striking miners including solidarity rallies food collections and caravans but no other union took action in their support. The miners fought alone; nevertheless they defeated the companies on many issues. Only hunger forced them back. Even then 40 percent of the miners voting rejected the settlement preferring to fight on. The miners were exhausted in 1978 but not defeated. They were not however prepared for what was to come — the wholesale removal of coal mining to the West. And the teachers again. In the ’70s teachers’ strikes were overwhelmingly called by the National Education Association (NEA). In the 1975–76 school year alone there were 203 strikes. In January 1978 when teachers struck in the Canton Ohio schools 400 were arrested including 230 in one swoop at Timken High School. These are just two examples in a history yet to be written. The NEA was already a large organization in the 1960s. Historically it was a professional organization; unlike the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) it had no ties to the organized labor movement. In the 1960s however this began to change. “Within the NEA” wrote the historian Marjorie Murphy “internal changes had made it clear that the mammoth organization was slowly but inevitably restructuring itself into a union.” In the course of the 1970s the NEA grew at a rate of nearly 100000 new members each year reaching the 2 million mark in 1980. The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) grew as well though not nearly so dramatically. The AFT was organized as a trade union and its roots were in the cities above all in New York City; it was affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Membership in the two unions came to exceed that of the Teamsters union. Both unions responded to changing conditions in the ’60s with strikes and organizing drives. The NEA however quickly outpaced its rival. In the thousands of teachers’ strikes in the ’70s perhaps as many as 80 percent were led by NEA teachers; moreover these teacher’s strikes represented a grassroots movement led locally. The NEA was highly decentralized certainly in comparison to the top-down unionism of the AFT. The NEA had another advantage. In these years of extensive teacher activity the AFT was embroiled in racial disputes — a legacy in part of its racist confrontations with black community activists in the New York teachers’ strikes of 1968. There were also conflicts with black parents in Youngstown and Newark where black activists challenged the union even when led by black teachers. In September 1975 in Boston 4950 teachers 90 percent of the workforce struck in response to a bargaining impasse — their strike also however crippled the district’s two-week-old court-ordered desegregation program. The AFT welcomed the anti-affirmative-action Bakke decision the Supreme Court ruling against racial quotas and opposed NEA policies that implemented racial and gender quotas in its governing bodies. The NEA despite its conservative origins in the era of segregated schools — it organized biracial unions in the South — supported integration and affirmative action. In 1964 it ordered that all its affiliates be integrated though in 1974 the Louisiana association remained segregated. In 1967 Elizabeth Koontz an African American classroom teacher from North Carolina became the NEA’s first black president. In 1972 when two black students at Southern University were shot and killed by police the NEA joined students and black organizations in demanding an official investigation. The NEA denounced a court ruling that would not require school authorities to readjust attendance zones to keep up with racial population shifts. When the AFT and the NEA abandoned unity talks in 1974 the reasons were numerous including simple organizational issues and the problems of professionalism the latter strongest in the NEA. But when Helen Wise president of the NEA rebutted the charge that the NEA teachers were not trade unionists she said fairly that there “are many liberals within the association who think of the AFL-CIO as too conservative.” She continued “The AFT while paying lip service to minority involvement opposed an effective way to assure it. There is no compatibility between the NEA commitment and the AFT laissez-faire attitude on this issue.” From the first the NEA enthusiastically supported the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) for women. In 1974 it won a Supreme Court case striking down mandatory leave for pregnant teachers. In addition then to aggressive organizing including the use of the strike the NEA in Murphy’s words took “bolder more progressive positions on a range of social issues.” The AFT and the AFL-CIO strongly supported the war in Vietnam — they no doubt believed that American workers did as well. This was not the case with teachers however and the AFT paid a price. Between 1970 and 1980 the NEA grew by a million members. The majority of these new members were women and many were black and Latino; tens of thousands of these new members attended university in the 1960s. At the same time according to Murphy “teachers complained about over supervision increasing bureaucratization inappropriate assignments and a lack of control over licensing training and assignments.” Out of these conflicts emerged what was soon to be the nation’s largest union — demonstrating that given the right circumstances and the willingness to act trade unions and above all progressive trade unions could still grow and succeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZW5ubGl2ZS5jb20vZm9vZC8yMDIxLzAxL25ldy1vd25lcnMtb2YteW9yay1jb3VudHktd2luZXJ5LXBsYW4tdG8ta2VlcC1hLWZhbWlseS1ydW4tYnVzaW5lc3Mtd2l0aC1hLWZhbWlseS1mcmllbmRseS1hdG1vc3BoZXJlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New owners of York County winery plan to keep 'a family-run business with a family-friendly atmosphere',"Amy Zill said that she and her husband Joe were already working on a “what’s-next plan” when they visited Thunder Ridge Vineyards near Spring Grove York County over Labor Day weekend to share some wine and pizza.

Every Friday he shares a new snap on his Instagram where he has nearly 100000 followers of a dog he has met on his travels including basset hound Elwood

His favourite pictures are those were the dog is also smiling although he doesn't have a single favourite photo (pictured with Elmore James)

He told the Bored Panda: 'I don’t think there are any challenges when it comes to taking pictures with dogs but that’s just because most of my photos are taken with puppies so it’s really hard to get into any kind of trouble with them.

'It's actually rather easy to take photos with them!'

Although he did recall that one puppy peed on him after he was trying to hold a small puppy who 'got a little bit scared'.

He has been posting the pictures on his Instagram for more than three years having started the idea after picking up a dog for fun to take a photo.

The photo received around 100 likes on Instagram despite Jason not expecting to receive any attention from it.

Also the overall sentiment got a boost after new president Joe Biden took office.

The resurgence of coronavirus cases and the deepening economic uncertainty continue to take a toll on the US labor market. Last week jobless claims stayed elevated around 900000 but it was slightly below economists’ prediction. The dismal employment scenario and continuing lay-offs show that the new president has a tough task at hand.

On the M&A front tech firms Lumentum Holdings and Coherent Inc. agreed for a merger last week. The $5.7-billion deal is expected to create one of the largest photonics and laser companies in the world. Elsewhere Boston Scientific signed a pact to acquire privately-held mobile health solutions company Preventive Solutions. In another tech buyout Cognizant agreed to acquire software company Magnetic Solutions to strengthen its digital engineering capabilities.

He argues that Covid-19 signals the end of the American era that the moral and economic failure evident in the US Covid-19 disaster will help end the post-WW2 American economic military and ideological domination of the world. Unfortunately Davis’ analysis is flawed by massive omissions and he underestimates the IT- and AI-enhanced power of the US Establishment.

Professor Wade argues in “The Unraveling of America” [1] that there once was a nicer more truthful and more altruistic America as encapsulated in the “American Dream” or indeed Canada. He argues that post-WW2 America dominated the world economically militarily and ideologically but that ever-increasing wealth disparity and state power have seriously diminished the welfare knowledge altruism and democratically expressed power of ordinary Americans. Nevertheless this essay about post-WW2 America while having an altruistic intent and a seriously humane message suffers from massive flaws of omission. According to Rolling Stone (2020): “Each year we publish tens of thousands of stories … Our most-read story of the year was an essay by anthropologist Wade Davis titled “The Unraveling of America” which ricocheted around the internet and was shared far and wide on social media and debated for months during the global Covid-19 quarantine measures” [2]. However the extraordinary popularity of this well-intentioned but highly flawed essay [2] – surely rating a Fail if written by one of Professor Davis’ students – illustrates the limits to Mainstream truth-telling in racist Corporatocracy America. Davis’ essay while forthright fails to go far enough and does not seriously challenge American cognitive dissonance over truth altruism and democracy.

Before detailed analysis of Professor Davis’ article [1] it is important to consider these 3 fundamental underlying notions of (a) Truth (b) Altruism and (c) Democracy especially as they relate to the US.

(a). Truth Spectrum on a scale of 0 to 10 . Re Truth one can perceive a Truth Spectrum on a scale of 0 (“absolute” falsehood) to 10 (“absolute” truth) in which QAnon Murdoch media the yellow press Biblical literalists and the Trumpist fantasists score about 1 (through massive  anti-science falsehood and lying by omission) the “quality” Mainstream media score about 5 (through massive censorship self-censorship lying by omission half-truths and cowardly complicity in Government lying) and progressive Alternative media score 9 (nobody is perfect in their search for truth ideological and “bubble” biases inevitably arise and they operate in a world dominated in every corner by One Percenter wealth and mendacity). Even science by Popperian definition never attains 10 because it seeks ever better models of reality. Thus science is about the gathering of accurate data and critically testing potentially falsifiable hypotheses to achieve an ever-improving estimation of “the truth”. In stark contrast the anti-science “spin” that variously dominates the Mainstream from Trumpist fantasists to the “quality” Mainstream involves selective use of asserted facts to support a partisan position [3].

In the recent US Presidential Election nearly half the Americans voting supported the incumbent Donald Trump who had uttered an estimated 25000 falsehoods or misleading statements in his 4 years as US president but had massively reduced US forces in Afghanistan [4]. His opponent avuncular and assertedly pro-Humanity Joe Biden did not stoop to outright lying but was certainly guilty like Trump of massive lying by omission about US war crimes in a swathe of Muslim countries from Libya to Afghanistan. Lying by omission is far  far worse than repugnant lying by commission because the latter at least permits public refutation and public debate [3]. Both candidates were of course fervently supportive of nuclear terrorist racist Zionist-run genocidally racist serial war criminal grossly human rights-abusing  democracy by genocide and Nazi without gas chambers Apartheid Israel. While Trump ignored international law in supporting illegal Israeli annexations Joe Biden was more circumspect and “proper”. However the Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is a fervent supporter of Apartheid Israeli criminality as revealed by this report from the progressive Israeli newspaper Haaretz: “She [Harris] also co-sponsored a Senate resolution in January 2017 criticizing President Barack Obama – in his last week in office – for abstaining in a vote on a UN Security Council resolution [UNSC Resolution 2334] condemning Israel’s [illegal] settlement policies”[5].

(b). Altruism Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) racism and war. Evolutionary biologist Professor Richard Dawkins in his book “The Selfish Gene” describes the evolution of maternal altruism and human altruism in general through (i) the selection of genetic mutations affecting behaviours favouring survival to reproductive age and (ii) the societal selection of similarly favourable ideas or “memes” such as “love thy neighbour as thyself” that enable mankind to rise above deadly non-altruistic xenophobic behaviours involving hatred of the Other [6]. Unfortunately the Agrarian Revolution of 10000 years ago set Humanity on a destructive course of city-based “civilization” involving excess food production xenophobia violent patriarchy and suppression of women [7 8]. More recently in the last 4 centuries the Enlightenment led to freedom from superstition and the positives of science and secular humanism. However the libertarian thrust of the Enlightenment gave rise to unlimited freedom of the powerful to exploit the perversion of science to create weapons of mass destruction and the neoliberal excesses that are devastating the Biosphere and now threaten mass destruction of Humanity. Nuclear weapons and climate change existentially threaten destruction of Humanity and the Biosphere [9 10] this leading one of the greatest products of the Enlightenment Stephen Hawking to declare: “We see great peril if governments and societies do not take action now to render nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further climate change” [10].

Ironically the primitive ignorant xenophobic Biblical literalist Trumpist “deplorables” have rejected truth reason and science as subverters of their “faith” but nevertheless arm themselves with most deadly small arms produced by science-based technology. Professor Walter Davis’ “Death’s Dream Kingdom. The American Psyche since 9-11” is about how sensible humans attempt to understand themselves (through earnest honest painful introspection) and others (through empathic internalizing and analysing of the suffering of others) – as compared to the psychotic “ideology-driven” simplicity of “compulsory happiness” “endless demand” “axiomatic rightness” “certainty- and guarantee-demanding” denial avoidance of empathy and introspection and violent externalizing of inner fears by both the Religious Right and contemporary Capitalist America. The racist religious right Republican (R4) Trumpists have “faith” that they are “saved”  have all the answers and have no need for honest and painful personal introspection or empathy for Others. Indeed to the R4 Trumpists the Other represent a threat to their exceptionalism nationalism salvation ideology and extraordinary cognitive dissonance . To the R4 Trumpists the Other merit hatred and destruction for perturbing and threatening their faith-based world of blind convictions [11]. In his 1967 speech “Beyond Vietnam – A Time to Break Silence” Martin Luther King declared “A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death”.

Article 25 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): “(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family including food clothing housing and medical care and necessary social services and the right to security in the event of unemployment sickness disability widowhood old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.(2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children whether born in or out of wedlock shall enjoy the same social protection” [12]. Thus Article 25 sets out a demand for social altruism that is unexceptional for Scandinavian countries but is fervently rejected as “socialism” by the merciless and ignorant R4 Trumpists. Unfortunately Article 25 of the UDHR was grossly violated in pre-Covid America through (i) greed (ii) religious perversion (that linked prosperity with Godliness) and (iii) racism. Thus for example while the civil rights movement in the 1960s lead to improvement of African American circumstances through voter registration de-Segregation of schools and greater economic possibilities in the 21st century American Apartheid (“racism is American as apple pie”) means massive Black American de-registration through felony laws massive wealth-based Segregation (Educational Apartheid) and race-based differential wealth (Black families have 5 times less wealth than White families and 27% of African-Americans live in poverty) [13].

War is the penultimate in racism and genocide is the ultimate in racism. A deeply racist America has invaded 72 countries (52 since WW2) and subverts every country on Earth [14-16]. The US has 700 bases in over 70 countries [17]. The US has overthrown a score of democratically elected government throughout the world including that of my own country Australia in 1975 [18] and that of my late wife’s country Fiji in 1987 and 2000 [19]. Steve Kangas: “The Association for Responsible Dissent estimates that by 1987 6 million people had died as a result of CIA covert operations. Former State Department official William Blum correctly calls this an “American Holocaust”” [20] (see [16] and [21]). Now “holocaust” implies a huge number of deaths whereas “genocide” is precisely defined by Article 2 of the 1948 the UN Genocide Convention as “acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group” [22]. The US has an appalling record of supporting ostensible non-state terrorism including jihadi non-state terrorism. Indeed jihadi non-state terrorists are powerful assets of the American Empire because every jihadi atrocity provides a ready excuse for US violence ranging from massive bombing to US or US Alliance invasion [23]. The US-imposed post-9/11 Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide has been associated with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence 5 million or imposed deprivation 27 million in 20 countries invaded by the US Alliance since the US Government’s 9/11 false flag atrocity [24 25]. In its “War on Terror” that is manifestly a “War on Muslims” a “War for oil” and claimed by the US Alliance to be a “War on Islamic Extremism” an utterly mendacious America has replaced or attempted to replace secular regimes with fundamentalist regimes in Afghanistan (1978) Iraq (2003) Libya (2011) and Syria (2012) [23].

(c). Democracy. Democracy is fundamentally about meeting the basic wishes of the people such as a long life a long life for offspring peace dignity shelter food modest economic security dignity and provision of good health and education services. Indeed democracy is about realization of the basic decencies set out in Article 25 of the UDHR. Under this definition the one party systems of China and Cuba are very successful democracies. Thus the pluralist Chinese economic miracle has brought 800 million Chinese out of dire and deadly poverty. Cuba has a per capita GDP ($9000) that is 7 times lower than that of the US ($65000) [26] but the under-5 infant mortality per 1000 live births is 6.5 for Cuba and 7 for the US [27]. Annual avoidable deaths from deprivation are 4 million for ostensible democracy India (“the world’s biggest democracy”) but zero for one-party China [28]. That said one hopes that China having been so successful in so many other areas will find a way to guarantee all human rights for dissidents as set out in the UDHR.

Unfortunately the much-vaunted Democracy of the West has transmuted into Kleptocracy Plutocracy Murdochracy Corporatocracy Lobbyocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big Money purchases people politicians policies public perception of reality votes more political power and more private profit. The world is dominated by neoliberalism that demands maximal freedom for the smart and advantaged to exploit the natural and human resources of the world for private profit. It is argued by expert economists that this system is very efficient with asserted “trickle down” benefiting the disadvantaged. However as argued by Professor Thomas Piketty the massive and ever-increasing wealth disparity between the One Percenters and the Rest is bad for the economy (the poor cannot afford to buy the goods and services they produce) and bad for democracy (Big Money buys votes) [29 30].

Whether in a one-party democracy like China or an ostensible two-party democracy like the US expression of the will of the people requires an informed population and effective free speech. Governments lie and in explicitly one-party states the people at least are aware of this deception. However in the ostensible 2-party democracies of the US and the West the lying is deeply entrenched and sophisticated. In their book of the same name Professors Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky described the US Mainstream media manipulation by the Deep State as “Manufacturing Consent”. Steve Kangas (1997): “Late 40s. Operation MOCKINGBIRD — The CIA begins recruiting American news organizations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. The effort is headed by Frank Wisner Allan Dulles Richard Helms and Philip Graham. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually the CIA’s media assets will include ABC NBC CBS Time Newsweek Associated Press United Press International Reuters Hearst Newspapers Scripps-Howard Copley News Service and more. By the CIA’s own admission at least 25 organizations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets” [20].

It gets worse. There is increasing recognition of governments “manufacturing dissent” for their nefarious purposes this leading to quite justified paranoia over possible Deep State manipulation of the Black Lives Matter movement and the Trumpist invasion of the Capitol. Indeed this scepticism borne of massive Government lying has led to dangerous scepticism over medical advice (some promulgated by Donald “25000 lies” Trump) about the deadliness of the Covid -19 Pandemic and the critical need for masks hand sanitizer social distancing testing contact tracing and vaccination. America is awash with falsehood this leading eminent US writer and historian Gore Vidal to assert: “Unlike most Americans who lie all the time I hate lying. And here I am surrounded with these hills [in Hollywood] full of liars — some very talented… Yeah [lying] about themselves about their beliefs about their histories. Degrees from universities — this is piled up lies… Americans are not interested in the truth about anything. They assume everybody is lying because they go out and lie everyday about the automobile they are trying to sell you…This is a country of hoax. P.T. Barnum is the god of this republic which is no longer a republic alas. It is an oligarchy and a rather vicious one” [31 32].

With this background we can turn to a detailed analysis of “The Unraveling of America” by anthropologist Professor Wade Davis. In short he fails to identify massive Elephant-in-the Room realities and solutions.

(1). Davis correctly identifies the US “cult of the individual” preventing Scandinavian-style social altruism – but fails to name politically dominant rapacious neoliberalism. Davis does not explicitly name “neoliberalism” the ruthless capitalist ideology that dominates the US and the world and seeks to maximize the freedom of the advantaged to exploit the world for private profit. However he does call out neoliberalism using other words: “The American cult of the individual denies not just community but the very idea of society. No one owes anything to anyone. All must be prepared to fight for everything: education shelter food medical care. What every prosperous and successful democracy deems to be fundamental rights — universal health care equal access to quality public education a social safety net for the weak elderly and infirmed — America dismisses as socialist indulgences as if so many signs of weakness” [1]. Davis makes no mention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that in Article 25 (as set out in (b) above) sets out these fundamental expectations for Humanity (what Economics Noble Laureate Professor Amartya Sen described in relation to avoidable man-made famines as “entitlement”).

The alternative to deadly neoliberalism is social humanism (social democracy social altruism socialism eco-socialism human rights-cognizant communism the welfare state universal basic income) that seeks to maximize happiness opportunity and dignity for everyone through evolving culturally cognizant intra-national and international social contracts [33-38]. Unfortunately “socialism” is a dirty word in neoliberal America notwithstanding the resurrection efforts of Bernie Sanders and the success of the conservative and capitalist Scandinavian welfare states. Davis: “Danes earn roughly the same after-tax income as Americans while working 20 percent less. They pay in taxes an extra 19 cents for every dollar earned. But in return they get free health care free education from pre-school through university and the opportunity to prosper in a thriving free-market economy with dramatically lower levels of poverty homelessness crime and inequality. The average worker is paid better treated more respectfully and rewarded with life insurance pension plans maternity leave and six weeks of paid vacation a year. All of these benefits only inspire Danes to work harder with fully 80 percent of men and women aged 16 to 64 engaged in the labor force a figure far higher than that of the United States. American politicians dismiss the Scandinavian model as creeping socialism communism lite something that would never work in the United States. In truth social democracies are successful precisely because they foment dynamic capitalist economies that just happen to benefit every tier of society” [1].

(2). Davis correctly identifies Trump’s failure to protect America from the Covid-19 pandemic – but fails to specify the extent of the failure relative to the few highly successful countries. Davis merely states (August 2020) “COVID-19 killed 100000 Americans in four months” [1]. Davis ignores the reality that many rich European countries had the same Covid-19 inaction policies as the US with comparable deadly consequences. Put simply the US Canada and other Western European countries deliberately adopted policies of putting “livelihoods” before “lives” with consequential huge “Covid-19 deaths per million of population” as follows (24 January 2021): 85 (Iceland) 100 (Norway) 339 (Denmark) 472 (Apartheid Israel) 500 (Canada) 528 (Greenland) 541 (Greece) 565 (Malta) 593 (Ireland) 626 (Germany) 787 (Netherlands) 818 (Austria) 893 (Luxembourg) 1001 (Portugal) 1041 (Switzerland) 1086 (Sweden) 1115 (France) 1186 (Spain) 1241 (Andorra) 1234 (Hungary) 1288 (US) 1362 (Liechtenstein) 1410 (Italy) 1429 (UK) and 1784 (Belgium). In stark contrast “Covid-19 deaths per million of population” values are 0.3 (Taiwan) 0.4 (Vietnam) 3 (China) 5 (New Zealand) 5 (Singapore) 22 (Hong Kong) 26 (South Korea) 35 (Australia) and 39 (Japan) [39].

Contrary to Davis’ implication of exceptional US failure Covid-19-wise the US has performed a bit better than Liechtenstein Italy the UK and Belgium although it was worse than other Western European countries or US-backed Apartheid Israel. Nevertheless the US did an astonishingly 3220 times worse than poor Vietnam that it had genocidally devastated for 30 years after WW2 [28]. One can argue that it would be “fairer” to compare the US performance with that of New Zealand that is culturally very similar to the US and a member of the Anglosphere 5-eyes intelligence-sharing Club (the US UK Canada Australia and New Zealand) – as of 24 January 2021 America has performed a shocking 258 times worse than New Zealand.

The leaders of Canada the UK and the US in particular should face the International Criminal Court (ICC) for depraved indifference and mass murder in causing avoidable Covid-19 deaths now totalling about 19000 97000 and 428000 in their respective countries (as of 24 January 2021). It gets worse. 95% of American Covid-19 deaths have been 50 years and older and there is a similar differential vulnerability of older people in the UK and Australia [40]. Not mentioned by Davis is that the Covid-19 pandemic has been associated with avoidable mass death of older people. The leaders of Canada the UK and the US in particular should be arraigned before the ICC for the deliberate intentional mass murder of their older people (Gerocide). [40].

(3). Davis’ extraordinary take on the Covid-19 tragedy is that it has primarily damaged America’s reputation – but American mendacity racism militarism and genocidal violence has been apparent for 245 years. Davis: “COVID’s historic significance lies not in what it implies for our daily lives… Unsettling as these [economic] transitions and circumstances will be short of a complete economic collapse none stands out as a turning point in history. But what surely does is the absolutely devastating impact that the pandemic has had on the reputation and international standing of the United States of America… In a dark season of pestilence COVID has reduced to tatters the illusion of American exceptionalism. At the height of the crisis with more than 2000 dying each day Americans found themselves members of a failed state ruled by a dysfunctional and incompetent government largely responsible for death rates that added a tragic coda to America’s claim to supremacy in the world” [1].

As set out above Covid-19-wise the US has performed a bit better than Liechtenstein the UK Italy and Belgium although it was 1.0 -15.2 times worse than other Western European countries. Apart from having more Nobel Laureates than other countries America did not have much of a “reputation and international standing” to be damaged after 245 years of a trifecta of mendacity racism and genocidal violence. The American Revolution of 1776 well illustrates this trifecta: thus American school children are still taught that 1776 was about freedom liberty and “no taxation without representation” but the horrible reality was that it permitted the 13 colonies to expand genocidally westward into Indian territory – by the 1840s Indigenous Americans were being totally eliminated from east of the Mississippi [28]. The US has invaded 72 countries (52 since WW2) has been at war for 94% of its existence and has been a serial violator of the UN Genocide Convention and the Fourth Geneva Convention. The US is the world’s leading nuclear terrorist state and the only state to have used nuclear weapons to destroy cities and hundreds of thousands of civilians. Yet these endless continuing atrocities are ignored or described as “defending American democracy” and at best as “mistakes”. Mendacity and genocide are as American as apple pie.

Indeed Davis describes US post-WW2 militarism and devastating violence thus: ”But [post-WW2] freedom and affluence came with a price. The United States virtually a demilitarized nation on the eve of the Second World War never stood down in the wake of victory. To this day American troops are deployed in 150 countries. Since the 1970s China has not once gone to war; the U.S. has not spent a day at peace. President Jimmy Carter recently noted that in its 242-year history America has enjoyed only 16 years of peace making it as he wrote “the most warlike nation in the history of the world”. Since 2001 the U.S. has spent over $6 trillion on military operations and war money that might have been invested in the infrastructure of home” [1]. However in the American tradition of horror-hiding mendacity there is no mention of the 7 countries subject to continuing deadly war criminal and Australia-assisted US drone attacks in recent years under relative peacenik Trump  namely Libya Somalia Yemen Syria Iraq Afghanistan and Pakistan.

War is the penultimate in racism and genocidal war is the ultimate in racism. Former Vice President Mike Pence correctly stated: “I’m proud to say with just a few days left in this administration this is the first administration in decades not to get America into a new war” [41]. Davis failed to point out this singular achievement of the otherwise deservedly much maligned Trump administration. Newly-elected Biden talks of re-joining the international community after 4 years of Trump isolationism. Indeed under Biden America is rejoining the WHO the Paris Climate Agreement and the anti-nuclear pact with Iran unilaterally left by Trump. However Joe “Mr Nice Guy” Biden has an appalling record of complicity in the US-imposed post-9/11 Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide (32 million Muslim deaths from violence 5 million or imposed deprivation 27 million in 20 countries invaded by the US Alliance since the US Government’s 9/11 false flag atrocity) [24]. African- and Indian-origin Vice President Kamala Harris has an appalling record of supporting nuclear terrorist genocidally-racist Apartheid Israel. Indeed she co-sponsored legislation criticizing Obama for his abstention from the otherwise unanimously supported UNSC Resolution 2334 that condemned Apartheid Israel for its crimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territories [5]. It is sensibly speculated that Biden’s search for “national unity” will be satisfied by a new war [42]. Which country will Biden invade next? I would not like to be a Libyan Somalian Yemeni Palestinian Lebanese Syrian Iraqi or Iranian at this moment in history.

(4). Covid deaths aside Davis understates the deadly domestic consequences of the American “cult of the individual” – but fails to document the ongoing American Holocaust of 1.5 million annual American preventable deaths. Davis mentions obesity gun deaths and homicide as serious afflictions of American society but fails to mention the appalling reality of 1.5 million American preventable deaths annually from “lifestyle choice” or “political choice” reasons . The updated breakdown of this appalling annual American Holocaust is as follows (preventable deaths in brackets; there are some overlaps): (1). Adverse hospital events (440000)[43]. (2). Smoking (420000) [44].(3). Accidents (147000) [45]. (4). Obesity (76000) [45]. (5). Alcohol (73000) [46]. (6). Drug overdose (69000) [47].(7). Air pollution (60000) [48]. (8). Influenza and pneumonia (57000) [45]. (9). Lack of health insurance (45000) [49]. (10). Suicide (44000) [45]. (11). Preventable under-5 infant deaths from comparing US and Singapore data (20000) [27]. (12). Homicide (19000) [51 52]. (13). Guns (15000) [45]. (14). Jihadi-caused deaths in America post-9/11 annual average (4) [53-58].

Davis correctly declares that “Since 2001 the U.S. has spent over $6 trillion on military operations and war money that might have been invested in the infrastructure of home” [1]. However Davis ignores not only the 1.5 million annual American preventable deaths (29 million since 9/11) but also the 32 million Muslims killed by violence (5 million) or imposed deprivation (27 million) in 20 countries invaded by the US Alliance since the US Government’s 9/11 false flag atrocity [24 25]. Racism is as American as apple pie and in the last 2 decades a deeply racist America has committed trillions of dollars to killing over 30 million Muslims abroad instead of trying to keep about 30 million Americans alive at home.

(5). Covid-19 is serious deadly and certainly warrants rigorous and sustained Lockdown and other draconian anti-Covid-19 measures for suppression – but Davis absurdly ignores other massively deadly threats to Humanity. Imperial College scientists (26 March 2020): “We estimate that in the absence of interventions COVID-19 would have resulted in 7.0 billion infections and 40 million deaths globally this year. Mitigation strategies focussing on shielding the elderly (60% reduction in social contacts) and slowing but not interrupting transmission (40% reduction in social contacts for wider population) could reduce this burden by half saving 20 million lives but we predict that even in this scenario health systems in all countries will be quickly overwhelmed” [59]. 10 months later as of 24 January 2021 globally there have been about 99 million cases 71 million recoveries 26 million ongoing illnesses and 2.1 million deaths [39] i.e. the measures taken globally while differing markedly in effectiveness have saved scores of millions of lives. By way of comparison Johns Hopkins Medicine states: “The World Health Organization estimates that 290000 to 650000 people die of flu-related causes every year worldwide” [60].

Davis comments: “Pandemics and plagues have a way of shifting the course of history and not always in a manner immediately evident to the survivors. In the 14th Century the Black Death killed close to half of Europe’s population. A scarcity of labor led to increased wages” [1]. However he surprisingly fails to mention the 1918-1919 global influenza epidemic at the end of WW1 that originated in the US was spread by travelling soldiers and killed 50-100 million people [28]. A team of WHO-appointed experts is presently in China investigating the origin of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Davis in his “North American bubble” also ignores the horrible realities that air pollution kills 9 million people each year [61] that 15 million people die avoidably from deprivation each year in an ongoing Global Avoidable Mortality Holocaust [28] and that in the absence of requisite action a worsening Climate Genocide is set to kill 10 billion people en route to a sustainable global population of only 1 billion in 2100 [57 58 62 63].

In an article about Covid-19 and global altruism  I wrote with Professor Richard Hil (2019): “The world has responded to the threat of the pandemic with a drastic economic lockdown and other preventative measures that will cost an estimated $4500 billion annually (mostly spent in richer nations) whereas each year a comparatively modest $250 billion is spent on trying to prevent starvation in ‘developing countries’ along with $167 billion on alleviating deprivation $165 billion to reduce the mortality rate in children aged under five and a mere $3.6 billion to reduce malaria deaths. Clearly richer more powerful nations are vastly more altruistic towards COVID-19 sufferers than they are towards people threatened with premature death from preventable causes in poorer parts of the world” [64].

Davis comments thus on global threats and altruism: “How can the rest of the world expect America to lead on global threats — climate change the extinction crisis pandemics — when the country no longer has a sense of benign purpose or collective well-being even within its own national community? Flag-wrapped patriotism is no substitute for compassion; anger and hostility no match for love” [1]. However he ignores the substance of these threats and totally ignores one of the 2 key existential threats to Humanity namely nuclear weapons. A nuclear winter from a nuclear exchange that could happen at any moment would wipe out most of Humanity and the Biosphere [9]. Climate change inaction threatens mass destruction of Humanity and the Living Planet [62 63]. Also ignored by Davis in his “North American bubble” is the existential threat of deadly poverty to the billions in the Developing World (minus China) this horrendous deprivation killing 15 million people each year [28].

(6). Davis commendably reports the worsening conditions of ordinary Americans and of Black Americans – but Davis fails to provide solutions except for emergency responses to Covid-19 and being “nicer”. Davis laudably sets out the appalling socio-economic differentials between Black and White Americans (for a cogent summary of these differentials see [65]). Davis ambiguously asserts in relation to Covid-19 deaths that Black Americans are dying at 3 times the rate of White Americans (the UK Guardian reports a 2-fold difference) [66]. Davis presents the following shocking statistics: “Today the base pay of those at the top is commonly 400 times that of their salaried staff with many earning orders of magnitude more in stock options and perks. The elite one percent of Americans control $30 trillion of assets while the bottom half have more debt than assets. The three richest Americans have more money than the poorest 160 million of their countrymen. Fully a fifth of American households have zero or negative net worth a figure that rises to 37 percent for black families. The median wealth of black households is a tenth that of whites. The vast majority of Americans — white black and brown — are two paychecks removed from bankruptcy. Though living in a nation that celebrates itself as the wealthiest in history most Americans live on a high wire with no safety net to brace a fall. With the COVID crisis 40 million Americans lost their jobs and 3.3 million businesses shut down including 41 percent of all black-owned enterprises” [1].

However all that Davis can recommend is a WW2-style emergency economic response to the Covid disaster and greater social altruism but without fundamental systemic change. There needs to be a radical change in America but as the recent presidential election showed that is not going to happen – America swapped a mendacious bullying ultra-nationalist and far right but anti-war leader for a gentlemanly consensual politically correct racist (PC racist) and right-wing warmonger and serial war criminal. Americans will embrace mass murder of foreigners with great enthusiasm but even humble proposals for a modest wealth tax on the rich or getting the rich to actually pay tax fatally offend the neoliberal American Dream that any Joe can become a Henry Ford or a Bill Gates.

(7). Davis praises Canada as a beacon of societal decency in North America – but he ignores Canadian failure in the Covid Pandemic and Canadian complicity in US nuclear terrorism war crimes climate criminality and support for nuclear terrorist Apartheid Israel. Davis asserts: “Over the last months a quip has circulated on the internet suggesting that to live in Canada today is like owning an apartment above a meth lab. Canada is no perfect place but it has handled the COVID crisis well notably in British Columbia where I live. … Canada performed well during the COVID crisis because of our social contract the bonds of community the trust for each other and our institutions our health care system in particular with hospitals that cater to the medical needs of the collective not the individual and certainly not the private investor who views every hospital bed as if a rental property” [1]. However as set out in section (2) above in terms of “Covid-19 deaths per million of population” rich Canada while doing 2.6 times better than the US did 1250 times worse than poor Vietnam 1667 times worse than Taiwan and 100 times worse than its cousin Anglosphere country New Zealand. Justin Trudeau like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson should be arraigned before the International Criminal Court for the intentional  passive mass murder of elderly citizens (Gerocide) [40].

At an individual level in my limited experience Canadians are an exceptionally nice and friendly lot. Indeed civilized Australians on encountering civilized North Americans and if they haven’t picked up on the Canadian “oot” for “out” will inquire whether they are Canadians. Indeed a very nice Canadian gave me a book “A War Against Truth “ by Canadian journalist and war correspondent Paul William Roberts who recounts encountering an angry Iraqi in smouldering Baghdad who is going to shoot him for the destruction of his city but relents and apologizes when Roberts explains that he is a Canadian. However Canada as a US lackey is intimately connected with the 2 major existential threats to Humanity and the Biosphere namely nuclear weapons and man-made climate change. One of the world’ greatest minds Professor Stephen Hawking has expertly stated the problem very succinctly: “We see great peril if governments and societies do not take action now to render nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further climate change” [10]. Canadians have been and still are intimately connected with American nuclear terrorism [9 67]. Canada enthusiastically supported the Keystone “Alberta oil to Texas” pipeline that was rejected by Obama enthusiastically approved by climate change denialist Trump and is now set to be cancelled by Biden. Leading climate scientist Professor James Hansen (Columbia) declared that Keystone meant “game over for the climate” [68]. For a cogent monstering of Davis’ assertions about Canada in general and Vancouver in particular (and notably high Vancouver property prices) see the review by Deanna Kreisel [69].

Assertedly “nice” “democratic” and “politically correct” Canada ranks third in the world after the US and thence US lackey Australia as a fervent supporter of nuclear terrorist racist Zionist-run genocidally racist serial invader serial war criminal grossly human rights abusing child abusing mother abusing democracy-by-genocide Apartheid Israel. However this may finally be changing under weight of decent international opinion and genocidal Apartheid Israeli criminality. Thus the Zionist JNS indignantly reported that Canada had departed from decades of blindly supporting Apartheid Israel by voting for a December 2020 UNGA motion “denouncing Israel’s presence in [East] Jerusalem characterizing it as “Occupied Palestinian Territory”… [the vote] passed 167-5 with 11 abstentions” [70]. The UNGA Resolution (A/C.3/75/L.45) stated: “The General Assembly… Affirming the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders 1.Reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination including the right to their independent State of Palestine; 2.Urges all States and the specialized agencies and organizations of the United Nations system to continue to support and assist the Palestinian people in the early realization of their right to self-determination” [69]. 168 countries (including Canada) voted Yes 10 countries abstained (Australia Cameroon Cote D’Ivoire Guatemala Honduras Kiribati Palau South Sudan Togo and Tonga) and 5 voted No (Apartheid Israel Marshall Islands Micronesia Nauru and the US) [71 72]. One swallow doesn’t make a summer and Canada remains unforgivably soiled by its support for Apartheid Israel and hence for the UN-condemned crime of Apartheid [].

America and Canada like Australia the UK and the EU are hardly beacons of democracy as they continue to fervently support genocidally racist democracy-by-genocide Apartheid Israel. Politicians who support Apartheid Israel and hence Apartheid are unfit for public life in any one-person-one-vote democracy. Yet Biden/Harris: “Vice President Joe Biden has consistently made solidarity with Israel combatting anti-Semitism and fighting for social justice pillars of his decades-long career in public service. As President Joe Biden will continue to ensure that the Jewish State the Jewish people and Jewish values have the unbreakable support of the United States… Firmly reject the BDS movement — which singles out Israel and too often veers into anti-Semitism — and fight other efforts to delegitimize Israel on the global stage” [73].

In falely smearing BDS as “anti-Semitic” Biden is smearing a large body of anti-racist Jewish and non-Jewish humanitarians throughout the world who are utterly opposed to Apartheid Israel and its ongoing Palestinian Genocide [74]. And it is not just Apartheid but genocidally racist Zionism and all its appalling crimes that leave pro-Apartheid Israel America utterly soiled and morally compromised. Zionism is genocidal racism. Zionism is Nazism without gas chambers. The Zionists and their evil supporters are the worst anti-Semites in the world – anti-Arab anti-Semitic through support for the Palestinian Genocide the Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide [24 57 58] and anti-Jewish anti-Semitic by horribly defaming anti-racist Jews opposed to Apartheid Israeli crimes [74-80] and by utterly falsely conflating Apartheid Israel and its crimes with all Jews. Anti-racist Jewish humanitarians cry “Not in our name!” [74-80]. Voters in Zionist-dominated neoliberal America have a “choice” between Evangelical and Pentecostal Racist Religious Right Republican (R4) Trumpist Christian Zionists versus racist Jewish Zionist-dominated One Percenter-controlled Democrats in what is an effective One-Party Zionist American political system from an anti-racist Jewish perspect

Final comments.

There is a lot wrong with America as correctly set out by Professor Davis. However as I have argued in this essay Davis has ignored a veritable Herd of Elephants in the Room and on that basis his effort must rank somewhere about 5 on the 0-10 Truth Spectrum together with “quality” media such as the New York Times and the Washington Pos

The horrendous Covid-19 deaths in America now total over 427000 and things are set to get even worse before the presently slow mass vaccination begins to negatively impact infection and deaths [39]. America will retain its ruthless capitalist model with the social safety net set much lower than in social democracies like the Scandinavian countries. The closest America has got to considering Scandinavian–style social democracy was the unsuccessful tilt for presidential office by self-styled “socialist” and oxymoronically “liberal Zionist” Bernie Sanders.

A major obstacle to social democracy in the US are (a) entrenched ignorance primitive superstition and denial (b) the entrenched power of the vastly disproportionately wealthy neoliberal One Percenters and (c) racism exceptionalism “every man for himself” and rejection of “love thy neighbour as thyself”. The American system is based on self-reliance and capitalism with massive Government intervention (but without systemic change) when system failure causes unacceptable suffering as with the Depression countered with the Keynesian New Deal and presently with the hoped for Biden Federal action to overcome the Covid-19 devastation of American jobs and lives.

It is not just the Covid-19 Pandemic but also the worsening Climate Crisis Climate Genocide and Biodiversity loss that demand a radical global new deal. There must be an urgent global change to a sustainable and humane order to avoid devastation. America made a great ideological contribution with “All men are created equal and have an inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness” that in turn stemmed from the wonderful Palestinian humanitarian Jesus’ “Love thy neighbour as thyself” and “ Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”.

As perceived by some writers most notably by the great Indian writer Arundhati Roy the Covid -19 Pandemic should be used as an opportunity for re-booting the world in a humane equitable and sustainable way summarized by the term Green New Deal. Unfortunately the billionaires are evidently already achieving the opposite with huge increases in their wealth to $10.2 trillion during the pandemic as opposed to massive losses being borne by the rest of Humanity [81]. The One Percenters running the world are evidently taking advantage of the Covid-19 Pandemic with a massive wealth transfer from and a massive debt transfer to the rest of us [82 83].

Professor Dabo Guan (School of International Development University of East Anglia UK) has commented thus on inescapable limits to growth (2016): “For everyone in the world to have an American lifestyle we would need seven planets and three to live as Europeans” [84]. The world is presently operating at a “2 planet” level of consumption – there must be negative carbon pollution (atmospheric CO 2 draw-down from the present 415 ppm CO 2 to a safe and sustainable 300 ppm CO 2 ) negative population growth (population decline by about 50%) and a corresponding negative economic growth (degrowth) of about 50% (to be mainly borne by rich Developed Countries) to halt and reverse this worsening disaster brought about by thoughtless neoliberal greed [85]. This sustainability crisis must impel adoption of the moral imperative that “all people are created equal”. Our present circumstances of existentially-threatening greed and gross inequity are intolerable.

The climate emergency and attendant resource use limitations mean rejection of terracidal neoliberalism and global adoption of social humanism involving sustainably maximizing the happiness opportunity and dignity of everyone. Exceptionalist America like all other countries will have to submit to this humane survival agenda on Spaceship Earth. A key immediate institutional vehicle for this urgent change would be a one-person-one-vote-elected Third Chamber of World Government that would deal exclusively with economic and sustainability issues. Radical global change is required – just being “nicer” will be grossly insufficient.

Inspirando a través del ejemplo

Siendo la sexta de siete hermanos Ángela María Romero reconoce que viene del seno de una familia humilde en el que ejemplo de su madre fue vital forjando en ella la perseverancia y el trabajo incansable.

“Mi madre que en paz descanse era un roble. No tuvo educación formal y no trabajaba. Recuerdo que mi padre se fue de la casa cuando yo tenía 8 años y a pesar de eso ella nunca dejó de ser una guerrera. Nunca nos faltó nada y eso me forjó como profesional mujer emprendedora y líder” dijo Romero quien reconoce que no se derrumba con nada sin importar la adversidad que se presente.

“Me he mantenido en pie a pesar de todos los obstáculos: pandemia problemas de envíos proveedores. Siempre le digo a mi equipo que nosotros seguimos de pie y ese es su ejemplo y el pasado año a pesar de la crisis crecimos más de un 100 por ciento. Por eso les digo a las mujeres que nunca dejen de soñar de creer de luchar y buscar la independencia financiera tan necesaria para consolidar el amor propio y un camino exitoso de vida” finalizó.

Seúl 24 de enero (Yonhap) -- Hyundai Motor Co. y su empresa hermana Kia Corp. han registrado caídas en sus tres principales mercados el año pasado en medio de la pandemia del nuevo coronavirus mostraron este domingo datos de las compañías.

Hyundai y Kia los mayores fabricantes de vehículos de Corea del Sur presenciaron una disminución de sus ventas en Estados Unidos Europa y China en 2020 a medida que la pandemia del COVID-19 afectó la producción y ventas de automóviles.

Entre los tres mercados las compañías tuvieron el peor desempeño en China con un declive de sus ventas combinadas del 269 por ciento interanual a 664.744 unidades el año pasado según sus datos de ventas.

Hyundai y Kia han sufrido ventas decrecientes en el mayor mercado de automóviles del mundo desde 2017 cuando Seúl y Pekín tuvieron una disputa sobre el despliegue de un sistema antimisiles estadounidense llamado el Sistema de Defensa Terminal de Área a Gran Altitud (THAAD según sus siglas en inglés) en Corea del Sur en 2017.

En Europa sus ventas cayeron un 21 por ciento interanual a 106 millones de unidades el año pasado mientras que sus ventas en EE. UU. bajaron un 76 por ciento interanual a 122 millones de unidades.

Hyundai y Kia se desempeñaron mejor que sus rivales en EE. UU. el mercado más importante a nivel global el año pasado gracias a las sólidas ventas de modelos como los vehículos utilitarios deportivos (SUV) Palisade de Hyundai y Telluride de Kia.

La mejorada mezcla de productos e incentivos reducidos también ayudaron a que las compañías surcoreanas tuvieran mejores resultados relativos en EE. UU.

Las cifras de las ventas de Hundai incluyeron el número de modelos vendidos bajo su marca independiente Genesis. Hyundai actualmente vende los sedanes G70 G80 y G90 y el SUV GV80 de Genesis en los mercados globales.

Para todo 2020 las ventas globales de Hyundai cayeron un 15 por ciento a 374 millones de unidades frente a los 443 millones del año previo mientras que las de Kia sufrieron un declive del 59 por ciento a 261 millones frente a los 277 millones de 2019.

Hyundai y Kia pretenden vender un total de 708 unidades este año lo que supone un 12 por ciento más que sus ventas de 635 millones de unidades el año pasado.

Para conseguirlo planean enfocarse en promover vehículos recreativos y lanzar modelos más adaptados a su zona de venta para atraer a los clientes de los principales mercados.

Los comerciantes del tianguis que se instala todos los domingos en las calles de España y Nicolás Regules en la colonia Moderna cuidan que en todos los ingresos operen los filtros sanitarios para prevenir contagios por covid-19.

Este domingo se observó que la mayoría de clientes usaron el cubrebocas y aceptaron colocarse gel antibacterial. Los tianguistas advierten que prefieren pagarles un sueldo a personas para que vigilen las medidas sanitarias de los visitantes antes de que se vuelva a suspender su actividad.

Aurora Lara Ramos quien vende gorditas de diversos guisados en el tianguis de la colonia Moderna explicó que ella solo vende los domingos por lo que de cerrarse de nuevo los fines de semana los tianguis afectaría sus ingresos económicos.

“Estas dos semanas han estado muy bajas las ventas. Ahorita ya no sabe uno ni que hacer porque nos retiraron tres domingos sin trabajar y no es justo porque nosotros nos mantenemos de aquí. Nosotros calculamos que las ventas han bajado 30 % es muchísimo. La mayoría sí usamos cubrebocas. En la esquina tenemos unas muchachas dando gel para que haya un protocolo más limpio. Nosotros le pagamos 20 pesos y se le junta un pago de 250 pesos para estar más seguros pues” expresó.

Por su parte Felipe propietario de la cremería “Puente Grande” relató que desde hace 17 años vende en los tianguis y nunca habían tenido ventas tan bajas. Lo que más les ha afectado en las ventas es que los clientes de la tercera edad han dejado de ir al tianguis.

“Ha bajado mucho la venta porque la mayoría de las personas grandes se quedan en casa. Creo que han bajado 40 % las ventas. Si volvieran a cerrar los tianguis tenemos que acatar lo que diga el gobierno. Nosotros estamos aquí esperando lo que ellos digan” advirtió.

Érika Velázquez es una de las personas que colocaba gel antibacterial y tomaba la temperatura a los clientes. Dijo que algunas personas no acatan las reglas.

“Yo a las personas en cuanto llegan les tomó su temperatura y les doy gel y aparte les comento del uso del cubrebocas. Muchas personas no hacen caso pero yo se los dejo a su criterio pero mi trabajo es decirles a todos que se coloquen su cubrebocas y los que lo traen abajo se lo coloquen bien y los que no cada quien que tome sus precauciones. Hay unos que me dicen ‘no es obligatorio’ pero los demás sí sí están colaborando bien con su gel y todo” manifestó.

Este fin de semana el Ayuntamiento de Guadalajara informó que en los 90 tianguis de la ciudad se colocaron filtros sanitarios en donde se han aplicado 138 apercibimientos y se suspendió a 32 comerciantes que no cumplieron con las medidas establecidas.

Añadió que el área de Inspección y Vigilancia hizo tres mil visitas a negocios con saldo de seis clausuras: tres a bares una franquicia de hamburguesas un negocio de venta de alitas y otro comercio con venta de cerveza. Además se aplicaron cinco multas.

En el centro histórico se colocaron 21 filtros sanitarios dada la gran cantidad de personas que acudieron a realizar compras.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYXMuY29tL2RpYXJpb2FzLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvYWN0dWFsaWRhZC8xNjExNDE5MDEzXzUwNDQ1MC5odG1s0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9hcy5jb20vZGlhcmlvYXMvMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9hY3R1YWxpZGFkLzE2MTE0MTkwMTNfNTA0NDUwLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,El nuevo artículo electrónico de Lidl que arrasa en ventas,"La cadena alemana de supermercados Lidl tiene en su catálogo de artículos electrónicos uno de sus grandes filones de ventas. En él se pueden encontrar una numerosa variedad de artículos dentro de la categoría de bazar. Ahora se ha puesto en el mercado un producto muy de moda: los auriculares bluetooth.

Tienen notables semejanzas con los AirPods el popular modelo de Apple. Incluyen un estuche cargador que permite llenar su batería en cualquier lugar hasta 5 veces. Además esta funda también se puede cargar de forma inalámbrica utilizando alfombrillas compatibles. Cuestan 1999 euros y actualmente se encuentran agotados para poder adquirirlos de forma online.

Asimismo disponen de un mando integrado para controlar las llamadas que se reciban o la música que se escuche. Incluyen un cable de carga USB para el estuche cargador y tienen garantía de 3 años. Llevan integradas baterías de polímero de litio y los auriculares destacan por su escaso peso: 37 gramos.

Gran repercusión

Una muestra de la notable acogida que suelen tener los productos electrónicos de Lidl es su robot de cocina 'Monsieur Cuisine Connect' de la marca Silvercrest. Precisamente su similitud con el comercializado por Thermomix ha provocado que Lidl tenga que indemnizar a la citada compañía al infringir los derechos de patente según el Juzgado Mercantil 5 de Barcelona.

Así tendrá que retirar del mercado todos los ejemplares del robot de cocina que se encuentren en los supermercados y distribuidores. Igualmente deberá eliminar los documentos comerciales material publicitario y promocional en los que se reproduzca el citado producto incluido Internet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlvY3ViYW5vLmluZm8vcGFub3JhbWEvdmVudGEtZGUtcGFuLWVuLWxhLWhhYmFuYS1jb250cm9sLXNvYnJlLWxhLWhhcmluYS15LWxhLWNhbnRpZGFkLWRlLXBhbi1xdWUtcG9kcmEtY29tZXJjaWFsaXphcnNlL9IBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlvY3ViYW5vLmluZm8vcGFub3JhbWEvdmVudGEtZGUtcGFuLWVuLWxhLWhhYmFuYS1jb250cm9sLXNvYnJlLWxhLWhhcmluYS15LWxhLWNhbnRpZGFkLWRlLXBhbi1xdWUtcG9kcmEtY29tZXJjaWFsaXphcnNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Venta de pan en La Habana: control sobre la harina y la cantidad de pan que podrá comercializarse,"El Consejo de Defensa Provincial (CDP) de La Habana abordó este viernes 22 de enero las insatisfacciones relacionadas con la calidad y el volumen de la oferta de pan según informa la Agencia Cubana de Noticias.

El jefe del subgrupo de Alimentación del Gobierno de La Habana Julio Martínez explicó que entre las medidas fundamentales que se tomarán está “informar y controlar en cada panadería cuánta harina se debe procesar en un día y cuántas unidades rinde esa cantidad.”

En este sentido la directora de la Empresa Provincial de la Industria Alimentaria Abdelin González Mesa señaló que en cada uno de los 250 mostradores donde se vende el producto de forma liberada se publicará el listado de panes previstos a comercializar en la jornada así como la cantidad que puede ser adquirida por una persona.

Se comunicó además que se le prestará atención no solo al pan sino a otros derivados como las bases de pizza y los dulces. El objetivo es que cada panadería en La Habana cuente diariamente con –al menos– cuatro variedades.

Otras de las medidas anunciadas son:

El 50 % correspondiente al plan liberado se venderá en unidades de 50 gramos “para alcanzar mayor presencia a un precio de cinco por cuatro pesos (80 centavos cada uno)”.

Dado el cierre de los centros educativos el pan destinado a la merienda escolar se va a redirigir a las panaderías con lo cual se alcanzará una disponibilidad de 35 toneladas del producto distribuidas en la provincia.

Se tendrá como “prioridad máxima garantizar la existencia de pan normado de 7:00 a.m. a 7:00 p.m.”

De acuerdo a la nota González Mesa expresó que “es inconcebible que una familia no pueda adquirir ese vital alimento”.

Sin embargo a pesar de las acciones que pondrá en vigor el gobierno habanero Rodolfo Candano Quintana miembro del Subgrupo de la Alimentación expresó que la demanda actual de pan supera las posibilidades reales de la oferta por lo cual se espera reducir parcialmente las insatisfacciones pero no erradicarlas totalmente.

Por su parte Reinaldo García Zapata vicepresidente del CDP indicó la necesidad de diseñar estrategias para lograr una mejor organización en las colas y evitar que las personas permanezcan durante horas a las afueras de los establecimientos a la espera de un producto que quizás no puedan comprar.

En este sentido se valoró la posibilidad de entregar tickets de acuerdo al conocimiento previo de cuántas unidades se producirán en el día.

El director de la Unidad Empresarial de Base de La Habana de la Cadena Cubana del Pan comunicó también que esa entidad ha tomado acciones para garantizar que cada una hora salga un carro de pan entre las 6:00 a.m. y las 9:00 p.m."

Some consumers may want it anyway.

Cord-cutting -- meaning canceling cable TV plans in favor of streaming TV over the internet -- is becoming an epidemic in the U.S.

According to the latest statistics from Statista.com by the end of last year 31.2 million Americans had already ""cut the cord"" up 27% from 2019. That number is expected to grow another 14% this year 11% in 2022 9% in 2023 and 8% in 2024 growing but decelerating as cable customers run out of cords to cut and the nation transitions slowly but surely to an ""everything over the internet"" model for TV viewing.

Of course cable providers such as Comcast (CMCSA) Verizon (VZ -0.05%) and AT&T may take some comfort in the knowledge that they also sell internet access. Even if cable subscriptions dwindle at least internet subscriptions should rise.

But will they? Because according to the latest data from a poll conducted by Reviews.org cable monopolies may face an even bigger threat than cord-cutting: SpaceX Starlink.

The news

As we've previously discussed SpaceX's new ""Starlink"" satellite broadband internet project is up and running rolling out beta access in the U.S. in October for $99 per month expanding into Canada in November and then winning an $885 million subsidy -- and 642925 new customers -- from the FCC in December.

Those lucky 642925 could soon have company. After surveying 500 internet subscribers aged 18 and over Reviews.org estimates that 64% of Americans would consider ditching their current internet service providers (such as the aforementioned Comcast Verizon or AT&T) and switching to Starlink. More than that 51% of Americans plan to switch to Starlink as soon as the service becomes available to them.

And it will be available to more people soon: Access to Starlink service is expanding with each launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 ""Starlink"" mission to orbit. The most recent batch of 60 Starlink satellites departed on Wednesday pushing the number of Starlink satellites in orbit past 1000. By the end of 2021 Starlink says it will be able to offer broadband access all around the world -- the rest of the U.S. included.

Caveats and provisos

Assuming internet users follow through on what they say they would do hypothetically and actually sign up for Starlink this could be bad news for incumbent internet service providers (ISPs). At the same time that their cable TV revenues are dwindling their internet broadband businesses might encounter a ""giant sucking sound"" coming from the direction of Starlink.

This would however be very propitious for investors hoping to get in on an eventual Starlink IPO which SpaceX says it has planned. (No date has been set yet.) But before you get too excited a few facts need to be highlighted.

First sample error. Reviews.com estimates that because of the small size of its survey there's a sample error of plus or minus 4.5%. Still the organization says it has ""a 95% level of confidence"" the data are correct. Worst case even if Reviews.org overestimated consumer desire for Starlink by 5% that still suggests incumbent ISPs could lose as much as 46% of their business to Starlink.

Second price. One curious bit of data in Reviews.org's report is that ""44% of survey respondents say they'd pay the $99/month price tag for Starlink internet if they were given an option to make payments on the $499 equipment fee"" (emphasis added). This caveat suggests that the stated ""51%"" interest in switching to Starlink isn't without caveats. Consumers are at least a little bit concerned about Starlink's price -- as they should be.

Finally speed and reliability. After all in its beta state some Starlink customers are getting as little as 50 mbps in speed for their $99 per month -- and must endure ""brief periods of no connectivity at all."" In remote rural markets that's probably still superior to what current terrestrial ISPs are offering. But for urban customers well Comcast charges as little as $50 for 200 mbps in metro locales -- half the price for four times the speed of Starlink. No matter how much consumers may hate their local cable monopolies after weighing the pros and cons they may well decide to stick with ""the devil they know"" -- especially given Starlink's $499 upfront equipment cost.

Granted as it builds out its satellite constellation Starlink says internet speeds will increase. Ultimately SpaceX hopes its satellite internet service will provide 1-gigabit speeds to customers. At that speed Starlink's $99 monthly price would be much more competitive with the $85 that Comcast charges for gigabit service.

At that point the writing could be on the wall for terrestrial ISPs and success would be all but assured for a Starlink IPO.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vamFtYmFuZHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMS8yMy9waGlzaC10by1icm9hZGNhc3QtNy0yNS0wMy1zaG93LWluLWNoYXJsb3R0ZS1mb3ItZGlubmVyLWFuZC1hLW1vdmllLXNlcmllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phish to Broadcast 7/25/03 Show in Charlotte for 'Dinner And A Movie' Series,"Phish to Broadcast 7/25/03 Show in Charlotte for ‘Dinner And A Movie’ Series

Ariel Robinson age 29 was charged Tuesday along with her husband Jerry Robinson in the death of a 3-year-old girl in South Carolina. They face counts of homicide by child abuse in the death of their adopted daughter.

More from Deadline

On Jan. 14 police found an unresponsive child at the couple’s home in Simpsonville South Carolina television station WHNS reported. The girl died as a result of several blunt force injuries a medical examination revealed. She was identified as Victoria Smith according to the Greenville station.

Ariel Robinson won $25000 in the latest edition of Worst Cooks in America a competition between people with admittedly poor cooking skills. They go through a boot camp under celebrity chef supervision in the competition.

The Food Network has scrubbed all content related to the Season 20 show. The competition was filmed in February 2020 and aired last year. The Food Network has yet to comment on the Robinson incident.

The content is not available on the Food Network’s Discovery+ Hulu or YouTube page but episode summaries are still available on the official website.

Robinson was a recently retired teacher and budding stand-up comedian. She also added three foster children to her family in March 2020 after the series taping but it’s not clear if the murdered child was one of them.

JACK Entertainment confirmed Wednesday that the management team had bought Gilbert’s ownership interests a deal that closed in December without a formal announcement and so quietly that visitors never would have noticed a difference.

Business of late has largely mirrored that of the other casinos and racinos in the state - down sharply overall in 2020 the result coronavirus-related closings and restrictions on hours yet robust when fully open. The industry statewide had record performances in 2020 for months when permitted to be open round-the-clock both before and after the full closings during the spring.

Matt Cullen chairman of JACK Entertainment said it has “been a really challenging year” since the outbreak of the virus. But he added “on a relative basis we’ve done well. ... We really embraced the COVID protocols. From the time we reopened we were able to make people feel very safe.”

Cullen covered a number of topics during an interview with cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer about the casino racino and their continued operation under the JACK brand.

With Gilbert selling his ownership stake who owns JACK Entertainment?

Cullen said he is the lead investor among a “significant group of investors” that bought out Gilbert’s ownership shares. This includes “roughly 15 or 20 top management people” who were in place ahead of the sale.

Cullen has been with Gilbert’s family of companies for more than a decade leading both the gambling side and other businesses such as real estate. Previously he was General Manager of Economic and Development Services for General Motors.

How important would it be if Ohio ever joins neighboring states in legalizing bets on pro and college sports?

“I can’t say it’s a need but certainly something we would be enthusiastic about and our customers would like” Cullen said of the potential of sports wagering.

“We would love to be able to make it available to our customers. I know it is being considered in the state of Ohio. We won’t comment on that process. But it has been a great asset in other jurisdictions. We know a lot of our customers would enjoy it.”

Separate proposals in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate have languished despite Gov. Mike DeWine saying in introducing his 2019 budget that he anticipated state revenue from sports gambling at some point during the course of the two-year budget.

Sports wagering by itself is not huge in the casino industry accounting for a small fraction of gambling revenue in Las Vegas. But it is considered a draw for the casinos bringing in customers who end up spending money other ways.

“Maybe they will put a bet down go to dinner and then come back in to watch the second half of the game and maybe play a slot machine” Cullen said.

How about Thistledown?

Though much smaller in terms of gambling revenue than the MGM Northfield Park racino just down the road in Summit County the JACK Thistledown Racino in North Randall ahead of the pandemic posted the biggest year-to-year gains in business among Ohio’s 11 casinos and racinos each of the previous two years.

Gambling revenue the money kept after paying out winnings was up 10.4% in 2018 and 11.7% to $142.5 million in 2019 state reports show. And in the first two months of 2020 before the pandemic struck revenue was up another 18.6%.

Cullen said he believed the gains were related to investments JACK has made in the facility and continues to make. Work is now under way on a new outdoor patio for slots a feature popular among gamblers who like to smoke but are not permitted to do so inside at Ohio’s casinos and racinos.

The original patio Cullen said “was kind of built after the fact. This one is really being built ground up in a very thoughtful way.”

Racinos like Thistledown and Northfield Park are permitted to offer only chance-based slot machines called video lottery terminals unlike casinos that offer table games and a wider variety of slots. The downtown Cleveland casino has the top table game revenue in Ohio.

How well does it work to be a gambling company with just two sites?

With two facilities - the Thistledown racino and the downtown casino - JACK doesn’t have the branding and the tie-ins of MGM Las Vegas Sands Casesar’s and other big players in the industry.

But Cullen said he believes it works for JACK because casinos have become more regional in nature now that so many states have so many casinos and racinos.

“Regional gaming is just that; it’s regional. Your customer comes from a relatively near circumference” Cullen said.

For JACK this is the Northeast Ohio crowd that largely went to Detroit Pittsburgh Erie Pennsylvania or Chester West Virginia for their “local” gambling trips ahead of the legalization in Ohio.

The Cleveland casino historically is second behind Hollywood Columbus for revenue among Ohio’s four casinos. Last year was different dropping to third as Hollywood Toledo experienced a big boost in business when the Detroit casinos had more extended closings.

Would JACK buy other casinos or be open to being bought?

“We’re focused on the two properties” Cullen said when asked of any more potential ownership changes.

But as to if an opportunity came up Cullen said “smart people listen to alternatives.” This could include being a buyer: “We want to continue to grow these assets and may look to continue to grow the company itself in looking at other assets.”

JACK Entertainment recently has been part of three major deals that included selling its Cincinnati and Detroit casinos:

* JACK’s former Detroit casino - Greektown Casino-Hotel – is now owned by VICI but operated as Greektown by Penn National after a $1 billion deal announced in 2018 and closed in 2019..

* JACK’s former Cincinnati casino is owned by VICI but operated by Hard Rock International following the closing in late 2019 of a $745 million deal ($558 million from VICI $187 million from Hard Rock) for both the casino and JACK’s Turfway Park in Kentucky. The final deal involved Churchill Downs ending up with Turfway.

* And while JACK continues to run the casino in Cleveland and racino at Thistledown it is doing so under a lease agreement with VICI. VICI purchased the properties to lease back to JACK as part of an $843 million deal that closed in January 2020.

Gilbert’s approach to the casino was a little different from many other casinos in not including a concert hall or theater instead focusing on being part of downtown. Has that worked?

“I think it has worked” Cullen said. “The whole predicate was let’s be part of the downtown and not compete with downtown. As a result we don’t have a lot of restaurants and nightclubs. We have a robust business approach where we give comps meals to surrounding restaurants.

“We got into this initially because we thought we could create vitality downtown. I think that has been the case and we will continue to partner with businesses downtown. ... I’m bullish on downtown Cleveland. I think it’s a tremendous center for business and commerce. We know that success of the casino is going to be predicated on the the success of downtown.”

What about the original plan to build a casino overlooking the Cuyahoga River behind the Terminal Tower complex?

Voters may remember the glitzy drawings of a casino overlooking the river south of Huron Avenue that were showcased during the campaign to legalize gambling in Ohio back in 2009. That was set aside in favor of a quicker plan to move into the Higbee Building billed as a temporary location at the time.

Over the years temporary changed to permanent with the river site labeled as what would become the second phase. But the second phase never came to be and there are no plans in the works to change that.

“There is not going to be a casino on that site” Cullen said. “The casino in Cleveland is the one in the Higbee Building. Nothing has changed in that regard.”

Holding true to the promises made during elections Joe Biden has sent in an immigration reform bill to Congress soon after taking oath as the 46th President of the United States.

The Bill to be the US Citizenship Act of 2021 on Congress approval modernizes the US immigration system. If passed this will be the most sweeping reform made in the US immigration system in over 20 years.

Indian IT professionals considered to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the proposed US immigration reform.

The US Citizenship Act of 2021 seeks to establish a new system for responsibly managing and securing the US border keeping communities and families safe within the country and for better managing migration.

By sending in the Bill to Congress right on Day 1 of assuming office President Biden has come true to the commitment to restoring humanity and American values to the immigration system.

By replacing the word ‘alien’ with ‘noncitizen’ the Bill recognizes America as a nation of immigrants.

Highlights of the US Citizenship Act of 2021 Creation of an “earned roadmap to citizenship” for undocumented individuals. Undocumented individuals can apply for temporary legal status in the US with the ability of applying for US Green Card after 5 years provided they pay their taxes and pass the required background checks. After 3 years all US Green Card holders that pass additional checks and demonstrate knowledge of US Civics and English can apply for US citizenship. While generally the applicants must be physically present in the US on or before January 1 2021 the condition might be waived by the Department of Homeland Security [DHS] under specific circumstances. Growing the US economy · Clearing employment-based visa backlogs · Recapturing unused visas · Reducing lengthy wait times · Removing the per-country visa caps · Easier for US graduates [with advanced STEM degrees] to stay on in the US · Improves accessibility of US Green Cards for workers in the sectors considered lower-wage · Elimination of other unnecessary obstacles to obtaining employment-based Green Cards · Dependents of H-B visa holders to get work authorization · Children of H-1B visa holders prevented from “aging out” of the system. · Creation of a Pilot Program for the stimulation of regional economic development · DHS given authority to adjust Green Cards as per the specific macro-economic conditions · Encourages higher wages for non-immigrant high skilled visas Embracing diversity Diversity Visas to be increased to 80000 from the existing 55000. Promotion of immigrant and refugee integration and citizenship New funding for the expansion of programs for the promotion of the inclusion and integration of newcomers to the country. Assistance will be provided to those seeking US citizenship.

The cornerstone of the US Citizenship Act of 2021 is that undocumented immigrants will now have a roadmap for obtaining legal status in the US and eventually citizenship.

Indian IT professionals have much to gain as well. With the removal of the per-country visa caps more Indians can hope to get their US visas. Many of whom have a current waiting period for US Green Card running into several years.

In December 2020 the US senate unanimously passed the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also referred to as ‘S.386’ eliminating the per-country cap on employment-based immigrant visas.

In 2020 the green card backlog for employment-based immigrants was above 1.2 million applicants. Indian applicants made up around 68% of the green card backlog.

Moreover with the dependents of H-1B visa holders being granted work authorization there is all the more reason for H-1B applicants to be hopeful for the future.

COVAX initial aim is to immunize the most vulnerable 20% of poorer coronavirus threatened nations. Tedros blasted rich countries over hoarding.

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the COVAX scheme had reached a deal with vaccine maker Pfizer-BioNTech for 40 million doses for poorer countries.

Another 150 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine will come in the first quarter of 2021 under COVAX — assuming WHO safety clearance said Seth Berkley chief executive of the private-public vaccination fund GAVI.

Addressing a press conference in Geneva UN agency head Tedros added that fresh US commitment under new President Joe Biden to join COVAX meant that we are closer to fulfilling the scheme's promise.

Launched last year before vaccines became readily available COVAX' initial aim is to immunize the most vulnerable 20% of poorer coronavirus threatened nations. Earlier this week Tedros blasted rich countries over hoarding.

Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla told the virtual Geneva conference that the initial dispatch would be on a not-for-profit basis adding developing countries should have the same access to vaccines as the rest of the world.

The Geneva announcements come as wealthy countries inoculate millions some using shots procured under bilateral deals decried officially for example by the EU.

Asked how many vaccine doses all manufacturers might produce this year GAVI's Berkley said: I think we're talking about numbers in the range of six to seven billion doses.

Chinese and Russian vaccines if proven safe and efficacious could also be added to COVAX Berkley added.

We still have a lot of work to do said WHO head Tedros but the light at the end of the tunnel continues to grow brighter."

That may be changing however. Executives and spokesmen are talking about the big pharmacy chains' plans to widely offer coronavirus immunizations.

CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. are on the verge of offering the shots to the public according to company reports.

And Walmart Inc. which is expanding its inoculations into seven states outside Arkansas indicated on a company blog that it eventually plans to offer covid-19 vaccinations throughout the chain.

The Bentonville-based retailer now offers the inoculations to eligible Arkansans only at its pharmacies in Arkadelphia Ashdown West Memphis and El Dorado according to the Arkansas Department of Health.

[CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]

Walgreens and CVS contracted with the federal Department of Health and Human Services in October to first vaccinate residents of long-term-care facilities nationwide. Those inoculations began Dec. 28 and the companies say they'll wrap up in late January.

Once that initiative is completed their agreements with Health and Human Service allows both chains to offer the vaccine at all of their pharmacy locations.

WALMART BLOG

A new blog post Friday by Dr. Cheryl Pegus Walmart's new executive vice president of health and wellness talked about how the company expects to be able to deliver up to 13 million doses a month ""when supply and allocations allow"" and is training pharmacists and staff members so they can be ready.

""As we look to a future when supply can meet demand and more people are eligible to receive the vaccine we plan to offer the vaccine seven days a week at our pharmacies through planned vaccination clinics and through large community events"" she said.

The company can help the nation in a couple of key ways she wrote especially in rural and medically underserved areas where health care is scarce.

WALGREENS' REACH

Walgreens plans to eventually offer the vaccine at all of its more than 9000 stores once doses are available for mass distribution and in accordance with state and local guidance according to the company's website.

When the chain starts vaccinating the public it will reach out to underserved and rural areas using methods such as mobile and off-site clinics the company said.

The drugstore chain's spokespeople were unable to comment ""due to the high volume of media inquiries"" they're receiving according to an automated email reply.

CVS ROLLOUT

CVS pharmacy vaccinations for the public are currently available only at a small number of the chain's stores in Indiana New York and Massachusetts CVS Health spokeswoman Monica Prinzing said. But the company is talking about a ""broader rollout.""

""The company remains in discussions with additional states to make a limited number of doses available in the coming weeks in advance of the broader rollout"" she said.

Vaccines in retail settings will be given by appointment only Prinzing said. Appointments can be made on the company's website or through its app.

Prinzing said CVS has the capacity to administer up to 25 million shots per month. The company has nearly 10000 pharmacies across the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Three other girls ages 14 13 and 12 also are accused in connection with the death. Mancuso said the girls allegedly stole knives from the Walmart to stab the victim. He said the entire case was recorded on social media with videos and posts and pictures that are ""very disturbing.""

He also said this is third homicide in six months involving children younger than 16 years of age.

""We have a problem in our community we're going to have to address"" he said. ""They come from all backgrounds all races this is just a problem we are having with children having access to weapons or stealing weapons. It's just heartbreaking when we have to come in and pick up the pieces because so many families are damaged... This is a cycle that we have to stop and we're just fed up with it.""

Mancuso said that immediately all law enforcement in the parish will be aggressively enforcing curfews set by state and local laws: 11 p.m. until 5 a.m. Mondays through Thursdays and midnight to 5 a.m. on weekends. However that being said police can't solve these problems.

""This is not something we can police our way out of. I just don't feel like this is a police matter. This is a parenting issue"" he said. ""People need to know where their kids are. They need to know what's going on in their lives. We're going to take some aggressive steps. This is going to be parish-wide every city we're all going to be on the same page. We're going to have zero tolerance on curfew violators.""

He pleaded with parents to keep track of their kids' social media. He said ""the whole murder played out on there"" he said. Parents have to put limits on their kids' phones and look at what they're posting and seeing it. Mancuso said he's certain that some people ""saw this coming"" on social media and ""never said a word. He said he knows it's hard sometimes for people who aren't ""tech savvy"" but it's not optional he said.

""You better learn. You better figure out how to do it"" Mancuso said.

Mancuso asked everyone with children in their lives to help.

""I'm asking you tonight for our parents to take control. they have to. We can't do this. We can arrest them but that's not going to solve the problem. It's going to take parenting; knowing where their kids are what they're involved in what they're doing.

I know many of us are in the most difficult times of our lives. There's not a lot for our kids to do right now. We're just not in normal circumstances but that is no excuse for the behavior that is going on in our community with our juveniles"" he said. ""They're breaking the law and they're getting violent and we can't tolerate it. I'm asking you to not put us in that position.""

Mancuso said his people will be meeting with store managers and owners to be sure they know what their rights are regarding loitering juveniles.

""You're dropping kids off they're not supervised. So we're going to meet with stores and make sure they know what their rights are. You can't just go to stores and hang out if you're not purchasing or legitimately doing something there"" he said.

Bottom line he said Calcasieu Parish has to ""take control of our kids.""

""We're asking everybody to step up and get involved. All of us: parent grandparent store owners. We can't let this happen because it's going to get worse and it's going to get completely out of control"" he said. ""We as a society cannot tolerate this behavior. We cannot sit back and let this happen.""

Earlier today the sheriff reported that four teens have been arrested and a fifth teen is dead after a fight at a store last night.

Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office deputies were called to a grocery store on Highway 14 in Lake Charles at about 7:30 p.m. Saturday night.

Deputies learned that several young girls were fighting in the store and during the fight a 15-year-old girl was stabbed. She was taken to a hospital where she died deputies say.

After an investigation sheriff's detectives arrested four girls ages 14 13 13 and 12 and booked them in connection with the incident. One of them is booked with second-degree murder and the other three are booked with principal to second-degree murder.

Hwy. 14.

According to CPSO the 15-year-old victim was involved in a fight between several other young girls inside Walmart. During the altercation the 15-year-old was stabbed.

The victim was transported to a local hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.

Chief Deputy Stitch Guillory said that the incident possibly started at a movie theatre.

Detectives arrested four young girls ages 14 13 (2 girls) and 12. They were all booked into the Juvenile Detention Center.

It could be a scam,"CNN Business —

Most people who buy things online just have to worry about their deliveries being delayed or never arriving. But some people are dealing with a different problem altogether: getting weird stuff like hair clippers face creams and sunglasses they never even ordered at all.

The Federal Trade Commission and cyber experts have been warning consumers about these deliveries which can be part of something known as “brushing” scams.

Here’s how these scams work: Third-party sellers on Amazon eBay and other online marketplaces pay people to write fake positive reviews about their products or do it themselves. To be able to post the reviews these so-called “brushers” need to trick the site into making it appear that a legitimate transaction took place. So they’ll use a fake account to place gift orders and address them to a random person whose name and address they find online. Then instead of actually mailing the item for which they want to post a review the brushers will send a cheap often lightweight item that costs less to ship.

Sending an item (even the wrong one) creates a tracking number and when the package is delivered it enables brushers to write a verified review. If you’re on the receiving end you usually aren’t charged for the purchase and your real account isn’t hacked — but you are left in the dark as to who is repeatedly sending the mystery packages. In many cases there’s no return address. You don’t need to worry that anything bad has happened to you or will happen to you if you get a package that might be part of a brushing scam experts say. But we all need to be concerned about the scams affecting reviews we rely on when buying products.

Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” Jen Blinn

Brushing scams reportedly took off on e-commerce sites in China around five years ago. They resurfaced in headlines last summer when all 50 states issued warnings about mysterious unsolicited packages of seeds that people across the nation received in the mail.

But it’s not just seeds. Unsuspecting recipients have also found boxes with goods ranging from dog pooper-scoopers to power cords to soap dispensers on their doorsteps.

Jen Blinn of Thousand Oaks California told CNN Business she has been receiving random packages since June including most recently a briefcase a backpack a hair straightener and a coffee-cup warmer.

“Every two weeks…I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered” she said. Blinn notified Amazon of the issue but a customer service agent “didn’t really understand what I was saying. She obviously didn’t know about it” she said. The agent looked at Blinn’s account and found nothing wrong with it.

Jen Blinn holds up some of the unusual items she received in Amazon packages. She didn't order these goods and doesn't know who sent them to her. CNN

It’s not illegal to send customers unordered merchandise. But “the [Federal Trade Commission] has long gone after marketers that use fake reviews” said David Vladeck a former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and a law professor at Georgetown University.

Amazon says its policy prohibits sellers sending unsolicited merchandise to customers and that sellers can be removed from the site for doing so.

“Third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and we take action on those who violate our policies including withholding payments suspending or removing selling privileges or working with law enforcement” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Amazon would not say how how many brushing scams have been found on the site or how many sellers have been removed due to these scams.

An eBay spokesperson said in an email that brushing schemes “do not appear to be highly prevalent” on the site. It violates eBay policy to send unsolicited merchandise to customers or falsify reviews and can result in eBay restricting sellers’ accounts or suspending them from the site.

Experts also say it’s difficult to quantify the frequency of such scams because it can be hard for companies to know whether reviews are fake and scams often go unreported by consumers.

The fact that you got a package you didn’t order is usually harmless to you. The harm is to people who rely on reviews when deciding on a purchase said Chris McCabe a former policy enforcement investigator at Amazon tasked with stopping scams and fraud. He is now a consultant to sellers on the site.

The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews” Chris McCabe consultant and former Amazon policy enforcement investigator

“The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews or this artificial padding of reviews because they might see 100 positive reviews and then there may only be 60 or 70 of them that are legitimate” he said.

The likelihood that a consumer will buy a product that has five reviews is 270% higher than the likelihood they will buy a product with zero reviews according to a 2017 report by Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center.

Some fake reviews are also being driven by Facebook groups where sellers offer buyers money if they write positive product reviews said McCabe. Amazon and Facebook should work together to crack down on these groups he said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company analyzes more than 10 million reviews every week to try to keep fake ones from being published and that it provides details of its investigations to social media companies “so they can stop these bad actors from abusing their platforms.”

A Facebook spokesperson said in an email that when the company is told of groups that may encourage fake reviews it reviews them and removes them if they violate its policies.

Unwanted sheets and Shiatsu massagers

For consumers the unexpected deliveries can be jarring. The packages Ashanté Nicole never ordered started arriving at her home in Fort Lauderdale Florida in 2019.

iPhone and portable car chargers. An iPad case. A heated shiatsu massage. A nail cleaning brush and a blow dryer. Sheets. A mattress cover. A floppy fish toy.

They didn’t have return addresses so Nicole wasn’t sure who was sending the packages. She reached out to Amazon to try to stop them from coming but they still keep arriving at her doorstep.

“It was just kind of a little bit concerning because I don’t know who has my information” she said. “I don’t know what they’re going to send me. Like they could send something illegal and then I’m in trouble because I didn’t know whoever that person was or what they were sending me.”

If you get merchandise you didn’t order it could mean that scammers have created an account in your name or taken over your account an FTC spokesperson said in an email. Scammers may have even created new accounts in other names tied to your address allowing them to post lots of seemingly-real reviews.

“We recommend keeping an eye on your online shopping accounts. If you spot activity that isn’t yours report it to the site right away and think about changing your password for that site” the spokesperson said.

There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” Ashanté Nicole

Nicole feels she has done all she can by alerting Amazon each time unsolicited packages from the retailer arrive at her doorstep.

“There’s literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn’t really done much” she said.

Amazon declined to comment directly on Nicole and Blinn’s accounts but said if a customer receives a package that was unsolicited they should contact Amazon’s customer service team.

Nicole said she hopes Amazon will do more to stop brushing and ban sellers who participate in the scams.

“I just think they need to be a little bit more concerned with shutting those stores down and making sure those sellers can’t use the platform.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rd3dsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NlZGFyLXJhcGlkcy91cGRhdGUtY2VkYXItcmFwaWRzLW9mZmljZXItYml0dGVuLWZvbGxvd2luZy1maWdodC1hdC13YWxtYXJ0L2FydGljbGVfNWViMmIxZWQtMGY2YS01YzkyLWE2YzMtYzQwZTRlOWI0ZDVhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATE: Cedar Rapids officer bitten following fight at Walmart,"You have permission to edit this article.

That may be changing however. Executives and spokesmen are talking about the big pharmacy chains' plans to widely offer coronavirus immunizations.

CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. are on the verge of offering the shots to the public according to company reports.

And Walmart Inc. which is expanding its inoculations into seven states outside Arkansas indicated on a company blog that it eventually plans to offer covid-19 vaccinations throughout the chain.

The Bentonville-based retailer now offers the inoculations to eligible Arkansans only at its pharmacies in Arkadelphia Ashdown West Memphis and El Dorado according to the Arkansas Department of Health.

[CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]

Walgreens and CVS contracted with the federal Department of Health and Human Services in October to first vaccinate residents of long-term-care facilities nationwide. Those inoculations began Dec. 28 and the companies say they'll wrap up in late January.

Once that initiative is completed their agreements with Health and Human Service allows both chains to offer the vaccine at all of their pharmacy locations.

WALMART BLOG

A new blog post Friday by Dr. Cheryl Pegus Walmart's new executive vice president of health and wellness talked about how the company expects to be able to deliver up to 13 million doses a month ""when supply and allocations allow"" and is training pharmacists and staff members so they can be ready.

""As we look to a future when supply can meet demand and more people are eligible to receive the vaccine we plan to offer the vaccine seven days a week at our pharmacies through planned vaccination clinics and through large community events"" she said.

The company can help the nation in a couple of key ways she wrote especially in rural and medically underserved areas where health care is scarce.

WALGREENS' REACH

Walgreens plans to eventually offer the vaccine at all of its more than 9000 stores once doses are available for mass distribution and in accordance with state and local guidance according to the company's website.

When the chain starts vaccinating the public it will reach out to underserved and rural areas using methods such as mobile and off-site clinics the company said.

The drugstore chain's spokespeople were unable to comment ""due to the high volume of media inquiries"" they're receiving according to an automated email reply.

CVS ROLLOUT

CVS pharmacy vaccinations for the public are currently available only at a small number of the chain's stores in Indiana New York and Massachusetts CVS Health spokeswoman Monica Prinzing said. But the company is talking about a ""broader rollout.""

""The company remains in discussions with additional states to make a limited number of doses available in the coming weeks in advance of the broader rollout"" she said.

Vaccines in retail settings will be given by appointment only Prinzing said. Appointments can be made on the company's website or through its app.

Prinzing said CVS has the capacity to administer up to 25 million shots per month. The company has nearly 10000 pharmacies across the country."
DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vd25lcnNoaXAtc3RydWN0dXJlLXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5LWNvbXBhbnktMDc0ODQ0ODcwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is The Ownership Structure Like For The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)?,"The big shareholder groups in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) have power over the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger smaller companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.

Walt Disney is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of US$311b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. In the chart below we can see that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner to discover more about Walt Disney.

View our latest analysis for Walt Disney

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

We can see that Walt Disney does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walt Disney (below). Of course keep in mind that there are other factors to consider too.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Walt Disney is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.4% of common stock and State Street Global Advisors Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock.

On studying our ownership data we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register implying that no single individual has a majority interest.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Walt Disney

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Story continues

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Walt Disney Company. As it is a large company we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$292m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public holds a 35% stake in Walt Disney. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. Consider for instance the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Walt Disney (at least 1 which is significant)  and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Designed as an eye-catching visual marquee for the original version of It’s a Small World at the 1964 World’s Fair in New York the Tower of the Four Winds was a whimsical icon for the attraction. It was designed by Imagineer Rolly Crump known now for his pivotal role in the early years of Disneyland.

In this lovingly modeled recreation of the Tower of the Four Winds Disney History Institute and Crankysomething have put together a fantastic animated 3D recreation of the kinetic sculpture. The utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) is excellent in displaying the true depth and movement of the tower. Then to top it off there are pedestals in a semi-circle around the sculpture each of which contains part of an interview with Rolly Crump himself.

It’s a surreal experience standing at perfect viewing distance looking down at the photos of the development of the sculpture and looking up to see it fully realized. All the while Rolly Crump is narrating the whole story. In true Rolly fashion he doesn’t sugar coat it and explains why the Tower of the Four Winds never made it back to Disneyland with the rest of It’s a Small World.

As with DHI’s previous recreation of Adventures Through Inner Space the real-time rendering of the image makes a strikingly clear and crisp picture. That’s especially true with the new Oculus Quest 2 which has a sharper screen. This is a big sculpture too so being able to walk (or teleport) around it to see all the angles is much more unique than just watching a video on it. Of course this is also another recreation of something I’m too young to have ever seen myself so that adds a little extra magic to it.

Visit the World’s Fair

If you want to take a stroll around the Tower of the Four Winds for yourself DHI has made it available for Oculus Quest and Quest 2 on Oculus App Lab. With the Quest 2 being such a huge seller this holiday season hopefully more of our readers now have a headset to try this out. Otherwise for those wanting to try it out on PC the developers have said they’ll be adding it to the Itch.io page very soon.

If you don’t have a VR headset I highly recommend giving it a try. It’s a medium that is rapidly expanding and it’s a great replacement for theme parks while they remain closed. For instance I wrote about the game Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge and the 5 things that Disneyland could adopt from it. The new Quest 2 sold out before Christmas (a sad circumstance for one MiceChat author’s family member who wanted one) but I’m personally impressed with it considering the great visuals relatively cheap price of $300 and the fact it requires no extra PC. I just checked and the Quest 2 is now widely available again following the holiday shortages.

After talking with Jeremy Marx at Disney History Institute and seeing a few posts about Rocket to the Moon Monsanto’s House of the Future and Ken Anderson’s Haunted House it looks like there are a few more exciting recreations coming soon. The latter we’ve been excited about since Jeremy’s presentation on Ken Anderson at D23.

The faster the better you say? Looks like your wish will come true thanks to a new agreement between Walt Disney World Resort and Brightline to build a train station at Disney Springs a trendy shopping dining and entertainment complex.

The station will provide a convenient travel option between Disney World Resort and Brightline stations at Orlando International Airport Miami Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach and planned stations in Aventura Boca Raton and Port Miami.

Brightline’s expansion from West Palm Beach to the Orlando airport is targeted for completion in 2022.

Plans for the Disney Springs station call for a ground floor lobby passenger facilities and an upper level train platform. The train stop will be close to Walt Disney World Resort’s four theme parks two water parks and more than 25 hotels.

“Brightline will offer a car-free connection to the millions of visitors from around the state and the world who plan to make Walt Disney World Resort part of their vacation plans” said Patrick Goddard president of Brightline in a press release.

Jeff Vahle president of Walt Disney World Resort adds: “We’re excited to work with Brightline as they pursue the potential development of a train station at Walt Disney World Resort a project that would support our local economy and offer a bold forward-looking transportation solution for our community and guests.”

We had beautiful weather today which was especially nice since it’s been a bit chilly recently. Encouraged by the warmer temperature we decided to check out the Magic Kingdom and then park hop to Disney’s Animal Kingdom to check out what might be new in each park. We found some exciting things so let’s get started!

After witnessing the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover testing yesterday we had hoped to find it in a soft opening stage today but unfortunately we were met with this now-familiar sign. We can’t wait to ride this iconic attraction once more!

With the Rivers of America beginning to fill with water just yesterday we were excited to see what the water level would look like after filling all night. It was a bit anticlimactic as the water had only risen to the bottom of the Liberty Square Riberboat track but nonetheless we were pleased to see progress.

Progress at the construction site for TRON Lightcycle / Run is coming along quickly with this assembled piece of canopy almost ready to hoist into place.

Visible work began today on the facade of Bonjour! Village Gifts. We were surprised to see an entire boom lift was hidden behind those planters!

It wouldn’t be a day at the Magic Kingdom if we didn’t find a new patch of fresh concrete blocked off from guests. Today’s patch was about 10 feet from yesterday’s patch.

We found the popular neon park icons Loungefly restocked at Star Traders today. This bag has been out of stock for some time now so it was a surprise to see it today.

We found some fun merchandise in the parks today that we wanted to show you. First was this glass gallon jar from “Up” which we found at The Emporium for $24.99.

Keeping in the “Up” theme we found these open edition pins today as well. For more pictures and information check out our article here.

Back at The Emporium we found a new dog toy from the Disney Tails line featuring Minnie’s iconic polka dotted bow for $17.99.

We also found these culinary additions to the Disney Dogs and Cats merchandise line with these spatula and cookie cutter sets retailing for $19.99 each.

The next new piece was this silk headband featuring Minnie Mouse in red and pink with “xoxo” for Valentine’s Day retailing for $13.99.

We found two youth long sleeve shirts with jersey-like writing going down one sleeve and a number on the back each featuring an iconic character. This yellow shirt featured Pluto.

Each of these shirts retails for $24.99.

We had a great time at the Magic Kingdom but it was time to head to Disney’s Animal Kingdom! It’s been far too long since we were there and we were excited to check out what might be new there.

A large portion of Gorilla Falls Exploration Trail has been closed for refurbishment leading to the remaining part of the open trail being turned into a two way walking path. For more pictures and information check out our article here.

Kali River Rapids is closed for it’s yearly refurbishment and we spotted through the trees that the ride vehicle loading area has been drained of water.

While looking for a snack we noticed that Flame Tree Barbecue is still offering some of their “Holiday Exclusives”. While we’re not disappointed to see this yummy drink still on the menu it did surprise us to see it still under the Holiday heading.

We found some more merchandise at Disney’s Animal Kingdom that we wanted to show you starting with this sweatshirt from Island Mercantile for $42.99. We love the characters on the sleeves!

This neon Walt Disney World logo youth shirt is sure to get you seen! We found it at Discovery Trading Co for $24.99.

We found a new youth crop tank for $24.99 at Windtraders.

We had a wonderful day at Disney’s Animal Kingdom and we hope you enjoyed coming along with us as we park hopped! Have a magical day!"

KONG trailer get your first glimpse of their titanic duel,"Godzilla vs. Kong lord does that take me back. I’m fairly certain I wore out the VHS of King Kong vs. Godzilla that my parents got me either for Christmas of my birthday watching it endlessly as a little guy. I saw that movie long before I saw either original film and I think I could just about quote it from memory. From the awkward “United Nations reporter” sharing tons of background for us dumb Americans on who Godzilla is to the island upon which Kong fights what is clearly at times anyway a real octopus. And Kong getting supercharged by lightning and kicking big G’s ass.

As a kid of course the rather…problematic…depiction of the Faro Islanders never really occurred to me until I saw the movie again as an adult thanks to the very nice Criterion set of the entire Godzilla run. It was there too that I finally saw the Japanese cut of the film long rumored (and dispelled by the internet) to be where Godzilla actually won. Spoilers that doesn’t happen but it is a MUCH better film objectively speaking. Ishiro Honda’s screaming satire of Japan’s media landscape comes to the fore and certain plot points (such as why the protagonist is capable of playing the drums that lull Kong to sleep) make far more sense. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I finally saw it. And if you have that set I highly recommend you do the same. It’s surely the second best movie in the run outside of Honda’s original.

Anyway back to modern day where we’re on the cusp of a NEW showdown between the big lizard and the big monkey this time with the names reversed in Godzilla vs. Kong. I actually visited the set for this when I went on a Hawaiian vacation with family…that was back in December of 2018 so they’ve been at this one for a long time. Originally scheduled for March of 2020 it was actually delayed to November of that year long before COVID and then of course thanks to the pandemic it ended up in the 2021 calendar now landing on HBOMax on March 26 right around my birthday!

The pedigree on this is pretty interesting with Adam Wingard behind the camera. It’s his first big blockbuster after a lineup of horror and thrillers (You’re Next the very interesting The Guest that Death Note movie nobody liked) but his involvement with this one perked my ears up in a way that none of the previous MonsterVerse films have been able.

Godzilla vs. Kong follows on the heels of Kong: Skull Island (which I liked and Hannah reviewed) and Godzilla: King of the Monsters (which I did not and Hannah also reviewed) and brings back a few characters from the latter film notably Millie Bobbie Brown and Kyle Chandler’s father and daughter pair. Since Kong’s reboot was a period piece set the in 70’s I’m guessing Kong is the only element of Skull Island making its return. Before we get to the trailer here’s the synopsis:

Legends collide in “Godzilla vs. Kong” as these mythic adversaries meet in a spectacular battle for the ages with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Kong and his protectors undertake a perilous journey to find his true home and with them is Jia a young orphaned girl with whom he has formed a unique and powerful bond. But they unexpectedly find themselves in the path of an enraged Godzilla cutting a swath of destruction across the globe. The epic clash between the two titans—instigated by unseen forces—is only the beginning of the mystery that lies deep within the core of the Earth.

So what do you think? Are you pumped to see the big throwdown? You only have a few months to wait as Godzilla vs. Kong again hits HBOMax on March 26th and will be available for 31 days. It’ll also be in theaters that same day provided they’re open in your area.

Organisers were forced to reiterate their commitment to holding the Olympics in July and August after a report on Friday said Japan's government had privately concluded the Games would have to be cancelled because of the pandemic.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said the entire Olympic movement is united in its determination to ensure the Games happen in a video message to mark the six-month countdown to the opening ceremony.

""We just do everything we can to keep our environment safe prepare the way that we can understanding much like last year it could likely not happen again"" Rapinoe who scored twice in Friday's 6-0 friendly win over Colombia told reporters.

""That would be awful. Personally I'd be devastated. A lot of my team-mates would be devastated to miss out fully on a major championship because I don't think it would be postponed again.

Someone will tell us at some point but until then we just keep training and keep playing these games.""

The U.S. women's soccer team captured the last of their four Olympic gold medals at London in 2012. They are the reigning World Cup champions.

Rapinoe said she understood the implications of bringing the global community together for ""technically a non-essential kind of thing"".

""We understand we're in a global pandemic. Our country being one of those that's been hit hardest or handled it the worst"" Rapinoe the 2019 Ballon d'Or winner said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdHBvc3QuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy93d2Utc3VwZXJzdGFyLXNwZWN0YWNsZS1qaW5kZXItbWFoYWwtcHJvbWlzZXMtYmVzdC12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLW1vZGVybi1kYXktbWFoYXJhamEtaW4tcmVwdWJsaWMtZGF5LXNwZWNpYWwtZXZlbnQtOTIzMzMzMS5odG1s0gGhAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpcnN0cG9zdC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3d3ZS1zdXBlcnN0YXItc3BlY3RhY2xlLWppbmRlci1tYWhhbC1wcm9taXNlcy1iZXN0LXZlcnNpb24tb2YtbW9kZXJuLWRheS1tYWhhcmFqYS1pbi1yZXB1YmxpYy1kYXktc3BlY2lhbC1ldmVudC05MjMzMzMxLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Superstar Spectacle: Jinder Mahal promises 'best version of Modern Day Maharaja' in Republic Day special event,"And after hitting another major roadblock in his career this time in the form of a knee surgery that has put him out of action for well more than a year Mahal prepares for another comeback into the company.

“You’re going to see a new version — and I would say the best version of the Modern Day Maharaja.”

Jinder Mahal’s had quite the story in the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). From the days of trying to get a foothold in the industry while working alongside the Great Khali and being part of the 3MB getting released of his services by the company in 2014 competing in the independent circuit for a while to making a successful comeback by becoming the first WWE Champion of Indian origin.

And after hitting another major roadblock in his career this time in the form of a knee surgery that has put him out of action for well more than a year Mahal prepares for another comeback into the locker room.

Older wiser and certainly knowing what it takes to chart one’s way back to the top the ‘Modern Day Maharaja’ has announced he’s going to be better than ever when he returns to the squared circle on 26 January at the ‘Superstar Spectacle’ a special two-hour event by WWE on Republic Day featuring a host of superstars from all three brands including several Indians — both the established names as well as the new recruits.

“Obviously it’s going to be the hashtag #ReturnOfTheMaharaja — I’m going to be coming back from injury so looking to make an impact and establish myself again in the title scene.

“I’m still inspired just like before even more motivated than ever before. I want to have a long career in WWE and now that I’m realising that I’m getting a little bit older I’m 34 years old I just have to take care of myself a little bit more. So now I’m doing more yoga more recovery stuff just staying on top of the recovery aspect” says Mahal in an interaction with Firstpost ahead of the Republic Day special.

Mahal has had to spend an extended period of time on the sidelines since suffering a ruptured patellar tendon at a live event in Denver on 15 June 2019. He made a short-lived return on Raw in April last year defeating Akira Tozawa before the knee issue pulled him out of WWE programming yet again.

Mahal revealed the operation on his right knee in 2019 was the first time he’d ever undergone surgery in his life and described not being on the road as a tough phase to go through. One in which he had to stay motivated throughout the period challenging himself to get better with each passing day of rehab in order to stay in shape in the build-up to his big return.

“It was very tough… First time I’ve been injured first time I’ve missed time away from WWE. So it was definitely hard at first. I went from being on the road 200-plus days in a year performing every night to all of a sudden now I’m home I’m just doing rehab every single day.

“But I kind of challenged myself at rehab every day I wanted to see the growth just like I challenged myself in WWE. Just like every match I wanted to get better every day at rehab I wanted to get better and come back stronger. I was super motivated to come back. Obviously WWE is my passion is my life is all I ever wanted to do.

“Every athlete goes through this they just kind of stay motivated and put the work in rehab in training and you can always come back stronger and better than before” added Mahal whose real name is Yuvraj Dhesi.

And there couldn’t have been a better platform for him to make his comeback than the event that’s a first for the WWE Universe in India. The company after all gets the highest viewership both on YouTube as well as on television from the country of a billion-plus people and is now starting to develop as a base for them to recruit their future superstars. A special event on the 72nd anniversary of India officially becoming a republic thus comes as a surprise to few.

“What makes this event special is that it is especially for India. Obviously it’s Republic Day January 26. It’s going to air them at 8 pm local time. This event is going to be spectacular. There’s going to be Desi style a little bit of desi flavour Indian flavour.

“There’s going to be lights camera something that you would expect almost from Bollywood all the colours all the sights and sounds” said Mahal who had wrestled Triple H at a live event in New Delhi in 2017 a match that he describes as the “biggest match that’s ever happened in India.”

From the days of the villainous Tiger Ali Singh during the Attitude Era the Great Khali making a statement with his dominant win over The Undertaker in the summer of 2006 to Mahal becoming the first WWE Champion of Indian origin and Kavita Devi becoming the first female WWE Superstar from the country India has slowly but steadily established itself as something of a force to reckon in the business. And Mahal for one believes the rise in the number of Indian superstars in the leading pro-wrestling promotion in recent years is just the beginning.

“I see in the future more WWE Superstars are going to come down the pipeline to NXT and then are going to move on to Raw and SmackDown. More future champions are coming down the pipeline I can assure you that.

“Especially now seeing Indian talent guys like Indus Sher Kavita Devi they’re going to inspire the next generation. Especially someline like Kavita Devi the first-ever female WWE superstar imagine how many of our Indian youth females she’s going to inspire. So the future is looking very bright” said Mahal.

Would he miss not having fans on his return to the ring though? A bit of yes and no both from the man who also enjoyed a short reign as the United States Champion in addition to his memorable WWE Championship run.

“I do a little bit. I would love to make this comeback in India in person. But the ThunderDome is something spectacular and this is actually the first time I’m stepping into the ThunderDome with a virtual crowd. We’re going to have a special ThunderDome audience virtual crowd it’s going to be our WWE Universe from India so I’m very excited for that. So this is going to be the second best thing.

“But nonetheless just like a live WWE show the ThunderDome is going to have pyro lights everything. It’s going to be a spectacular setup so it’s going to be very close to the real thing” said Mahal who also teased at a possible reunion with the Singh Brothers in the upcoming show.

When asked to reflect on the highs and lows of his career spanning more than a decade a major chunk of which has been spent at the WWE Mahal said he was happy with all the lessons he learnt along the way and that he wouldn’t “change a single thing.”

“Two things. Obviously winning the WWE Championship against Randy Orton that was a big big accomplishment representing India on the world stage being the first-ever WWE Indian champion. Second thing would be having longevity in WWE and going through different changes in my career from debuting with the Great Khali to being in 3MB to being released from WWE and then making a comeback and then within 10 months of making that comeback becoming WWE Champion.

“So it’s not really one highlight but I would say just my overall career I wouldn’t change a single thing. I loved the way it’s went down I’ve learnt so many lessons I went through hardships and prevailed and just like this injury right now prevail and come back stronger and better than before cause the Maharaja knows how to make a comeback” Mahal signed off.

WWE Superstar Spectacle will premiere exclusively on Sony Ten 1 Sony Ten 3 and Sony MAX on India’s Republic Day Tuesday 26 January at 8 pm IST with commentary available in both English and Hindi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hdmVyYWdlLXlldC1jb25maWRlbnQtY29tZWRpYW4tY29pbmVkLTEwMDA1NTA5OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Average-yet-confident”: A comedian coined a Chinese equivalent to “mansplaining”,"Chinese women

“How can he be so average yet so full of confidence?”

That baffled line about the male psyche delivered by 28-year-old stand-up comedian Yang Li last year has become a catch-phrase for feminists in China. In the face of widespread sexism it was a moment of public pushback that is becoming less rare.

“Men are so mysterious” Yang said feigning a confused look on her face as she elaborated cuttingly about men’s self-involvement at the online comedy show Rock and Roast. “Unlike women who always think of themselves as unimportant men always think of themselves as the center of the universe. Every single sentence from men carries utmost importance and points out the right direction in which the world should advance.”

“Average-yet-confident” has swiftly been taken up by women desperate to describe their experiences of men with outsized egos who are oblivious to the privileges associated with their gender. On Weibo users used it to share their annoyance. “A male classmate who is attending the same online class as me changed his online bio to: ‘I am in a relationship please don’t hit on me.’ He is really the champion of all ‘average-yet-confident’ males!” one user wrote.

Such catchphrases have been a long time coming for women in China. While terms deriding men’s behavior have been gaining traction in the west for years observers say China is now coining its own phrases thanks in part to comedians like Yang pushing the envelope.

“In the English-language world there have long been terms like ‘mansplaining’ used to mock males who like to give their condescending opinions on things. But it’s [only] now that we are finally seeing Yang’s jokes gain popularity in the Chinese-speaking community” observed Luo Yansu (link in Chinese) a popular Chinese entertainment blogger in a widely-read post. “Yang’s jokes are in no way stoking gender opposition but [rather] females making their voices heard—which already has come way too late” wrote Luo.

Yang’s jokes are far milder than the takes on sex and racism delivered by her female western peers. Nonetheless they are an example of recent efforts by some Chinese women to counter the country’s deeply rooted misogyny.

China has long been a patriarchal society. But when the Communist Party came to power in 1949 it gave women greater rights including the freedom to work and marry who they liked. That progress was always limited—women remain a rare sight in the very top ranks of the Party—and over the years has stalled in the face of other concerns. Critics say that the country’s aging crisis a declining birth rate and a need to maintain social stability amid a slowing economy have prompted party leaders to try nudge women back into their traditional roles.

The Party “aggressively perpetuates gender norms and reduces women to their roles as dutiful wives mothers and baby breeders in the home in order to minimize social unrest and give birth to future generations of skilled workers” wrote Leta Hong Fincher the author of 2018’s Betraying Big Brother: the Feminist Awakening in China.

As a result China has slid backwards on metrics of gender equality over the last decade. Women are also frequently the target of sexist jokes—including on national television. In one notorious example a Chinese New Year gala in 2015 hosted by state broadcaster CCTV and viewed by over 690 million people depicted unmarried women over 30 as second-hand goods in a sketch. In another it hinted that female officials slept their way to the top.

Meanwhile the space for activism or even discussion of gender-related topics in China has shrunk in recent years part of a larger crackdown on freedom of speech under president Xi Jinping. In 2015 Beijing arrested five young feminists for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” a charge often used to target activists. The move forced many feminists to self-censor or go underground.

But the country could not escape the outrage of the 2018 #MeToo movement. In one prominent example that year a young woman took to social media with claims of sexual harassment by one of China’s most famous TV hosts Zhu Jun eventually bringing the case to court. Hearings began in December.

Since then public criticism of patriarchal values have become more common. Activists last year decried moves by state-owned media to use women as propaganda tools in efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic; there was also an online uproar when a state-run TV program downplayed their contribution to the fight against the virus. In December pop singer Tan Weiwei railed against domestic violence and victim blaming in her latest single—a rare occasion of a mainstream celebrity addressing an otherwise taboo topic.

And in January a cosmetics manufacturer was forced to apologize after releasing a controversial advert which depicted a woman escaping a stalker by using the company’s makeup-removing wipes: in doing so she had become too ugly for the stalker to show any interest.

Xiong Jing a Chinese feminist activist believes the public is starting to pay more attention to and more frequently call out everyday sexism.

“Although many organizations focusing on women’s rights were forced to shut down since 2015 there is a growing awareness of the Chinese public especially among well-educated women” of gender equality issues she told Quartz. While many “feel they have little power to change the situation” they are more willing to “engage in debates on gender issues which have become an important part of public discourse in China” she said.

Yang has told Chinese media (link in Chinese) that she likes to joke about “anything that is seen as inappropriate to be talked about by women such as feces urine and farts” to challenge viewers’ boundaries. In one joke Yang questioned why one of the powers of Black Widow a female superhero in Marvel’s Avengers series is her body’s engineered resistance to disease and aging. “Why should our imagination about women always focus on how young beautiful and fit they are? Why couldn’t a female hero become old?” asked Yang.

In another joke Yang replied to criticism about her stirring hatred towards men saying she feels men are too hard to please. “Men are unhappy even for being labeled as ‘average’—what exactly do they want?” she asked.

Not everyone appreciates Yang’s jokes. In December an internet user who billed himself as a defender of equal rights between men and women initiated a campaign on Weibo asking his followers to report Yang to China’s top media regulator. The user accuses Yang of “insulting all men” and “creating gender opposition” and said Yang’s jokes are “harmful to the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics.”

Yang has refrained from making many comments on the criticism against her apart from saying on Weibo earlier this month that stand-up comedy has become an increasingly difficult profession. Many of her fans defended her saying she isn’t out to ignite a gender war but is in fact an advocate for true respect between men and women.

Some pointed to a joke she told in December about her experience seeing a male gynecologist which she turned into an account that was as poignant as it was comic.

“That is the first time when I was lying in front of a standing man and both of us were completely at ease and had no non-relevant thoughts” Yang said. “I felt I was no longer just a woman but a human being that wanted to survive while the male doctor had only one purpose which was to help me survive. When he asked how I felt I said I felt completely free.”

After he was cross-examined by the attorneys the community members granted party status questioned Santora — and challenged his repeated assertion that he was a good neighbor.

T.L. and Crystal Lucky are professors at Villanova University and pastors at Sword of the Spirit Church which has been located on Union Avenue since 2003. The church is next door to Santora’s property.

Though they commended Santora for the improvements he has made to the property they warned him about the optics of his proposal.

“Typically communities of color bear the brunt of these types of facilities” T.L. Lucky said.

Crystal Lucky confronted Santora about his intentions.

“I know you don’t know who we are because as you were talking earlier you don’t even know our names” she said.

Though Santora was apologetic their next exchange when she asked if he would want a facility like this in his neighborhood made him defensive.

“I didn’t buy a house in an industrial center. No I would not want it. And I wouldn’t buy a house in an industrial center” Santora said.

Paul James a senior pastor at the CareView Community Church across the street from both the property and the Luckys’ church echoed the sentiment of the other pastors.

James said something like this would not happen in Upper Darby’s whiter neighborhoods like Drexel Hill.

“There are just some places that white folks know that they can’t do certain things” James said.

As the meeting reached its conclusion state Rep. Margo Davidson who represents the area spoke out against the application saying that Santora has been using Upper Darby as a dump site. She urged the zoning board to deny the application.

After the hearing WHYY News reached out to several of the parties involved. Robinson Santora’s attorney declined to comment.

Gibbs who is representing Yeadon talked about his client’s environmental justice concerns.

“Yeadon is a predominantly African American community. Historically what has happened is that these types of industrial polluters are situated incredibly close to predominantly African American communities” he said. “And I think that science will bear out that there’s some correlation between the proximity of industrial sites and some of the comorbidities that exist in the African American community.”

The legacy of environmental racism

Environmental racism is not rare across the United States research shows. A 2018 study shows that toxic waste sites for example are not evenly distributed throughout communities and that Black communities are usually the ones faced with hosting them.

Lansdowne was designated a Superfund site by the EPA from 1985 to 1991 because of toxic waste that resulted from a scientist’s at-home work with radium between 1924 and 1944.

Gibbs said he was proud to see people stand up for a cause at Thursday’s zoning hearing.

“I was the proudest I’ve been as a lawyer in my entire career — to speak for people who are fighting for their communities fighting for generations that are yet unborn” Gibbs said.

The racial elephant in the room is what stuck out to the pastors representing their churches — especially after the confrontation over whether Santora would feel the same way about a facility in his community.

“The history of racism environmental racism the history of redlining and … racist real estate practices have forced many people into communities where lots of people would not have wanted to live” Crystal Lucky said. “It’s a chicken or the egg situation. So what’s there first: the chemical plant or the houses?”

In a 2015 study titled Which came first people or pollution? researchers found that communities of color and low-income communities settled first — and that industrial facilities soon followed.

She said that she felt disrespected by Santora’s testimony.

“He never put a note in the mailbox he never reached out. And then he tries to say something about us last night about being a good neighbor” she said.

T.L Lucky said he is concerned about the racial makeup of the decision-makers.

“The voting members of that board had nobody that looked like me nobody that looked like any of these people that were in opposition to this particular application — but they all look like the applicant. That to me is problematic” he said.

James the pastor said he believes people in positions of power feel like they have agency in communities of color especially when they think no one is watching.

“There’s constant mention of Flint Michigan that municipalities are capable of horrific things when the electorate and the community is not astute to what is going on” James said.

Lansdowne resident Eric Aubrey who attended the zoning board meeting said people in his town are used to challenging these things.

“This is not our first run with environmentally damaging issues” Aubrey said. “The issues … are very near and dear to all the hearts and minds of people who have been here.”

Many of the people who attended Thursday night’s meeting credited Smith and the Change.org petition for calling attention to the zoning application.

Smith hopes the hearing’s second round set for Feb. 9 at 7 p.m. will put the issue to rest.

“We have them on the ropes. The next round is going to be a TKO. Be there” Smith said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ud2l0aW1lcy5jb20vZ2FyeXMtbWF5YS1lbmVyZ3ktc29saWQtd2FzdGUtcGxhbnQtaXMtbW92aW5nLWZvcndhcmQtcHJvamVjdC1sZWFkZXItc2F5cy9hcnRpY2xlXzM2N2IzZGIzLTdjNDktNTlmMC1iMGY2LTY0OTIzZTUzMTVmNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gary's Maya Energy solid waste plant is moving forward project leader says,"GARY — After a years-long tumultuous fight with environmental activists city leaders and students of a nearby charter school the owner of Maya Energy LLC says he is moving forward on his long-awaited solid waste recovery and recycling project at 35th and Chase.

Once complete the $50 million facility — in Gary's Glen Park section — would take in municipal waste and construction/demolition material from contractors and waste haulers in Lake County and the Chicago area.

Project leader Jimmy Ventura a former East Chicago councilman said he also envisions accepting material from the city of Gary and contractors as more homes and buildings are demolished citywide.

Permit application documents submitted to IDEM said Maya foresees the facility employing up to 124 high-paying workers.

In a phone interview last week Ventura said Maya would have 55 to 65 full-time employees at the onset and at least 100 total down the line.

The 165000-square-foot building will have two sorting lines for household garbage and C&D debris from demolished homes and commercial buildings.

The facility would process up to 2400 tons — or 4.8 million pounds — of waste per day though hazardous waste would not be allowed at the site.

Waste management

Waste accepted by Maya would be sorted and treated and recovered plastics cardboard paper glass and metals will be transferred off site for recycling.

Usable wood and combustible municipal solid waste will be processed and transferred via truck haulers for resale as fuel or recycling. Unusable MSW and construction and demolition materials will be transferred to a landfill for disposal according to Indiana Department of Environmental Management.

Once constructed the tipping floor and process lines will be housed in an enclosed building with solid walls sloped floors and doors with adequate ventilation for workers Ventura said.

Ventura said CP Group a recycling equipment firm based in San Francisco California is supplying ""state-of-the-art"" equipment and Maya is considering the use of robotics in addition to traditional workers to sort materials.

Opposition remains

Ventura's bid for permits from IDEM was met with fierce opposition from several groups including the Steel City Academy charter school at 2650 W. 35th Ave. which is located less than 100 feet away from the proposed plant.

Ventura also faced criticism from the Gary Common Council which rescinded its support of the project in late 2019 citing alleged misinformation about project scope only to later reverse course again in the face of a lawsuit.

In the lawsuit Ventura's company had alleged the legislative body violated Indiana law with its rejection and threw the project’s state approval off track late in the game.

The IDEM permit for Maya Energy — first submitted for consideration April 28 2017 — was approved shortly after the lawsuit filing in late 2019.

In speaking to his critics Ventura alleged his opponents spread misinformation about the project calling it a ""dump"" when in actuality Maya went through a rigorous vetting process through IDEM.

""Anytime you say anything about trash people get alarmed. Everyone thought getting this permit was easy that it was some political backdoor deal but it was nonpolitical"" Ventura said.

Ventura said he believes he had a ""positive"" chat recently with Mayor Jerome Prince and Eric Reaves head of community investment though no partnerships were etched nor promises made.

Prince who became mayor after the project's approval and Reaves described the conference call as routine. Reaves said they met with Ventura ""as we would with anyone looking to do business"" in Gary.

Both Prince and Reaves and acknowledged their familiarity with the company's controversies with the nearby school and the then-council members.

Due to IDEM's approval and past legal challenge Prince said he doesn't think the city had any legal options in blocking the project if it wanted to.

Reaves echoed that saying: ""We're neutral but we're certainly not going to overwhelmingly endorse him.""

Ventura said he has pledged to the city administration that Maya would pay to repave 35th Street and widen the road to account for heavier truck traffic. He said he would also be seeking a state matching grant.

'Stewards of the land'

The Maya Energy project had been in motion for a year in front of Gary zoning regulators before opposition picked up.

The opposition was led mainly by Steel City Academy students who loaded up buses and traveled to the Genesis Center on a cold blustery day to protest the project at the March 6 2018 City Council meeting largely calling the project ""a dump.""

This week the school's executive director Katie Kirley said she and the students are disappointed the project is moving forward.

""There's been no communication with Maya no circling back with us. There have been no commitments made to us that they will be good stewards of the land"" she said.

Ventura said he and his team fully intends to comply with all environmental regulations imposed by IDEM.

Kirley said her No. 1 priority is providing her students a safe learning environment and she hopes to work closely with the city to potentially find a new space in Gary for the school.

Since 2018 the charter school in partnership with groups like the Hoosier Environmental Council and Community Strategy Group had attempted to derail the project citing concerns about diesel fumes and truck traffic on 35th and the social injustice of yet another solid waste facility in Northwest Indiana's lowest income cities.

'A taste of advocacy'

Kirley said one positive takeaway is how the fight empowered her students to be more politically and civically engaged. Hundreds of students crowded a city council meeting at the Genesis Center on a cold and rainy and delivered letters to IDEM in Indianapolis asking the agency to deny Maya their permit.

""I think this experience has been powerful for our community. Our students got a taste of advocacy and for fighting for justice in an inequitable world"" Kirley said. ""It empowered them and showed they deserve to be heard. Those are the positives I’m seeking to find from it.""

Three Steel City students-turned-journalists Erin Addison Evan Addison and Andrew Arevalo even created a podcast about the school's fight.

The podcast ultimately garnered national recognition as a winner of The New York Times' first-ever student podcast competition and an interview with NPR's Audie Cornish.

Kirley said the fight against Maya even though it ended unfavorably ignited and reinforced the school's ""social justice spirit"" that they will carry onto in 2021 and beyond.

""It's become a part of our DNA"" Kirley said.

End users

Ventura said as material comes in much of it will be sorted recycled and/or bailed and sold to end-users.

Magnets will help sort metals and aluminum and the remainder — considered lower grade — will be bailed and sold as refused-derived fuel to end users instead of going to a landfill.

""It's not an easy sell but there is a market for it"" Ventura said.

The Hoosier Environmental Council which fiercely opposed the project long argued to IDEM that Maya Energy would not serve a solid waste need in Lake County.

The group argued the company’s application materials had lacked any contracts commitments or even statements of interest from local refuse services or other potential customers.

Ventura said last week that he has ""some contracts already signed"" by end users and ""five or six letters of intent"" though he declined to share any names upon request.

Ventura said Maya will reach its goal of recycling 50 percent of its waste.

He said soil borings were conducted on the property last this month and submitted to an engineering firm for review.

He said he hopes to start construction on the 165-square foot building in the spring and be completed by the end of 2021.

In approving the project IDEM said Maya Energy has established there is a need for a solid waste facility in the Region — a requirement that must be met for approval.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZWNvcmkub3JnLzIwMjEtMS0yNC1wb2xsdXRpb24tcHJvYmxlbXMtcGVyc2lzdC1hdC10aHJlZS1yaS1sb2NhdGlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pollution Problems Persist at 3 Rhode Island Locations,"A lack of urgency and a deference to business interests by Rhode Island officials have allowed three high-profile pollution problems to fester. All of the ongoing environmental degradation has been happening for more than a decade.

It’s long been the modus operandi of a state more interested in placating businesses than enforcing the laws they violate even as this shortsighted practice essentially punishes those companies that abide by the rules.

Many of the state’s environmental regulations are selectively enforced depending if you are a 72-year-old Charlestown man charged with the possession of striped bass during the closed season an industry with political pull or a lawmaker with a business interest.

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) the agency that “serves as the chief steward of the state’s natural resources” and whose mission “is to protect restore and promote our environment” didn’t make anyone available for an interview for this article. Instead a spokesperson answered some preliminary questions sent in an email requesting an interview.

The following is a look at the three situations:

Truk-Away Landfill

The Warwick landfill closed in 1978 and operated before strict regulations were in place. No one knows for sure what is buried beneath 36 acres in the middle of the Buckeye Brook watershed. Remediation efforts during the past 43 years have amounted to no more than 2 feet of loam being spread on top of abused land loaded with harmful materials.

During a June 1982 state inspection of the property a former Truk-Away Landfill employee told the Rhode Island Department of Health he had been responsible for overseeing the disposal of hundreds of drums of chemical waste. Those drums contained among other things benzyl chloride spent solvents chlorobenzene dyes pigments and intermediate compounds made from benzene reactions phenols hydrogen peroxide and benzenesulfonyl chloride.

Those drums represent but a slice of what was and may have been dumped at the landfill. Truk-Away Landfill opened in 1970 and accepted municipal and industrial waste until its closure eight years later.

The list of material dumped there is long and concerning — medical waste electrical waste paint cans mercury film packs fly ash still bottoms and hydroxide sludge. The site had an oil disposal pit and the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been detected.

Several reports have been written to assess what is there but so far little action has been taken to remove any of it. The most-recent report a 2142-page tome was published last June by GZA GeoEnvironmental Inc. It was prepared for DEM.

The nearly yearlong site investigation report by GZA noted among other things:

Light nonaqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) were found in groundwater monitoring wells. These hydrocarbons tend to contaminate soil and groundwater for long periods of time and are persistent organic pollutants.

On the landfill perimeter especially the northeastern side waste appears to have been deposited into the wetland area.

Landfill gas containing levels of methane above DEM’s criteria of 25 percent of the lower explosive limit were observed in samples from two perimeter monitoring probes along the site’s western edge.

Exceedances for VOCs benzene chlorobenzene ethylbenzene and vinyl chloride and semi-metals/metals arsenic cadmium lead and nickel were detected.

Some surface water samples showed exceedences for state water-quality criteria for chlorobenzene semivolatile organic compounds iron cadmium nickel and zinc.

GZA eventually concluded “that there is a low potential for significant risk of harm to ecological receptors in the adjacent wetlands. This opinion is based on comparing contaminant concentrations in surface water and sediment samples to ecological risk screening benchmarks.”

However the environmental consultant’s conclusion for a 54-acre property owned by the Rhode Island Department of Administration hasn’t lessened the concern of neighbors such as Philip D’Ercole.

The site’s toxic stew combined with minimal remediation efforts during the past four decades continues to annoy and worry neighbors and environmentalists.

Three waterbodies — Brush Neck Cove Little Pond and Buckeye Brook — are all less than a mile from the former landfill on Warwick Industrial Drive. Wetlands surround much of the landfill and appear to drain toward Buckeye Brook. Dark red- and orange-stained soils evidence of leachate outbreaks have been documented leading from the landfill’s edges into the surrounding wetlands.

D’Ercole and his wife Carmen have lived on Edgehill Road on the shores of Warwick Pond for the past 18 years. Concerned that contaminated runoff and groundwater flow from the landfill property is making its way into the pond they don’t eat any of the fish they catch and they don’t go swimming.

Philip D’Ercole recently told ecoRI News that the lack of remediation is “absolutely frustrating.” He’s worried about the long-term environmental impacts public-health risks and his property value posed by the improperly closed landfill.

D’Ercole said Friends of Warwick Ponds a group he helped create and other local residents want a guarantee from state officials that there is no leaching of chemicals and toxins from the landfill into the nearby wetlands. He said that would likely require the physical removal of waste and contaminated soil. He understands such a project would be expensive but believes not properly remediating the site would be even costlier.

“The landfill has been closed for four decades and the toxic chemicals are still there and still present the potential to leach into the wetlands” D’Ercole said. “What an unbelievable lack of institutional control.”

DEM has proposed a remedial alternative that focuses on the removal of the light nonaqueous phase liquids noting that historic sampling indicates that these products contain PCBs that have exceeded the analytical thresholds established by the Toxic Substances Control Act.

Where remediation stands according to DEM spokesperson: “The Remedial Action phase of the project has not commenced yet. This phase would commence following Department concurrence with the findings of the Site Investigation Report which also includes the State/PRP Group addressing the outstanding Department technical comments as well as performing public notice/comment period requirements of the Site Remediation Regulations.”

Hopkins Hill Sand & Stone

The West Greenwich quarry on New London Turnpike a Cardi Corp. subsidiary had been operating without a Rhode Island pollutant discharge elimination system (RIPDES) permit for 16 years before DEM decided to apply a bit of bureaucratic muscle.

In late February of last year DEM issued a notice of violation (NOV) to Hopkins Hill Sand & Stone LLC and the property’s owner Hopkins Hill Road Realty LLC for environmental violations arising from the mining of sand and stone at the facility.

The NOV charged both parties with violations of Rhode Island’s Water Pollution Control Act and state water-quality and pollutant-discharge elimination system regulations. The enforcement action included a $67896 penalty. It also required the parties to immediately cease the discharge of all processed water and stormwater from the facility to nearby wetlands until a permit is issued and all the required controls are installed and operational.

Hopkins Hill Sand & Stone appealed. The quarry is still operating illegally and polluting a nearby conservation area. Nothing has changed.

The mining operation which conducts blasting as this 2016 Cardi Corp. video on YouTube and these 2018 and 2017 Facebook videos show abuts the Big River Management Area an 8319-acre conservation area that features streams wetlands and the Big Nooseneck Congdon and Carr rivers.

Quarry waste runoff that flows off property used by one of the more recognizable corporations in the state and onto land owned by the Rhode Island Water Resources Board and managed by DEM has left plenty of environmental scars: stormwater damage accumulating silt in stream beds and out-of-place gravel and rocks deposited in the conservation area.

DEM long knew the Cardi Corp. subsidiary was operating illegally. A June 14 2018 letter of noncompliance sent to Hopkins Hill Sand & Stone by DEM noting that the company is in violation of the federal Clean Water Act and state law makes reference to another letter sent nearly 14 years earlier (Oct. 13 2004) that notified Hopkins Hill Road LLC that it needed “to apply for and receive approval from the DEM RIPDES program for the permitting of stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity.”

During all that time another Rhode Island business learned that DEM threats are toothless.

Where remediation stands according to DEM spokesperson: “An appeal was filed on the NOV so the ordered actions in the NOV and the penalty assessed in the NOV are legally stayed until the appeal is concluded. We are in settlement negotiations with the respondents to resolve the NOV. No permit has been issued and the discharges have not ceased.”

Rhode Island Recycled Metals

The waterfront scrap yard on Allens Avenue in Providence has been flaunting its contempt for the state’s environmental regulations since it began operating illegally 12 years ago.

It took DEM six years to respond with legal action despite Save The Bay urging the state agency to take action sooner. The scrap-metal processing facility sits atop a former Superfund site that was contaminated during the 1980s by a computer and electronics shredding company. The property has tested positive for PCBs.

Rhode Island Recycled Metals (RIRM) the operator of scrap-metal yards at 434 and 444 Allens Ave. opened both sites without required permits. The business has since been cited for inadequate runoff control systems and improper operations.

Since 2009 pollution from the capped 6-acre brownfield has flowed into the Providence River. The facility at 444 Allens Ave. has several vessels designated for demolition sitting offshore. The vessels including a fully submerged former Soviet nuclear submarine and a partially submerged ferry are in violation of environmental regulations including spilling oil into the Providence River.

The Coastal Resources Management Council insisted that the submarine be fully demolished by 2012. RIRM ignored that order. The business also brought in a handful of other vessels for scrap without authorization.

Early last year RIRM was given another 90 days to comply with a new consent order for removing the vessels. RIRM has agreed to stop bringing in vessels and can no longer cut up new boats or vehicles.

Since the original complaint was filed by DEM on March 4 2015 more than 70 hearings reports and conferences have been held in Rhode Island Superior Court. The waterfront business eventually paid a $25000 penalty.

About a year after DEM took formal legal action against its operations at 434 and 444 Allens Ave. RIRM opened another junk collection facility down the street at 278 Allens Ave. without obtaining the required permits or having a stormwater management plan in place.

Where remediation stands according to DEM spokesperson: “RIRM is operating under various orders issued by the Superior Court. RIRM continues to work on the removal of the submarine. There is no schedule that has been set by the court to complete the work. Once the submarine is removed RIRM intends to remove the two remaining sunken vessels (the tug and the ferry). The barge was removed (not relocated). Minimum stormwater controls are installed (haybales and silt fence). The $25000 penalty was paid.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pdWNuLm9yZy9uZXdzL21hcmluZS1hbmQtcG9sYXIvMjAyMTAxL3BsYXN0aWMtd2FzdGUtZnJlZS1pc2xhbmRzLXByb2plY3QtbGF1bmNoZXMtemVyby1wbGFzdGljLXdhc3RlLXRvb2xraXRzLXRvdXJpc20tc2VjdG9yLXNtYWxsLWlzbGFuZC1kZXZlbG9waW5nLXN0YXRlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plastic Waste Free Islands project launches zero plastic waste toolkits for the tourism sector in Small Island Developing ...,"With strong support from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) the Plastic Waste Free Islands project has been developing practical solutions to plastic leakage in six participating islands in Oceania and the Caribbean regions: Fiji Vanuatu Samoa Antigua and Barbuda Saint Lucia Grenada.

The most recent outcome of the project is Plastic Waste Free Tourism toolkits developed from in-depth consultation with the tourism industry in the two regions. The toolkits address island stakeholders’ desire to see the costs and benefits of changing to more sustainable alternatives.

Each toolkit is targeted at different stakeholders in the tourism sector:

Hotels

Cruise Ships

Tour Operators and Destination Managers

In each kit relevant stakeholders can find best practices from around the world concrete suggestions for implementing change and information about return on investment. The toolkits identify problem areas and provide tips and tricks for hygienic and convenient zero plastic waste options.

The new toolkits provide clear and practical guidance for tour operators and destination managers on how to reduce waste. Uniquely they demonstrate tangible and persuasive returns on investment - including values of cost savings and reduced carbon emissions associated with implementing specific more sustainable solutions.” Dr Anna Spenceley GSTC Director; Independent Panel Member Travalyst; Chair IUCN WPCA Tourism and Protected Areas Specialist Group

The tools are a great initiative and will be very useful for tourism businesses as it not only looks at the hygiene and safety but also reducing single use plastic. It will also be very beneficial as it also provides cost cutting alternatives/options which hotels can consider.” Robert Ah Sam Planning & Development Manager - Samoa Tourism Authority

To ensure relevance and effectiveness of the tools the project team invites interested parties to test the toolkits in practice and actively share learnings so we can keep on improving the tools. The team will also be available for supporting interested parties to tailor the tools or help integrate them into existing sustainability programmes and policies.

About Plastic Waste Free Islands

Over 14 million tonnes of plastic waste enter our oceans every year making plastic pollution one of the major challenges of our time. Islands are particularly vulnerable to the effects of plastic pollution having to deal with plastic debris that washes ashore from other places as well as plastic waste they generate themselves. In 2019 with support from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) IUCN launched the Plastic Waste Free Islands (PWFI) project as part of its global Close the Plastic Tap Programme. In collaboration with national governments and the private sector Plastic Waste Free Islands seeks to provide practical solutions that add value to plastic waste based on local knowledge best practices and the understanding of volumes and quality of plastic waste available. The planned solutions focus on addressing plastic waste at the source whilst unlocking financial opportunities for the tourism fisheries and waste management sectors in SIDS of the Caribbean and Oceania. Nine solution concepts have been identified including waste to product net-to-net and bottle-to-bottle recycling.

Island working groups have been established to guide the development of prototypes and implement pilots in their local setting. These groups are collectively working towards the shared ambition: healthy seas healthy communities and happy tourists.

The long-term vision is to create a Blueprint for Plastic Waste Free Islands so that all solutions can be scaled up and rolled out to other islands across the globe. The Blueprint will outline how to implement lasting change in three sectors: tourism fisheries and waste management. To find out more about the Plastic Waste Free Islands Project visit the website.

For 18000 weeks according to David Smith his mother Grace Smith made sure her waste collection team had refreshments waiting for them.

Her generosity was well known and first brought to this reporter’s attention when a worker was injured on the job a couple of years ago. Ms. Grace called to ask who it was and if “Is it one of mine? I take good care of them and I pray my guys are OK.”

She relayed a story of how hot it was outside one day as she was watched the crew collect the garbage along her street. She said they looked as if they could use a drink of water.

She offered them bottles of water that day and started leaving a cooler with drinks and later added snacks as well.

“For 35 years she would say ‘David I have to go I have to take care of my trash collectors.’ She would then tell me how she needed two cans of coke two root beers cracker jacks and candy” David said. “She was good to them and in they were good to her.”

Grace told her son that she wanted a garbage truck in her funeral procession.

“Her son reached out to us and said it was her wish to have a truck in the procession” Waste Management Director Public Affairs Lisa Doughty said. “They were like part of her family. She was part of the WM family and we began working on making it happen.”

This is just one example of the impact she had on the lives of so many people throughout Orange.

In her obituary which can be read in it’s entirety on page 4 it reads: She leaves behind a legacy that will be long remembered in the hearts of those who knew her. She was over the top generous. Each week over the past 35 years she placed prepared snacks and drinks for her garbage men and placed them outside on her porch using her walker. She had a card ministry and over the past decade has mailed thousands of cards to the sick and those who needed a kind word. She led the Joy Club at her church which she dearly loved.

Joy in JOY Club stood for Just Older Youths. A phrase which described her perfectly.

She is survived by her three children Harold Smith Jr. and wife Deanna David Smith and wife Nancy and Patti Cochran and husband Lawrence. She has four grandsons Jason Eric Brandon and Adam. She has eight great grandchildren Payton Zachry Caleb Nathan Samantha Sara Cameron and Hayden and one “adopted son” Mike Feagin."

Featured Athletes

These four athletes came fresh off competing at World’s Strongest Man and once again competed against each other for the title at the Mammoth Strength Challenge V.

Trey Mitchell

Earning his pro card in 2017 Mitchell was able to claim four top-two finishes in 5 events at the Strongman Corporation Nationals to give him his pro card and the chance to compete against the pros. Since his pro debut Mitchell has won America’s Strongest Man placed second at Giants Live North America and has made the final at his first appearance at World’s Strongest Man. Ready to take on many challengers at this event he showed up in his trademark cowboy hat ready to lock horns with the entire roster.

Bobby Thompson

The massive Virginian Thompson was another athlete to watch this weekend for he has packed on the muscle over the years and anything now seems possible for his titanic strength. He was locked into this competition making him dangerous and one to not sleep on. Nicknamed “The American Nightmare” this strongman’s pre-event gaze is one to put shivers down your spine and once that whistle blows it is game on. He is nearly always the first to push pull grab and fight with zero concern for anything other than a win. Thompson has great pure pressing power particularly with logs and axles.

Gabriel Pena

This 2019 American Super Heavyweight National Champion was hailed as a pro prospect a year prior to this incredible victory. However a string of injuries set him back slightly from a faster shot at the pros. Pena brings the fire of a thousand hells with him to the competitive field. His youth the road blocks he’s overcome to get his chance at the pro ranks and his passion for strength all combine to give us an athlete with a burning desire to succeed.

Wesley Clayborn

Clayborn holds the American record in the Atlas Stone load at a whopping 565 pounds exceeding the previous set by Brian Shaw. Only Tom Stoltman has surpassed him on the world stage. Clayborn holds the world record for the Keg Load and was until quite recently the most underrated strongman. With serious strength and a will to be the best Clayborn is a threat to all competitors and cannot be overlooked.

In the case of Uganda people staying around water bodies for centuries improvised means of navigating the waters.

And for unknown reasons India’s role in the evolution of Uganda’s transport system has been underestimated.

Not only did they build the Uganda Railways but India provided the second-hand rail slippers and wagons that started the railways system. Through the British Indian Steamship Company steam ships were introduced on Lake Victoria.

In the late 1880s the British owner of the Bombay-based British Indian Steamship Company Sir William Mackinnon ordered the construction of steamships for East Africa.

Prior to this coming into the interior of East Africa was by trekking while goods were transported by porters on their heads.

First steamer ship

“The first of these was a stern wheel paddle steamer. It was dispatched in knocked-down form to Mombasa. The second was a 70-ton single-screw steamer specially designed with overland transportation to Lake Victoria” Ian H. Grant writes in The Empire.

The packaging cases for the 70-ton single-screw steamer called SS Mackinnon stayed in Mombasa for five years after the company meant to put it on Lake Victoria went bankrupt.

When the British government agreed to establish Uganda Railway they purchased the knocked down steamship for the newly created Uganda Railways.

“It was purchased by the agents of the British government on behalf of the Uganda protectorate administration. At that time the colonial administration badly wanted to have a steam ship on the waters of Lake Victoria as the easiest way to ease transport to the East African coast” Grant writes.

The ship had 3000 parts and packages which were to be transported to Lake Victoria across Kenya. Before the parts could be put together for sail on Lake Victoria there was need for the establishment of a dockyard.

Within the 3000 packages were tools and equipment essential for establishing a dockyard. But some never made the journey as Grant explains.

“These were earmarked for earliest dispatch and some hundreds did start on the precarious journey but many of them stopped far short of their final destination when the human or animal bearers expired or deserted. Some eventually reached Port Victoria where Nzoia River enters the north of the lake close to the present day boundary between Kenya and Uganda” he writes.

“Having purchased the steamer ship the British foreign office was oblivious to the challenges of having the parts transported to Lake Victoria and have them assembled. Three shipbuilders from The Clyde were engaged and sent to Mombasa. They were under contract to the Uganda Protectorate for the purpose of putting together the SS William Mackinnon on Lake Victoria. The senior engineer was Richard Dick Grant and his assistants were Robert Brownlee iron fitter and John MacMillan carpenter.”

Almost three years after the parts arrived in Mombasa on June 4 1900 SS William MacKinnon was launched on Lake Victoria. Her maiden voyage was from Port Victoria to Entebbe the government seat.

When World War I broke out in 1917 SS MacKinnon was turned into a gunboat and patrolled Lake Victoria against the Germans in Tanganyika present day Tanzania.

It only resumed her passenger and cargo travels after the war. In 1929 SS MacKinnon reached the end of her working life when she was withdrawn from service taken out into deep water and destroyed.

Having established the Uganda Railways the Foreign Office established a committee they called “the railway committee” which in 1901 ordered the construction of three other steam ships for the Uganda Protectorate administration.

They were SS Winifred and SS Sybil the sisters as they were called and SS Clement Hill. Their design and construction were put under the supervision of Sir EJ Reed a naval architect.

SS Winifred was launched in February 1903 and her sister a year later. They had a speed of 10knots with restricted cargo since they had to carry a lot of wood to fuel them While SS Clement Hill was launched in 1907.

“They were handsome vessels with comfortable cabins for a dozen first-class passengers large cool saloons and dining rooms electric light canopies and mosquito screens and excursions on the lake became a highly desirable diversion” writes Grant.

It was SS Clement Hill that brought British secretary of state for colonies Winston Churchill to Entebbe.

In My African Journey Churchill described his ride: “I woke the next morning to find myself afloat on a magnificent ship. Its long and spacious decks are as snowy as those of a pleasure yacht. It is equipped with baths electric light and all modern necessities. There is an excellent table also a well-selected library. Smart blue-jackets with ebony faces are polishing the brasswork dapper white-clad British naval officers pace the bridge.

SS Winifred (above) was launched in February 1903 and her sister SS Sybil a year later.

“We are steaming at ten knots across an immense sea of fresh water as big as Scotland lifted higher than the summit of Ben Nevis. At times we are a complete circle of lake and sky without a sign of land... the air is cool and fresh and the scenery splendid and yet our route crosses the equator.”

Just like SS MacKinnon the two sister steamers Winifred and Sybil were turned into gunboats and patrolled the British part of Lake Victoria during World War I.

By 1908 the railways committee had ordered the construction of three more steamers. These included Nyanza Rusinga and Usoga.

Each of these was more than 1000 tons. At the time of their entry in 1913 the authorities in London had decided to have all the vessels on Lake Victoria converted from steam to oil firing.

Writing in Death of a Fleet at Kisumu McCrow Malcolm says water transport in the colony was not only reserved for Lake Victoria but also other water bodies in the Uganda Protectorate.

“In addition there were tugs lighters dredgers and stern-wheel paddle steamers on the Nile lakes of Kioga and Albert. The Uganda Protectorate named their craft after the famous explorers of the country Lake Albert having the Samuel Baker and Lake Kioga the Speke Stanley and Grant” Malcolm writes.

The two sisters Winifred and Sybil ended their service under the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation in the 1930s and 1960s respectively.

“In 1936 the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation scuttled her (Winifred) and her remains were scrapped in 1954. While Sybil was destroyed in 1967 and the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation scuttled her at Kisumu” Malcolm writes.

Usoga and Rusinga entered service as military steamers during World War I. But after the war they turned into passengers steamers.

They had two weekly services around the lake. Rusinga started from Port Bell in Uganda going to Kisumu Musoma Bukoba and Mwanza where it arrived on Mondays while Usoga commenced from Kisumu going in the opposite direction of Rusinga.

The passenger cabins were divided into three classes. The first and second class were mostly for the Whites while the Africans travelled in the third deck which sometimes was used as a cargo holding area.

According to McCrow Malcolm she was finally put to rest in the 1990s. “In 1975 the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation laid her up at the Lake Victoria Port of Kisumu and in the 1990s she sank at the quayside” he writes.

While Rusinga which had entered service at the same time with Usoga was first damaged in 1927 when it caught fire and withdrawn from service in 1966 it managed to return into service under private ownership.

The investment comes despite challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.

New solar installations nationwide are expected to increase 43 percent from 2019 to a record 19 gigawatts of capacity installed in 2020 according to projections from the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar also accounted for 43 percent of all new electricity generating capacity added this year.

The state currently has 20 solar farms under active development that will generate more than 2.2 gigawatts of power according to Michael Vickerman policy director for RENEW Wisconsin. Vickerman said that’s enough capacity to account for roughly 7 percent of the state’s annual electricity use.

“So there will have to be another wave — several waves in fact — of solar coming down the pike after the first 20 projects have been built” said Vickerman.

The shift in the electricity generation mix has been driven by declining costs of utility-scale solar as coal has become more costly to operate Vickerman said. Solar costs have dropped more than 80 percent in the last decade.

Vickerman added that customer demand tax incentives relative ease of permitting and willing landowners have also led utilities to invest in solar power.

Madison-based Alliant Energy announced this year that it would phase out coal from its electricity generation by 2040 including the retirement of its Edgewater coal plant in Sheboygan. In May Alliant detailed plans to invest $900 million to add 675 megawatts of solar as part of a goal to add 1 gigawatt of solar power by the end of 2023.

“Our solar projects we’re very attractive from the standpoint that they are the right choice for our customers thinking about this long term and looking at the generation” said David de Leon president of Alliant subsidiary Wisconsin Power and Light. “So not only is it that the cost of these projects have been coming down and have given us an opportunity to really incorporate those into our operations from a cost perspective. But also it’s doing the right thing for the environment.”

Alliant also purchased solar projects in Rock and Green counties this fall that are expected to contribute to the utility’s goal of building 1 gigawatt of solar.

WEC Energy Group which owns We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service also pledged to go carbon neutral in the next three decades. In November the utility company announced it was retiring 1800 megawatts of fossil fuel generation and investing $2 billion in renewable energy that includes 800 megawatts of new solar power.

“A lot of this is made possible also because of the drop in prices from solar from (the) last five or 10 years” said Brendan Conway spokesperson for WEC Energy Group. “Things like this would not have been possible in the past because obviously anytime we’re looking at a project it has to make sense fiscally because that’s what our customers expect.”

WEC Energy Group has already received approval from regulators to invest in 300 megawatts of utility-scale solar projects. They include the state’s largest solar farm Badger Hollow in Iowa County and the Two Creeks solar project which went online in November. Subsidiaries We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service co-own those projects with Madison Gas and Electric.

The first phase of the Badger Hollow solar farm was set to go into service by the end of this year but the coronavirus pandemic set the project back four months. However the COVID-19 crisis has created only minor delays for utility project construction and little slowdown in new announcements according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The recently passed $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill may provide additional incentive for solar development with the inclusion of a two-year extension on a solar energy investment tax credit at 26 percent. The tax incentive was expected to wind down next year.

Tom Content executive director of the Citizens Utility Board said the challenge with making a rapid transition to renewables and solar power is that customers don’t want to pay twice.

“You don’t want to have to pay for the solar plants that will be needed but continue paying ad nauseam for the coal plants that are no longer needed and the utilities want to shut down” said Content.

Ratepayers have been paying off utility investments in pollution controls that were installed at coal plants in the last decade. Content urged utilities to consider innovative financing to pay off those investments noting customers shouldn’t be penalized as part of the rapid energy transition.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Things couldn’t be much closer than they are at the 54-hole mark at The American Express where 25 (!!!) players sit within five strokes of the lead. Of course there are much more than bragging rights at stake at PGA West Sunday. Here’s everything you need to know about the tournament’s purse including payout information and winner’s share.

The American Express final round preview

A chaotic leaderboard begins (fittingly) with a three-way tie for the lead. Max Homa Si Woo Kim and Tony Finau each enter Sunday’s final round at 15 under good enough for a one-stroke hold on first. But perhaps more interesting than what has happened for the trio of leaders is what hasn’t. Should any of the three 54-hole leaders follow through with a victory on Sunday it would mark the end of a winless streak. Homa is winless since the 2019 Wells Fargo Kim hasn’t claimed victory since the 2017 Players and Finau hasn’t won since his first PGA Tour victory at the Puerto Rico Open in 2016.

Homa Kim and Finau will not only have to outlast each other they’ll also have to outlast a crowded field. Francesco Molinari (-12) Paul Casey and Patrick Cantlay (both -11) are all within striking distance heading into Sunday’s final round. A strong Sunday for Molinari would mark his first top-10 finish since the 2019 Masters.

Further back Sungjae Im Gary Woodland and Abe Ancer all face outside shots at top-10 finishes needing big final round performances to vault into the conversation.

Below is the payout information for The American Express’ $6.7 million purse; you can catch all the action on Golf Channel Sunday beginning a 3:00 p.m. ET.

During the first rotation UCLA would decide to only use five gymnasts for the vault opposed to the usual six. Despite this decision UCLA scored a 49.200 on the vault with senior Nia Dennis scoring UCLA's best score on the rotation 9.900.

ASU started with one of its strongest events of the season — bars. ASU would prove they could compete with one of the premier gymnastics programs in the country.

Sophomore Hannah Scharf continued her run of form scoring a 9.875 on bars. Senior Cairo Leonard-Baker and freshman Emily White each scored a 9.850 on bars.

FINAL

ASU did not break 49.000 on the vault in either of their previous meets this year and that streak continued with ASU's 48.975 score on vault. Scharf scored a team-best 9.875 on vault with freshman Jada Mangahas and White each contributing a 9.800 to ASU's final score.

It was a scary start on bars for UCLA as freshman Chae Campbell fell off the bars during her routine. Despite this Campbell still scored an 8.950. Freshman Frida Esparza scored a meet best 9.900 as UCLA scored a 48.975 on the rotation.

ASU's first four routines on floor would all receive scores under 9.700. Mangahas would then score a 9.850 and Scharf would finish strong with a 9.875 on the team's final floor exercise routine. ASU finished with a 48.725 team total on floor.

UCLA was helped to score a 49.000 on beam thanks to key performances from junior Samantha Sakti who scored a 9.900 and junior Margzetta Frazier and Esparza each adding a 9.800 score.

Just like ASU UCLA's first three gymnasts would score below a 9.700 on floor to begin the final rotation. But UCLA's last three gymnasts were almost perfect. Campbell and Frazier scored a 9.900 and Dennis scored a meet-winning 9.950 on her floor exercise.

Scharf and White led the way for ASU on beam each scoring a 9.850. ASU's beam routine was not enough to pull the meet away from UCLA as the Bruins took a 196.150 to 195.950 victory.

ASU's next meet will be against Oregon State on Jan. 29 at 5 p.m.

Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp. said on Friday it plans to sever ties with the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race after this year's 49th edition of the contest citing economic concerns.

“After careful review of sponsorships in light of current economic conditions we’ve decided to conclude our sponsorship of the Iditarod following the 2021 race” Ashley Alemayehu an Exxon Mobil spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

Exxon’s sponsorship focused on the race’s education program which provides study material to schools nationwide.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) a longtime Iditarod foe claimed a victory with the decision.

“No reputable company wants to associate with a race that forces dogs to run until they collapse"" PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said calling on other sponsors to quit ""this spectacle of suffering.""

Animal rights activists have criticized the Iditarod for pushing its dog teams too hard in racing and training and for subjecting its canine contestants to dangerous conditions. Five dogs died during or immediately after 2017's race.

Iditarod mushers and officials have long defended their dog-care record citing the army of volunteer veterinarians involved and extensive dog health screening conducted before each race.

In response to Exxon’s decision PETA plans to withdraw its Iditarod-related shareholder resolution and cancel an anti-Exxon advertising and protest campaign set to start next week the group said.

Iditarod representatives were not immediately available for comment.

Exxon’s move follows the loss in recent years of such longtime corporate sponsors as Alaska Airlines and Wells Fargo.

This year’s race has been sharply pared back due to the coronavirus pandemic to an 860-mile out-and-back trail instead of the traditional 1000-mile route from Anchorage to Nome.

The race is due to start in Anchorage on March 6."

These supplies – 334 ventilators and 19 400 pulse oximeters - will equip health facilities to monitor and improve the health outcomes of COVID-19 patients particularly in intensive care units.

The shipments were distributed at the end of 2020 to hospitals across the 5 countries of Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Montenegro North Macedonia and Serbia as well as Kosovo (in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)). All these materials meet WHO quality and safety standards to keep frontline health care workers and patients safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Courtesy of District 94

For 27 years West Chicago Community High School American Government teachers have prepared senior students to “live” democracy through the award-winning semesterlong legislative simulation.

Yet during a global pandemic teachers were challenged to find a way to continue the highly successful tradition that engages students by “living” government rather than just reading about it.

Once it was determined that students were not going to be attending in-person classes during first semester American Government teachers John Chisholm Bobbie Felfle and Candace Fikis were implored by senior students to find a way to make the simulation work remotely.

“From the beginning of the semester students asked us if we were going to do the legislative simulation because they knew it was a senior tradition in Government” said teacher Candace Fikis.

“They got online at 6 a.m. to secure their political topics they were passionate about worked outside of school hours to research their issue and advocate on its behalf and so many students stepped up to be leaders from committee chairs to caucus leaders to the speaker of the House.

“It was their enthusiasm for political action that drove us to re-imagine this simulation online.”

The teachers re-imagined committee hearings and held them virtually Dec. 18. Based on how successful that day went they agreed to move ahead with a virtual full session. While preparing for committee hearings students told the teachers they were excited to be doing a “traditional” senior year experience and it provided some students some extra motivation to be sure they were caught up in class.

As the school's technology integration specialist Dave Clarke was challenged with how to manage half of the senior class almost 250 students in an online experience that could keep students engaged allowed increased participation opportunities and allowed all of the roles in a legislative full session to be carried out.

“While many other programs were unfortunate casualties of the pandemic” teacher John Chisholm said “the students government team and Mr. Clarke banded together to make this senior simulation a resounding success.”

Clarke created a “war room” that was key to the management of this large undertaking on Jan. 13. With multiple Chromebooks connecting groups of students by not only political affiliation but by strict moderate or centrist to further define their beliefs students were able to caucus for discussion prior to taking a vote.

In addition all students were able to see and hear those testifying view presentations and see vote tallies as they came in.

“Watching the students in live time in our 'war room' with multiple computers open was an amazing experience” Chisholm said. What they were able to simulate and accomplish should give our democracy hope for the future.”

The bills written by the first semester senior class that made it to the full session were:

HB119: Restore Voting Rights for Felons

HB111: Ban Assault Weapons

HB120: Mask Mandates

HB125: Zero Tolerance for Teens Driving with Alcohol

HB126: Police Repurposing

To read the details of these bills visit sites.google.com/d94.org/2021governmentcaucus/home.

The bills that passed? Mask Mandates and Zero Tolerance for Teens Driving with Alcohol.

“In this very polarized political environment we live in it was refreshing to hear our students agree and disagree with one another on controversial issues yet do it in a civil and respectful manner that impressed all the adults who observed the simulation” Fikis said.

“In our reflection after the mock full session students repeatedly said that one of the things they liked best about this simulation was the ability to hear what others think even if they disagreed with them. It really made them take a closer look at the issue.”

That is what teachers know is accomplished in the in-person legislative simulation but hoped it could still be accomplished online. And with a little technological magic it did.

“Civil discourse and respect for others is alive and well here at Wego” Chisholm said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy83NzQ5MC9udmlkaWEtZXhwYW5kcy1nZWZvcmNlLW5vdy1pbnRvLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1hbmQtb3RoZXItY291bnRyaWVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA expands GeForce NOW into Australia and other countries,"NVIDIA will be expanding GeForce NOW game streaming service into Australia Saudi Arabia and Turkey sometime 'later this year'.

NVIDIA has just announced that it will be powering gamers in Australia Saudi Arabia and Turkey with GeForce NOW ""later this year"".

In an announcement on the official NVIDIA blog the company explained that it has signed new telcos into the GeForce NOW Alliance with Turkcell Zain KSA and Pentanet these new companies join current GeForce NOW Alliance members in Softbank KDDI LG Uplus Taiwan Mobile and GFN.RU.

NVIDIA reminds us that GeForce NOW brings real-time ray tracing to some of the biggest games in the market to underpowered PCs Macs Chromebooks Android and iOS devices. The company adds: ""It also offers an opportunity for the world's leading telecommunications firms to deliver high-quality low-latency PC gaming to nearly any device from the cloud. These partners form the GeForce NOW Alliance a partnership of operators using RTX Servers and NVIDIA cloud-gaming software to expand and improve cloud gaming globally"".

NVIDIA explained: ""By placing NVIDIA RTX Servers on the edge GeForce NOW Alliance partners deliver even lower latency gaming experiences. And this gives partners an opportunity to show the value of their broadband and 5G infrastructure to customers"".

""The newest GeForce NOW Alliance members join a growing group of telecommunications experts that includes Softbank KDDI LG Uplus Taiwan Mobile and GFN.RU"".

Now I will note as someone who lives in Australia that Perth is on the western side of the country and many thousands of miles away from any other major cities.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Philadelphia police said a 29-year-old man was shot and killed while trying to protect his sister from her armed boyfriend.

It happened around 10:45 p.m. Friday on the 100 block of Allison Street in West Philadelphia.

Investigators said the suspect began assaulting his girlfriend who called her brother.

When the 29-year-old man arrived and confronted the boyfriend police said the suspect fired nine shots. The victim was struck three times in the stomach arm and back.

Police took the victim to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Police said the suspect drove off in a white Nissan.

Though he remains on the loose police said they know who he is and that he lives in Norristown Montgomery County.

Sahara's Polisario Front attacks Guerguerat border area,"-

Western Sahara's pro-independence Polisario Front bombarded the Guerguerat buffer zone under Moroccan control in the far south of the desert territory in an overnight attack Rabat described as part of a ""propaganda war"".

""The Saharawi army launched four rockets in the direction of... Guerguerat"" on the border between Morocco and Mauritania the Saharawi press agency SPS said in a statement Sunday citing a military leader of the separatist Saharawi forces.

Morocco launched a military operation on November 13 in the buffer zone of Guerguerat in the extreme south of the former Spanish colony to drive out a group of Saharawi militants who were blocking a transit route to neighbouring Mauritania.

The SPS statement also reported attacks along the security wall that separates Saharawi fighters from Moroccan forces in the vast desert expanse.

A senior Moroccan official contacted by AFP in Rabat said: ""There was harassing fire near the area of Guerguerat but it did not affect the trunk road traffic was not disrupted.""

""It's been part of a cycle of harassment for more than three months"" he said.

Western Sahara  AFP

""There is a desire to create a propaganda war a media war on the existence of a war in the Sahara"" but ""the situation is normal"" he said.

Western Sahara is a disputed and divided former Spanish colony mostly under Morocco's control where tensions with the Polisario Front have simmered since the 1970s.

In November Morocco sent troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone to reopen a key road leading to Mauritania.

The Polisario responded by declaring a 1991 ceasefire null and void arguing the road had not existed when the truce was signed.

The two sides are reported to have since exchanged regular fire along the demarcation line.

The UN-backed ceasefire deal was meant to lead to a referendum on self-determination.

Morocco has offered autonomy but maintains the territory is a sovereign part of the kingdom.

UN-led negotiations involving Morocco and the Polisario with Algeria and Mauritania as observers have been suspended since March 2019.

The Polisario Front which fought a war for independence from Morocco from 1975 to 1991 said it was still willing to join UN talks on the territory's future -- but would not lay down its arms.

""In the past we put all our trust in the international community and definitively ended our armed struggle"" senior Polisario security official Sidi Ould Oukal said on Tuesday.

""We have waited 30 years. Thirty years of broken promises prevarication and untenable waiting.""

Ould Oukal insisted the group was ""open to any mediation"".

""But at the same time we will keep up the armed struggle based on past experiences"" he said.

For its part Morocco's position was reinforced last year by US recognition of its sovereignty over the entire disputed territory breaking decades of precedent.

The move came under president Donald Trump in exchange for Rabat normalising relations with Israel."

For employees who suddenly faced indefinite telecommuting a short walk to the kitchen table replaced rivers of brake lights and speedometers stuck in the single digits. Those empty roads were one vivid reminder of the ways COVID-19 upended our lives. Of course in many others people with jobs they could do at home were lucky—thousands of essential workers like supermarket clerks Amazon delivery drivers nurses and doctors didn’t have that option and tens of thousands more in sectors like hospitality and entertainment have lost their jobs.

But as 2020 bitterly gave way to 2021 a question loomed for employers and office workers inured to endless rounds of Zoom calls: How long will all this last and what would come next?

The question has ramifications far beyond our commutes. Employers face questions with multimillion-dollar answers: How much office space do we build? How do we structure or restructure our workforce? Service-oriented businesses that depend on the daily flood of employees to uptown University City Ballantyne and other employment centers continue to live with potentially catastrophic drops in business—although as of this writing in early December only a few like La Belle Helene and Amelie’s uptown have closed permanently. A long-term mass shift to remote work could make Charlotte’s $12 billion transit and mobility plan a tougher sell.

For Charlotte—a city that’s grasped at “world-class” status for decades where boosters tout new skyscrapers and fete emissaries of prospective corporate relocators like royalty—the questions carry special significance. The city’s come a long way since The New York Times dubbed uptown a “somnolent streetscape of abandoned buildings and vacant lots” and “a Potemkin Village with a drawl” during the 1994 NCAA Men’s Basketball Championship. But last year brought back recollections of that embarrassing time with uptown empty of its 130000 daily workers and darkened office towers that loomed over vacant light rail trains. What’s the distinction between a world-class metropolis and a bedroom community if we all work from our spare bedrooms?

Clear answers don’t exist here or in any other American city and businesses will likely adopt a mix of telecommuting and in-office work that varies from company to company and industry to industry somewhere between the poles of “offices are extinct” and “back to business as usual.” Some employees love ditching their commutes and doing laundry between meetings. Others have to squeeze work projects and emails between caring for toddlers or all-day virtual school and supervision of children too young to type. Companies unaccustomed to employee autonomy wrestle with the need to supervise remote workforces. Can the boss trust that you’re not watching YouTube during the staff meeting behind the mask of your Zoom screen? Does in-person work and collaboration have distinct value and can remote work replicate or replace it?

To understand how large employers around Charlotte are thinking about those questions I interviewed executives at four companies in different industries. None envision a fully remote future—some like the Charlotte Hornets depend on packing arenas and others like Truist are building new offices and value in-person collaboration—but all expect lasting changes. Here’s what I learned.

TRUIST: Planting a flag uptown

When workers eventually return to their uptown offices they’ll see an unmistakable marker affixed to Charlotte’s newest bank on one of the city’s most striking buildings. In late November a helicopter flew the two-story-tall name and logo to the top of the Truist Center in the former Hearst Tower at 7th and Tryon streets which the company bought for $456 million. A product of the BB&T-SunTrust merger Truist employs 2000 in its new headquarters.

Before COVID individual teams might have had the flexibility to work off-site one day or so a week says Chief Human Resources Officer Kimberly Moore-Wright. But a “large percentage” of Truist employees worked in the office. The bank’s workforce except for a small contingent of employees who operate branches has worked remotely since March—a special challenge for a company in the midst of combining two competitors. “Just as we’re getting ready to go into the thick of that” Moore-Wright says “you overlay it with a pandemic no one could have expected.”

As the merged bank builds everything from business processes to physical offices Moore-Wright says executives don’t want to make dramatic changes like moving large numbers of employees to permanent telework based on conditions that may change soon.

“‘Normal’” Moore-Wright says “keeps changing as we get through this.” And Truist still needs to operate its branches physical locations with in-person customers who can’t do everything over Microsoft Teams or Slack.

But bank officials have found it easier to adopt new business practices—an unexpected benefit of throwing out the playbook. No one can protest “That’s the way we’ve always done it!” when everything has to be rewritten anyway. But as in many companies managers find workers increasingly fatigued by their homebound routines. “You’re in the guest bedroom. You may be working even longer just because you’re there at home” Moore-Wright says. “I think managers are becoming more attuned to that.”

Moore-Wright who speaks to me via video from her office is one of a small number of executives who work socially distant and with masks at headquarters. Heath Campbell president of the bank’s Metrolina region takes my call from a spare bedroom outfitted with a Truist banner that serves as a makeshift video background.

“Client-facing” bankers in his division have long had autonomy Campbell says. They might spend a day driving from Mooresville to SouthPark to Ballantyne to meet clients. Such meetings illustrate the double-edged sword remote work offers: Bankers can pack more meetings into a day without driving from one to the other. But do you really get the same connection with clients through a screen?

After the pandemic Campbell says Truist probably will allow some office workers more flexibility to work from home if their presence isn’t required. But the bank still will try to convince workers to choose the office. “If you’re going to explore more autonomy for our teammates to choose their work environment that means you’re giving them more decisions” he said. “What we’re trying to do is make sure with places like the Truist Center when it’s built out and designed … they’ll choose that place first.”

For now he misses the energy of in-person meetings sporting events restaurants and entertainment. “We’re not meant to be in isolation” Campbell says. “I’ve got a feeling once you’ve got the vaccine—I think we’ll get a resurgence.” Just how far off that resurgence is remains hard to predict. As of press time Truist had extended its telework policy from the end of January to at least March 1.

RED VENTURES: What happens to the beer taps?

The digital marketing and media company Red Ventures based just south of the state line in Indian Land S.C. built its image around a campus modeled after those of Silicon Valley tech firms. Employees enjoy beer taps a bowling alley and basketball court bistros a library and “The Arena” where the company hosts packed “RedTalks”—TED-style events with speakers from Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to University of Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari.

“We have prided ourselves on our culture. A cornerstone of that culture was the in-office collaboration” says Hallie Cornetta the company’s head of human capital. “Everything is now done via video chats” and Red Ventures is “erring on the highly conservative side” in assessing when to bring employees back.

So what does the future look like in a world where employees rifle through their own fridges for beer and snacks and crowded indoor gatherings are a wild fantasy? Cornetta says Red Ventures will use 2021 to explore a “hybrid working environment.” That might even mean employees who want to work elsewhere for weeks or months—an option previously unthinkable for a fast-expanding company that normally trains new workers via “osmosis” and in-person apprenticeships.

“The world’s changed and employees especially great talent want flexibility now more than ever” she says. “That means the ability to work from home or work from the beach for a month in the summer. Or work remotely entirely if that’s the way we can attract the best talent.”

Remote work has yielded both benefits and problems. Employees tend to burn out more quickly on Zoom where their own faces stare back from the screen all day. They have to schedule videoconferences to resolve questions once answered with a shout to the next desk. As employees move sometimes to other time zones they have to get up early or stay up late to make meetings.

Red Ventures has tried to manage burnout with selective long weekends and no-video or no-meeting days. They’ve modified internal newsletters and encouraged more communications from other managers the better to keep in touch with a workforce used to mass in-person gatherings with CEO Ric Elias.

Red Ventures could learn helpful lessons from teleworking. With the $500 million acquisition of CNET Media Group (whose brands include TVGuide and Gamespot) as well as travel guide company Lonely Planet less than half of Red Ventures’ employees now live in the Charlotte region. Still Cornetta doesn’t think an all-virtual future is in the cards for most workers.

“We know that some of our talent arguably the majority of our talent is still going to crave an in-office environment the majority of the time” she says. “Having the flexibility to work from home or other places will be there but we will absolutely continue to invest in our on-campus facilities and our amenities.”

Even for those who choose to work outside the office “remote work” might not be so remote: Red Ventures recently opened an apartment complex next to its campus called the Court at Redstone for employees who want to live next door to the office.

CHARLOTTE HORNETS: Getting back in the arena

Few businesses are more centered on in-person interactions than sports and entertainment which relies on packed arenas and stadiums and in-person league meetings player workouts and conference schmoozing.

The Charlotte Hornets organization which operates and plays in the 20000-seat Spectrum Center had its last 10 home games canceled; concerts from Michael Bublé to The Weeknd postponed; and the Republican National Convention relocated.

“We’ve basically been shut down from March 13 on” says Hornets President Fred Whitfield. The team’s 200-plus permanent employees have worked remotely since then. (The Hornets also employ more than 500 or so part-timers to work events and games.) Whitfield says he has a comfortable setup at home with his computer iPad and phone screens. Zoom has made it easier for him to attend departmental meetings he used to miss and serve on several pandemic-related task forces that meet virtually.

But he adds the personal aspects have been tough to replicate. “I really think there’s a value to be gained from in-person meetings and really being able to sit across the table from individuals whether it’s in New York at the NBA meeting or at the sales and marketing meeting down in Miami” he said. “In meetings now with our NBA counterparts and colleagues you don’t have that in-between break time that you can interact network share ideas and best practices what’s working what’s not. I miss those kinds of things and I think we all do.”

Although Whitfield said he and employees have adapted—they interviewed some potential players via Zoom for example then set up in the arena’s VIP area with masks and social distancing for the draft—the ultimate goal is to get back to the office. With a business that requires in-person attendance permanent remote work isn’t an option. He says it’s important for part-timers who work events from ushers to ticket-takers to feel comfortable when the arena reopens. If they don’t it will be harder to convince fans to come back.

As of mid-December the NBA planned to begin its 2020-21 season December 22 with 10 fewer games than usual and daily testing of players and staff. Teams will vary in the number of fans they allow for games; the Hornets began with none but hoped to welcome fans back later in the season. The team has invested in enhanced air filtration touchless tickets and cashless concessions; committed to more cleaning and disinfection; and obtained two third-party health and safety accreditations all with the goal of convincing fans and workers that the team and Spectrum Center can safely host mass gatherings again.

“We’ve got to make sure” Whitfield said “we’re completely buttoned up on every protocol we know how to operate.”

LOWE’S: Home improvement store in the home office era

Lowe’s named Janice Dupré Little executive vice president of human resources weeks before it sent its corporate workforce home in mid-March. “Like everyone else” Dupré Little says “we thought it would be for a couple of weeks.” The company had to figure out how to work remotely with more than 6500 corporate employees who were used to doing things in the office “face-to-face brick and mortar” at its massive Mooresville campus and uptown offices. And Lowe’s had to keep its 2200 stores open with an hourly-wage workforce that can’t do its jobs through video calls from home.

Demand for home-improvement products surged. Lowe’s scrambled to buy huge amounts of personal protective equipment install Plexiglas shields at registers and comply with shifting regulations as people stuck at home decided they couldn’t stare at their chipped paint or outdated kitchens anymore. Office workers abruptly left supervising children all day faced another set of challenges. With employees at work and home all the time Dupré Little says they confronted new levels of burnout.

“People were invigorated in the beginning” she said. “Now we’re all facing this fatigue. We don’t know how to separate and go eat lunch go have dinner. We have to continue to remind our associates: Take your vacation. Take that downtime.”

Lowe’s is building a new tech hub with 2000 workers in a 23-story tower in South End scheduled for completion in late 2021. The project was announced in mid-2019 before people questioned whether anyone especially tech workers who need only a computer would be in the office again. “No one has a crystal ball to know everything but at this point we’ve stayed on track” Dupré Little says. “We are still hiring. We are still very focused on the commitment that we made.”

As of early December Lowe’s was planning to continue remote work at least through July 2021. Dupré Little says she expects the company to retain some measure of flexibility with a greater recognition of the “human components” of workers’ lives: “You see dogs and kids flying by in the midst of a call and you’re more tolerant of that.”

To compensate in-store workers Lowe’s has distributed six rounds of bonuses—$300 each for full-time employees $150 for part-time—since March. The company also gave hourly workers a temporary $2-an-hour raise. Lowe’s has hired more than 155000 people in part due to the surging demand from stir-crazy customers. Lowe’s also held its annual women’s leadership summit and its vendor forum virtually this year a first for the company. Dupré Little says changes like those could persist after the pandemic.

“When you do things in person you’re limited by space capacity and resources” she says. “Once you have a virtual environment it gives you a reach you wouldn’t have before.”

But the new workplace template whatever it turns out to be is still a long way off. “I don’t feel like we’re going to come out of this pandemic just because a vaccine comes out” Dupré Little says. “It’s going to take time. We could be in this thing for a lot longer.”

A Charlotte-based dog bar and social club concept that took off in the COVID-19 pandemic is planning to plant roots for its second location this summer in Dallas.

Skiptown a membership-model dog care service provider and bar for owners is expanding into North Texas from its flagship in North Carolina where it’s collected more than 2000 members since first opening last summer said founder and CEO Meggie Williams.

Williams said Dallas is a priority because there’s a strong demand for a concept like Skiptown. She added that in Skiptown’s analysis Dallas was shown to have many millennials and young professionals who want to invest in convenience and in opportunities that provide a high quality of return on experiences — and specifically she said their pets. She expects at least 1600 individuals to sign up for membership initially.

“In our minds it was just a very natural choice for us when we are thinking about expansion even though it's not geographically as close” Williams said. “We're going headfirst into coming to Dallas next.”

She said she can’t disclose specific location details yet but said Skiptown was primarily looking into areas in Deep Ellum Bishop Arts Trinity Groves and Lower Greenville and the facility should be about 20000 square feet similar to the flagship location in Charlotte.

But not everyone meditates the traditional way.

""I used to [meditate]"" Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson tells CNBC Make It.

But Johnson realized that finding alone time was just as valuable.

""In essence it's meditating but it's just really quiet time and just having a moment where I really just shut off my brain"" he says.

Finding quiet time isn't so easy for Johnson who is a father of three and the highest-paid actor in Hollywood and who runs several companies including tequila brand Teremana and energy drink ZOA which he launched during the pandemic.

But Johnson says he takes advantage of the ""that sweet window of about 11 p.m. to about 1 a.m. in my world in my household where everything is so quiet. Babies are asleep. Everyone's asleep"" Johnson says.

He also finds his early morning workouts meditative. (Johnson who wakes up at 4 a.m. to start his routine told Variety in 2017 that his sleep patterns ""are always funky and off"" and typically only needs three to five hours of sleep.)

""My gym time — and this sounds crazy because the music is so loud it's sweaty it's intense — but I am alone and it becomes a meditative process for me"" Johnson says.

Johnson isn't alone in valuing quiet time. Tennis star Serena Williams utilizes it too she told CNBC Make It in February.

""Something I do every day is [to] completely turn my brain off which sounds weird but because I work so much.... But it's a lot so I just need to turn my brain off and not think about anything"" Williams said.

""Sometimes it's meditation. Sometimes it's watching a program [on TV] that has nothing to do with anything like something that is silly or fun"" Williams said.

Former Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality spokesperson Roland Williams has been jailed for four years after he failed to abide by a court order to pay back money to his insurance company that he had defrauded.

Williams submitted a false claim to Santam Insurance stating that his vehicle was involved in an accident in Port Elizabeth on 19 August 2014.

At the time of the offence Williams 50 was reportedly going through financial woes Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said.

After his black BMW had experienced mechanical issues Williams submitted a claim to his insurance purporting to have been involved in an accident in Motherwell.

""The insurance company consequently suffered a loss to the tune of R96 000 as a result of Williams' criminal ways"" Ramovha said.

The insurance company was alerted to the fraud two years later.

A probe by the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team ensued resulting in Williams' arrest on 6 July 2017. He was convicted on 9 March 2018.

National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Anelisa Ngcakani said Williams was sentenced to 36 months of correctional supervision a suspended four-year sentence a fine of R30 000 and was instructed to repay Santam the R96 000.

""He was to pay through monthly instalments of R3 500 from 3 May 2018 to 31 May 2020"" she said.

Santam submitted an affidavit to the State indicating that William had defaulted. He last made payment in October 2019.

""He was then rearrested in November 2020 by the Hawks at his home in Port Elizabeth. Williams then paid the outstanding R40 000 a few days after his arrest"" Ngcakani said.



Williams' attorney immediately submitted an application for leave to appeal that was opposed by senior state prosecutor advocate Lise Keech.

Magistrate Lionel Lindoor of the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court dismissed Williams' application. He said no other court would come to a different conclusion Ngcakani said.

The court activated his suspended sentence with immediate effect on Friday.

Posted on: January 23 2021 12:02h.

Last updated on: January 22 2021 06:41h.

Steve Wynn has listed his sprawling Beverly Hills estate for $110 million. It’s the second mansion the billionaire has now on the market.

Wynn purchased the home located in the 1200 block of Benedict Canyon Drive in 2015 for $47.85 million. The seller at the time was Guess jeans cofounder Maurice Marciano.

The nearly $48 million pad wasn’t up to the casino billionaire’s lavish tastes. He invested millions more overhauling the property. Wynn Resorts interior designer Robert Thomas was brought in to give the inside a fresh look.

Accessed by a private gate on a cul-de-sac the estate is situated on 2.7-acres. It includes more than 27000 square feet of living space with 11 bedrooms and 16 baths.

The home has a swimming pool move theater tennis court separate guesthouse and sweeping views of downtown Los Angeles.

If the former casino magnate gets his $110 million asking price the Los Angeles Times says it will rank among the priciest home sales in California history. The state’s all-time highest price paid for a home came last year when Amazon’s Jeff Bezos dropped $165 million on the iconic Warner estate.

The most expensive home in Beverly Hills currently on the market is listed at $160 million.

Wynn Unloading Assets

Steve Wynn is the founder and former chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts. He departed the company in early 2018 after The Wall Street Journal published accounts of alleged sexual misconduct committed by the casino tycoon.

Wynn has maintained he never acted inappropriately with his female employees.

Wynn continues to sever ties with Southern Nevada. In June of 2020 Wynn listed his mansion on “Billionaire’s Row” in Summerlin for $25 million. The home is located in the prestigious TPC Summerlin private golf community.

Wynn hasn’t had any takers for the six-bed 10-bath residence situated on 1.5 acres. On December 29 the listing price for the mansion dropped from $25 million to $19.5 million.

Along with his mansions in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas Wynn owns a retreat in Sun Valley Idaho a townhouse in New York City and as of last week two mansions in Florida.

Establishing Florida Roots

Since departing the gaming industry Wynn has predominantly spent his time either aboard his $215 million superyacht or at his beachfront palace in Palm Beach Florida.

Wynn purchased the Lantana Florida mansion in 2019 for $43 million. The property is just a short drive from Mar-a-Lago the new home of former President Donald Trump.

Wynn 78 years old will celebrate his 79th birthday next week on January 27. He’s apparently enjoying his retirement days in Florida.

Last month Wynn paid $18.4 million for another Florida property this one even closer to Mar-a-Lago. The newly constructed mansion is located on Via Vizcaya less than 3000 feet from Trump’s spot.

Florida has seen tens of thousands of people move into the state recently. And several billionaires are now calling the Sunshine State home.

Along with Trump and Wynn a few notables include PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel NFL superstar Tom Brady and his supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen fashion tycoon Tommy Hilfiger corporate raider and former casino owner Carl Icahn. Trump’s children Don Jr. and girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle and Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner are also relocating to Florida.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Packer in no hurry to leave Caribbean,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/james-packer-and-girlfriend-kyle-lim-in-no-hurry-to-leave-the-caribbean/news-story/0c6e10aefd32c7470394464298c651bc on URL https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The global economy has been slowly shifting toward cleaner fuel sources over the years. This transition will likely take several more decades to complete. However what has become clear is that the world is moving toward a renewable energy-powered future.

Many companies are taking early steps to participate in the energy transition. Three energy companies positioning themselves to win are Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B) Xcel Energy (XEL 1.21%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 0.98%). Here's why investors won't want to miss this trio.

The royal treatment

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Royal Dutch Shell): Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend in 2020 in the face of low energy prices. That's not good. But it would be a mistake to count this nearly 200-year-old energy giant out given its long history of adjusting its business along with the world around it.

Today that means pulling back in the carbon-heavy oil space investing more heavily in transition businesses (like liquified natural gas which is often paired with renewable power to ensure energy reliability) and increasingly focusing on the future of energy (such as renewable power which the company calls a ""growth"" business). The dividend cut while unfortunate helps free up cash to fund the transition of its business with Shell planning to invest as much as $20 billion a year to meet the world's changing energy needs. The key however is that going forward only 35% to 40% of the capital spending budget is earmarked for oil. The rest is split between its transition and growth businesses. This is a fairly aggressive plan that will work out particularly well if the world makes a decided shift toward renewable power.

To be fair conservative dividend investors might prefer a more middle-of-the-road approach like the one Total is taking. But if you believe that the renewable power transition will happen quickly Shell appears to be in a better position to transition to the clean energy future while milking its cash cow oil business for as long as it can manage.

Investing in the future of energy

Matt DiLallo (Xcel Energy): Utility Xcel Energy has a bold goal. It aims to deliver 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. Fueling that plan is a steady transition to cleaner power sources. The company intends to retire all its coal power plans by 2030 and replace that capacity with cleaner natural gas and renewable energy. Meanwhile it's investing in emerging technologies like green hydrogen to achieve its ambitious multi-decade plan to produce emission-free energy.

In the near term Xcel Energy expects to invest as much as $24 billion through 2025 on expansion projects such as new renewable energy capacity. That's a $1.4 billion increase from its initial plan powered by incremental investments in new solar energy developments and wind repowering projects. In addition to that visible near-term growth the company sees significant future expansion opportunities in solar due to steadily falling costs and intriguing potential for using nuclear energy to produce emissions-free hydrogen that could eventually become a replacement for natural gas.

The company anticipates its investments over the next four years will power earnings-per-share growth of about 5% to 7% annually. That should give it the fuel to increase its 2.7%-yielding dividend by around that same yearly rate. Xcel's steadily rising earnings and dividends should produce attractive total returns for investors especially considering the company's low-risk profile. That combination of low risk and attractive reward potential makes Xcel a great way for investors to earn some green as the world goes green.

A win-win stock for all investors

Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): If you're looking to invest in renewables look no further than NextEra Energy. It is after all the world's largest producer of energy from solar and wind. But here's the real deal: The company which also owns the largest regulated utility in the U.S. Florida Power & Light Company is going all out to ensure it remains right at the top in coming years and that's precisely why investors could mint a lot of money from this stock.

NextEra had a solid year in 2020 beating COVID-19 pandemic blues and delivering where it matters. As the company's earnings grew so did its projections through 2023. NextEra foresees its adjusted earnings per share growing 6% to 8% in 2022 and 2023 off its projected 2021 base backed by an ever-growing renewables portfolio.

Through the first nine months of 2020 NextEra added nearly 4800 megawatts to its renewables backlog. With that its total backlog crossed 15000 megawatts by the third quarter surpassing the company's entire existing renewables capacity. Put another way NextEra's capacity to produce energy from wind and solar is set to grow exponentially in the near future. With the company also dabbling in battery storage and high-potential green hydrogen opportunities are numerous.

So you have an established utility here that's taking the renewable world by storm making NextEra Energy a no-brainer stock to play the renewable energy boom. In fact growth and income investors alike should be richly rewarded as NextEra is also an excellent dividend-paying company. Although the stock's yield of 1.7% is on the lower side in the utilities sector management is targeting 10% annual dividend growth through ""at least"" 2022. With NextEra's full-year 2020 earnings just around the corner and its next dividend hike expected in coming weeks you won't want to miss this train.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjEvMDEvMjQvd2Fsei1jYWxscy1mb3ItMTAwLXBlcmNlbnQtY2FyYm9uZnJlZS1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS1ieS0yMDQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walz calls for 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040,"Governor Tim Walz is pushing a goal for Minnesota to produce 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040 a decade earlier than he previously proposed.

The proposal is one of several policies the governor outlined last week to try to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases linked to climate change.

A report recently released by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency said the state is not on track to meet its goals to cut overall greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels. Minnesota’s overall greenhouse gas emissions have declined just 8 percent since 2005.

The state’s electric utilities have made the most progress by reducing the use of fossil fuels such as coal-fired power plants in favor of cleaner energy sources such as wind and solar.

Other sectors including transportation and agriculture have been less successful in cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Walz and some DFL lawmakers want to speed up the electricity sector’s progress by setting a deadline for electric utilities to use zero-emission energy resources by 2040.

Two years ago Walz outlined a plan to make Minnesota’s electricity carbon-free by 2050 but it ran into opposition from Republican lawmakers.

A House bill authored by Rep. Jamie Long DFL-Minneapolis had its first committee hearing last Thursday. The bill would set benchmarks for the proportion of a utility’s retail electric sales that must be generated from renewable energy over the next two decades reaching 100 percent carbon-free in 2040.

Among those voicing support was Michael Noble director of the nonprofit Fresh Energy who said the price of clean energy including wind solar and battery storage has fallen dramatically.

""Because new carbon-free electricity technologies are lower cost than the legacy fossil fuel technologies that they're replacing we can do this in a way that saves money rather than increase consumer costs” Noble said.

The state's largest utility Xcel Energy pledged in 2018 to be carbon-free by 2050 in part by closing its coal-fired power plant in Becker Minn. by 2030.

Minnesota Power followed suit earlier this year announcing it would add wind and solar energy and stop burning coal at its last remaining coal-fired power plant in Cohasset Minn. by 2035.

Jessica Tritsch with the Sierra Club’s North Star Chapter called those efforts “positive steps” but not enough.

“That timeline is not what scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis” she said.

Utility representatives said they support the state's clean energy goals but also have a responsibility to meet customer expectations for reliability and cost.

Environmental groups have praised utilities for replacing aging coal-fired power plants with wind and solar. But they’ve also been critical of their use of natural gas-fueled plants which produce less emissions than coal but are not carbon free.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS93aWxkLXJvb2tpZS1raXJpbGwta2Fwcml6b3YtcHJhY3RpY2VzLWFzLWhhcmQtYXMtaGUtcGxheXMvNjAwMDE0NzAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild rookie Kirill Kaprizov practices as hard as he plays,"Kirill Kaprizov and Jordan Greenway were still on the ice Saturday inside Xcel Energy Center long after the rest of their Wild teammates had left practice but Kaprizov wasn't giving Greenway a tutorial on the between-the-legs shot he attempted Friday against San Jose.

""We talked about it for sure"" Greenway said. ""[But] I'll stay in my lane.""

Even though it was unsuccessful — getting blocked by Sharks goalie Devan Dubnyk — the play rang up as a highlight in Kaprizov's young NHL career a nod to his talent and his smarts.

""The skill set of these players is phenomenal and to do it at the pace that they do it in the environment they do it in the greatest league in the world is pretty exciting"" coach Dean Evason said. ""That was fun to watch.""

The day after he tried the move Kaprizov was the last one to exit the ice at practice. He not only was still stickhandling after Greenway left but he was even passing pucks off the boards as the Zamboni was getting queued up to clean the ice.

And that's another impression Kaprizov is making how much passion he has for hockey.

""He loves the game"" Marcus Foligno said. ""You can just tell. He's always trying to work on things. He loves shooting pucks. He's addicted to the game and it's great to see. He loves being out there.

""… It's refreshing to have guys like that in the locker room bring that confidence about them and love for the game the passion into the room. He's a fun kid out there. He's just enjoying it.""

Kahkonen starts Talbot a scratch

Goalie Cam Talbot did not start or suit up Sunday after leaving Friday's game because of a lower-body injury. He is considered day-to-day.

Talbot was hurt late in the first period getting checked out by the team following a sequence on a San Jose power play. Although he played the rest of the period Talbot didn't finish the game. Backup Kaapo Kahkonen came in stopping all 17 shots he faced to help the Wild to a 4-1 victory and he returned to the crease Sunday.

Andrew Hammond who had been on the Wild's taxi squad since the season started was recalled to the active roster. Goalie Hunter Jones took Hammond's place on the taxi squad getting added from Iowa in American Hockey League.

Winger Nico Sturm who missed Friday's game due to illness was also out Sunday and is day-to-day. His absence is not COVID-related.

Hunt's versatility pays off

When Evason learned that Sturm would be unavailable for Friday's game the Wild tabbed Brad Hunt to take Sturm's spot on the fourth line even though Hunt is a defenseman. The team kept Hunt in the lineup Sunday — a decision that showcases Hunt's versatility.

""He deserved to be in there the way that he's practiced [and] worked"" Evason said. ""That's how you get in.""

The team actually planned on giving Hunt shifts on defense and subbing someone else in that fourth-line hole but Evason thought Hunt did so well with the limited minutes he received that Evason kept Hunt with the line.

Hunt said he feels that ability to rove between forward and defense is what has kept him in the NHL. ""I just want to be a guy that they can throw in and feel comfortable with whatever they need"" he said.

Before Friday Hunt was a healthy scratch for the Wild. While he was idle the team added new defenseman Ian Cole via trade. But Hunt said that's part of the game and he understands his role.

""Somebody has to be in this position"" he said. ""It's not that it's always the funnest to be in this position. But at the end of the day you got to be here for your teammates and be positive.""

Fiala is good to go

Kevin Fiala left the first period Friday after taking a hip check from Logan Couture but the winger returned for the second and went on to score his first goal of the season into an empty net.

""It was scary"" Fiala said of the play. ""I saw him coming but I thought I made a move and had him. But he got my left leg so I fell down. It was pretty painful but … I'm fine now.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjMvYS1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLXNjZW5lcy1sb29rLWF0LXRoZS1lbXB0eS13aWxkLWhvbWUtb3BlbmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A behind-the-scenes look at the empty Wild home opener,"To place an obituary please include the information from the obituary checklist below in an email to obits@pioneerpress.com.

After a rather boring game by his already high standards Kaprizov nearly pulled off the best goal the franchise has ever seen. No hyperbole.

He corralled a puck in the neutral zone with a little less than 10 minutes and raced the other way with Sharks winger Marcus Sorensen trying to chase him down.

In the blink of an eye Kaprizov put his stick in his right hand and without breaking stride used his left arm to fend off Sorensen. He then dragged the puck between his legs and fired a shot on goaltender Devan Dubnyk.

It narrowly missed finding the back of the net and Dubnyk was thanking his lucky stars postgame.

“I can’t believe he made that move” Dubnyk said. “It’s a nightmare when somebody makes a move that’s that slick and puts it in the back of the net and then I’ve got 365 days to watch it over and over again on the highlights. Just an impressive move and I really fortunate I was able to stop that. You just don’t want to be on the receiving end of those.”

Asked about the move on Friday night winger Zach Parise lamented the fact that he couldn’t put in the rebound. He was right on the doorstep as the puck sailed wide of the crease.

“That was a nice play by him” Parise said in what might be the understatement of the century. “I felt like I should’ve had the rebound out of the air. That should’ve been easy for me.”

If Kirill Kaprizov pulled this off.. pic.twitter.com/IN4dUKbcVr — Dimitri Filipovic (@DimFilipovic) January 23 2021

In the end Kaprizov’s miraculous move resulted in nothing more than a few GIFs on social media.

Asked about the move after practice on Saturday afternoon winger Marcus Foligno joked that it wasn’t anything special because it didn’t go in. He immediately cracked a smile and admitted the truth.

“Nah it was good” Foligno said. “That’s Kirill. He’s going to do some flashy stuff. It’s impressive. He’s fending a guy off his back which sometimes guys get slowed down and tangled up and he’s got the idea and the creativity to go between his legs and try a different angle on their goal. If that would’ve went in it would’ve been a highlight-reel goal for sure.”

Maybe the fact it didn’t find the back of the net explains why Kaprizov was on the ice more than 20 minutes after practice wrapped up on Saturday afternoon.

“Either that or he has nothing to do for the rest of the day” Foligno said. “He loves the game. You can just tell. He’s always trying to work on things. He loves shooting pucks. He’s addicted to the game and it’s great to see. He loves being out there.”

Briefly

After suffering an apparent lower-body injury on Friday night goaltender Cam Talbot missed practice on Saturday afternoon. There was no immediate update on his status moving forward. In addition winger Nico Sturm and defenseman Jonas Brodin were absent from practice. According to coach Dean Evason it was simply a maintenance day for Brodin and he won’t miss any time."

The animals have grown sick and died in large numbers from the virus which they have also passed back to people in mutated form.

Zoetis a large veterinary pharmaceutical company in New Jersey with more than $6 billion in annual revenue in 2019 and Medgene Labs a small company with about 35 employees that is based in South Dakota are both testing vaccines in mink. They are seeking licensing of their products from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Both companies said their vaccine technologies are generally similar to the one used by Novavax for a human vaccine which is in late-stage trials. That system involves making insect cells produce the spike protein on the coronavirus which is then attached to a harmless virus that enters into the body’s cells and trains the immune system to be ready for the real thing.

Activist: Sachem Head Capital

Percentage Ownership: 5.9% Average Cost: $28.33 Activist Commentary: Sachem Head was founded in 2013 by Scott Ferguson the first investment professional hired at Pershing Square where he worked for nine years. While Sachem Head has a history of solid value investing their activism in their early years was short term and underwhelming at best. In their first campaign at Helen of Troy they advocated for a sale of the company and share buybacks in a February 2014 letter and sold their entire position into the buyback a month later something experienced activists never do. Their first 13D filing was on CDK Corp. only a month after the company went public through a spinoff – hardly giving management time to do anything. Since then they have grown through campaigns at companies like Zoetis and Autodesk partnering with more experienced investors like Pershing Square and Eminence. And recently Ferguson has created value as a director of Olin his first public company board seat in a portfolio company he did not invest in as part of a group. This investment in Elanco is his second of what we expect to be many in the future. Taking board seats signifies both commitment and contribution; and since their launch in 2013 Sachem Head has evolved from a value investor that used activism as a short-term stunt to a value investor that genuinely engages with companies to create value for shareholders.

On December 13 2020 Sachem Head and the company entered into a cooperation agreement pursuant to which the company appointed the following three individuals to the board as directors (i) William Doyle executive chairman of Novocure Ltd. a publicly traded global oncology company commercializing a novel platform technology to treat solid tumors and former director of Zoetis (ii) Scott Ferguson the founder and managing partner of Sachem Head Capital Management and (iii) Paul Herendeen EVP and CFO of Bausch Health and former EVP and CFO of Zoetis Inc. Sachem Head agreed to abide by customary voting and standstill provisions until the later of (x) five days after the date on which neither Ferguson nor any officer director consultant partner or employee of Sachem Head continues to serve on the Board and (y) forty-five days before the closing of the non-proxy access shareholder director nomination window for the 2023 annual meeting.

Behind the Scenes:

Sachem Head took this position at a time when the company has been criticized for several missteps including a poorly timed acquisition of Bayer AG's animal-health assets for $6.9 billion that did not close until after the onset of the COVID pandemic. The company has also exhibited supply chain issues and low operating margins. Their EBITDA margin of about 18% is well below the 44% margin at Zoetis. Elanco has already announced a restructuring plan to create $100 million in annual savings and improve its margins but there is clearly a lot more that can be done. Prior to the pandemic Elanco had been targeting a 31% EBITDA margin in 2022.
